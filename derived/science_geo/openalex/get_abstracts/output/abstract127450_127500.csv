https://openalex.org/W2113505777,"TRAIL (also called Apo2L) belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family, activates rapid apoptosis in tumor cells, and binds to the death-signaling receptor DR4. Two additional TRAIL receptors were identified. The receptor designated death receptor 5 (DR5) contained a cytoplasmic death domain and induced apoptosis much like DR4. The receptor designated decoy receptor 1 (DcR1) displayed properties of a glycophospholipid-anchored cell surface protein. DcR1 acted as a decoy receptor that inhibited TRAIL signaling. Thus, a cell surface mechanism exists for the regulation of cellular responsiveness to pro-apoptotic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2171884143,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the widespread development of distinctive tumors termed hamartomas. TSC-determining loci have been mapped to chromosomes 9q34 ( TSC1 ) and 16p13 ( TSC2 ). The TSC1 gene was identified from a 900-kilobase region containing at least 30 genes. The 8.6-kilobase TSC1 transcript is widely expressed and encodes a protein of 130 kilodaltons (hamartin) that has homology to a putative yeast protein of unknown function. Thirty-two distinct mutations were identified in TSC1 , 30 of which were truncating, and a single mutation (2105delAAAG) was seen in six apparently unrelated patients. In one of these six, a somatic mutation in the wild-type allele was found in a TSC-associated renal carcinoma, which suggests that hamartin acts as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2089476060,"TRAIL, also called Apo2L, is a cytotoxic protein that induces apoptosis of many transformed cell lines but not of normal tissues, even though its death domain–containing receptor, DR4, is expressed on both cell types. An antagonist decoy receptor (designated as TRID for TRAIL receptor without an intracellular domain) that may explain the resistant phenotype of normal tissues was identified. TRID is a distinct gene product with an extracellular TRAIL-binding domain and a transmembrane domain but no intracellular signaling domain. TRID transcripts were detected in many normal human tissues but not in most cancer cell lines examined. Ectopic expression of TRID protected mammalian cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which is consistent with a protective role. Another death domain–containing receptor for TRAIL (designated as death receptor–5), which preferentially engaged a FLICE (caspase-8)–related death protease, was also identified."
https://openalex.org/W1987938015,"Computational studies suggest that acquisition of a motor skill involves learning an internal model of the dynamics of the task, which enables the brain to predict and compensate for mechanical behavior. During the hours that follow completion of practice, representation of the internal model gradually changes, becoming less fragile with respect to behavioral interference. Here, functional imaging of the brain demonstrates that within 6 hours after completion of practice, while performance remains unchanged, the brain engages new regions to perform the task; there is a shift from prefrontal regions of the cortex to the premotor, posterior parietal, and cerebellar cortex structures. This shift is specific to recall of an established motor skill and suggests that with the passage of time, there is a change in the neural representation of the internal model and that this change may underlie its increased functional stability."
https://openalex.org/W1992934869,"Most somatic cells die after a finite number of cell divisions, a phenomenon described as senescence. The p21 CIP1/WAF1 gene encodes an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Inactivation of p21 by two sequential rounds of targeted homologous recombination was sufficient to bypass senescence in normal diploid human fibroblasts. At the checkpoint between the prereplicative phase of growth and the phase of chromosome replication, cells lacking p21 failed to arrest the cell cycle in response to DNA damage, but their apoptotic response and genomic stability were unaltered. These results establish the feasibility of using gene targeting for genetic studies of normal human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1532833901,"Mutation of the XRCC4 gene in mammalian cells1,2 prevents the formation of the signal and coding joints in the V(D)J recombination reaction3, which is necessary for production of a functional immunoglobulin gene, and renders the cells highly sensitive to ionizing radiation4. However, XRCC4 shares no sequence homology with other proteins, nor does it have a biochemical activity to indicate what its function might be2. Here we show that DNA ligase IV (ref. 5) co-immunoprecipitates with XRCC4 and that these two proteins specifically interact with one another in a yeast two-hybrid system. Ligation of DNA double-strand breaks in a cell-free system by DNA ligase IV is increased fivefold by purified XRCC4 and seven- to eightfold when XRCC4 is co-expressed with DNA ligase IV. We conclude that the biological consequences of mutating XRCC4 are primarily due to the loss of its stimulatory effect on DNA ligase IV: the function of the XRCC4–DNA ligase IV complex may be to carry out the final steps of V(D)J recombination and joining of DNA ends."
https://openalex.org/W1988283120,"Female chimpanzees often forage alone and do not display obvious linear dominance hierarchies; consequently, it has been suggested that dominance is not of great importance to them. However, with the use of data from a 35-year field study of chimpanzees, high-ranking females were shown to have significantly higher infant survival, faster maturing daughters, and more rapid production of young. Given the foraging behavior of chimpanzees, high rank probably influences reproductive success by helping females establish and maintain access to good foraging areas rather than by sparing them stress from aggression."
https://openalex.org/W1590230114,"Neurons maintain a limited pool of synaptic vesicles which are docked at active zones and are awaiting exocytosis1,2,3,4. By contrast, endocrine cells releasing large, dense-core secretory granules have no active zones, and there is disagreement about the size5 and even the existence6 of the docked pool. It is not known how, and how rapidly, secretory vesicles are replaced at exocytic sites in either neurons or endocrine cells. By using electron microscopy, we have now been able to identify a pool of docked granules in chromaffin cells that is selectively depleted when cells secrete. With evanescent-wave fluorescence microscopy7, we observed single granules undergoing exocytosis and leaving behind patches of bare plasmalemma. Fresh granules travelled to the plasmalemma at a top speed of 114 nm s−1, taking an average of 6 min to arrive. On arrival, their motility diminished 4-fold, probably as a result of docking. Some granules detached and returned to the cytosol. We conclude that a large pool of docked granules turns over slowly, that granules move actively to their docking sites, that docking is reversible, and that the ‘rapidly releasable pool’ measured electrophysiologically represents a small subset of docked granules."
https://openalex.org/W1627029737,"The discovery of homologues from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of the human Ku DNA-end-binding proteins (HDF1 and KU80) has established that this organism is capable of non-homologous double-strand end joining (NHEJ), a form of DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) active in mammalian V(D)J recombination. Identification of the DNA ligase that mediates NHEJ in yeast will help elucidate the function of the four mammalian DNA ligases in DSBR, V(D)J recombination and other reactions. Here we show that S. cerevisiae has two typical DNA ligases, the known DNA ligase I homologue CDC9 and the previously unknown DNA ligase IV homologue DNL4. dnl4 mutants are deficient in precise and end-processed NHEJ. DNL4 and HDF1 are epistatic in this regard, with the mutation of each having equivalent effects. dnl4 mutants are complemented by overexpression of Dnl4 but not of Cdc9, and deficiency of Dnl4 alone does not impair either cell growth or the Cdc9-mediated responses to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation. Thus, S. cerevisiae has two distinct and separate ligation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2007498342,"In addition to the RNA polymerases (RNAPs) transcribing the nuclear genes, eukaryotic cells also require RNAPs to transcribe the genes of the mitochondrial genome and, in plants, of the chloroplast genome. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana was found to contain two nuclear genes similar to genes encoding the mitochondrial RNAP from yeast and RNAPs of bacteriophages T7, T3, and SP6. The putative transit peptides of the two polymerases were capable of targeting fusion proteins to mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively, in vitro. The results indicate that the mitochondrial RNAP in plants is a bacteriophage-type enzyme. A gene duplication event may have generated the second RNAP, which along with the plastid-encoded eubacteria-like RNAP could transcribe the chloroplast genome."
https://openalex.org/W2026721213,"Repeated administration of morphine sensitizes animals to the stimulant and rewarding properties of the drug. It also selectively increases expression of GluR1 (an AMPA glutamate receptor subunit) in the ventral tegmental area, a midbrain region implicated in morphine action. By viral-mediated gene transfer, a causal relation is shown between these behavioral and biochemical adaptations: Morphine's stimulant and rewarding properties are intensified after microinjections of a viral vector expressing GluR1 into the ventral tegmental area. These results confirm the importance of AMPA receptors in morphine action and demonstrate specific locomotor and motivational adaptations resulting from altered expression of a single localized gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1498454099,"Antagonists of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-type glutamate receptors disrupt several forms of learning. Although this might indicate that NMDA-receptor-mediated processes are critical for synaptic plasticity, there may be other mechanisms by which NMDA-receptor antagonism could interfere with learning. For instance, fear conditioning would be blocked by microinfusion of the NMDA-receptor antagonist AP5 (D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate) into the basolateral amygdala if AP5 inhibited routine synaptic transmission, thereby reducing the ability of stimuli to activate amygdala neurons. In second-order fear conditioning, the reinforcer is a fear-eliciting conditioned stimulus rather than an unconditioned stimulus. Expression of conditioned fear is amygdala-dependent and so provides a behavioural assessment of the ability of the reinforcer to activate amygdala neurons in the presence of AP5. We report here that intra-amygdala AP5 actually enhances expression of conditioned fear to the conditioned stimulus that provides the reinforcement signal for second-order conditioning. Nevertheless, acquisition of second-order fear conditioning is completely blocked. Our findings strongly support the view that NMDA receptors are critically involved in synaptic plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W1981226387,"DAP-kinase is a novel calmodulin dependent serine/threonine kinase that carries ankyrin repeats and the death domain. It was recently isolated, by a functional selection approach of gene cloning, as a positive mediator of programmed cell death. In this study the expression of DAP-kinase was examined in the cell lines derived from various human neoplasms. DAP-kinase mRNA and protein expression were below the limit of detection in eight out of ten neoplastic derived B-cell lines. In six out of 14 examined bladder carcinoma, in three out of five renal cell carcinoma, and in four out of ten tested breast carcinoma cell lines, the DAP-kinase protein levels were below detection limits or lower than 1% compared to the positive cell lines. Interestingly, DAP-kinase expression could be restored in some of the negative bladder carcinoma and B-cell lines by treatment of cells with 5′-azadeoxycytidine that causes DNA demethylation. The high frequency of loss of DAP-kinase expression in human tumor cell lines, and the occasional involvement of methylation in this process raise the possibility that this novel mediator of cell death may function as a tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2020427232,"It is currently debated whether AP1 or Sp1 is the factor that mediates transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β) stimulation of the human α2(I) collagen (COL1A2) gene by binding to an upstream promoter element (TbRE). The present study was designed to resolve this controversy by correlating expression of COL1A2, AP1, and Sp1 in the same cell line and under different experimental conditions. The results strongly indicate that Sp1 is required for the immediate early response of COL1A2 to TGF-β and AP1 is not. The Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin blocked stimulation of α2(I) collagen mRNA accumulation by TGF-β, whereas the AP1 inhibitor curcumin had no effect. Furthermore, antibodies against Jun-B and c-Jun failed to identify immunologically related proteins in the TbRE-bound complex, irrespective of whether they were purified from untreated or TGF-β-treated cells. AP1 did bind to the TbRE probe in vitro, but only in the absence of the upstream Sp1 recognition sequence. Based on this finding and DNA transfection results, we conclude that the AP1 sequence of the TbRE represents a cryptic site used under experimental conditions that either eliminate the more favorable Sp1 binding site or force the balance toward the less probable. Finally, a combination of cell transfections and DNA-binding assays excluded that COL1A2transactivation involves the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb), an activator of Sp1, the pRb-related protein p107, an inhibitor of Sp1, or the Sp1-related repressor, Sp3.

Type I collagen is the major structural component of connective tissue and consequently one of the key contributors to embryonic development and growth and to tissue repair and homeostasis (1Hay, E. D. (ed) (1991) Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix, 2nd Ed., pp. 419-462, Plenum Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 2Clark, R. A. F. (ed) (1995) The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair, 2nd Ed., pp. 3-50, Plenum Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Deregulated type I collagen synthesis is invariably associated with disorders characterized by excessive matrix deposition or abnormal matrix degradation (3Raghow R. FASEB J. 1994; 9: 823-831Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 4Koch A.E Kunkel S.L. Strieter R.M. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 28-38PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, transcription of the genes coding for the α1 and α2 subunits of type I collagen is critical to many physiological activities and pathological processes. During the past few years, substantial effort has been devoted toward understanding the molecular mechanisms that control transcription of the type I collagen genes (5Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 837-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 6Slack J.L. Liska D. Bornstein P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Some of the studies have examined tissue specific expression of the murine α1(I) and α2(I) collagens in transgenic animals; others have focused on the response of the human genes to cytokines. Altogether, the analyses suggest that the regulatory sequences of these coordinately expressed genes are organized somewhat differently. On the one hand, transcription of the murine α1(I) collagen gene in distinct mesenchyme lineages appears to be under the control of separate cis-acting elements scattered within 3.5 kilobase pairs of upstream sequence (7Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 8Pavlin D. Lichtler A.C. Bedalov A. Kream B.E. Harrison J.R. Thomas H.F.

On the other hand, spatiotemporal specificity of the mouse α2(I) collagen (Col1a2) gene seems to be confined to the 350-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base p[air(s); AP, activating protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CTF/NF-I, CCAAT box transcription factor/nuclear factor I; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; pRb, the product of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene; Sp1, specificity protein 1; TbRC, transcriptional complex bound to the TbRE; TbRE, TGF-β-responsive element; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α. proximal promoter andcis-acting elements with redundant GC-rich binding sites for nuclear proteins (9Niederreither K.

One of the cis-acting elements of the mouse 350-bp promoter has been shown to participate in α2(I) collagen expression in dermal and tendon fibroblasts, and to mediate the transcriptional response of the gene to transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) (9Niederreither K.

Cell. 1988; 52: 405-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Multiple copies of the −315 to −284 sequence of the Col1a2gene were sufficient to drive transcription from the basal 40-bp promoter in transfected fibroblasts and only in the tail and skin of transgenic mice (9Niederreither K. D'Souza R.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19622-19630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding was in line with prior results, which had correlated mutations introduced within the −315 to −284 sequence with a 10-fold loss of promoter activity (14Karsenty G. Golumbek P. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13909-13915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same region had also be found to mediate the stimulatory effect of TGF-β through a CTF/NF-I sequence by an as yet undetermined mechanism (13Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 1988; 52: 405-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Subsequent work could not confirm the contribution of the CTF/NF-I binding site to TGF-β responsiveness and instead implicated AP1 without, however, documenting where the factor binds or what the transactivating mechanism might be (15Chang E. Goldberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4473-4477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A more recent report has made a correlative argument to link CTF with the antagonistic signals of TGF-β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on Col1a2gene expression (16Alevizopoulos A. Mermod N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29672-29681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Work on the human α2(I) collagen (COL2A1) gene has reiterated the importance of the corresponding −330 to −283 promoter region in controlling fibroblast specificity and in mediating TGF-β responsiveness (17Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It has also raised the same controversy as the mouse studies did. Whereas there is general agreement excluding the participation of CTF/NF-I in the regulation of the human gene, different reports have involved distinct cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors in constitutive and TGF-β-stimulated transcription ofCOL1A2 (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One set of studies has shown that the TGF-β and TNF-α signaling pathways converge on the same transcriptional complex bound to the −330 to −255 region of the COL1A2 promoter (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The sequence consists of two nearly juxtaposed footprints (Boxes A and B, see Fig. 1), the most distal of which was further subdivided into two (Boxes 5A and 3A) by the following criteria. Deletion of Box 5A increased promoter activity, whereas nucleotide substitutions in Box 3A nearly abrogated it; additionally, distinct nuclear proteins bound Boxes 5A and 3A independently of each other. Although Box 5A contains the counterpart of the murine CTF/NF-I binding site (Fig. 1), recombinant NF-I failed to recognize the human sequence; furthermore, deletion of Box 5A had virtually no effect on the ability of TGF-β to stimulate the collagen promoter (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β responsiveness was instead linked to Boxes 3A and B (TbRE) and the cognate nuclear protein complex (TbRC). Additional in vitro evidence indicated that one of the TbRC components is the ubiquitous activator Sp1 (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, it was noted that TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2gene expression translated into increased intensity of the TbRC in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A subsequent study suggested that tyrosine dephosphorylation may be an obligatory step in TbRC transactivation (22Greenwel P. Hu W. Kohanski R.A. Ramirez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6813-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led to the formulation of the following hypothetical mechanism for TGF-β induction of COL1A2 transcription. TGF-β transactivates the TbRC by modifying an Sp1 co-factor through a tyrosine dephosphorylation-dependent nuclear step. In turn, the post-translational modification increases either the recruitment of TbRC to the cognate binding site or the affinity of the prebound complex. It was also hypothesized that the antagonistic signal of TNF-α affects both TbRC and C1R, the alleged repressor that binds to Box 5A (21Inagaki Y. Truter S. Tanaka S. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3353-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); the conclusion was based on the observation that overexpression of c-jun blocked cytokine stimulation of the co-transfected collagen promoter (19Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The above findings have been subsequently challenged by another study which located the TGF-β-responsive element to an AP1 recognition sequence overlapping the 3′ end of Box B (Fig. 1) (19Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The study has also suggested that transcriptional stimulation of COL1A2 by TGF-β is due to a switch in Fos partners, from c-Jun to Jun-B, resulting from TGF-β induction of jun-B gene expression (19Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 23Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The idea has received further support from the independent finding that overexpression of jun-B induced transcription of the mouseCol1a2 gene, and antisense jun-B RNA attenuated its stimulation by TGF-β (15Chang E. Goldberg H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4473-4477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It should be noted that another study similarly implicated TGF-β induction of jun-B expression in the down-regulation of the matrix metalloprotease-1 gene in cultured dermal fibroblasts (24Mauviel A. Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Hence, TGF-β may modulate matrix remodeling by changing the composition of a transcriptional complex that regulates expression of collagen and collagenase genes in opposite ways (19Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 23Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It was the principle objective of the present study to resolve the above controversy by elucidating whether the factor involved in TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2 transcription is Sp1 or AP1. To this end, we investigated how different experimental conditions affect expression of the candidate regulators and the target gene in the same fibroblast cell line. Within the limitation of this in vitroexperimental model, the results excluded AP1 participation in the early response of COL1A2 to TGF-β and, indirectly, confirmed Sp1 involvement in this process. They also excluded roles for availability of active Sp1 and release of Sp3 in TbRC transactivation. TGF-β1 and Yersinia-derived protein-tyrosine phosphatase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Curcumin, mithramycin A, cycloheximide and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were obtained from Sigma. Oligonucleotides containing consensus recognition sequences for Sp1 and GATA factors and for wild type and mutant AP1, as well as antibodies against Sp1 (PEP-2), c-Jun (D and N), Jun-B (N-17), pRb (C-15), and p107 (SD9) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Additional antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 were generously provided by Dr. J. Horowitz (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The Rb expression vector, pHRb, and the parental plasmid, pBJ1874, were a kind gift of Dr. R.

Curran (Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Nutley, NJ), whereas the Sp1 cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. J. T. Kadonaga (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and the COL1A2 cDNA has been described previously (26de Wet W.

Primary human fetal skin fibroblasts (CF-37) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) (17Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation and transfection of plasmid DNA into cells were performed as described previously (17Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five hours after transfection, fibroblasts were treated with 10% glycerol for 90 s, and then placed in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Two hours later, TGF-β or PMA were added to the culture media at the final concentration of 5 ng/ml or 60 ng/ml. Cells were harvested 48 h later and subjected to luciferase and CAT assays as described previously (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with the −378COL1A2/CAT construct and pHRb or pBJ1874, expression vectors with or without the Rb gene. In this case, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection to prepare nuclear extracts and total RNA, and to determine CAT activities. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the statistical value of the functional data. The transcriptional activity of chimeric constructs in transfection assays was always normalized against the co-transfected pSV-luciferase vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Confluent CF-37 fibroblasts were placed in low serum 18 h before TGF-β addition. Likewise, cells were preincubated with curcumin (20 μm) for 30 min or with mithramycin (100 nm) for 18 h prior to TGF-β administration. In some experiments, cycloheximide and PMA were added at final concentrations of 30 μg/ml and 60 ng/ml, respectively. Viability of the cells was estimated using the trypan blue (0.4% in PBS) exclusion test; in all cases, cellular viability was more than 90%. Total RNA was extracted 4 h after the addition of TGF-β and processed for Northern blot hybridizations according to standard protocols (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar, 27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Likewise, a standard protocol was used to determine rates of COL1A2transcription in control and mithramycin-treated cells using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pBR322 DNA as controls (28Shafit-Zagardo B. Brown F.L. Zavodny P.J. Maio J.J. Nature. 1983; 304: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Quantitative data were obtained using the computer program NIH-image software after scanning the autoradiographs with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from control and TGF-β-treated fibroblasts, alone or in combination with curcumin or cycloheximide. Confluent cells were maintained for 18 h in low serum prior to the addition of either TGF-β or PMA. Cells were preincubated with curcumin as described above. Cells were harvested 3 h after treatment and processed to prepare nuclear extracts according to the published protocol (29Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were used in the EMSA with COL1A2 oligonucleotides spanning from −313 to −183 (TbRE) and from −271 to −235 (Box B). Although longer than the TbRE and Box B, the EMSA probes are nevertheless identified by the names of these cis-acting elements. Relevant to the present study, the TbRE includes the Sp1 and AP1 recognition sequences and Box B encompasses only the AP1 binding site (Fig. 1). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase or with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed as described previously (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mithramycin treatment, DNA probes were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of the drug (100 nm final concentration) before being added to nuclear extracts. In the competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides were always added at 100-fold molar excess. The TbRC pattern shown in the present and past studies (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J.

(29Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Andrews and Faller (30Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). In the antibody interference assays, 2 μg of antibodies were preincubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts for 1 h at 4 °C before adding labeled probes. For the immunodepletion experiments, 20 μg of antibodies were conjugated to protein G-agarose beads in PBS and, after washing, they were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of nuclear proteins. Following centrifugations, supernatants were incubated with labeled oligonucleotide probes and analyzed by the EMSA. Nuclear extracts (15 μg for Sp1 detection and 20 μg for Rb detection) were electrophoresed in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (-7.5% polyacrylamide) and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters as described by Towbin et al. (31Towbin H. Ramjoue H.-P. Kuster H. Liverani D. Gordon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 257: 12709-12715Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Filters were probed with antibodies (1:4000 dilution), followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG diluted 1:3000. Sp1 and pRb were detected using an enhanced chemiluminiscent system (ECL, Amersham Corporation) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Inagaki et al. (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) originally proposed that TGF-β stimulates COL1A2 transcription by modifying the transactivating potential of an Sp1-containing complex (TbRC) that binds in vitro to a 130-bp probe (-313/-183) inclusive of the TbRE (Fig. 1). In contrast, Chunget al. (19Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) have recently argued that TGF-β stimulation is mediated by the cytokine-induced change in the composition of the AP1 complex bound to the −265/−241 sequence from Fos/c-Jun to Fos/Jun-B (Fig. 1). We have revisited this important issue using a strategy that took into account the biological implications of both models. Specifically, we have compared the effects of various experimental conditions on the expression of the endogenous COL1A2 gene and the candidate regulators Sp1 and AP1 on the in vitrobinding of the purified nuclear proteins. It is well established that TGF-β stimulates collagen production by acting in part at the transcriptional level (32Ignotz R.A. Endo T. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6443-6446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Penttinen R.P. Kobayashi S. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1987; 79: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It is also widely appreciated that a variety of factors, including culture conditions and the target cell, play a role in determining the precise mode of action of the cytokine and thus, the nature and extent of the response (35Laiho M. Rönnstrand L. Heino J. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 972-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Blume S.W. Sneyder R.C. Ray R. Thomas S. Koller C.A. Miller D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In view of these considerations, we first established how TGF-β modulates expression of the genes coding for α2(I) collagen, Sp1, and Jun-B in our experimental system, primary fibroblasts (CF-37) derived from human fetal skin (17Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AP1 model predicts synthesis of the Jun-B protein as an intermediate step in TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2 (19Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This prediction is consistent with the reported induction ofjun-B mRNA accumulation within 1 h of TGF-β administration in several cell culture systems, including lung epithelial cells, foreskin fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes (34Raghow R. Postlethwaite A.E. Keski-Oja S. Moses H.L. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar,35Laiho M. Rönnstrand L. Heino J. DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Livingston D.M. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 972-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A rapid and substantial increase of jun-B mRNA after TGF-β treatment was also seen in our dermal fibroblasts cultures; like other cell culture systems, the increase was unaffected by co-administration of cycloheximide at a concentration known to nearly abolish protein synthesis in fibroblasts (37Brenner D.A. Chojkier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17690-17695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). A more delayed stimulation was seen in duplicate Northern blots hybridized toCOL1A2 or c-jun; also in this case, the increases were not blocked by addition of cycloheximide (Fig. 2 A). TGF-β stimulation of COL1A2 transcription thus appears to occur independently of de novo synthesis of Jun-B, the step allegedly responsible for the change in AP1 composition and consequently, for COL1A2 transactivation (19Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The mRNA data also excluded causal association between de novo Sp1 synthesis and COL1A2 stimulation by TGF-β, a finding in line with the hypothesized co-factor modification of the Sp1 model (Fig.2 A) (18Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Greenwel P. Hu W. Kohanski R.A. Ramirez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6813-6819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, they documented 2- and 1.5-fold increase in Sp1 mRNA and protein content after 6 h of TGF-β treatment, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2TGF-β modulation of fibroblast gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W1528038969,"Exploration of the mechanisms and plasticity of synaptic transmission has been hindered by the lack of a method to measure single vesicle turnover directly in individual presynaptic boutons at isolated nerve terminals. Although postsynaptic electrical recordings have provided a wealth of invaluable basic information about quantal presynaptic processes, this approach has often proved difficult to apply at most central nervous system synapses. Here we describe the direct optical detection of single quantal events in individual presynaptic boutons of cultured hippocampal neurons. Using the fluorescent dye FM 1-43 as a tracer for presynaptic endocytosis, we have characterized both evoked and spontaneous components of presynaptic function at the level of individual quanta. Our results are consistent with quantal interpretations of previous electrophysiological analyses and provide new information about the unitary membrane recycling event and its coupling to individual action potential stimuli, about spontaneous vesicle turnover at individual boutons, and about the numbers of vesicles recycling at individual boutons."
https://openalex.org/W1659561622,"Triple whole-cell recordings from simple networks of cultured hippocampal neurons show that induction of long-term depression at glutamatergic synapses is accompanied by a back propagation of depression to input synapses on the dendrite of the presynaptic neuron. The depression also propagates laterally to divergent outputs of the presynaptic neuron and to convergent inputs on the postsynaptic neuron. There is no forward propagation of depression to the output of the postsynaptic neuron and no presynaptic propagation accompanying long-term depression at GABAergic synapses. Activity-induced synaptic modification is therefore not restricted to the activated synapse, but selectively propagates throughout the neural network."
https://openalex.org/W2318172046,"We evaluated the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in human A-172 glioblastoma cells and human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The mRNA level of VEGF increased in response to S-Nitroso-N-acetly-D,L-penicillamine (SNAP) in both cell lines, and increased in mRNA level well coincided with VEGF protein production in A-172 cells. SNAP at 0.5 mM induced maximal stimulation of 4.4 and 3.7 kb VEGF mRNA expression after 6 h about 11 and 8 fold increase, respectively above control level. Similar VEGF mRNA accumulation was observed also with NOR3, another chemical NO generator. To evaluate the effect of SNAP on VEGF mRNA stability, half-lives of VEGF mRNA were measured in A-172 cells cultured with or without 0.5 mM SNAP and treated with actinomycin D (25 μg/ml). Half-life for VEGF mRNA was found to be prolonged about 2.4 fold by SNAP. VEGF expression induced by SNAP was inhibited by guanylate cyclase inhibitors, methylene blue (10 μM) and LY-83583 (1 μM), and by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (25 μg/ml). These results suggest that induction of VEGF gene expression by NO is mediated through guanylate cyclase activity and requires on-going protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1502125372,"Sex is a general feature of the life cycle of eukaryotes. It is not universal, however, as many organisms seem to lack sex entirely. The widespread occurrence of sex is puzzling, both because meiotic recombination can disrupt co-adapted combinations of genes, and because it halves the potential rate of reproduction in organisms with strongly differentiated male and female gametes. Most attempts to explain the maintenance of sexuality invoke differences between parents and sexual offspring. These differences may be advantageous in novel or changing environments if new gene combinations are favoured from time to time. Sex would then serve to concentrate beneficial mutations that have arisen independently into the same line of descent. But in a stable environment sex might serve to concentrate deleterious mutations, so that they will be more effectively purged from the population by selection. We have studied the effect of sex on mean fitness in experimental populations of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results show that sex increases mean fitness in an environment to which the populations were well adapted, but not in an environment to which new adaptation occurred, supporting the hypothesis that the advantage of sexuality lay in the removal of deleterious mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2018465340,"The TRAF3 molecule interacts with the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus (COOH terminus) of the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded oncogene LMP-1. NF-κB activation is a downstream signaling event of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) molecules in other signaling systems (CD40 for example) and is an event caused by LMP-1 expression. One region capable of TRAF3 interaction in LMP-1 is the membrane-proximal 45 amino acids (188–242) of the COOH terminus. We show that this region contains the only site for binding of TRAF3 in the 200-amino acid COOH terminus of LMP-1. The site also binds TRAF2 and TRAF5, but not TRAF6. TRAF3 binds to critical residues localized between amino acids 196 and 212 (HHDDSLPHPQQATDDSG), including the PXQX(T/S) motif, that share limited identity to the CD40 receptor TRAF binding site (TAAPVQETL). Mutation of critical residues in the TRAF3 binding site of LMP-1 that prevents binding of TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 does not affect NF-κB-activating potential. Deletion mapping localized the major NF-κB activating region of LMP-1 to critical residues in the distal 4 amino acids of the COOH terminus (383–386). Therefore, TRAF3 binding and NF-κB activation occur through two separate motifs at opposite ends of the LMP-1 COOH-terminal sequence.

LMP-1 is an essential gene for the immortalization of B cells by Epstein-Barr virus in vitro (1Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 4766-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The apparent oncogenicity of the LMP-1 gene product has made this molecule the focus of intense interest in the field of EBV biology. LMP-1 is a short lived protein with a half-life of between 2 and 4 h (8Mann K.P. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2100-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Baichwal V.R. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 866-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This rapid turnover occurs due to the specific cleavage in the COOH terminus at amino acid 242 resulting in the release of a 144-amino acid 25-kDa fragment that is itself rapidly degraded (10Moorthy R. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 829-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LMP-1 is also selectively phosphorylated in the released 25-kDa fragment at serine 311 and threonine 324 (11Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of these modifications of the LMP-1 carboxyl terminus are uncertain, although Thr-324 dephosphorylation is required for the transformation of Rat-1 cells (11Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis of LMP-1 indicated that it aggregates in the plasma membrane and co-patches with the cytoskeletal protein vimentin (12Liebowitz D. Wang D. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1986; 58: 233-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patching of LMP-1 with cytoskeletal components occurs through the cytoplasmic amino-terminal residues (13Martin J. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3246-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LMP-1 has thus been divided into three separate domains, the cytoplasmic amino terminus, the transmembrane, and the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. All three domains of LMP-1 have been shown to be critical for transformation in focus-forming assays with the rodent cell line Rat-1 (14Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Rat-1 transformation assays were the first formal demonstration that the COOH-terminal domain of LMP-1 was critical to its function. These experiments delineated critical residues for transformation to be present in the last 23 COOH-terminal amino acids of LMP-1 (14Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and additional unpublished studies suggested that the critical motif includes the last 4 COOH-terminal amino acids. Subsequent studies with recombinant virus confirmed the requirement for COOH-terminal components of LMP-1 in the EBV immortalization process during in vitro infection (15Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Mosialos G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 675-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Rat-1 focus-forming assay, therefore, has good predictive value for LMP-1 function. LMP-1 has been the focus of recent intensive study due to its ability to bind the family of adaptor molecules known as TRAFs (TNF receptor-associated factors; reviewed in Ref. 16Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar), specifically to TRAF3 (also known as LAP1, CRAF1, CD40bp, and CAP1) (17Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D.

This is a significant finding, since it is known that the phenotypic changes and activation state of an EBV-infected cell is similar to that seen with CD40 receptor activation of B cells (20Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar). CD40 receptor also binds to TRAF molecules, and its functions are mediated through these molecules (17Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D.

This is indirect evidence that EBV, specifically LMP-1, may subvert normal cellular pathways to establish and maintain the latent state of infection in B cells, as has been hypothesized previously (22Thorley-Lawson D.A. Mann K.P. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). LMP-1 expression has been linked to many of the cellular changes induced by EBV infection of B cells in vitro (reviewed in Ref. 20Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 2nd Ed.

Most of these changes occur following stable or transient expression of LMP-1 into tumor cell lines. However, it has been shown recently that these changes, with the exception of NF-κB activation, are a consequence of LMP-1 overexpression in cell lines. 2S. R. Brodeur and D. A. Thorley-Lawson, submitted for publication. 2S. R. Brodeur and D. A. Thorley-Lawson, submitted for publication. NF-κB activation is therefore likely to represent the most relevant measure of LMP-1 function. The TRAF molecules are an expanding family of proteins (TRAF1–TRAF6) that share a conserved COOH-terminal TRAF domain (reviewed in Ref. 16Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these molecules were identified due to their interaction with the TNF or CD40 receptors (17Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 18Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Liou M.-L. Liou H.-C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9699-9703Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are the only members able to directly cause activation of NF-κB through transient overexpression (21Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 40Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V.

Kobayashi N. Ohishi T. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9437-9442Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 appear to be ubiquitously expressed, implying a general regulatory role, whereas TRAF1, TRAF4, and TRAF5 appear to be more tissue-specific. Multimerization of the TRAF molecules through the TRAF domain appears to be important for the function of all of the TRAFs identified to date (21Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). A molecule known as TANK or I-TRAF has also been identified that can bind to TRAF molecules and appears to be a negative regulator of the TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 NF-κB-activating function (41Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 43Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Analysis of the LMP-1 carboxyl terminus has identified two regions that are potentially responsible for NF-κB activation. One of these sites maps to the first 40–45 amino acids (188–232) of the LMP-1 COOH terminus (33Mitchell T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar), the same region shown to be important in TRAF3 binding activity (19Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). A second site maps to the last 35–45 amino acids (351–386) of the COOH terminus of LMP-1 (33Mitchell T. Sugden B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2968-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar). This site is dispensable for B lymphocyte transformation (15Kaye K.M. Izumi K.M. Mosialos G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 675-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but correlates with sequences that are essential for oncogenic transformation of Rat-1 cells (14Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have dissected the cytoplasmic COOH terminus of LMP-1 to attempt to understand the role of TRAF binding in LMP-1 signaling functions. Preliminary sequence analysis suggested three or four potential TRAF binding sites in the COOH terminus of LMP-1. However, we localized the sole recognition site for binding TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 to the membrane-proximal region of the COOH terminus. Loss of TRAF binding to this site does not affect LMP-1 activation of NF-κB. A second distinct region, representing the major NF-κB-activating sequence, is composed of critical residues that include the last 4 amino acids of the LMP-1 COOH terminus. These critical residues of LMP-1 are part of a sequence that resembles a TRAF binding site, although TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6 do not bind, and correlate perfectly with critical sequences shown previously to be essential in Rat-1 transformation assays. BJAB is a human EBV-negative lymphoblastoid B cell line, and IB4 is an EBV-positive lymphoblastoid B cell line. Both were maintained in RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). 293 cells are a human embryonic kidney cell line and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. GST fusion constructs were made by inserting PCR products of the LMP-1 COOH terminus into theEcoRI-BamHI site of the pGEX2T (Pharmacia) multicloning site. For the LMPC200 (from pB3LMP-1) and LMPN55 (from pB3LMP-1 del242–386) fragments, engineered in frame 5′EcoRI and 3′ BamHI sites were added to the ends of the LMP-1 sequences 5′-TATTACCATGGACAACGACAC-3′ and 5′-GCCTATGACATGGTAATGCC-3′, respectively. The LMPC35 fusion used an engineered in frame 5′ EcoRI site added to theLMP-1 sequence 5′-CATAGTCATGATTCCGGCCAT-3′. The LMPC140 fusion was generated by cutting the LMPN55 PCR product withBglII and BamHI and inserting this piece into theBamHI site of pGEX2T. The BglII site was introduced into the LMPEnd (del242–386) construct as described previously and cut to allow for an in frame sequence starting at amino acid 245 of LMP-1. All PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. PCR mutagenesis was used to generate the LMPM2 and LMPEndM2 double point mutant constructs. The mutagenic oligonucleotides, 5′-CCTCAACAAGCTGCCGCGGATTCTGGCCAT-3′ and its corresponding opposite strand, were used with the above 5′ EcoRI and 3′BamHI primers by sequential PCR steps as described previously (48Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1991: 8.5.7Google Scholar). The NcoI fragment of the LMPM2 and LMPEndM2 PCR products were cloned into the pB3LMP-1 construct to generate full-length coding sequence containing the mutation. MTLM (4Wang D. Liebowitz D. Kieff E. Cell. 1985; 43: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) and the derivatives End (del242–386) and 4Stop (del364–386) were described previously (14Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LMP5Stop (del377–386) and LMP6Stop (del383–386) deletions were created in the same way by replacing coding sequence with stop codons using the Amersham in vitromutagenesis kit in the pB3LMP-1 vector as described previously (14Moorthy R.K. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CMV LMP-1 constructs were derived by inserting the EcoRI (from pB3LMP-1 MCS)-PvuII (LMP-1 noncoding) fragment of the various LMP-1 mutants into the EcoRI-SmaI multicloning site of pCI-Neo (Promega). NF-κB transient transfections utilized the pIFNLuc and pIFN(kB)3Luc (44Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). pCMVLuc was used as a positive control for luciferase activity (gift of Dr. David Livingston), and pCMVβgal was used as an internal control to normalize for transfection efficiency. The vector for expressing FLAG-tagged human TRAF6 (pRK5FLAGTRAF6) (40Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. David Goeddel (Tularik Inc.). To produce human HA-tagged TRAF5, a cDNA for human TRAF5 was cloned into the vector pEBD (41Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides encoding the HA tag were then cloned in frame at the 3′-end of the TRAF5 cDNA sequence. Transient transfection experiments in BJAB were performed by electroporation of 5 × 106 cells at 300V/500 microfarads at room temperature in the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with 1–5 μg of the appropriate vectors. Cells were harvested 24–48 h post-transfection in 300–400 μl of Reporter lysis buffer (Promega). All experiments represent three separate transfections with results done in duplicate. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as per the manufacturer's protocol from 1 liter of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced culture. Following sonication of the cells to release the GST proteins, 0.25 ml of washed packed bead volume was used for purification. The coupled beads were then stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline until they were used for in vitro binding assays. Binding assays were done essentially as described previously (45Cheng G. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8152-8155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In short, 293 cells, either stably or transiently transfected with HA-tagged human TRAF2 (TRAF2/HA), TRAF3 (TRAF3/HA), or TRAF5 (TRAF5/HA) or FLAG-tagged TRAF6 (FLAG/TRAF6) expression vectors, were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated with appropriate GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione beads and washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Samples were then boiled in SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Berkeley antibodies) or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co., IBI) followed by a goat-anti mouse immunoglobulin antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Bound antibodies were detected with the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). 50–200 μl of each extract (approximately 1–2 × 105 relative light units for pCMVLuc) was assayed using the Promega luciferase assay system and a luminometer for detection. All extracts were normalized for protein content using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase activity (exogenous pCMVβgal). LMP-1 has been shown to interact with TRAF3 through its carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Previous studies (19Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) have shown that TRAF3 binds to recombinant fusion proteins containing either the full-length (200 amino acids from 188 to 386) or the membrane proximal 44 amino acids (188–232) of the COOH terminus of LMP-1. The number and specific sequences of TRAF binding sites in the entire LMP-1 COOH terminus remains to be elucidated. We used the known TRAF3 binding sequence of the CD40 receptor COOH terminus to identify, by inspection, potential TRAF3 binding sites in the COOH-terminal domain of LMP-1. We found several likely regions with homology (Fig. 1 A). Overall, the analysis revealed three potential TRAF3 binding sites, designated LMP-1 A, B, and C, including one in the 44-amino acid membrane proximal region (LMP-1 A). All three contained a conserved PXQX(T/S) motif in common with the CD40 receptor. The sequences are shown aligned with the CD40 receptor motif (in Fig.1 A), and their location in the LMP-1 COOH terminus is shown at the top of Fig. 1 B. To test the potential TRAF3 binding capacity of each of these sites, we made a number of GST fusion proteins containing various portions of the LMP-1 sequence (Fig.1 B). The ability of these fusion proteins to bind a recombinant TRAF3 protein fused to a hemagglutinin tag of influenza (TRAF3/HA) was then assessed using an in vitro binding assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results are shown in Fig.2 A. From these results, it is clear that the only sites for TRAF3 binding in LMP-1 are present in the first 55 amino acids (N55; residues 188–242), since no detectable binding to the C140 (residues 243–386) and C35 (residues 351–386) fusion proteins was seen. This indicates that the LMP-1 B and C sites are not functional TRAF3 binding sites, leaving LMP-1 A or other unspecified regions in N55 as candidate binding sites. Alanine substitution studies of the TRAF binding site in the CD40 cytoplasmic tail 3G. Cheng and D. Baltimore, unpublished results. showed that substitution of any one of three critical residues (shown inboldface type in Fig. 1 A) in the 17-amino acid sequence of the CD40 receptor resulted in significant loss of TRAF3 binding. Specifically, mutation of the threonine residue at position 234 to alanine in the CD40 receptor blocks both TRAF3 binding and CD40 functions (18Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Inui S. Kaisho T. Kikutani H. Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Clark E.A. Kishimoto T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Use of a 17-amino acid synthetic peptide (N17) equivalent to the LMP-1 A site of LMP-1 (residues 196–212) showed that this region bound the TRAF3 protein (Fig. 2 A) as well as or better than N55. Introduction of a point mutation (equivalent to Thr-234 in the CD40 receptor) into the 17-amino acid LMP-1 peptide (N17M) by substitution of threonine 208 with alanine caused an extensive reduction in TRAF3 binding (Fig. 2 A). This establishes that the LMP-1 A site, initially identified by sequence homology, is capable of binding to TRAF3. Having identified a short peptide sequence between amino acids 196 and 212 that was sufficient to bind TRAF3, we wished to establish if this was the sole TRAF3 binding site in the entire LMP-1 COOH-terminal sequence. This was done by testing if mutation of the motif was able to block binding of TRAF3 to the intact COOH-terminal domain. Based on mutagenesis studies of the CD40 receptor, the introduction of two point mutations converting Thr-234 and Leu-235 to alanine was sufficient to completely inhibit TRAF binding and CD40 functions (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, we introduced the equivalent mutations into the LMP-1 A motif in the GSTLMPC200 vector, converting the T-208 and D-209 residues to alanine, generating the mutant GST fusion protein LMPC200M2. The wild type and mutant fusion proteins were then tested for binding to TRAF3 (Fig.2 B). The wild type COOH-terminal domain of LMP-1 (C200) bound TRAF3 as efficiently as the wild type CD40 receptor. However, the double point mutation (C200M2) of the full-length carboxyl terminus of LMP-1 completely ablates binding to TRAF3 (Fig. 2 B). This mutation does not show the weak binding that is displayed by the single point mutation in the synthetic peptide (N17M) even upon longer exposure. This is the first demonstration of point mutations in the LMP-1 COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail (C200M2) that effectively knock out TRAF3 binding, therefore confirming the presence of only one TRAF3 binding site (referred to as the TRAF3 recognition site). Having identified the sole TRAF3 binding site in the LMP-1 COOH terminus, we asked if mutations in this site that prevent TRAF3 binding result in functional inactivation of LMP-1. Many functions have been attributed to ectopic expression of LMP-1 in cell lines including induction of cell surface activation and adhesion molecules, increased Bcl-2 expression, and NF-κB activation (reviewed in Ref. 20Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar). Recent evidence, utilizing an LMP-1-inducible system in the BJAB cell line, showed that the only consequence of physiological levels of expression of LMP-1 is the activation of NF-κB; the other phenotypic effects occurred only at very high levels of LMP-1 expression that were also associated with the induction of apoptosis.2 NF-κB activation is also a major function associated with TRAF binding to TNF receptor family members including CD40. We therefore used transient transfection studies in the BJAB cell line to test for the functional role of the LMP-1 TRAF3 binding site in the activation of NF-κB. Transient expression of the entire LMP-1 coding sequence (CMVLMP) showed about a 15-fold induction of NF-κB from the IFN(kB)3Luc construct (Fig. 3 A)versus the IFNLuc construct. This induction of NF-κB activity was equal to or perhaps even higher than the activity produced by direct expression of the p50 and p65 components of NF-κB. Transient expression of the TRAF3 recognition site mutant (CMVLMPM2) produced NF-κB activity comparable to that of wild type LMP-1. Repeat experiments performed after different times of culture (24 and 36 h) gave comparable results, and overall, no significant difference in NF-κB activation was ever observed between the wild type LMP-1 expression vector and the expression vector expressing the mutant LMP-1 that could no longer bind TRAF3. Therefore, the TRAF3 recognition site makes no detectable contribution to the NF-κB activation associated with LMP-1. Truncated TRAF3 (C26 CRAF1; Ref. 17Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) is able to bind to its recognition site and allows for homodimerization of the TRAF3 molecules, but it is no longer able to generate downstream signals when receptors are stimulated. Loss of this activity allows truncated TRAF3 to act as a dominant negative molecule that, when highly overexpressed, will block the NF-κB- and CD23-activating function of the CD40 receptor (17Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). To further test the role of the LMP-1 TRAF3 site in NF-κB activation, LMP-1 was transiently expressed from the MTLM expression plasmid in the presence of co-transfected C26 at levels previously shown to block CD40 signaling. Expression of LMP-1 from the MTLM vector alone or in the presence of the dominant negative TRAF3 produced comparable le"
https://openalex.org/W1550791622,"V(D)J recombination generates diversity in the immune system through the lymphoid-specific assembly of multiple gene segments into functional immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. The first step in V(D)J recombination is cleavage of DNA at recombination signal sequences. Cleavage produces a blunt DNA end on each signal sequence and a hairpin end on adjacent coding gene segments, and can be reproduced in vitro by using purified RAG and RAG2 proteins. The later steps involve processing and joining of the cleaved DNA ends, and until now have been studied only in cells. Here we reconstitute the complete V(D)J recombination reaction in a cell-free system. We find that the RAG proteins are not only involved in cleavage, but are also needed in the later steps for efficient joining of coding ends. Joining is largely directed by short pieces of identical sequence in the coding flanks, but addition of human DNA ligase I results in greater diversity. Coding junctions contain short deletions as well as additions complementary to a coding flank (P nucleotides). Addition of non-templated nucleotides into coding junctions is mediated by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase. The cell-free reaction can therefore reproduce the complete set of processing events that occur in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2049198952,"Sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is critical for initiating differentiation of the PC12 cell to a sympathetic-like neurone. The neuropeptide, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), has been demonstrated to cause cells to adopt a neuronal phenotype, although the mechanism of this activity is unclear. PACAP through its type I receptor stimulates a biphasic activation of ERK1/2; a >10-fold increase within 5 min, followed by a >5-fold increase that is sustained for ≥60 min. An equivalent stimulation is seen in PC12 cells expressing a dominant negative Ras mutant. However, the mitogen-activated kinase/ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor PD98059 blocked both PACAP-induced stimulation of ERK1/2 activity and neurite outgrowth. Thus, the activation signal from the PACAP type I receptor on the ERK1/2 cascade pathway is received downstream of Ras, either at Raf or MEK. Down-regulation of protein kinase C or its inhibition by calphostin C blocked the ability of PACAP to stimulate ERK1/2. We conclude that activation of PACAP type I receptor activates protein kinase C, which then activates the ERK1/2 cascade in a Ras-independent manner at either Raf or MEK1/2.

Two receptor subtypes have been identified for PACAP; both are G protein-coupled receptors. The PACAP type I receptor (found in hypothalamus, brain stem, pituitary, adrenal gland, and testes) is specific for PACAP, having a K d of 0.5–2.0 nm.

The type II receptor does not discriminate between PACAP and VIP and is only positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase.PACAP38 potently stimulates neuritogenesis of neuroblastoma cells (3Deutsch P.J.

Peptides. 1995; 16: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The MAP kinases ERK1/2 are thought to be key players in the control of gene transcription events that lead to proliferation or differentiation in PC12 cells in response to epidermal growth factor or NGF, respectively. It has been suggested that the determinant of the nature of the response of PC12 cells (proliferation or differentiation) correlates with the duration of ERK1/2 activation and its translocation to the nucleus (9Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar).ERK1/2 activation following agonist stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors has been reported (reviewed in Ref. 10van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), although various effectors are employed to couple these receptors to the MAP kinase cascade. In light of the neurite-stimulatory role of PACAP38 in pituitary neural cells and neuroblastoma cell lines, we have investigated the relationship of PACAP38 stimulation to ERK1/2 activation and compared this to that for NGF. In this study, we have demonstrated that PACAP38 activates ERK1/2 for prolonged times and that this activation is independent of Ras but dependent on MEK1/2.DISCUSSIONSustained activation of the ERK1/2 pathway has been suggested to be sufficient to cause differentiation of PC12 cells into a neuronal phenotype (22Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 23Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). Work by Traverse et al. (9Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) in PC12 cells, suggests that a sustained activation is required for nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 and that this translocation is required to initiate neuronal differentiation through activation of transcription events. Here we report that stimulation of the PACAP type I receptor increases ERK1/2 activity >10-fold within 5 min. This initial peak is followed by a lower, more sustained activity up to 60 min of >5-fold above basal levels. This pattern of the response of ERK1/2 to PACAP38 was similar to that observed for NGF. The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 has previously been reported to block the NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (24Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). We find this inhibitor to be equally effective in blocking the PACAP38 stimulation of ERK1/2 and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. These data provide further evidence that the activation of ERK1/2 is sufficient for PC12 cell differentiation and, furthermore, strongly suggest that PACAP38-induced neurite outgrowth is mediated via the activation of ERK1/2.The lack of effect of cAMP on ERK1/2 activation we report here is consistent with our previous observation that the PKA inhibitor H89 does not block PACAP38-induced neurite outgrowth (7Colbert R.A. Balbi D. Johnson A. Bailey J.A. Allen J.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7141-7147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the ubiquitous Raf-1, PC12 cells contain the B-Raf isoform, which is specific for neuronal and PC12 cells (25Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar, 26Oshima M. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23753-23760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Work by Peraldi et al. (27Peraldi P. Frödin M. Barnier J.V. Calleja V. Scimeca J.-C. Filloux C. Calothy G. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrates that although B-Raf is capable of being activated by NGF and PMA, cAMP cotreatment with these agents returns B-Raf activity to basal levels. The mechanism of inhibition is thought to arise via the phosphorylation of B-Raf by PKA, causing a reduced p21 ras -B-Raf affinity, similar to that shown in fibroblasts by Wu et al. (28Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Thus, the enhancement of PACAP38-stimulated ERK1/2 activity seen in the presence of H89 could be explained by removal of the inhibitory contribution from PKA-phosphorylated B-Raf.Here we demonstrate that the PACAP type I receptor, which is positively coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, stimulates ERK1/2 activity in a Ras-independent manner. The magnitude of activation is equivalent for the wild type PC12 and PC12asn17-W7 cells, suggesting that a single Ras-independent pathway is activated. Furthermore, the PACAP38 stimulation of ERK1/2 activity is sensitive to PKC inhibition. From the literature, the activation of ERK1/2 by the pertussis-insensitive, Gq/11-coupled receptors has been reported in both Ras-dependent (29Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Also, activation of phospholipase C by expression of phospholipase Cβ2 or an activated Gαq mutant has been shown to stimulate ERK1/2 by Faure et al. (34Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters have been reported to potently activate ERK in various cell types, and PKC-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Raf is a strong contender for the mechanism of activation. For example, PKCα has been shown to activate c-Raf (31Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mishak H. Finkenzeller G. Marmé D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), and recently Ueda et al. (33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a Ras-independent, Raf-dependent, PKCδ- mediated activation of ERK. In COS7 and Chinese hamster ovary cells, increases in ERK activity by Gq-coupled receptors occurs independently of p21 ras activation but is blocked by expression of dominant negative Raf or PKC depletion (32Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Thus, the data presented here are consistent with a Ras-independent, PKC-dependent activation of ERK1/2, and as discussed here, similar effects have already been reported for other cell types.With respect to determining which component of the ERK signaling pathway receives the activation signal from the PACAP receptor, these data indicate that the recipient is downstream of Ras, either at Raf or MEK1/2, and further work is ongoing to determine the exact component of the ERK1/2 pathway that is the recipient of the stimulatory signal from the activated PACAP receptor.

They share the same 27 amino-terminal amino acids and arise from a precursor peptide by post-translational processing (1Arimura A. Regul. Pept. 1992; 37: 287-303PubMed Google Scholar). Two receptor subtypes have been identified for PACAP; both are G protein-coupled receptors. The PACAP type I receptor (found in hypothalamus, brain stem, pituitary, adrenal gland, and testes) is specific for PACAP, having a K d of 0.5–2.0 nm. There are several splice variants that demonstrate different abilities to activate adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C (2Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H.

https://openalex.org/W2017788990,"Previous reports have shown that fresh tissues and cell lines from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) overexpress transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) and its receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at both the mRNA and protein levels. Protein localization studies confirm that TGF-alpha and EGFR are produced by the same epithelial cells in tissues from head and neck cancer patients further supporting an autocrine growth pathway. Using three strategies, we examined the hypothesis that downmodulation of EGFR would reduce the proliferation of SCCHN cells. We targeted EGFR mRNA using antisense oligonucleotides and the mature EGFR protein at two sites, the ligand-binding domain and the kinase domain, and determined the effects of this targeting on SCCHN proliferation. Treatment of several SCCHN cell lines with a pair of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against the translation start site and first intron-exon splice junction of the human EGFR gene resulted in decreased EGFR protein production and inhibited growth by 86% compared to a 13% reduction in cells treated with sense oligonucleotides (P=0.03). Growth inhibition was specific for carcinoma cells since the same EGFR antisense oligonucleotides had no effect on the proliferation of normal mucosa cells harvested from non-cancer patients. Two monoclonal antibodies which block ligand binding to EGFR (MAbs 425 and 528) inhibited the growth of several SCCHN cell lines by up to 97% which suggests that EGFR is participating in an autocrine pathway in SCCHN that is, at least in part, external. An EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PD 153035) was found to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation in SCCHN cell lines and to reduce growth by 68% although it had no effect on the growth rate of normal mucosal epithelial cells. These experiments indicate that EGFR gene expression and function is critical for SCCHN cell growth but not for growth of normal mucosa cells and therefore may serve as a tumor-specific target for preventive and therapeutic strategies in head and neck cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2153390050,"The related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) is tyrosine-phosphorylated following β1 integrin or B cell antigen receptor stimulation in human B cells. Two substrates that are tyrosine-phosphorylated following integrin ligation in B cells are p130Cas and the Cas family member human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1), both of which can associate with RAFTK. In this report we observed that RAFTK was involved in the phosphorylation of these two proteins. While a catalytically active RAFTK was required for both p130Cas and HEF1, phosphorylation of p130Cas, but not of HEF1, was dependent on an intact autophosphorylation site (Tyr402) on RAFTK. To determine if RAFTK phosphorylated p130Cas and HEF1 directly or through an intermediate, we assayed the ability of RAFTK and of a Tyr402 mutant to phosphorylate purified HEF1 and p130Cas domains. RAFTK was able to phosphorylate the substrate domains of both p130Cas and HEF1, but only the C-terminal domain of p130Cas. Furthermore, Tyr402, which mediates the binding of RAFTK to c-Src kinase, was required for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of p130Cas. These data suggest that RAFTK itself is sufficient for HEF1 phosphorylation, whereas a cooperation between RAFTK and Src kinases is required for the complete phosphorylation of p130Cas.

This kinase is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells and neurons and is distinct from p125FAK (focal adhesion kinase, FAK). Similar to FAK, RAFTK lacks a transmembrane region, does not contain any SH2 or SH3 domains, but does have a proline-rich region in its C terminus (9Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D.

Ohba T. Sasaki H. Sasaki T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2331-2338PubMed Google Scholar, 16Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). p130Cas is an SH3 domain-containing molecule with 15 potential Crk-SH2-binding motifs (substrate domain, SD domain), an SH3 binding motif located near the N-terminal region as well as a proline-rich sequence (RPLPSPP) and a YDYV motif, which have been shown to bind to Src SH3 and SH2 domains, respectively, in its C-terminal region (17Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). HEF1 is 64% homologous to p130Cas and contains also an SH3 domain and multiple SH2 binding motifs, but lacks the proline-rich sequences located near the N-terminal SH3 domain and in the C-terminal region of p130Cas (13Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Binding of Crk family members to tyrosine phosphorylated Cas and HEF1 illustrates the assembly of signaling complexes, since the SH3 domain of Crk proteins can bind in turn to a number of proteins including two guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Sos and C3G, which regulate Ras and Rap1 activation, respectively (18Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenwa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Integrin-mediated phosphorylation of p130Cas has been shown to be primarily mediated by c-Src in fibroblasts (22Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation site of FAK, tyrosine 397, serves as a Src binding site (23Eide B. Turck C. Escobedo J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Following FAK autophosphorylation, Src family kinases are recruited and then phosphorylate p130Cas (24Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in PC12 cells, the autophosphorylation site of RAFTK, tyrosine 402, binds to Src kinase upon bradykinin activation (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneide S. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that RAFTK is involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and HEF1. Although RAFTK by itself seems sufficient for HEF1 phosphorylation, a cooperation between RAFTK and Src kinase is required for a complete p130Casphosphorylation. These studies suggest that p130Cas, but not HEF1, activity may be regulated in response to the action of Src and Src family tyrosine kinases. Cos-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Antibodies used in this study were directed against phosphotyrosine (4G10 mAb); p130Cas (Cas), c-Src (rabbit polyclonal IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); hemagglutinin (HA mAb; Boehringer Mannheim); Flag mAb (M5 antibodies, Eastman Kodak Co.). HEF1 polyclonal antibodies (anti-HEF1) have been previously described (13Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The anti-C/H mAb recognizes both p130Cas and HEF1 (p130Cas mAb, Transduction laboratories, Lexington, KY). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse Igs (RAM) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The following GST fusion proteins were used: substrate domain of p130Cas (SD Cas), amino acids 213–514; C-terminal domain of p130Cas containing the Src SH2 and SH3 binding motifs (CT Cas/SB), amino acids 691–786 (17Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar); substrate domain of HEF1 (SD HEF1), amino acids 82–398, cloned in pGEX1lambdaT vector at EcoRI/XhoI sites; C-terminal domain of HEF1 (CT HEF1), amino acids 626–832 (13Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Cos-7 cells were transiently transfected using DEAE-dextran, using p130Cas cDNA subcloned in pSSRα and HEF1 cDNA subcloned in pcDNA3 through restriction digests of overlapping clones (13Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell.

RAFTK constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3/Flag vector as already described (26Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants of Cas included: Cas ΔSD, in which the sequence from amino acids 213 to 514 was deleted; and Cas ΔSB, in which the sequence from amino acids 638 to 889 (17Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The transfected p130Cas proteins were fused to the HA peptide, whereas RAFTK was fused to a Flag peptide located downstream of the proteins. Cells were lysed (in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, 0.4 mmNa2VO4) 48 h after transfection, and immunoprecipitations were then performed. Cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), then incubated with specific antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After four washes with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted with sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.02% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-PTM membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 130 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for anti-phosphotyrosine blotting and with 5% non-fat dried milk in TBS-T for all other antibodies and incubated for 1 h with specific antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) and chemiluminescence (Renaissance, DuPont NEN). Densitometric analysis was performed with an LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer. Immunoprecipitated proteins or GST fusion proteins were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na2VO4) and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in kinase buffer containing 0.1 mm ATP (Sigma). Proteins were then eluted by boiling with 0.5% SDS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and subjected to reimmunoprecipitation or boiled directly in sample buffer. Since RAFTK can associate with p130Cas as well as HEF1, we investigated whether RAFTK is involved in their tyrosine phosphorylation. Cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding HEF1, HA-tagged p130Cas, or Flag-tagged RAFTK, and after 2 days cells were harvested and lysed. p130Cas and HEF1 were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA and anti-HEF1 antibodies, respectively, and each immunoprecipitate was divided in two parts. Transfected RAFTK was immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag antibodies and divided into four aliquots. Two aliquots of the immunoprecipitated Flag-RAFTK were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay (− or + ATP) (Fig.2 A) and analyzed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to assess the autophosphorylation of the kinase (upper panel). As seen in Fig. 2 A, an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK was seen in the presence of ATP. Immunoprecipitated p130Cas or HEF1 was subjected to an in vitrokinase assay in the absence (0) or presence of the remaining parts of immunoprecipitated Flag-RAFTK (+R) (Fig.2 B). As phosphorylated p130Cas and HEF1 comigrate with RAFTK, to enable their detection, proteins were eluted with SDS following in vitro kinase assays. p130Cas or HEF1 were then reimmunoprecipitated using antibody specific for each protein and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). As seen in Fig. 2 B (upper panel), the incubation of immunoprecipitated p130Cas or HEF1 with RAFTK led to prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Casand HEF1. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) or with anti-C/H antibody, which recognizes both p130Cas and HEF1 (Fig.2 B, lower panel), to confirm that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. To determine whether RAFTK was able to phosphorylate p130Cas and HEF1 in vivo, we performed co-transfections in Cos-7 cells of p130Cas (C) or HEF1 (H) with the vector encoding Flag-RAFTK (C/R or H/R) or with a vector Flag control (C/F or H/F). After 2 days, transfected p130Cas or HEF1 were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA or anti-HEF1 antibodies, respectively, and analyzed by Western blot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2 C(upper panels), co-transfection of RAFTK along with p130Cas or HEF1 led to the in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of the two proteins. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-C/H antibody to confirm that equivalent amounts of p130Cas and HEF1 proteins were loaded in each lane (Fig.2 C, lower panels). These results indicate that RAFTK participates in Cas and HEF1 phosphorylation in vitroand in vivo. It has been previously reported that the autophosphorylation site of FAK (Tyr397) interacts with the Src SH2 domain, thus recruiting Src kinase to phosphorylate p130Cas (24Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This tyrosine is conserved in RAFTK (Tyr402) and has also been shown to be a Src SH2 binding motif (11Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneide S. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). We compared the ability of wild type (WT) RAFTK, a Y402F RAFTK mutant, and a K457R RAFTK mutant that abolishes the RAFTK catalytic activity, to induce the phosphorylation of p130Cas and HEF1. Co-transfection experiments were performed in Cos-7 cells using p130Cas or HEF1 and each individual RAFTK construct (WT = R, Y402F =02, K457R = 57) or the vector-Flag alone (F). Transfected RAFTK (Fig.3 A), p130Cas or HEF1 (Fig. 3 B) were immunoprecipitated, using anti-Flag, anti-HA, or anti-HEF1 antibodies respectively, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The analysis by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine of the different Flag-RAFTK mutants showed that a basal RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation was observed with the WT RAFTK (C/R and H/R), whereas no basal phosphorylation was observed with the two mutants of RAFTK expressed in Cos-7 cells (Fig. 3 A). Reblotting of the membrane demonstrated that equivalent amounts of RAFTK proteins were expressed and immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3 A, lower panel, anti-Flag blot). As shown in Fig. 3 B, when compared with WT RAFTK, the RAFTK Y402F mutation markedly decreased p130Cas phosphorylation, and minimally affected HEF1 phosphorylation. Densitometric analysis indicated that the Tyr402 mutation led to an 80% decrease in p130Cas phosphorylation but only a 20% decrease in HEF1 phosphorylation. Although the anti-C/H antibody does not recognize hyperphosphorylated HEF1 in the H/R and H/02 lanes as well as the unphosphorylated protein in H/F or H/57 lanes, equivalent amounts of protein were observed in H/R and H/02 lanes. Therefore, mutation of the putative binding site of Src kinase markedly decreased the phosphorylation of p130Cas but affected only minimally the phosphorylation of HEF1. No phosphorylation of p130Cas or HEF1 was observed when either were co-transfected with the K457R mutant of RAFTK (Fig. 3 B, C/57 and H/57). This indicates that the kinase activity of RAFTK was required for p130Cas and HEF1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the kinase activity alone was sufficient for HEF1 phosphorylation but not necessarily for p130Cas. Since we observed a decreased phosphorylation of p130Cas in the presence of the Y402F RAFTK mutant, a binding site for Src kinases, we investigated whether tyrosine 402 of RAFTK recruited c-Src in Cos-7 cells. Cos-7 cells were transfected with the Flag-vector (F) or with the vector encoding each of the Flag-RAFTK proteins (WT = R, Y402F =02, K457R = 57) and lysed after 2 days. The cell lysates were divided into two aliquots, and c-Src or Flag-RAFTK were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig.4 A). WT RAFTK (R) was co-immunoprecipitated with c-Src, but not the Y402F (02) or the K457R (57) RAFTK mutants as shown by reblotting of the membrane with anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). Furthermore, in a reciprocal experiment, c-Src could also be detected in WT RAFTK immunoprecipitate, but not in the Y402F immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4 B, bottom panel, blot c-Src). Therefore, when expressed in Cos-7 cells, WT RAFTK co-immunoprecipitated with c-Src, and this binding required tyrosine 402. In an attempt to understand the differences in p130Cas and HEF1 phosphorylation, we investigated which domains of p130Cas or HEF1 were phosphorylated by RAFTK. Both proteins have a substrate domain which contains multiple YDXP Crk SH2 consensus binding motifs. The C-terminal domain of both p130Cas and HEF1 contains a YDYV Src SH2 consensus binding motif. GST fusion proteins containing the p130Cas or HEF1 substrate domain (SD) (Fig. 5) or the C-terminal domain (CT) (Fig.6) were used as substrates for RAFTK. Transfected WT RAFTK or mutated RAFTK were immunoprecipitated from Cos-7 cell lysates using anti-Flag antibody and mixed with the different GST fusion proteins as indicated (Figs. 5 and 6). A kinase assay was then performed on each sample for 30 min with (+) or without (−) ATP, and phosphorylation of the GST fusion proteins was assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 5, an increase in phosphorylation of WT RAFTK (R) (indicated with anarrow) was observed after the kinase assay, as has already been observed in Fig. 2. The Y402F mutant (02) was also phosphorylated in vitro, indicating that the tyrosine 402 is not the only site of in vitro autophosphorylation. However, no phosphorylation of the K457R mutant was observed. The SD domains of both p130Cas and HEF1 were tyrosine-phosphorylated when incubated with WT RAFTK. Similarly, the phosphorylation of the SD domains of p130Cas and HEF1 was unaffected by mutation of tyrosine 402. In contrast, no phosphorylation of GST SD of p130Cas or HEF1 was detected in the presence of the K457R RAFTK mutant with inactivated kinase activity. These data suggest that RAFTK directly phosphorylates the SD domain of p130Cas and HEF1.Figure 6RAFTK is involved in the phosphorylation of the C terminus portion of p130Cas but not of HEF1. GST fusion proteins containing the C terminus part of p130Cas(CT Cas/SB) or HEF1 (CT/HEF1) were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with (+) or without (−) ATP in presence of the wild-type RAFTK (R), the Y402F mutant (02), or the K457R mutant (57). Proteins were then analyzed by Western blot with anti-Tyr(P) (P-tyr) antibodies. The membrane was then stripped and reblotted with anti-Flag or anti-GST antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined the phosphorylation of the CT domain of p130Cas and HEF1 by RAFTK. In contrast to the SD domains of p130Cas and HEF1, only the CT domain of p130Cas(CT Cas/SB) was phosphorylated by RAFTK and no phosphorylation of the CT domain of HEF1 (CT HEF1) was observed (indicated by arrows) (Fig. 6). GST CT HEF1 did not comigrate with the Ig heavy chain, since we were able to detect the Ig chain above the GST fusion protein when the membrane was reprobed with anti-GST antibodies, as indicated in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the Y402F mutation of RAFTK decreased the phosphorylation of p130CasGST CT Cas/SB. This may account for the decrease in p130Cas-specific phosphorylation seen with the Tyr402 mutant observed in Fig. 2. This suggests that phosphorylation of the CT domain of p130Cas is dependent upon the presence of the tyrosine 402, and therefore likely involves a Src kinase. It also implies that despite an identical Src SH2 consensus sequence present in the C-terminal region of HEF1, the Src kinase is unable to phosphorylate this domain of HEF1. The previous results indicated that in vitro, Tyr402 in RAFTK was required to phosphorylate the CT domain of p130Cas. We investigated whether the in vivo phosphorylation of the CT region of p130Cas in vivo also required Tyr402. cDNAs encoding HA-tagged wild-type Cas or deletion mutants of Cas were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells with the Flag-vector (F) or the vector encoding the WT RAFTK (R) or the Y402F (02) and the K457R (57) mutants. Two deleted-Cas mutants were used (Fig. 1 B): Cas ΔSD, in which the sequence from amino acids 213 to 514 containing the substrate domain was deleted; and Cas ΔSB, in which the sequence from amino acids 638 to 889, containing the Src SH2 and SH3 binding motifs in the CT, was deleted (17Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Transfected Cas proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig.7 A). As shown previously, a decrease in WT Cas phosphorylation was observed with the Y402F RAFTK mutant, and no phosphorylation was observed with the RAFTK K457R mutant. Co-transfection of WT RAFTK and Cas ΔSD mutant led to the phosphorylation of the Cas mutant. The co-expression of the Cas ΔSD with the Y402F RAFTK led to a dramatic decrease of Cas ΔSD tyrosine phosphorylation. Therefore, Tyr402 is necessary for the phosphorylation of the CT domain of Cas in vivo, strongly supporting the involvement of a Src kinase. The co-transfection of the Cas ΔSB mutant with WT RAFTK led to the detection of a smear containing two discrete phosphorylated bands, probably corresponding to different levels of phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of the lower band corresponding to the Cas ΔSB mutant after reblotting with anti-Cas antibodies was not affected by the Y402F RAFTK mutation. The phosphorylation of the upper band was decreased in the presence of Tyr402 RAFTK mutant. Therefore we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the phosphorylation of Cas ΔSB was dependent upon the presence of a Src kinase. However, these results suggest that the SD domain phosphorylation was largely unaffected by the Tyr402 mutation. Comparable levels of expression of WT Cas and Cas mutants (Fig. 7 B) were obtained regardless of the co-transfection conditions. p130Cas is a major tyrosine phosphorylated substrate following integrin ligation in several cell types (24Vuori K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Following integrin stimulation of normal B cells and B cell lines corresponding to various stages of ontogeny, the Cas-like protein HEF1 is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate (14Manié S.N. Beck A.R.P. Astier A. Law S.F. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B.J. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N. Sattler M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Golemis E.A. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, in terminally differentiated B cell lines, p130Cas is also a prominent substrate after integrin stimulation. Therefore, these proteins are differentially phosphorylated in B cells, and probably mediate distinct functions. We previously showed that RAFTK, a tyrosine kinase with significant homology with the FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated after integrin or BCR stimulation in human B cells. In addition, RAFTK can associate with either HEF1 or p130Cas (8Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14Manié S.N. Beck A.R.P. Astier A. Law S.F. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B.J. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N.

In this report we observed that RAFTK is differentially involved in the phosphorylation of HEF1 and p130Cas. Our results suggest that, at least in COS-7 cells under the conditions used, RAFTK by itself appeared sufficient for HEF1 phosphorylation, whereas cooperation between RAFTK and Src kinases was required for the complete phosphorylation of p130Cas. In fibroblasts p130Cas phosphorylation has been reported to be mediated by Src kinases and that the autophosphorylation site of FAK (Tyr397) may act to recruit and/or activate a Src kinase (24Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p130Cas phosphorylation was reduced in fibroblasts lacking Src kinases but remained unaffected in fibroblasts lacking FAK (22Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Src kinases act as a “bridge” between p130Cas and FAK, since the expression of a mutated Src containing only the SH2 and SH3 domains but no catalytic domain, was able to restore the phosphorylation of p130Cas in Src− fibroblasts (30Schlaepfer D. Broome M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Similarly, our results suggest that one of the autophosphorylation sites of RAFTK, the tyrosine 402, recruits a Src kinase, c-Src in Cos-7 cells, that will phosphorylate the C-terminal part of p130Cas. Alternatively, the binding of Src kinase to Tyr402 in RAFTK could also lead to an enhanced kinase activity of RAFTK, as described for FAK (31Calalb M. Polte T. Hanks S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that the Src-mediated enhanced FAK/Cas association was observed in the absence of the autophosphorylation site of FAK and of the SH2 domain of Src kinase (32Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5501-5509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We found that RAFTK was still able to phosphorylate a Cas mutant lacking the C-terminal Src binding region. This result suggests that RAFTK could still directly phosphorylate Cas without binding via a Src kinase to the C-terminal Src binding region. A possible explanation for this is that RAFTK can bind to the SH3 domain of p130Cas (data not shown) through its SH3 binding motif. RAFTK was observed to be involved in the phosphorylation of the substrate domains of both Cas and HEF1, and this was dependent on the kinase activity of RAFTK. The phosphorylation of the substrate domains of p130Cas and HEF1 by RAFTK can then lead to their potential associations with Crk family members, allowing the propagation of the signals toward Ras activation (30Schlaepfer D. Broome M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Although we previously reported that Cas associated with RAFTK is mainly nonphosphorylated on tyrosine residues, following phosphorylation Cas and RAFTK may rapidly dissociate. In contrast, RAFTK appears to have a different role in the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of HEF1 and p130Cas. We found that RAFTK could not phosphorylate the YDYV motif present in the CT region of HEF1, whereas it phosphorylated the same motif in p130Cas. Although similar in the C-terminal region, HEF1 does not contain the Src SH3 binding motif present in the p130Cas C terminus (SB) region (13Law S. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The lack of Src SH3 binding motif in HEF1 might explain the inability of RAFTK, in association with a Src kinase, to phosphorylate the CT region. However, we could not exclude that the conformation of the CT HEF1 GST fusion protein folds in a way that makes the tyrosine inaccessible to the kinases. RAFTK has been shown to localize to focal contact-like structures in adherent megakaryocytic cell line CMK and in RAFTK-transfected COS cells adherent to fibronectin (26Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, one function of RAFTK may be to localize p130Cas and HEF1 to focal contacts. Optimal p130Cas and HEF1 phosphorylation requires an intact cytoskeleton, since inhibitors of cytoskeletal assembly also inhibit integrin-mediated p130Cas and HEF1 tyrosine phosphorylations (14Manié S.N. Beck A.R.P. Astier A. Law S.F. Canty T. Hirai H. Druker B.J. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N. Sattler M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Golemis E.A. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of HEF1 may require another interacting protein(s) despite the presence of RAFTK and Src kinases. The in vitro kinase assays performed with RAFTK suggested that the tyrosine 402 was not the only site of autophosphorylation of RAFTK, since an increase in phosphorylation was observed with the Y402F mutant. However, no basal phosphorylation of the Y402F mutant was observed in vivo in Cos-7 cells, indicating that the tyrosine 402 is probably the principal site of autophosphorylationin vivo. Furthermore, this tyrosine is the only site of binding for c-Src kinases, since no binding could be observed with the Y402F mutant. Therefore, Tyr402 is the major Src binding site present in RAFTK. Our results indicate a distinct role of RAFTK in the differential phosphorylation of HEF1and p130Cas. Both HEF1 and p130Cas are expressed in normal and neoplastic B cells and most B cell lines. HEF1 is the major phosphorylated substrate in normal tonsillar B cells and most B cell lines, whereas Cas is the predominant substrate which is phosphorylated in terminally differentiated B cell lines following β1 integrin ligation. Moreover, HEF1 is also phosphorylated following BCR ligation, whereas p130Cas is minimally phosphorylated. RAFTK is also phosphorylated following both β1 integrin and BCR stimulation. The finding that RAFTK has a direct role in p130Cas and HEF1 phosphorylation might allow a better understanding of these distinct signaling pathways, and further insights into the potential cross-talk that has been observed between integrin and antigen receptor signaling. We greatly appreciate Dr. Andreas Beck for helping in preparing p130Cas constructs. We also thank Dr. Bernard Mari for helpful discussions.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) 1The abbreviations used are: PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; E1, pyruvate decarboxylase; E2, dihydrolipoamide transacetylase; E3, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; E3BP, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEG, polyethylene glycol. catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate with the formation of CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH. The eukaryotic complex has 30 copies of a tetrameric (α2β2) pyruvate decarboxylase (E1) component noncovalently bound along the edges of an icosahedral 60 meric dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) core (1Reed L.J. Hackert M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twelve copies of a homodimeric dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) component are believed held on the faces of the E2 core by a corresponding number of monomeric E3-binding proteins (protein X, E3BP) (2Sanderson S.Y.

With the exception of E3BP, the role of each enzymatic component in the overall reaction catalyzed by the complex is basically understood. E1 catalyzes a thiamine diphosphate-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and the reductive acetylation of a lipoyl residue covalently attached to the lipoyl domain of E2. E2 then catalyzes transfer of the acetyl group to coenzyme A, leaving a reduced E2 lipoyl group that the E3 component uses as an electron source for FAD-dependent reduction of NAD+ to NADH.

Its function was difficult to establish in early studies because of a very tight association with the E2 core of the complex. Very elegant limited proteolysis and immunological studies (12Powers-Greenwood S.L. Rahmatullah M. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

Commun. 1989; 160: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) provided the first evidence that protein X contributes to the binding and function of E3. Cloning of the E3BP gene ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (14Behal R.H. Browning K.S. Hall T.B. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8732-8736Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) revealed a protein structure that resembles the E2 component of yeast in its amino terminus but not the remainder of the molecule. Subsequent gene disruption studies provided definitive proof that protein X should be considered an E3-binding protein (15Lawson J.E. Behal R.H. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2834-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Questions left unsettled included whether mammalian E3BP is completely analogous to yeast E3BP, whether the lipoyl moiety of mammalian E3BP is functionally important for catalytic activity of the complex, and whether the inner core of the mammalian E3BP has transacetylase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence for the first mammalian (human) E3BP is presented here. Although similar in their amino-terminal, lipoyl-bearing domains, the mammalian E3BP and the yeast E3BP are markedly different in their carboxyl-terminal regions. Indeed, the human E3BP is more homologous to mammalian E2 throughout its primary sequence than it is to yeast E3BP. Previous evidence that the mammalian E3BP contains only a single lipoyl domain in its amino terminus (8Neagle J. De Marcucci O. Dunbar B. Lindsay J.G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), rather than the two tandemly arranged lipoyl domains characteristic of mammalian E2, is confirmed. The active site histidine residue characteristic of transacetylases of all α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes is not conserved in the mammalian E3BP. Two clones found by searching of the expressed sequence tag data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) were analyzed in this study. H58032 was identified by the presence of sequence encoding for the amino-terminal peptide of E3BP, and T77385was identified by a sequence encoding an internal peptide of E3BP. The cDNA of H58032 in pT7/T3 vector is 2,335 base pairs long; the cDNA of T77385 in Lamfid vector is 1,965 base pairs long. Sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNA was done by the Biochemistry Biotechnology Facility (Indiana University) using Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, (Perkin-Elmer) following manufacturer instructions. Both strands were sequenced. To remove the mitochondrial targeting sequence and 3′-non-coding region from the cDNA for the human E2 component (kindly provided as a generous gift by Dr. Mulchand Patel, SUNY at Buffalo, NY), NdeI and XhoI sites flanking the coding region were created by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) withPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The sense/antisense PCR primers correspond to bases 163–190 and 1827–1850 of human E2 cDNA (CAT ATG AGT CTT CCC CCG CAT CAG AAG GTT CC(A/C)TC GAG AGT TAC AAC AAC ATA GTG ATA GGT). The sequence coding for NdeI restriction site was added to sense primer, whereas the sequence coding for XhoI site was added to antisense primer (underlined). The respectiveNdeI/XhoI fragment was subcloned betweenNdeI and XhoI sites of pET-23a expression vector (Novagen) (plasmid PDHE223a). The fidelity of constructs was established by nucleotide sequencing. The expression cassette for human E2 (carrying T7 promoter, ribosome-binding site, cDNA for E2 component, and T7 terminator) was cut from pPDHE223a with BglII andNaeI. Resulting DNA was purified, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into the pACYC vector (New England Biolabs) cut with HindIII and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase (plasmid PDHE2). Plasmids were transformed into competent TG-1 cells. Transformants were selected on YT agar plates containing 35 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. Colonies that expressed chloramphenicol resistance were screened for the presence of inserts by PCR with the above primers. NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites flanking the coding region of E3BP cDNA were constructed by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase. The sense, NcoI containing, primer (TGG CCC ATG GGT GAT CCC ATT AAG ATA CTA ATG) corresponds to bases 168–191 of the E3BP cDNA. Antisense primer (CTT GAA TTC CTA GGC AAG TCG GAT AGG ATT CT) corresponds to bases 1492–1514 of the E3BP cDNA and contains anEcoRI restriction site. Resulting cDNA of approximately 1.3 kilobases was digested with NcoI/EcoRI and ligated between NcoI/EcoRI site of bacterial expression vector pET-28a (Novagen) (plasmid PDHE3BP28a). pPDHE3BP28a was digested with DraIII/SphI to obtain an E3BP expression cassette. This DNA was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into pPDHE2 plasmid cut with BamHI and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase (plasmid PDHE2/E3BP). Resulting plasmids were transformed into competent TG-1 cells. Transformants were selected on TY agar containing chloramphenicol. Plasmids carrying both cDNAs were identified by PCR. Construction of the bacterial expression vector for E1component of PDC (plasmid PDHE1) has been described elsewhere (16Jeng J. Huh T.-L. Song B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Competent BL21(DE2) cells obtained from Novagen were transformed with pPDHE2 or pPDHE2/E3BP plasmids. Transformants were selected on TY agar plates containing 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Several colonies displaying antibiotic resistance were tested for their ability to express recombinant polypeptides and were used to prepare glycerol stocks. For expression experiments, 10 μl of glycerol stock (pPDHE1 was transformed in BL21(DE3)pLys cells) was inoculated into 1 liter of M9ZB medium supplemented with 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol or 100 μg/ml ampicillin for pPDHE2/E3BP and pPDHE1 plasmids, respectively. The cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C until theA 600 reached 0.6–0.7. At this point, the cultures were shifted to room temperature. After temperature equilibration, cultures were supplemented with 50 μg/ml thiamin for pPDHE1 or 0.2 mm lipoic acid for pPDHE2/E3BP and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside. Cells were cultured for another 20–24 h at room temperature and then harvested. Harvested cells were resuspended in 75 ml of buffer A (50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm KCl) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm benzamidine, 1% aprotinin). Cells were sonicated five times for 15 s on ice with 1-min intervals. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 ×g for 20 min. Clear extracts containing E1 and either E2 or E2·E3BP subcomplexes were combined and recombinant proteins were precipitated with 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, Sigma)-8000 at 4 °C for 20 min. This 12% PEG pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and applied on a Sepharose 4B column (bed volume, 500 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer. Column fractions (5 ml) were assayed by PDC activity and Western blot analysis. Pooled fractions containing human PDC components were centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 10–12 h. Precipitated PDC was resuspended in a small volume of buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors and stored at −70 °C. Activity of PDC was assayed by the reduction of NAD+ to NADH as described previously (17Popov K.M. Shimomura Y. Harris R.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Five units of porcine dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Sigma) and 0.5 mm pyruvate were used in the assay. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Procedure for Northern analysis was as described elsewhere (19Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human heart poly(A)+ RNA was obtained from CLONTECH. Protein was determined according to Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Two of these clones (H58032 and T77385) were sequenced and found identical to one another except that T77385 is 370 base pairs shorter at its 5′ end. Clone H58032 has an open reading frame of 1503 base pairs that encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 54,085 (Fig. 1). Evidence that this cDNA encodes E3BP is provided by a comparison of the deduced protein sequence with the previously published (7Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S. Andrews P.C. Chang C.L. Radke G.A.

Although no previous data for the human protein are available in the literature, the almost perfect match (45 of 50 residues) with the bovine protein indicates that the cDNA obtained in this study encodes human E3BP. Based on the amino-terminal sequence of 22 amino acids published previously for bovine heart E3BP (Table I), the mature form of E3BP is assumed to start after a 53-amino acid presequence that has numerous Arg, Ser, and Leu residues arranged in an order consistent with other mitochondrial targeting sequences (21Von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The assignment of where the mature protein begins is provisional, however, because the mature native human protein has not been subjected to direct amino acid sequencing and there is disagreement in the literature as to whether the amino terminus of the bovine protein is free or blocked (7Rahmatullah M.

If it is assumed that mature E3BP of human starts at the same residue found for the bovine heart protein, the human mature protein has 448 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 48,040, in reasonably good agreement with the molecular weight of 50,000 estimated by SDS-PAGE (4De Marcucci O.

Open table in a new tab Northern blot analysis of human heart poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) using 32P-labeled cDNA for E3BP as a probe revealed a single hybridizing message of approximately 2.7 kilobases (data not shown), indicating cDNA of clone H58032 is almost complete. The DNA sequence encoding this message is located on chromosome 11 in the region p12–13 (National Center for Biotechnology Information Human Gene Map). It is interesting that the human E2 gene has also been mapped to chromosome 11 but in a region (q21–23) far removed from that of the E3BP gene. Lack of any long stretches of identical nucleotide (not shown) and amino acid sequences (presented and discussed below) in E2and E3BP also indicates that different genes encode these proteins. E3BP is an essential component of PDC because it positions E3 to accept electrons from the reduced lipoyl group of the E2 component (12Powers-Greenwood S.L. Rahmatullah M. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3655-3657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gopalkrishnan S. Rahmatullah M. Radke G.A. Powers-Greenwood S. Roche T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Lawson J.E. Behal R.H. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2834-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since the only function of E3BP may be to anchor E3 to the complex and E3BP may not have an intrinsic catalytic activity of its own, proof that the cDNA characterized in this study encodes E3BP would best be provided by reconstitution of the overall reaction catalyzed by PDC. Without the presence of E3BP as an integral component of the complex, the enzymatic activity of the complex for its complete reaction (pyruvate + NAD+ + CoA → acetyl-CoA + NADH + CO2) would be expected to be very low for want of high affinity binding of E3 to the complex. With E3BP present in the complex, E3 should bind and reconstitute PDC with a high specific activity. The mammalian PDC consists of three single enzyme subcomplexes capable of self-assembly: 1) E1 subcomplex (tetramer of two E1α and two E1β subunits); 2) E2·E3BP subcomplex (consists of 60 copies of E2 and 12 copies of E3BP); and 3) E3 subcomplex (dimer of two identical subunits). This modular organization allows for independent expression of the different single enzyme subcomplexes, which can then be mixed for reconstitution of the multienzyme complex. We took advantage of this fact, generating the catalytically active E1 subcomplex by co-expression of cDNAs for E1α and E1β subunits and independently generating the catalytically active dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase or E2·E3BP subcomplex by co-expression of cDNAs for E2 and E3BP. For comparison purposes, the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase component lacking E3BP was obtained by expression of the cDNA for E2 alone. The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase subcomplex from porcine heart is commercially available in excellent purity, making its expression for the reconstitution studies unnecessary. Reconstitution of the PDC was achieved by mixing extracts of E. coli in which the E1 subcomplex had been expressed with extracts of E. coli in which either the E2·E3BP complex or E2 alone subcomplex had been expressed. Reaction mixtures containing expressed E1 alone plus porcine E3, expressed E2·E3BP alone plus porcine E3, or expressed E2 alone plus porcine E3 did not show PDC activity above that due to the native bacterial enzyme activity present in these extracts (Fig. 2). However, combining extracts containing E1 and E2·E3BP in a reaction cocktail containing porcine E3 reconstituted the mammalian PDC as evidenced by a more than 3-fold increase in activity above that of the native bacterial enzyme activity (Fig. 2). Combining extracts containing E1 with extracts containing E2 but lacking E3BP in a reaction mixture containing the same amount of porcine E3 resulted in no increase in PDC activity, showing that the cDNA encodes for E3BP and confirming its requirement for the reaction catalyzed by the complex. To establish whether E3BP physically associates with other components of the PDC, extracts of E. coli containing the different recombinant proteins were combined to reconstitute subcomplexes with and without E3BP. The E1·E2·E3BP subcomplex, produced by combining extracts containing E1 and E2·E3BP, and the E1·E2 subcomplex, produced by combining extracts containing E1 and E2, were then partially purified by PEG precipitation and gel filtration on Sepharose 4B. Both subcomplexes eluted from the gel filtration column as large aggregates right after the void volume, indicative of assembly of macromolecular complexes from the components (data not shown). The isolated E1·E2·E3BP subcomplex added to a reaction mixture containing porcine E3 exhibited a specific enzyme activity of 12 units/mg of protein. This value is lower but still quite respectable relative to previously reported specific activities (18–23 units/mg of protein) for native bovine enzymes (23Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), particularly since the subcomplex was only partially purified. Incomplete lipoylation of the E2 component could also be a contributing factor. In contrast to the high activity of the E1·E2·E3BP subcomplex, the isolated E1·E2 subcomplex had a much lower specific activity (<0.8 units/mg of protein) when assayed under the same conditions. SDS-PAGE analysis of the respective preparations revealed that the catalytically active subcomplex contains predominant protein bands corresponding to the molecular weights of E1α, E1β, E2, and E3BP (Fig. 3). In contrast, the much less active subcomplex obtained by expression of the E2 cDNA without E3BP cDNA lacks the protein corresponding to E3BP. These findings provide evidence that the E3BP is physically associated with E2 and confirm that it is required for PDC activity. Analysis of the human E3BP amino acid sequence indicates a structure quite similar to human E2, i.e. a segmented domain structure joined by linker regions rich in alanine and proline residues (Fig.4 A). Overall sequence identity is 43% for the two proteins. One difference is that E3BP has one putative lipoyl-bearing domain in its amino-terminal region rather than the two tandemly repeated lipoyl-bearing domains present in E2. Residues 4–83 of E3BP exhibit 44% sequence identity with the first lipoyl-bearing domain and 46% identity with the second lipoyl-bearing domain of E2 (Fig.4 B). Thus, the alignment can be made with either lipoyl-bearing domain, but because of the slightly greater degree of homology, the E3BP sequence has been aligned in Fig. 4 with the second lipoyl-bearing domain of E2. That E3BP should have a lipoyllysine residue in its amino-terminal region is expected from several previous studies demonstrating acetylation of this protein upon incubation of PDC with either radioactive pyruvate or acetyl-CoA (4De Marcucci O. Lindsay J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Jilka J.M. Rahmatullah M. Kazemi M. Roche R.E. J. Biol.

Lipoyllysine residues are typically found to occur 43–44 residues from the amino terminus of mammalian E2 proteins (26Lau K.S. Griffin C.-W. Hu C. Chuang D.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1972-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A lysine residue is located at assigned position 44 in the deduced sequence of mature E3BP, and this lysine occurs in a typical consensus sequence for a lipoyl-attachment site (branched chain residue-Glu-Ser/Thr-Asp-Lys-Ala-Xaa-branched chain residue) (26Lau K.S. Griffin C.-W. Hu C. Chuang D.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1972-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and is, therefore, highly likely to be the site of lipoylation. The existence of a glycine at position 55 is of significance because of recent evidence that a glycine residue situated 11 residues to the carboxyl-terminal side of a lipoylation site is required for lipoylation of E2 by lipoyltransferases (27Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12932-12936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Human E3BP also has an internal region that exhibits considerable sequence identity with the putative E1/E3-binding domain (28Thekkumkara T.J. Pons G. Mitroo S. Jentoff J.E. Patel M.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) of human E2 (Fig. 4 B), a relationship pointed out previously by Sanderson et al. (10Sanderson S.J. Khan S.S. McCartney R.G. Miller C. Lindsay J.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in their analysis of the first 23 amino-terminal residues of an Arg C proteolytic fragment of bovine E3BP. Thirty-eight percent sequence identity occurs in this domain (E2 residues 271 to 303 versusE3BP residues 131 to 163) where E1 is believed to bind to E2 and where E3 most likely binds to E3BP. Further support that E3 binds in this region to E3BP is provided by considerable sequence identity with E3-binding domains of the E2components of human branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (30%) (26Lau K.S. Griffin C.-W. Hu C. Chuang D.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1972-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Hummel K.B. Litwer S. Bradford A.P. Aitken A. Danner D.J. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6165-6168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and E. coli α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (50%) (30Packman L.C. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the protease Arg C cleavage site of E3BP (7Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S. Andrews P.C. Chang C.L. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2221-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sanderson S.J. Khan S.S. McCartney R.G. Miller C. Lindsay J.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) is located adjacent to the amino-terminal side of the E1/E3 binding-domain (Fig. 4 B). This is consistent with the previous suggestion of Sanderson et al. (10Sanderson S.J. Khan S.S. McCartney R.G. Miller C. Lindsay J.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that exposure of this domain with disruption of its structure most likely accounts for loss of E3 binding upon cleavage of E3BP at the Arg C proteolytic site (7Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S. Andrews P.C. Chang C.L. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2221-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal regions of E3BP and E2are remarkably similar (Fig. 4 B). This is the inner core domain of E2 where acetyl transferase activity as well as the self-assembly sequences are located. These proteins share 50% sequence identity in this region, beginning with residues 221 and 334 of E3BP and E2, respectively, and extending to their carboxyl termini. The carboxyl-terminal region of human E3BP lacks the highly conserved histidine residue found in the active site motif of all dihydrolipoamide acyltransferases. This histidine residue is invariably present in the highly conserved sequence of DHRXXDG in proteins with acyltransferase activity (31Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C.E. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Russell G.C. Machado R.S. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Griffin T.A.

The corresponding sequence in human E3BP is DSRXXDD (residues 221 to 226; Fig. 4 B). Thus, the active site histidine is replaced by a serine residue, and the carboxyl-terminal aspartate of the motif is replaced by a glycine residue, making it unlikely that this protein possesses acetyltransferase activity. Based on a comparison of the primary sequences E2 of different species, two domains (residues 428 to 440 and 462 to 483) within the carboxyl-terminal region of E2 have been proposed involved in homo- and hetero-subunit interactions (28Thekkumkara T.J. Pons G. Mitroo S. Jentoff J.E. Patel M.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although not established that these domains are interaction sites between E2 subunits, it is interesting to note that 9 of 13 residues in the first domain and 17 of 22 residues in the second are identical in E3BP and E2.The hinge regions separating the three major segments of E3BP and E2 show the least sequence identity (15%) of any region of these proteins (Fig. 4 B). The hinge of E2 that connects lipoyl-bearing domain 2 with the peripheral subunit binding domain is rich in both proline and alanine residues. The corresponding region of E3BP is rich in proline but contains no alanine residues. Collagenase specifically cleaves within this hinge of E2 because it contains an amino acid sequence (PAGP) recognized by this protease. Absence of this sequence from the hinge of E3BP prevents cleavage by collagenase, accounting for the specific removal of lipoyl-bearing domains from E2 by collagenase digestion of the PDC (35Rahmatullah M. Radke G.A. Andrews P.C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14512-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hinge separating the E1/E3-binding domain from the inner core is rich in proline and alanine residues in both proteins, but this domain is 28 residues longer in E3BP and consequently has many more proline and alanine residues in this region than E2. Lipoyl-bearing proteins have invariably been found to migrate on SDS-PAGE gels with aberrantly high molecular weights (29Hummel K.B. Litwer S. Bradford A.P. Aitken A. Danner D.J. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6165-6168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Spencer M.E. Darlison M.G. Stephens P.E. Duckenfield I.K. Guest J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a feature attributed to an extended region of helical structure due to domains rich in alanine and proline residues (37Guest J.R. Lewis H.M. Graham L.D. Packman L.C. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is not apparent why this disparity between SDS-PAGE-estimated molecular weight (50,000) and amino acid content-calculated molecular weight (48,040) is not observed for E3BP. The human E3BP shows significant sequence similarity to the yeast E3BP only in amino-terminal, lipoyl-bearing domains of these proteins (49% identity between residues 4–83) (Fig. 4 B). In this region, both proteins have the signature motif of a lipoyl-bearing domain as discussed above in the sequence comparison with E2. Beyond residue 83, however, very little sequence similarity is found for these proteins that have been assigned a similar function in their respective complexes. The yeast protein lacks a well defined proline-alanine-rich domain that would readily identify a hinge region. On the other hand, a short sequence exists between residues 166 and 175 that has significant homology to sequences within the E1/E3-binding domains of human E2 and E3BP. Conservation of this sequence in both the human and the yeast forms of E3BP suggests this motif may be particularly important for E3binding. However, it is known that E3-deficient PDC from beef heart cannot be reconstituted with yeast E3 (10Sanderson S.J. Khan S.S. McCartney R.G. Miller C. Lindsay J.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a finding that presumably reflects poor binding of yeast E3to the mammalian E3BP as a consequence of marked differences in sequence and therefore structure of the E3-binding domains of yeast and mammalian E3-binding proteins. The carboxyl-terminal region of yeast E3BP shows no sequence similarity with either human E2 or E3BP (Fig. 4 B). The active site motif DHRXXDG characteristic of dihydrolipoamide acyltransferases is not present in yeast E3BP, and no evidence has been presented for acyltransferase activity with either the native or recombinant proteins (38Maeng C.-Y. Yazdi M.A. Niu X.-D. Lee H.Y. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13801-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Maeng C.-Y. Yazdi M.A. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5879-5882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remarkable differences between yeast E3BP and mammalian E3BP coupled with the remarkable similarity between mammalian E2 and mammalian E3BP raise interesting questions, not the least of which is whether anchoring E3 to E2 is the only function of mammalian E3BP. We are particularly interested in a possible role for this protein in mediating regulation of the activity of the various isoenzymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase that have been discovered recently (19Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gudi R. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Popov K.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2312493610,"Overexpression of many growth factor receptors, as well as growth factors, has been shown to confer varying degrees of estrogen-independent growth on estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cells. The proto-oncogene Raf-1 is a key intermediate in the signal transduction pathway of many of these growth factor receptors, and when constitutively activated in fibroblasts is transforming. To examine the effects of Raf-1 kinase activity on the estrogen-dependent growth of human breast cancer cells, ER + MCF-7 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with an expression construct directing the expression of an amino-truncated protein having constitutive kinase activity. Expression of constitutively activated Raf in MCF-7 cells is incompatible with growth in the presence of estrogen; that is, cells down-regulate expression of the transfected Raf. Constitutive Raf activity does allow for growth of the cells in the absence of estrogen, suggesting that activation of growth factor signaling pathways through Raf may confer a selective advantage for growth of breast cancer cells under estrogen-deprived conditions. In addition, the high levels of Raf activity induce apoptosis in cells grown under either condition. This is a novel activity for Raf, and may occur because the levels of the constitutive Raf are extremely high in these cells."

To understand how these processes occur, we have begun to map functional domains of a dynein heavy chain from Dictyostelium. The carboxyl-terminal 10-kilobase region of the heavy chain encodes a 380-kDa polypeptide that approximates the globular head domain. Attempts to further truncate this region fail to produce polypeptides that either bind microtubules or UV-vanadate cleave, indicating that the entire 10-kilobase fragment is necessary to produce a properly folded functional dynein head. We have further identified a region just downstream from the fourth P-loop that appears to constitute at least part of the microtubule-binding domain (amino acids 3182–3818). When deleted, the resulting head domain polypeptide no longer binds microtubules; when the excised region is expressed in vitro, it cosediments with added tubulin polymer. This microtubule-binding domain falls within an area of the molecule predicted to form extended α-helices. At least four discrete sites appear to coordinate activities required to bind the tubulin polymer, indicating that the interaction of dynein with microtubules is complex.

We have further identified a region just downstream from the fourth P-loop that appears to constitute at least part of the microtubule-binding domain (amino acids 3182–3818). When deleted, the resulting head domain polypeptide no longer binds microtubules; when the excised region is expressed in vitro, it cosediments with added tubulin polymer. This microtubule-binding domain falls within an area of the molecule predicted to form extended α-helices. At least four discrete sites appear to coordinate activities required to bind the tubulin polymer, indicating that the interaction of dynein with microtubules is complex. In eukaryotic cells, dynein is a ubiquitous high molecular mass ATPase that moves organelles and other cellular cargo toward the minus ends of microtubules (1Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Schroer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The globular head domain, largely encoded by the dynein heavy chain (DHC) 1The abbreviations used are: DHC, dynein heavy chain; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HSS, high speed supernatant(s). 1The abbreviations used are: DHC, dynein heavy chain; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HSS, high speed supernatant(s). gene, couples ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding to generate conformational changes that provide force for this movement (3Warner, F. D., Satir, P., and Gibbons, I. R. (eds) (1989) Cell Movement. Vol 1: The Dynein ATPases, Alan R. Liss, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Within the DHC, four P-loop motifs partially identify sites for nucleotide binding. The first of these motifs is highly conserved among cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins and represents the major ATP catalytic site for force production (1Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 4Gibbons I.R. Gibbons B.H. Mocz G. Asai D. Nature. 1991; 352: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 5Ogawa K.

The other three P-loops likely bind nucleotide (8Mocz G. Gibbons I.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9204-9211Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but their contribution to the mechanochemical cycle of dynein is so far unknown. The region of the heavy chain responsible for microtubule binding has not yet been identified. A conventional mapping strategy produces increasingly smaller fragments and tests these for relevant activity in vitro or in vivo. However, soluble expression of reasonably sized DHC fragments (i.e. >100 kDa) in prokaryotic systems is problematic. Even eukaryotic expression is not straightforward. Because the DHC provides an essential function in some organisms and activities (9Eshel D. Urrestarazu L.A. Vissers S. Jauniaux J.-C. van Vliet-Reedijk J.C. Planta R.J. Gibbons I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For both kinesin and myosin motors, the regions believed to interact with their respective filaments are located fairly close to the catalytic P-loop (17Yang J.T. Laymon R.A. Goldstein L.S.B. Cell. 1989; 56: 879-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 18Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A.

Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It is possible that dynein follows a similar design with a single microtubule binding domain near the primary P-loop. We previously characterized the in situ expression of a 107-kDa fragment of the DHC that contained the first two P-loop motifs (21Koonce M.P. Samso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although a small amount of polypeptide appeared to cosediment with microtubules when analyzed by immunoblots, this was substantially less than the native heavy chain and clearly does not represent a native binding activity. This argues that the nucleotide-sensitive interaction of dynein with microtubules is not self-contained within a simple region flanking the first P-loop. Alternatively, there may be weak affinities associated with each of the four P-loop motifs, and microtubule binding is a cooperative effort involving multiple regions. Finally, the microtubule-binding domain may be located elsewhere in the globular head. An important prerequisite for its placement is that binding must be mechanically coupled to ATP catalysis to allow for cyclical on/off interactions. We describe here efforts to express a series of DHC gene constructs inDictyostelium. This work roughly defines a minimal functional unit for the dynein motor domain. We further demonstrate that a region centered around a predicted two-part α-helical domain of the heavy chain, just downstream of the fourth P-loop, is able to bind microtubules in vitro. When this domain is deleted, a dynein head fragment expressed in vivo no longer interacts with microtubules and loses its ability to undergo a UV-vanadate cleavage reaction. The sequence encoding this motif is complex and may require substantial secondary structure for its activity. This work identifies an important structural domain of dynein and links this activity to ATP hydrolysis. Most of the molecular manipulations and culture conditions have been previously described (21Koonce M.P. Samso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Koonce M.P. Grissom P.G. Lyon M. Pope T. McIntosh J.R. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, fragments of the dynein heavy chain gene fromDictyostelium were ligated between the DHC promoter and an actin 8 transcriptional terminator on a plasmid containing a G418 resistance marker. Constructs were introduced into AX-2Dictyostelium cells by CaPO4 precipitation of supercoiled plasmid DNA (23Knecht D.A. Jung J. Matthews L.R. Dev.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Colonies were selected for growth in 10 μg/ml G418 and cloned as described previously (21Koonce M.P. Samso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Generation of Dictyosteliumhigh speed supernatants, microtubule affinity, UV cleavage, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described in Ref.25Koonce M.P. McIntosh J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1990; 15: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. Bovine tubulin was isolated and purified essentially as described in Refs. 26Weingarten M.D. Suter M.M. Littman D.R.

For in vitroexpression, an initial EcoRI fragment of the DHC gene (encoding amino acids 3182–3679) and several subfragments were cloned into the pET 5 series of expression vectors (28Studier F.W. Rosenerg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar), just downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase binding site. Products were expressed in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). 50-μl reaction mixtures were assembled following the manufacturer's instructions, using [35S]methionine to visualize newly synthesized polypeptides. After a 75-min synthesis at 30 °C, samples were diluted 5–10-fold with PMEG buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.9 m glycerol) and clarified at 80,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor. Supernatants were removed and either supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml taxol-stabilized tubulin or an equivalent volume of PMEG/taxol buffer for a precipitation control. In two sets of experiments, additional samples were incubated with approximately 0.4 mg/ml of purified actin. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were underlaid with an equal amount of 20% sucrose in PMEG/taxol and spun again. Supernatant and pellet fractions were saved and electrophoresed on 12.5% acrylamide gels. After destaining, the gels were incubated in Amplify (Amersham Corp.), dried, and exposed to film. The Dictyostelium DHC encodes an open reading frame of 4725 amino acids (6Koonce M.P. Grissom P.M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Previous work showed that a 380-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment corresponds to a single globular head (21Koonce M.P. Samso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This fragment binds to microtubules in an ATP-sensitive fashion indistinguishable from native dynein and undergoes a UV-vanadate cleavage, a reaction diagnostic for dynein and for a structurally active ATP catalytic domain (29Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz C.G. Phillipson A. Tang W.-J.Y. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite using the same general construct design and following identical transformation and cloning procedures, efforts to express smaller units of the mechanochemical head in Dictyostelium had mixed results. As shown in Fig. 1, some constructs express quite well, whereas others do not. Partial head domains that encode the central region are problematic. In general, these correlate with poor transformation efficiencies and fail to produce detectable product. Only the 270-kDa plasmid expresses a polypeptide of predicted molecular mass, albeit at a level significantly less than the native heavy chain. In contrast, transformation efficiencies are consistently good for plasmids that lack the central head region (107, 115, and 318 kDa), and cells produce a robust amount of material. However, none of these partial head domain fragments show good microtubule binding or UV-vanadate cleavage (Fig. 2 and data not shown).Figure 1Dynein heavy chain expression inDictyostelium. A, schematic representation of DHC fragments introduced into Dictyostelium. For comparison, the full-length native gene is included at the top. The detected levels of expression relative to native dynein and their ability to cosediment with microtubules are noted on theright. The black boxes labeled P1-P4 mark the positions of the four P-loops. The two extended α-helical regions downstream from the fourth P-loop are also noted. B, immunoblot analysis of expressed fragments. Dictyosteliumhigh speed supernatants were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with DHC antibodies. The numbers above the lanes represent the predicted molecular mass product of the expression construct in each cell clone. The 380-, 318-, and 107-kDa polypeptides were probed with an affinity purified antibody raised against a 78-kDa fragment of the DHC encompassing the first two P-loops (11Vaisberg E.A. Koonce M.P. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The 270- and 115-kDa polypeptides were visualized by an antibody that recognizes a motif in the first 12 amino acids of the heavy chain (6Koonce M.P. Grissom P.M. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), a sequence preserved in both of these constructs. This antibody also recognizes a prominent unknown band at approximately 125 kDa. Because this 125-kDa band is present in wild type cells, it is not an artifact due to transformation or ectopic expression of dynein fragments. The position of the native 540-kDa dynein heavy chain is indicated at the left with an arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Characterization of the 318-kDa polypeptide from Dictyostelium. Lanes 1 and 2show Coomassie Blue-stained high speed supernatants (HSS) from wild type AX-2 cells and a clone expressing the 318-kDa construct, respectively. The 318-kDa band is marked with asterisks.Lanes 3 and 4 show pellet and supernatant fractions following microtubule incubation and ATP extraction in the 318-kDa HSS. Although the native DHC is substantially enriched by this procedure, little or none of the 318 kDa appears in the microtubule pellet or ATP extract. For comparison, lanes 5 and6 show an equivalent HSS and ATP extract from cells expressing the 380-kDa head domain fragment. The 380-kDa polypeptide is marked with asterisks in lane 5. Molecular masses are noted on the left; the native DHC position is also marked with an arrowhead. Lanes 7 and8 show an immunoblot of 318 kDa HSS supplemented with 1 mm ATP and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The HSS was evenly divided. Lane 7 shows the unirradiated aliquot;lane 8 shows the sample after irradiation with 365-nm UV light for 60 min. The native DHC (arrowhead on theleft) nearly disappears following irradiation, indicating cleavage. A faint band representing the native lower molecular mass cleavage product can be detected (arrowhead on theright). The higher molecular mass cleavage product would be obscured by the 318-kDa band. The 318-kDa product is not appreciable altered by the UV light, and no new cleavage products can be detected that would indicate breakage of the polypeptide backbone at the V-1 cleavage site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inability to produce some DHC fragments suggests that these polypeptides are either unstable or toxic. None of the head domain fragments that do express well show substantial dynein-like activity. Therefore it seems reasonable to predict that the difference between these two sets of constructs (i.e. the central head region) contains an activity important for dynein's structure or function. AnSphI restriction digest of the DHC gene removes an in-frame 1.6-kilobase fragment of sequence (amino acids 3105–3643) within this region. This excised segment encodes a structurally unique region of the heavy chain, containing two predicted α-helical motifs. Fig. 2shows that AX-2 cells transformed with the 380KΔSph construct abundantly produce the 318-kDa polypeptide. However, unlike either native dynein or the 380-kDa head domain fragment, this 318-kDa polypeptide does not cosediment with microtubules in binding assays and fails to cleave in the presence of UV light and vanadate, indicating that the ATP catalytic site is no longer active. Deletion of this 1.6-kilobase fragment from the DHC gene could sufficiently perturb secondary structure to affect a microtubule-binding domain located elsewhere in the DHC sequence. Although we cannot rigorously exclude this possibility, we can demonstrate in vitro that the excised fragment encodes a microtubule binding activity. Figs. 3 and4 summarize this in vitro expression work. A 1.5-kilobase construct encoding 57 kDa was expressed in a reticulocyte lysate and then incubated with purified bovine microtubules. The resulting polypeptide pelleted through a sucrose cushion in the presence of microtubules but not appreciably in their absence, suggesting it binds to the taxol-stabilized polymer. Polypeptides encoded by the helix-1 domain (20 kDa), the central region (30 kDa), or the helix-2 domain (24 kDa) did not appreciably pellet in this assay. However, combining helix-1 + the central region (43 kDa), helix-2 + the central region (44 kDa), or helix 1 + 2 (lacking the central region, 39 and 45 kDa) substantially increased this binding activity. The region just downstream from helix 2 (16 kDa) also showed a weak affinity for microtubules. Combining the 16-kDa fragment with helix-2 (40 kDa) and with helix-2 + the central region (60 kDa) produced polypeptides with progressively greater binding activity. The buffer alone control presented for each construct indicates that pelleting is not merely due to protein aggregation. However, because tubulin is an acidic polymer (pI 5.5), it is possible that the in vitro expressed polypeptides nonspecifically interact through charged residues. Actin also forms long polymers and carries a net overall charge similar to that of tubulin (pI. 5.4) (30Schliwa M. The Cytoskeleton. Springer-Verlag, Wien1986Google Scholar). Fig.5 compares the sedimentation of the 57- and the 30-kDa polypeptides in the presence of molar excesses of microtubules and actin filaments. Although actin sedimentation results in a slight increase of pelletable 57-kDa product over buffer alone, there is substantially more polypeptide in the tubulin pellet. The 30-kDa polypeptide does not pellet in the presence of microtubules nor in the actin polymer control. These results strengthen the argument that the interactions described here are tubulin-specific. The results presented in Figs. 3, 4, 5 indicate that this predicted helical region of the DHC contains an ability to cosediment with tubulin and thus may at least in part define the microtubule-binding domain of dynein. They further indicate that this region is complex and binding requires either substantial secondary structure or that multiple contact sites with the polymer are involved. In the in vitro pelleting assays, only a small percentage of the total expressed polypeptide appears to cosediment with microtubules. Although this is consistent with what we have found in Dictyosteliumhigh speed supernatants, where only a fraction of the total native DHC cosediments with bovine microtubules, 2M. P. Koonce, unpublished observations. it may also indicate a partial microtubule binding ability. Native dynein contains both high and low affinity microtubule binding states, which are likely the product of geometrical changes within the microtubule-contact site. Without detailed information on the tertiary structure of this region in both the native molecule and the fragments expressed here, quantitative assessments on the binding efficiency are probably not meaningful. The work presented here describes two related efforts to understand the domain structure of a dynein heavy chain gene. The first describes efforts to express functional units of the globular head domain, and the second identifies a region of the molecule that appears to contain a microtubule binding activity. Biochemical and structural data indicate that a 380-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of theDictyostelium DHC corresponds to a functionally active, single globular head of dynein (21Koonce M.P. Samso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The data presented here describe efforts to produce substantially smaller head domain fragments that retain an ATP-sensitive microtubule binding activity. In our hands, several constructs truncated from the carboxyl-terminal end fail to produce detectable product, indicating that the specified polypeptide either is highly unstable or is toxic to the cell. Of the smaller constructs that are produced in vivo, none show a substantial ability to bind microtubules and, for the ones containing the first P-loop, fail to undergo the UV-vanadate cleavage normally associated with this motif (29Gibbons I.R. Lee-Eiford A. Mocz C.G. Phillipson A. Tang W.-J.Y. Gibbons B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2780-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncations in from the amino terminus of the head domain would remove the P-loop associated with ATP hydrolysis and thus would fail to make complete motors. A deletion from the middle of the head domain produces a polypeptide that appears stable but does not interact with microtubules or UV-vanadate cleaves. Moreover, the region excised contains an ability to bind microtubules in vitro. If an ATP-insensitive microtubule binding activity is retained in constructs expressedin vivo, then these polypeptides would likely coat the surface of the microtubules, inhibit dynamics and associated organelle motility, and likely lead to cell death. This may at least partially explain our difficulty in expressing some of the head domain constructs. Although the first P-loop in the DHC sequence plays a prominent role in binding the nucleoside triphosphate, additional residues are necessary for ATP hydrolysis (31Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Kinesin and myosin share at least three other motifs in common with some GTPases that fold together forming the ATP catalytic domain (reviewed in Ref. 32Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Although identical sequences are not obvious in the Dictyostelium DHC, it seems reasonable to predict that similar structural motifs are required for dynein; these could be distributed anywhere along the linear sequence. Thus even though the ΔSph truncation occurs over 1100 amino acids downstream of the first P-loop, the inability of the 318-kDa polypeptide to UV-cleave indicates that the catalytic pocket is not folded properly or is missing a functional element necessary for ATP hydrolysis. Together with the data discussed in the previous paragraphs, these results suggest that the entire 380-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment is necessary for ATP-sensitive microtubule binding activity and thus roughly defines the minimal functional head domain for dynein. The in vivo deletion and the in vitro expression work suggest there are microtubule binding activities located within the predicted α-helical region just after the fourth P-loop in the DHC. A preliminary report describing a similar finding for another cytoplasmic dynein has also recently appeared (33Gee, M. A., and Vallee, R. B. (1996) Mol. Biol. Cell., 7, (Suppl.) 566 (abstr.).Google Scholar). Comparative sequence analysis shows this region to be well conserved among dynein heavy chains. Within this region, the Dictyostelium sequence is approximately 50% identical to most cytoplasmic dyneins and close to 30% identical to axonemal dyneins sequenced to date. Our work suggests that at least four discrete units can act in different combinations to mediate the binding of dynein to microtubules. Comparisons do not show an obvious sequence conservation between these four domains, suggesting that they do not contain simple repeated motifs similar to other microtubule-binding proteins, e.g. MAP-2, MAP-2C, MAP-4, and tau (34Doll T. Meichsner M. Riederer B.M. Honegger P. Matus A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 633-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted α-helical regions just after the fourth P-loop represent a unique structural domain in the dynein molecule. The borders of these regions are arbitrarily defined here by proline residues. Although the true structure of this domain has yet to be determined, the position and spacing of the proline residues are well conserved among axonemal and cytoplasmic dyneins. Previous discussions of functional properties for this domain include: 1) the helices could form a projection off the head domain and provide the ATP-sensitive B-link to the adjacent microtubule found in several axonemes (4Gibbons I.R. Gibbons B.H. Mocz G. Asai D. Nature. 1991; 352: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Asai D.J. Brokaw C.J. Trends. Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 398-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); 2) they may combine with another, shorter predicted helical domain preceding the first P-loop and participate in forming the tertiary structure of the head domain or the dynein molecule (1Holzbaur E.L.F. Vallee R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 339-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 36Mikami A. Paschal B.M. Mazumdar M. Vallee R.B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); 3) they may form coiled-coil interactions with other polypeptides (4Gibbons I.R. Gibbons B.H. Mocz G. Asai D. Nature. 1991; 352: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 36Mikami A. Paschal B.M. Mazumdar M. Vallee R.B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); and 4) may play a role in the conformational changes associated with force production (37Porter M.E. Knott J.A. Gardner L.C. Mitchell D.R. Dutcher S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1495-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our data strengthen the arguments presented for 1) and 4). If the region does form two or more helical domains, they could serve to project a microtubule contact site or could serve as mechanical levers to raise/lower a binding domain in conjunction with structural changes produced by ATP catalysis. A microtubule-binding sequence motif has been proposed in common with dyneins and kinesins (38Witman G.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Witman G.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 497-506PubMed Google Scholar). P-X 6E-X 4-L represents the core consensus sequence of this motif and is surrounded by several conserved hydrophobic, polar, and charged regions (39Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Witman G.B. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 497-506PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence was described just after the first P-loop, about the same distance downstream in dynein, kinesin, and kinesin-like proteins. Although it falls within a region of kinesin shown experimentally to bind microtubules (17Yang J.T. Laymon R.A. Goldstein L.S.B. Cell. 1989; 56: 879-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), a similar relationship to functional activity within dynein has not been reported. Interestingly, this core motif is also found within the domains we suggest have microtubule binding activity. Prolines 3198, 3366, 3648, and 3712 are followed by a glutamic acid 6 residues downstream and a leucine (or in one case, isoleucine) 3–5 residues further. The latter three of these “motifs” are well conserved among cytoplasmic dyneins. Here we present data suggesting that the entire carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the dynein heavy chain from Dictyostelium is essential to comprise a functional head domain. We also suggest that there are at least four domains, each containing approximately 125 amino acids, clustered around a predicted α-helical region downstream from the fourth P-loop that collectively participate in binding the motor to the microtubule polymer. Data also exist to suggest that dynein binds to both α- and β-tubulin (40Goldsmith M. Yarbrough L. van der Kooy D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and structure work indicates that the dynein head is large enough to interact with multiple dimers. If a single dynein can bind to both α- and β-tubulin, the contact regions would not necessarily be identical. However, they might contain a similar core structure that coordinates affinity with ATP hydrolysis. Taking this together, we propose that cytoplasmic dynein makes more than one functional contact with a microtubule. This could be important in binding (does it dock to or does it grip the tubulin surface) or during its mechanochemical stroke (instead of rocking a lever arm, does the head roll?). At a minimum, this work associates a relatively defined region of the DHC with a functional activity and will permit a more focused analysis of how dynein binds microtubules.

https://openalex.org/W2013584016,"We previously isolated novel tetrasaccharides containing 3-O-sulfated glucuronic acid from king crab cartilage chondroitin sulfate K and demonstrated that the disaccharide units containing 3-O-sulfated glucuronic acid were decomposed by chondroitinase ABC digestion (Sugahara, K., Tanaka, Y., Yamada, S., Seno, N., Kitagawa, H., Haslam, S. M., Morris, H. R., and Dell, A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26745-26754). The findings indicated the necessity to re-evaluate the disaccharide compositions of chondroitin sulfate preparations purified from other biological sources and analyzed using the above enzyme. In this study, to evaluate squid cartilage chondroitin sulfate E a series of even-numbered oligosaccharides were isolated after exhaustive digestion with sheep testicular hyaluronidase and subsequent fractionation by gel chromatography. The tetrasaccharide fraction was subfractionated by high performance liquid chromatography on an amine-bound silica column. Systematic structural analysis of five major fractions, h, l, m, n, and q, by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, enzymatic digestions in conjunction with capillary electrophoresis, and 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed one disulfated, three trisulfated, and one tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide structure: fraction h, GlcAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S)beta1-4GlcAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S); fraction l, GlcA(3S)beta1-3GalNAc(6S)beta1-4GlcAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S); fraction m, GlcA(3S)beta1-3GalNAc(4S)beta1-4GlcAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S); fraction n, GlcAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S,6S)beta1-4GlcAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S); and fraction q, GlcA(3S)beta1-3GalNAc(4S,6S)beta1-4GlcAbeta1-3GalNAc(4S), where 3S, 4S, and 6S represent 3-O-, 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate, respectively. The structures found in fractions h and m as well as the unsaturated counterpart of that found in fraction n have been reported, whereas those in fractions l and q are novel in that they contained unusual disulfated and trisulfated disaccharide units where GlcA(3S) is directly linked to GalNAc(6S) and GalNAc(4S,6S), respectively. These novel tetrasaccharide sequences are distinct from those found in other chondroitin sulfate isoforms and may play key roles in the biological functions and activities of chondroitin sulfate E not only from squid cartilage but also from mammalian cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2128548712,"Biochemical and enzymatic characterization of the novel proprotein convertase rat PC7 (rPC7) was carried out using vaccinia virus recombinants overexpressed in mammalian BSC40 cells. Pro-PC7 is synthesized as a glycosylated zymogen (101 kDa) and processed into mature rPC7 (89 kDa) in the endoplasmic reticulum. No endogenously produced soluble forms of this membrane-anchored protein were detected. A deletion mutant (65 kDa), truncated well beyond the expected C-terminal boundary of the P-domain, produced soluble rPC7 in the culture medium. Enzymatic activity assays of rPC7 using fluorogenic peptidyl substrates indicated that the pH optimum, Ca2+ dependence, and cleavage specificity of this enzyme are largely similar to those of furin. However, with some substrates, cleavage specificity more closely resembled that of yeast kexin, suggesting differential processing of proprotein substrates by this novel convertase. We examined the rPC7- and human furin-mediated cleavage of synthetic peptides containing the processing sites of three proteins known to colocalize in situ with rPC7. Whereas both enzymes correctly processed the pro-parathyroid hormone tridecapeptide and the pro-PC4 heptadecapeptide, neither enzyme cleaved a pro-epidermal growth factor hexadecapeptide. Thus, this study establishes that rPC7 is an enzymatically functional subtilisin/kexin-like serine proteinase with a cleavage specificity resembling that of hfurin. In addition, we have demonstrated that rPC7 can correctly process peptide precursors that contain the processing sites of at least two potential physiological substrates.

Oncog. 1993; 4: 115-136PubMed Google Scholar), be involved in the processing of precursors within the constitutive secretory pathway. Interestingly, in lymphoid-associated tissues such as thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, the expression of PC7 appears to be especially high (5Seidah N.G. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi M. Dong W. Tadros H.

The sites where PCs cleave peptide precursors of various hormones, growth factors, and viral envelope glycoproteins have generally been defined as (Arg/Lys)-(X)n-(Arg/Lys)↓ wheren = 0, 2, 4, or 6 residues (9Seidah N.G.

Due to this wide-ranging specificity and the overlapping expression of various convertases in different tissues, it is often difficult to assign cleavage of a given precursor to a particular enzyme.

Intramolecular Chaperones and Protein Folding. R. G.

This paper characterizes the in vitro properties of full-length and soluble rat PC7 (rPC7) overexpressed in mammalian cells infected with the corresponding vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants. A polyclonal rPC7 antiserum has been produced and used to identify the biosynthetic forms, likely cellular location, and site of zymogen cleavage of rPC7 in these cells. In addition, processing of several synthetic fluorogenic and peptidyl substrates is examined to elucidate the cleavage specificity of this newest member of the PC family. The full-length cDNA of rPC7 (5Seidah N.G. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi M. Dong W. Tadros H. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. Day R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) that had been inserted into the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) was digested with (5′) HindIII and (3′) BbsI to remove a pair of extra 5′ ATG codons (5Seidah N.G. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi M. Dong W. Tadros H. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. Day R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Following the addition of a linker to close the sequence, the insert (5′) HindIII/(3′)XbaI was ligated into the HindIII/NheI sites of the VV transfer vector PMJ602 (18Davison A.J. Moss B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4285-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This produced the rPC7 full-length recombinant virus (VV:rPC7). The native initiator sequence of this construct, CTGATGC, was subsequently modified by polymerase chain reaction to GTGATG Gto generate a favorable Kozak consensus sequence for the initiation of protein translation (19Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Three soluble forms of rPC7 were constructed from this full-length VV:rPC7K clone by digestion with restriction enzymes followed by addition of the appropriate linkers. Thus, digestion withBsu36I produced a form called BTMD- (before thetransmembrane domain) rPC7K, which ends at Gly-Tyr-Ser622. Similarly, digestion with HgaI generated two shorter forms of rPC7, called BTMD-S-rPC7, ending at Tyr-Gly-Ser578 or at Val-Asp-Ile585. Vaccinia virus recombinants of the three constructs were then isolated as described previously (12Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 14Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol.

Human BCRD- (before the cysteine-richdomain) furin (BCRD-hfurin), ending at Ser-Ser-Gly586, has been described previously (20Paquet L. Bergeron F. Boudreault A. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Mbikay M. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19279-19285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast recombinant VV:ykexin was kindly provided by Dr. D. Thomas (Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Canada). BSC40 cells, an African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line, were grown to confluence in 10% CO2 at 37 °C on 15-cm tissue culture dishes using minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 28 μg/ml gentamycin. Following a brief rinse in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were infected with recombinant viruses at 2–4 plaque forming units (pfu)/cell in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% (v/v) bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. They were then returned to minimum essential medium plus fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Membrane preparations of rPC7K− and yeast kexin (ykexin)-infected cells were made according to the procedure of Bresnahan et al. (21Bresnahan P.A. Leduc R. Thomas L. Thorner J. Gibson H.L. Brake A.J. Barr P.J. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2851-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) with several modifications: 1) cells were harvested at 18 h post-infection by scraping in 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0; 2) suspensions from the Dounce homogenizer were centrifuged at 16,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge; 3) the supernatants, representing soluble cellular material, were removed and stored at −20 °C for enzymatic activity and Western blot analyses; 4) the membrane pellets, resuspended in the above buffer, were diluted 1:1 (v/v) with glycerol and aliquoted for storage at −20 °C. Under these conditions, enzymatic activity was stable for at least 6 months. For the soluble VV:BTMD-rPC7K construct, cells at 18 h postinfection were washed three times with serum-free minimum essential medium and then incubated in the same medium for an additional 6 h. Following centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris, the media were concentrated approximately 20-fold on Centriprep-30s (Amicon), diluted 1:1 with glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. BCRD-hfurin, produced in the same manner, was further purified on DEAE-Bio-Gel A agarose (Bio-Rad) as reported (22Jean F. Basak A. Rondeau N. Benjannet S. Hendy G.N. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A similar further purification of BTMD-rPC7 consistently resulted in very poor recoveries of activity, most likely due to oxidative damage. Nonetheless, using the small amount of active BTMD-rPC7 recovered from this purification, we were able to ascertain that the properties (pH optimum and K m (app) using a pentapeptide fluorogenic substrate (see below)) of the DEAE-purified BTMD-rPC7 were essentially identical to those of the enzyme obtained from concentrated media (results not shown). Media and membrane extracts from rPC7-infected BSC40 cells were run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and the separated proteins electroeluted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Boehringer Mannheim) using a primary rabbit antiserum raised against a synthetic multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) (23Basak A. Boudreault A. Chen A. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) based on the amino acid sequence (Ala449-Ser-Tyr-Val-Ser-Pro-Met-Leu-Lys-Glu-Asn-Lys-Ala-Val-Pro-Arg-Ser465) located in the P-domain of rPC7 (5, Fig. 1). The specificity of the antiserum was verified by demonstrating that the bands visualized in the rPC7-infected cells could be blocked by preincubation with 200 μg/ml linear synthetic peptide of the MAP that had been prepared separately using normal, solid phase Fast-Moc chemistry (23Basak A. Boudreault A. Chen A. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the antiserum did not cross-react when used on membrane pellets of BSC40 cells infected with vaccinia virus recombinants of other known membrane-associated convertases such as hfurin, mPC5/6-B, or ykexin. For quantitative analyses, densitometric readings of ECL films were carried out using the Gel Plotting macro of a Macintosh image analysis software (a public domain National Institutes of Health Image program). BSC40 cells were infected with the VV:rPC7 construct at 4 pfu/cell. Seventeen hours postinfection, the cells were pulse- or pulse-chase labeled withl-[35S]Met as described (12Benjannet S. Rondeau N.

Thomas G. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When present during the preincubation as well as the pulse periods, the concentrations of tunicamycin and brefeldin A (BFA) were 5 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively. As described previously (24Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), cells were lysed, and the proteins therein, along with those in the culture media, were immunoprecipitated by incubation with either the rPC7 antiserum (see above) plus protein A-agarose or with lentil lectin-Sepharose (25Zhong M. Benjannet S. Lazure C. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE, the bands were visualized by exposure to x-ray film. For microsequence analyses, BSC40 cells infected with the VV:rPC7 construct were pulse-labeled for 4 h in the presence of [3H]Leu or [3H]Ile and processed as above. The labeled proteins were then run on an SDS-PAGE, after which the appropriate bands were eluted and analyzed on an Applied Biosystem gas-phase sequenator (model 470A) as described previously (12Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 25Zhong M. Benjannet S. Lazure C. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was assessed using the fluorogenic synthetic peptide substrate pERTKR-MCA (Peptides International) (26Jean F. Boudreault A. Basak A. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as follows. The enzyme preparation (usually 5 μl) was added to the assay reaction mixture consisting of (final concentration) 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 6.5), 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in the case of membrane-bound enzyme preparations, and 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol in the case of BCRD-hfurin. The reaction (in a total volume of 100 μl) was initiated at room temperature in a microtiter plate by the addition of pERTKR-MCA at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Fluorescence was monitored at 0, 30, 60, and 90 min using a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorometer (model LS 50 B) set to an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. In all cases, the rate of substrate hydrolysis was constant for at least 60 min. For pH sensitivity experiments, enzymatic activity was evaluated as above using a ternary buffer system containing 17.3 mm sodium acetate, 17.3 mm MES, and 17.3 mm Tris acetate adjusted to the appropriate pH with acetic acid or NaOH. To determine the Ca2+ activation requirement of PC7, increasing concentrations of EDTA were added to the assay mixture described above for enzymatic activity measurements but lacking CaCl2. Based on these results, the assay mixture was then supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and varying concentrations of CaCl2. For the inhibitor profiles, selected compounds were added to the fluorogenic assay medium 30 min before the addition of pERTKR-MCA. In the case of EDTA and EGTA, the indicated concentrations of the chelator were added to the assay mixture without CaCl2. Fluorogenic assays were carried out substituting various MCA substrates for pERTKR-MCA. For K m determinations, increasing amounts of pERTKR-MCA were added to the reaction mixture. The data, plotted as hydrolysis activityversus [pERTKR-MCA], were subject to nonlinear regression analysis (KaleidaGraph) to determine the K m andV max values. For the representative assays depicted in the figures, the data were expressed as a percentage of the calculated V max and replotted. The pro-PC4 and pro-epidermal growth factor (pro-EGF) peptides were synthesized on an automated solid phase peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, model 431A) using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate)-based FastMoc chemistry (22Jean F.

The following side chain protecting groups were used:tert-butyloxycarbonyl for Lys; tert-butyl for Ser, Thr, Tyr, Asp, and Glu; and 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman 6-sulfonyl for Arg. At the end of the synthesis, the peptides were cleaved from the resin and fully deprotected by treating the resin with reagent K (22Jean F. Basak A. Rondeau N. Benjannet S. Hendy G.N. Seidah N.G.

The peptides were purified by RP-HPLC (Beckman, model 5500) on a semi-preparative Vydac column 218TP510G8 (1.0 × 25 cm) (Chromatographic Specialty Corp., Canada). The buffer system consisted of an aqueous phase containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and an organic phase of acetonitrile also containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). The elution was carried out at a flow rate of 2 ml/min beginning with a 5-min isocratic step of 5% organic phase followed by a linear gradient of 5–60% organic phase over 60 min. Eluted materials were monitored at a wavelength of 225 nm. Both peptides were fully characterized by FAB mass spectrometry as well as by amino acid analysis (23Basak A. Boudreault A. Chen A. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The synthetic pro-parathyroid hormone (pro-PTH) tridecapeptide was a gift from Dr. G. N. Hendy, Calcium Research Laboratory, Royal Victoria Hospital, McGill University, and has been described previously (27Hendy G.N. Bennett H.P.J. Gibbs B.F. Lazure C. Day R. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9517-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pro-PTH tridecapeptide (KSVKKRSVSEIQL), the pro-PC4 heptadecapeptide (YETLRRRVKRSLVVPTD), and the pro-EGF hexadecapeptide (HLREDDHHYSVRNSDS) were reacted at room temperature with enzymes in the reaction mixture as described above for enzymatic activity determinations. Time courses of substrate digestion by BCRD-hfurin, rPC7, and BTMD-rPC7 were first carried out to optimize the digestion conditions and to define the period during which the reaction proceeded at a constant rate (not shown). Thus, the reaction times chosen for the K m determinations were from 10 to 20 min. The digestion products were analyzed using RP-HPLC separation (Varian, model 9010) on a Beckman 5-μm Ultrasphere C18 column (0.2 × 25 cm) as described above for peptide purification except that the buffer system also contained 0.01% triethylamine in both the aqueous and organic phases, the flow rate was 1 ml/min, the linear gradient of acetonitrile was 5–30% over 45 min, and monitoring was carried out at a wavelength of 210 nm. The collected peptides (two product peaks along with that of the undigested peptide, not shown) were identified and quantitated by amino acid composition as described (27Hendy G.N. Bennett H.P.J.

The K m determinations were based on the amounts of the C-terminal cleavage product of each substrate peptide, and the resulting data were analyzed as described above for the pERTKR-MCA peptide. A schematic representation of the sequence of the full-length rPC7 and three truncated versions lacking the putative transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail (5Seidah N.G. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi M. Dong W. Tadros H. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. Day R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), denoted BTMD-rPC7 and C-terminally shortened versions called BTMD-S-rPC7, is shown in Fig.1. These molecular structures are compared with those of ykexin, the full-length hfurin, and its truncated version lacking the cysteine-rich domain, called BCRD-hfurin. The 17-amino acid peptide sequence indicated within the P-domain was used as an immunogen to obtain a polyclonal rPC7 antiserum, permitting the identification and characterization of the various forms of rPC7 obtained via overexpression in BSC40 cells. Thus, following overnight incubation of cells infected with VV recombinants expressing either rPC7K or BTMD-rPC7K, the cell extracts, and media were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.2, an rPC7-specific doublet (101 and 89 kDa, at a ratio of approximately 1:3 as determined by densitometric analysis of the ECL film) is visible only in the membrane fraction of cell lysates obtained from VV:rPC7K-infected cells. (The construct VV:rPC7K produced 2–3 times more enzyme than that containing the native initiator sequence, results not shown.) These two proteins were resistant to solubilization with 0.1m Na2CO3 and even low (<5%) concentrations of Triton X-100 (not shown), indicating that rPC7 is an integral membrane protein. These findings were further supported by enzymatic activity assays of crude cellular fractions (TableI), which showed that 93% of the total rPC7-specific pERTKR-MCA hydrolytic activity was present in cell membranes. Analysis of BSC40 cells infected with VV:ykexin revealed that 21% of its activity is shed into the medium during a 7-h collection (subsequent to an overnight incubation), whereas 66% remains membrane-associated (Table I). Similarly, infections of BSC40 cells with VV:hfurin (full-length) resulted in the secretion of active, soluble furin (28Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vidricaire G. Denault J.B. Leduc R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These data thus confirm that rPC7, unlike hfurin and ykexin, remains as a membrane-associated protein which is not significantly shed into the medium.Figure 2Immunodetection of rPC7 and BTMD-rPC7.Samples from VV:wild type-, rPC7-, and BTMD-rPC7-infected BSC40 cells were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and run on 7.5% SDS reducing gels.

https://openalex.org/W2020862791,"There is a close correspondence between the ability of RANTES and macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β to activate CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and the ability to inhibit CCR5-dependent membrane fusion mediated by the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), type 1. This finding suggests that some of the structural determinants for CC chemokine/CCR5 interactions and CCR5 HIV-1 fusion co-receptor activity may be shared. Recent studies using human CCR5/CCR2B chimeras have suggested that the determinants of CCR5 co-receptor activity are complex and may involve multiple extracellular receptor domains and that viral co-receptor activity is dissociable from ligand-dependent signaling responses. However, conclusive evidence demonstrating an important role for the second and third extracellular regions of human CCR5 is lacking. Furthermore, to determine whether the determinants for CCR5 co-receptor activity overlap with those required for agonist activity, studies that compare the chemokine specificity for inhibition of envelope-mediated cell fusion and the agonist profile of chimeric receptors are necessary. In the present report, using a series of CCR5/CCR2B chimeras we ascribe an important role for the second and third extracellular loop of CCR5 in supporting the co-receptor activity of CCR5. We also provide evidence that the intracytoplasmic tail of CCR5 does not play an important role in supporting HIV-1 entry. The hypothesis that the structural determinants for CC chemokine/CCR5 interactions and CCR5 HIV-1 fusion co-receptor activity may be shared was confirmed by two novel observations: first, the fusion activity supported by two hybrid receptors could be inhibited by both RANTES and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, chemokines specific to CCR5 and CCR2B, respectively; and second, the chemokine specificity for inhibition of envelope-mediated cell fusion matched the agonist profile of these hybrid receptors. These data shed new light on the structural determinants involved in these distinct activities of CCR5 and may have important implications for the development of CCR5-targeted anti-viral compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2013249689,"The ars operon of plasmid R773 encodes an ATP-dependent extrusion pump for arsenite and antimonite in Escherichia coli. The ArsA ATPase is the catalytic subunit of the pump protein, with two nucleotide binding consensus sequences, one in the NH2-terminal half and one in the COOH-terminal half of the protein. A 12-residue consensus sequence (DTAPTGHTIRLL) has been identified in ArsA homologs from eubacteria, archebacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. ArsA enzymes were constructed containing single tryptophan residues at either end of this conserved sequence. The emission spectrum of the fluorescence of the tryptophan on the COOH-terminal end (Trp-159) indicated a relatively hydrophilic environment for this residue. An increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and a blue shift of the maximum emission wavelength were observed upon addition of MgATP, indicating movement of Trp-159 into a relatively less polar environment. No fluorescence response was observed with MgADP, with nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, or with MgATP by catalytically inactive enyzmes. This suggests that the location Trp-159 is shifted only during hydrolysis of ATP. In contrast, the emission spectrum of Trp-141, located on the NH2-terminal side of the consensus sequence, indicated a relatively nonpolar environment. The maximum emission wavelength red shifted upon addition of MgADP. MgATP slowly produced a response that correlated with product formation, suggesting that the environment of Trp-141 is sensitive only to MgADP binding. Thus, during ATP hydrolysis the COOH-terminal end of the conserved domain moves into a less polar environment, whereas the NH2-terminal end moves into a more hydrophilic environment as product is formed. A hypothesis is presented in which the conserved domain of ArsA and homologs is an energy transduction domain involved in transmission of the energy of ATP hydrolysis to biological functions such as transport.

Resistance to arsenical and antimonial salts in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli is conferred by thears operon of conjugative R-factor R773 (1Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 273-277Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This operon encodes an ATP-coupled efflux pump that actively transports the trivalent arsenicals and antimonials out of the cell; reducing the intracellular concentration of those metalloid oxyanions to subtoxic levels produces resistance (2Dey S. Rosen B.P. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 103-132Google Scholar). The pump consists of two types of polypeptides, ArsA and ArsB. ArsA is the 63-kDa catalytic subunit. ArsB is a 45-kDa integral membrane protein that is the membrane anchor for ArsA and the oxyanion-translocating sector of the pump (3Dey S. Dou D. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the absence of ArsB, ArsA can be purified as a soluble ATPase (4Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal (A1) and COOH-terminal (A2) halves of ArsA ATPase are homologous to each other, likely the result of an ancestral gene duplication and fusion (5Chen C.-M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the A1 and A2 halves contain a consensus sequence for the phosphate binding loop (P-loop) of an ATP binding site (6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4210) Google Scholar), and both sites are required for catalysis and resistance (7Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Karkaria C.E. Chen C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the results of intergenic complementation and intragenic suppression, a model was proposed in which a single catalytic site was formed at the interface of an A1 and an A2 ATP binding site (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Construction of single tryptophan-containing proteins has proven of value in the study of other E. coli transport enzymes. For example, the environments of regions of the mannitol enzyme II were investigated from the fluorescence of strategically placed tryptophan residues (11Dijkstra D.S. Broos J. Lolkema J.S. Enequist H. Minke W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6628-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Senior and colleagues have used tryptophan fluorescence as a direct probe of nucleotide binding in the noncatalytic sites ofE. coli F1-ATPase (12Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11261-11268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wilke-Mounts S. Weber J. Grell E. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and to discriminate between binding of substrate and product in the catalytic sites (14Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence can be used to investigate the interactions with its ligands (15Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the presence of multiple tryptophan residues in ArsA decreased the signal-to-noise response to ligand binding; of the four tryptophan residues in ArsA, only Trp-159 gave a substrate-responsive signal. From that study it was not clear whether ATP binding to the A1 or A2 site or both produced enhancement of Trp-159 fluorescence. In this study mutant arsA genes were constructed containing single tryptophan codons. By site-directed mutagenesis tyrosines were substituted for Trp-253, Trp-522, and Trp-524, and a six-histidine tag was added to the COOH terminus, producing a His-tagged ArsA containing only Trp-159 (W159H6); a His-tagged tryptophan-free ArsA was also constructed. The single tryptophan-containing W159H6 ArsA gave approximately a 4-fold increase in the signal-to-noise ratio in response to MgATP/mol of tryptophan residue compared with the wild type enzyme. The sequence D142TAPTGHTIRLL153 in A1 is highly conserved in ArsA homologs from every kingdom, implying that this common motif may have a conserved function. To examine the microenvironment of the conserved sequence, an F141W substitution was introduced into the tryptophan-free ArsA, producing a W141H6 enzyme. The fluorescence spectra indicate that Trp-141 is located in a hydrophobic region, whereas Trp-159 is surround by a relatively hydrophilic environment. Binding of MgADP moved Trp-141 into a more hydrophilic region; in contrast, the addition of MgATP shifted Trp-159 into a more hydrophobic environment. To examine the effect of mutation in the nucleotide binding sites, substitutions in the A1 (G18R) and A2 (G337R) P-loops were introduced into single tryptophan-containing ArsAs. The results showed that neither binding of substrate nor product per se affected the fluorescence of Trp-159, suggesting that changes in Trp-159 fluorescence report a transient state during ATP hydrolysis. Since Trp-141 at one end of the conserved sequence enters a more polar environment while Trp-159 at the other end enters a less polar environment, this sequence may be an energy transduction domain that experiences significant conformational changes during hydrolysis of ATP.

Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing using a Cy5-AUTOREAD sequencing kit with an ALFexpress system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Plasmid DNA for sequencing was prepared with a miniprep kit (QIAGEN). Mutations in thearsA gene were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered SitesTM in vitro Mutagenesis system (Promega). Single-strand DNA of plasmid pW253Y (15Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), encoding a single tryptophan-to-tyrosine mutation at arsA codon 253, was used as the initial template. Plasmid pTZ3 was obtained by simultaneously mutating tryptophan codons 522 and 524 of plasmid pW253Y to tyrosine codons using the following oligonucleotide (respective changes underlined): 5′-GCTGTTATTGATAATGTAGCCGTAGGGGTGAATGCCTGC-3′. To purify ArsA by Ni2+ affinity column, a six-histidine tag (His6) was introduced to the COOH terminus of the arsA gene of plasmid pTZ3 by inserting 18 bases encoding six histidine residues between the last codon and the stop codon using the following oligonucleotide (histidine codon insertions underlined): 5′-TTTGCTGCCCTACGTGATGACAATAATTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGCCCAGCAAGTTGTTTGAGTTTGTCGATGCC-3′. The resulting plasmid pTZ3H6 was used for expression and purification of the single tryptophan-containing W159H6 ArsA by Ni2+affinity chromatography. To construct plasmid pTZ4H6, encoding a tryptophan-free ArsA, the 6.5-kilobase fragment from plasmid pTZ3H6 was digested with AvaI and ligated with the 2.5-kilobaseAvaI fragment from plasmid pW159Y. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli strain JM109. Plasmid pW141H6, which expresses the single tryptophan-containing W141H6 ArsA, was constructed by mutating codon 141 of plasmid pTZ4H6 to a Trp codon using the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GGCGCGGTATCCCAAATGATATGG-3′. The oligonucleotides used for the introduction of G18R and G337R substitutions in the A1 or A2 consensus nucleotide binding sites in pTZ3H6 and pW141H6 were: 5′-TTACCCACGCGTCCTTTACCCG-3′ (G18R) and 5′-TTCCCCACGCGACCTTTACCC-3′ (G337R), where the indicated mutations are underlined. Cells were grown in 100 ml of LB medium at 37 °C overnight and diluted into 1 liter of prewarmed LB medium, with antibiotics added as required. The culture was induced at A 600 nm = 0.6–0.8 with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2.5 h and harvested by centrifugation. The cells (4–5 g wet weight) were washed once with buffer A (50 mmMOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminodiphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); FSBA, 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine. -KOH, pH 7.5, 0.5m NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −80 °C until use. The cells were suspended in 5 ml of buffer A containing 20 mm glycine/g of wet cells and lysed by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate was added at 2.5 μl/g of wet cells immediately following lysis. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant solution was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a column containing 5 ml of ProBond Ni2+ affinity resin preequilibrated with 30 ml of buffer A containing 20 mmglycine. The column was washed with 40 ml of buffer A followed by 40 ml of buffer A containing 0.1 m glycine and finally with 40 ml of buffer A containing 0.2 m glycine, all at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Finally ArsA was eluted with 100 ml of 0.6 mglycine in buffer A. ArsA-containing fractions were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled, and concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter BIOMAX-30K (Millipore) at 2,000 × g. Purified ArsA was quickly frozen and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. The concentration of purified ArsA was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficients for W159H6 ArsA and W141H6 ArsA were calculated to be 20,250 and 21,530 m−1cm−1, respectively (17Aitken A. Leamonth M. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1996: 3-6Crossref Google Scholar). Routine ATPase assay was carried out as described (18Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Yu. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To correlate the rate of ATP hydrolysis with the rate of change of tryptophan fluorescence, ATPase activity was estimated from the release of phosphate by the method of Fiske and SubbaRow (19Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). ArsA and ATP at the indicated concentrations were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5. One portion was used to monitor the fluorescence change, and the remainder was used to assay ATPase activity. The reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. At indicated times, portions of 0.2 ml were withdrawn and mixed with 0.2 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid to terminate the reaction. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and 0.3 ml of the supernatant solution was mixed with 0.2 ml of a solution of 5% FeSO4, 1% (NH4)2MoO4, and 1 nH2SO4. After 10 min at 37 °C, the absorbance at 740 nm was measured, and phosphate concentrations were determined from the absorbance of known amounts of phosphate. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a SLM-8000C spectrofluorometer at room temperature. Samples were stirred continuously in a 1.0 × 1.0-cm quartz cuvette. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm for selective excitation of tryptophan fluorescence. The bandwidths for both emission and excitation monochromators were 4 nm. Spectra were corrected for background and Raman scattering by subtracting buffer spectra. Free tryptophan was used as an external standard for comparison of different spectra. To monitor the fluorescence intensity change with time or addition of quenching ligands, the emission wavelengths were set to 322 nm for W141H6, 337 nm for W159H6, and 353 nm for free tryptophan and denatured ArsAs. The concentration of ArsA was 1.25 μm, unless otherwise noted. The buffer used was 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5. To denaturate ArsA, the protein was mixed with 6 mguanidine HCl for 3 min before measurement. To determine collisional quenching of tryptophan fluorescence, stock solutions of 8m acrylamide and 5 m KI containing 0.1 mm Na2S2O3 were used (20Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). The effects of dilution and ionic strength were calibrated in parallel experiments. The quenching data were plotted according to the Stern-Volmer equation (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Crossref Google Scholar)F0/F=1+KD[Q]Equation 1 where F 0 and F are the relative fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the collisional quenching ligand at concentration [Q], andK D is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. The arsenite resistance phenotype of cells of strain JM109 bearing plasmids with mutated arsA genes was analyzed (Fig.1). Sequential substitution of tyrosines for Trp-253, Trp-522, and Trp-524 and addition of the six histidine residues at the COOH terminus produced an ArsA with only Trp-159 (W159H6). Substitution of tyrosine for Trp-159 in W159H6 produced a tryptophan-free ArsA. Subsequent substitution of tryptophan for Phe-141 resulted in the single tryptophan ArsA W141H6. Each mutated gene conferred wild type resistance to arsenite. Introduction of a G18R substitution in the A1 P-loop (8Karkaria C.E. Chen C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or G337R in the A2 P-loop (7Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in either W159H6 or W141H6 produced an arsenite-sensitive phenotype. Each ArsA was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and ATPase assayed. Although ArsA with a COOH-terminal histidine tag had slightly less activity than the wild type enzyme, both W159H6 and W141H6 are as active as the wild type protein with a COOH-terminal histidine tag (data not shown). Combination of the G18R or G337R substitution with W159H6 or W141H6 resulted in inactive proteins. The results indicate that none of the tryptophan residues nor Phe-141 is essential for activity, allowing tryptophan fluorescence to be used as an intrinsic probe of ArsA catalysis. The polarity of microenvironment of tryptophan residues in a protein can be assessed from their fluorescence emission spectra (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Crossref Google Scholar). In a less polar environment the maximum emission wavelength (λmax) of tryptophan shifts to a lower wavelength, with an increase in the fluorescence yield (21Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Crossref Google Scholar). When excited at 295 nm, free tryptophan in an aqueous solution has a λmax at 353 nm (Fig. 2,curve 5), whereas the λmax of Trp-159 and Trp-141 were 337 nm (Fig. 2, curve 2) and 322 nm (Fig. 2,curve 1), respectively. At the same concentration of protein the fluorescence yield of Trp-141 was nearly twice that of Trp-159. The λmax of each shifted to 353 nm upon denaturation of the proteins with 6 m guanidine HCl (Fig. 2, curves 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that Trp-141 is in a relatively less polar environment than Trp-159. The environment of a specific tryptophan can also be evaluated by its accessibility to collisional fluorescence quenchers (20Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). The Stern-Volmer constants (K D ) for Trp-141, Trp-159, and free tryptophan quenching with acrylamide and I− under native and denatured conditions were determined (TableII). In native ArsA Trp-141 is in an environment 3.3-fold less accessible to either I− or acrylamide than Trp-159, even though both Trp-159 and Trp-141 are almost equally accessible in denatured proteins by I− or acrylamide. Compared with free tryptophan, Trp-141 was 37-fold and 13-fold less accessible to I− and acrylamide, respectively, indicating that it is extremely shielded from the solvent. In denatured ArsA, Trp-141 was 11-fold and 6-fold more accessible by I− and acrylamide, respectively, than in the native enzyme, whereas accessibility of Trp-159 was increased by a factor of 3.6 and 1.5 for I− and acrylamide, respectively. However, the K D values for the denatured proteins were still lower than the K D values for free tryptophan, which may indicate that the proteins are not completely unfolded by guanidine HCl. Consistent with the results from fluorescence emission spectra presented above, the fluorescence quenching data also suggest that Trp-141 is located in a less polar region than Trp-159, possibly by proximity to negatively charged amino acid residues.Table IIAccessibility of Trp-141 and Trp-159 to collisional fluorescence quenchersW159H6W141H6l-TryptophanNativeDenatured2-aProteins were denatured by incubation in buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl for 3 min with continuous stirring followed by titration with KI or acrylamide.NativeDenatured2-aProteins were denatured by incubation in buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl for 3 min with continuous stirring followed by titration with KI or acrylamide.Potassium iodide13.60.33.311.2Acrylamide6.59.5211.725.1Values are Stern-Volmer quenching constants (K D (m−1)) obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-a Proteins were denatured by incubation in buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl for 3 min with continuous stirring followed by titration with KI or acrylamide. Open table in a new tab Values are Stern-Volmer quenching constants (K D (m−1)) obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the presence of both 1 mm ATP and 0.5 mm MgCl2, the emission spectrum of W159H6 ArsA exhibited a blue shift of about 5 nm, with an increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3 A,curve 1) compared with the absence of nucleotide (Fig.3 A, curve 3). Neither ATP nor MgCl2alone produced a change in fluorescence (data not shown), indicating that binding of the MgATP complex induced a conformational change that moves Trp-159 into a relatively more hydrophobic region. MgADP produced no change in the emission spectrum of W159H6 (Fig. 3 A,curve 2). In control experiments, MgATP was shown to have no effect on the fluorescence of free tryptophan or on denatured protein (data not shown). ArsA neither aggregates nor exhibits a change in light scattering properties upon addition of nucleotides (22Mei-Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so the fluorescence increase cannot be due to light scattering produced by aggregation. In contrast, when W141H6 was incubated with MgADP, the λmax exhibited a red shift of about 5 nm, with a decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3 B, curve 3) compared with the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 3 B,curve 1). Neither MgCl2 nor ADP alone produced a response (data not shown). Incubation of W141H6 with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP produced no change in the emission spectrum (Fig. 3 B, curve 2). The response of W141H6 to MgATP was more complicated. With time λmaxgradually red shifted, while the fluorescence intensity decreased (Fig.3 C). After 20 min the spectra of the samples with MgATP resembled that of W141H6 exposed to MgADP. The facts that the effect of ATP was time-dependent and that a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog gave no response suggest that only MgADP, the product of hydrolysis, produces a change in the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-141. Since the effect of MgADP is a red shift with a decrease in fluorescence intensity, the data suggest that binding of MgADP induces a movement of Trp-141 into a relatively more polar environment. Although MgATP induces an enhancement of the fluorescence of Trp-159, in wild type ArsA the enhancement was relatively low compared with the total tryptophan fluorescence. The signal-to-noise ratio was increased considerably in the single tryptophan containing W159H6 (Fig.4 A, curve 1) compared with the wild type his-tagged enzyme (Fig. 4 A,curve 2) when the amount of each protein was adjusted to equivalent concentrations of tryptophan residues. This enhancement allowed a more sensitive and detailed characterization of the MgATP-responsive signal. Although a sustained fluorescence enhancement was observed with a saturating concentration of MgATP (Fig. 4 A), enhancement was transient at 5 μm ArsA with 20 μm MgATP (Fig. 4 B, curve 1). If a second pulse of ATP was added following the decrease in fluorescence, a further transient increase was observed (Fig. 4 B, curve 1). Moreover, the rate of decay of the fluorescence signal correlated with the rate of phosphate released during ATP hydrolysis (Fig.5 A). Addition of neither MgADP (Fig. 4 C, curve 2) nor MgATPγS (Fig.4 C, curve 3) nor the combination of MgADP and phosphate (Fig. 4 C, curve 4) enhanced fluorescence. These results indicate that neither the binding of substrate nor the binding of products to ArsA is sufficient to cause the fluorescence change, suggesting that the increase in fluorescence was related to ATP hydrolysis rather than MgATP binding per se, reporting the conformation of an intermediate formed during the catalytic cycle. That premise was tested by examination of the fluorescence of W159H6 with a G18R substitution in the A1 P-loop or a G337R substitution in the A2 P-loop. These substitutions have been shown previously to eliminate nucleotide binding in their respective ATP binding sites (8Karkaria C.E. Chen C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the enzymes are catalytically inactive, they still bind nucleotide at the nonsubstituted site. Neither the G18R W159H6 (Fig.4 C, curve 5) nor the G337R W159H6 (Fig.4 C, curve 6) gave a fluorescence response following addition of MgATP, consistent with an association of Trp-159 movement and catalysis. Addition of MgADP to W141H6 produced a red shift in the λmax and a quenching of fluorescence, whereas MgATP produced a similar effect only at later times (Fig. 3 C). From the kinetics of the fluorescence quenching it appears that the addition of MgADP produced a rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 6, curve 1), whereas MgATP produced a slow change that took approximately 20 min to reach completion (Fig. 6, curve 2). Fluorescence quenching did not occur in the absence of MgCl2 and was reversed by the addition of EDTA (data not shown), indicating a requirement for Mg2+. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs AMP-PNP (Fig. 6,curve 3) and FSBA (Fig. 6, curve 4) had no effect on the fluorescence of W141H6. Moreover, FSBA inhibited the response to ATP (Fig. 6, curve 4). These results suggest that Trp-141 responds to binding of the product of the reaction, MgADP, and not to MgATP. The rate of quenching produced by MgATP correlated with the rate of ADP formation (Fig. 5 B). There was no effect of MgADP or MgATP on the fluorescence of W141H6 ArsA proteins with a G18R substitution in the A1 P-loop or a G337R substitution in the A2 P-loop (Fig. 6, curves 5–8). These proteins would still be expected to bind ADP at the nonsubstituted site, so occupancy of both sites may be required to produce the conformational change reported by Trp-141. However, the data clearly show that Trp-141 moves into a relatively more polar environment upon binding of MgADP and is a sensitive probe for the binding of the product of hydrolysis. The R773 ars operon confers arsenite and antimonite resistance to E. coli cells by encoding an ATP-coupled oxyanion pump that extrudes those toxic compounds out of the cell, lowering their intracellular concentration to subtoxic levels. The catalytic subunit of the pump, ArsA, is a 63-kDa protein that hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of Mg2+. It has a basal hydrolytic activity that is allosterically activated by antimonite or arsenite, which is accompanied by formation of a homodimer (4Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mei-Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ArsA has two consensus ATP binding motifs (6Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4210) Google Scholar), one in each of the A1 and A2 halves (5Chen C.-M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the A1 and A2 binding sites are required for resistance and catalysis (7Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Karkaria C.E. Chen C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on results from biochemical analysis (22Mei-Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), genetic complementation (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and intragenic suppression (10Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a model has been proposed in which the interface of an A1 and an A2 binding site forms a single catalytic unit (9Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the interface forms from the A1 and A2 domains of a single ArsA monomer or from intersubunit interactions. Wild type ArsA has four tryptophans located at positions 159, 253, 522, and 524 (5Chen C.-M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence can be used to investigate the interactions of ArsA with its ligands and that the fluorescence of Trp-159 is responsive to the interaction of ArsA with MgATP (15Zhou T. Liu S. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13622-13626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study single tryptophan-containing ArsA enzymes were used as sensitive probes of ligand interaction. An ArsA with a single tryptophan at residue 159 exhibited a large enhancement of fluorescence upon addition of MgATP, with a concomitant shift in λmax to lower wavelength. This increase of fluorescence intensity and the blue shift of emission spectrum of Trp-159 indicate that the interaction of ArsA with MgATP causes a specific conformational change that moves Trp-159 into a more hydrophobic environment. However, the addition of nonhydrolyzable MgATP analogs or the product, MgADP, did not produce a fluorescence change, nor did MgATP produce a change in inactive enzymes unable to bind nucleotide at either the A1 or the A2 site. Moreover, the fluorescence enhancement was transient and correlated with the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Thus it is likely that the fluorescence of Trp-159 is reporting a transient state of the enzyme formed during ATP hydrolysis. In addition, the loss of fluorescence response following inactivation of either nucleotide binding site supports our previous hypothesis that the A1 and A2 sites must interact to form a single catalytic unit (10Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,22Mei-Hsu C.M. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second single tryptophan-containing ArsA was constructed in which Phe-141 was altered to Trp-141. The substitution was neutral, having no effect on ATPase activity. Comparison of the emission spectra of Trp-141 and Trp-159 suggests that the former is in a more hydrophobic environment than the latter. In accordance with this idea, the fluorescence of Trp-141 was nearly unaffected by the collisional quencher KI, whereas Trp-159 was quenched readily. In contrast to Trp-159, the fluorescence of Trp-141 was quenched by MgADP. Although MgATP produced quenching, the response was slow and paralleled formation of ADP by hydrolysis, suggesting that Trp-141 responds only to the product of the reaction. Consistent with this, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs produced no quenching, nor did MgATP affect the fluorescence of catalytically inactive enzymes. Thus two aminoacyl residues separated by only 17 residues (F141DTAPTGHTIRLLQLPGAW159) respond quite differently to nucleotides. This sequence is conserved in the A2 half of ArsA and in homologs from every kingdom, including bacteria, archea, fungi, plants, and animals (Fig. 7). Although most of these homologs have been identified solely as open reading frames by nucleotide sequencing, the conservation of this sequence suggests that it is a functional domain. Interestingly, the human homolog has been implicated in arsenite resistance (23Kurdi-Haidar B. Aebi S. Heath D. Enns R.E. Naredi P. Hom D.K. Howell S.B. Genomics. 1996; 36: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In ArsA this sequence may be involved in ATP hydrolysis, since none of the conformational changes occurs with nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs or with catalytically inactive ArsA enzymes. By analogy, we would propose that this conserved domain is involved in ATP hydrolysis in homologs, which would, therefore, be ATPases. During ATP hydrolysis the COOH-terminal end of the domain moves into a more hydrophobic environment. As product is formed, the NH2-terminal end moves into a more hydrophilic environment. At the NH2 terminus of this domain is a conserved aspartate residue, corresponding to Asp-142 in the A1 half of ArsA. In preliminary experiments we have found that a D142N substitution results in an arsenite-sensitive phenotype, 2T. Zhou and B. P. Rosen, unpublished data. suggesting that Asp-142 may be of importance for the ATPase activity, perhaps functioning as a ligand to Mg2+ associated with the nucleotide. We hypothesize that the conserved domain of ArsA and homologs is an energy transduction domain that might be involved in transmission of the energy of ATP hydrolysis to other functions such as transport of arsenite through the ArsB subunit of the oxyanion pump."
https://openalex.org/W1966687765,"The small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, consisting of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 subfamilies, are implicated in various cell functions, such as cell shape change, cell motility and cytokinesis, through reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. Rho GDI is a general regulator which forms a complex with the GDP-bound inactive form of the Rho family members and inhibits their activation. We have purified Rho GDI from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cloned its gene, and named it RDII (Rho GD). In this study, we have further characterized yeast Rho GDI. Rho GDI was found in the cytosol by immunoblot and immunofluorescence microscopic analyses. Rho1p and Cdc42p were co-immunoprecipitated with Rho GDI from the cytosol. This immunoprecipitated Rho1p was mainly bound to GDP. In the disruption mutant of Rho GDI, which did not show any apparent phenotype, both Rho1p and Cdc42p were also present in the cytosol. These results indicate that yeast Rho GDI possesses properties similar to those of mammalian Rho GDI, and that there is a cytosolic factor which functionally substitutes for Rho GDI in yeast."

LpxAs from diverse Gram-negative bacteria display specificity for acyl-ACPs of different lengths (16Williamson J.M. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. J.

The released lipid product is designated as “bis-phospho-lipid A” throughout this paper.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus far, only conditional mutants of genes encoding the early lipid A biosynthetic enzymes have been identified, indicating that lipid A is required for growth (1Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar, 10Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5745-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). One lpxA mutation,lpxA2, has been extensively investigated (22Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32896-32903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strains carrying this mutation are temperature-sensitive and have little measurable LpxA activity at any temperature, as judged by assays of cell extracts. Mutants harboring lpxA2 also are characterized by a very low lipid A to glycerophospholipid ratio compared with wild type cells at 42 °C (22Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32896-32903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, such mutants have been shown to be supersusceptible to many antibiotics, perhaps due to the effect of the low lipid A content on outer membrane integrity (24Vaara M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2255-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Vuorio R. Vaara M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 37: 354-356Google Scholar). These features reinforce the idea that LpxA and certain other enzymes of LPS biosynthesis are targets for the design of new antibiotics (26Onishi H.R. Pelak B.A. Gerckens L.S. Silver L.L. Kahan F.M. Chen M.H. Patchett A.A. Galloway S.M. Hyland S.A. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. Science. 1996; 274: 980-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli lipid A activates the synthesis of cytokines and various other inflammatory mediators in macrophages (1Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar,5Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T.

Invest. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the lipid A molecules from some other organisms, for instance R. sphaeroides, are potent antagonists of that response in mouse and human cells (28Takayama K. Qureshi N. Beutler B. Kirkland T.N. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1336-1338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Golenbock D.T. Hampton R.Y. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3637-3638Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One major difference in the lipid A of R. sphaeroides, as compared with E. coli, is that the 3 and 3′ O-linked fatty acids are hydroxydecanoates rather than hydroxymyristates (18Qureshi N. Honovich J.P. Hara H. Cotter R.J. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5502-5504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Christ W.J. McGuinness P.D. Asano O. Wang Y. Mullarkey M.A. Perez M. Hawkins L.D. Blythe T.A. Dubuc G.R. Robidoux A.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3637-3638Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, subtle features of the structure of lipid A, especially the nature of the fatty acids at the ester-linked positions, appear to be important in triggering the activation of macrophages.We now report that the LpxA from Neisseria meningitidiscatalyzes the transfer of 3-hydroxylaurate from 3-hydroxylauroyl-ACP to the glucosamine 3-OH position of UDP-GlcNAc, as predicted from theN. meningitidis lipid A structure (20Kulshin V.A. Zähringer U. Lindner B. Frasch C.E. Tsai C.M. Dmitriev B.A. Rietschel E.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Karibian D. Deprun C. Szabō L. Le Beyee Y. Caroff M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1991; 111: 273-286Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To determine whether a foreign LpxA selective for a different fatty acid could substitute for the enzyme of wild type E. coli, we have introduced the N. meningitidis lpxA gene (31Steeghs L. Jennings M.P. Poolman J.T. van der Ley P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 190: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) on a plasmid into RO138, an E. coli strain harboring the lpxA2mutation (23Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32896-32903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strain, RO138/pTO6, has wild type growth characteristics. However, the lipid A isolated from RO138/pTO6 is extensively substituted with shorter than normal ester-linked hydroxy fatty acids. This new strain provides a system in which to investigate the effects of a specific lipid A modification on E. coligrowth and outer membrane function.DISCUSSIONThe enzyme LpxA is responsible for the incorporation of the 3 and 3′ O-linked hydroxy fatty acids found in the lipid A of Gram-negative bacteria (1Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). In E. coli these ester-linked fatty acids are (R)-3-hydroxymyristate (8Raetz C.R.H. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1235-1238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rietschel E.T. Brade L.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3591-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inN. meningitidis, they are (R)-3-hydroxylaurate (20Kulshin V.A. Zähringer U. Lindner B. Frasch C.E. Tsai C.M. Dmitriev B.A. Rietschel E.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Karibian D. Deprun C. Szabō L. Le Beyee Y. Caroff M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1991; 111: 273-286Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The LpxA enzymes from E. coli and other organisms have been shown to have a high specificity for the ACP thioester of the fatty acid found in the 3 and 3′ positions of their lipid A, compared with ACP thioesters of longer or shorter hydroxyacyl chains (12Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5159-5169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Williamson J.M. Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3591-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown in this study that, as expected, the N. meningitidis LpxA is specific for 3-hydroxylauroyl-ACP as the acyl donor substrate. How lpxA-encoded acyltransferases achieve their remarkable acyl chain selectivity is unknown. However, the crystal structure of E. coli LpxA was recently solved (36Raetz C.R.H. Roderick S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and further structural studies of LpxA enzymes having different selectivity may lead to the identification of the acyl chain measuring device in these unusual enzymes.The availability of N. meningitidis LpxA has made possiblein vivo investigations of lipid A molecules with different length acyl chains. The construction of an lpxA2 mutant strain complemented by N. meningitidis lpxA on a plasmid (RO138/pTO6) creates a system in which an E. coli strain produces lipid A molecules with hydroxydecanoyl and hydroxylauroyl chains at the O-linked 3 and 3′ positions. In wild typeE. coli and Salmonella, over 95% of the lipid A contains (R)-3-hydroxymyristate at the 3 and 3′ positions (7Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 9Rietschel E.T. Brade L. Lindner B. Zähringer U. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. I.

Chem. 1985; 260: 16080-16088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of N. meningitidis have revealed lipid A molecules with predominantly 3-hydroxylaurate (20Kulshin V.A. Zähringer U. Lindner B. Frasch C.E. Tsai C.M. Dmitriev B.A. Rietschel E.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Karibian D. Deprun C. Szabō L. Le Beyee Y. Caroff M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1991; 111: 273-286Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar,54Van Alphen L. Lugtenberg B. Rietschel E.T. Mombers C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), although some investigators note the presence of some 3-hydroxydecanoate in lipid A from strains of Neisseria (21Karibian D. Deprun C. Szabō L. Le Beyee Y. Caroff M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1991; 111: 273-286Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar,55Stead A. Main J.S. Ward M.E. Watt P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 88: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The lipid A from RO138/pTO6 contains approximately equal amounts of 3-hydroxydecanoate and 3-hydroxylaurate in the 3 and 3′ positions. This may be due to the relaxed selectivity toward acyl donor substrates ofN. meningitidis LpxA, which incorporates 3-hydroxydecanoate into UDP-GlcNAc in vitro at about 8% the rate with which it incorporates 3-hydroxylaurate. Also, 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP is a branch point metabolite in the biosynthesis of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in E. coli (23Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R.H. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32896-32903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pool of (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP in E. coli cells may be larger than that of (R)-3-hydroxylauroyl-ACP. If so, mass action would favor (R)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP as the substrate, and the percent of lipid A molecules containing (R)-3-hydroxydecanoate would be larger than expected from the kinetic analyses (Table II). The small fraction of the lipid A molecules containing 3-hydroxymyristate (Figs. 4 and 5) would probably be absent in a strain in which the E. coli chromosomallpxA gene was removed altogether and replaced by theN. meningitidis gene.On plates and in liquid media, at either 30 or 42 °C, the growth of RO138/pTO6 is indistinguishable from the equivalent strain carrying theE. coli lpxA gene (RO138/pTO7). In addition, RO138/pTO6 produces wild type levels of lipid A. These data demonstrate that all the lipid A biosynthetic enzymes (Fig. 1) can effectively utilize substrate analogs containing 3-hydroxylaurate and/or 3-hydroxydecanoate at the 3 and 3′ positions. Only one other E. coli mutant (msbB −) has been reported to grow with a modified lipid A structure, in this case with a penta-acylated lipid A (27Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Bainbridge B. Cunningham M.D. Darveau R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 56Clementz, T., Zhou, Z., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1997)J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar), rather than the usual hexa-acylated species (Fig. 1). Ours is the first description of an E. coli mutant with a modified lipid A that contains shorter, non-native hydroxyacyl chains.To date the only biological difference that we have found between RO138/pTO6 and RO138/pTO7 is the higher sensitivity of RO138/pTO6 to certain antibiotics at 42 °C. These types of antibiotics apparently cannot penetrate the outer membrane of wild type E. coli(24Vaara M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2255-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Vuorio R. Vaara M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 37: 354-356Google Scholar). Strains like RO138, with mutations in early lipid A biosynthetic genes, are hypersensitive to these antibiotics (24Vaara M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2255-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Vuorio R. Vaara M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 37: 354-356Google Scholar). At 30 °C, the lipid A molecules of RO138/pTO6 are sufficient to confer wild type levels of resistance, probably because some hydroxymyristate is incorporated (Table V). However, at 42 °C, RO138/pTO6 is significantly more susceptible to these antibiotics than are wild type strains, possibly because the shorter acyl chains at the 3 and 3′ positions of the lipid A result in a higher fluidity of the outer membrane of RO138/pTO6, as compared with wild type. This characteristic of RO138/pTO6 suggests that the acyl chain length ofE. coli lipid A is optimized to contribute to the protective function of the outer membrane. It will be interesting to investigateE. coli constructs expressing acyltransferases specific for even shorter acyl chains, such as those of Pseudomonas orRhodobacter. Conversely, the effects of replacing N. meningitidis lpxA with E. coli lpxA will also be of interest, especially with regard to N. meningitidispathogenesis.A possible application of E. coli strains producing modified lipid A molecules is in the biological production of LPS antagonists. Currently, such antagonists are chemically synthesized (30Christ W.J. McGuinness P.D. Asano O. Wang Y. Mullarkey M.A. Perez M. Hawkins L.D. Blythe T.A. Dubuc G.R. Robidoux A.L. J. Am. Chem.

The recently cloned P. aeruginosa lpxAencodes an acyltransferase that is specific for 3-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP as the acyl donor. 2Garry Dotson and Christian Raetz, manuscript in preparation. This gene, introduced on a plasmid, has been shown to correct the temperature sensitivity of RO138.2 It seems likely that the RO138 strain carrying the P. aeruginosa lpxA will be found to contain lipid A molecules with only 3-hydroxydecanoate in the 3 and 3′ positions. In combination with an msbB mutation, such strains (if viable) would have a lipid A structure almost identical to that of R. sphaeroides. The determination of whether such engineered lipid As are agonists or antagonists of LPS-induced responses in mammalian immune cells will be useful in defining the subtle structural features that are responsible for the bioactivity of lipid A-like molecules (5Rietschel E.T.

https://openalex.org/W2028187809,"High mobility group (HMG) proteins are thought to facilitate assembly of higher order chromatin structure through modulation of DNA conformation. In this work we investigate the bending of a 30-base pair DNA fragment induced by Chironomus HMG1 (cHMG1a), and HMGI (cHMGI) proteins. The DNA bending was measured in solution by monitoring the end-to-end distance between fluorescence probes attached to opposite ends of the DNA fragment. The distance was measured by fluorescence energy transfer using a novel europium chelate as a fluorescence donor. These measurements revealed that the end-to-end distance in the 30-base pair DNA was decreased from ∼100 Å in free DNA to ∼50.5 Å in cHMG1a·DNA complex. The most probable DNA bending angle consistent with these distance measurements is about 150°. The deletion of the charged regulatory domains located close to the C terminus of the HMG1 box domain of cHMG1a protein had no effect on the induced bend angle. The ability to induce a large DNA bend distinguishes the cHMG1 from the cHMGI protein. Only small perturbation of the DNA conformation was observed upon binding of the cHMGI protein. A strong DNA bending activity of cHMG1a and its relative abundance in the cell suggests that this protein plays a very important role in modulation of chromatin structure. High mobility group (HMG) proteins are thought to facilitate assembly of higher order chromatin structure through modulation of DNA conformation. In this work we investigate the bending of a 30-base pair DNA fragment induced by Chironomus HMG1 (cHMG1a), and HMGI (cHMGI) proteins. The DNA bending was measured in solution by monitoring the end-to-end distance between fluorescence probes attached to opposite ends of the DNA fragment. The distance was measured by fluorescence energy transfer using a novel europium chelate as a fluorescence donor. These measurements revealed that the end-to-end distance in the 30-base pair DNA was decreased from ∼100 Å in free DNA to ∼50.5 Å in cHMG1a·DNA complex. The most probable DNA bending angle consistent with these distance measurements is about 150°. The deletion of the charged regulatory domains located close to the C terminus of the HMG1 box domain of cHMG1a protein had no effect on the induced bend angle. The ability to induce a large DNA bend distinguishes the cHMG1 from the cHMGI protein. Only small perturbation of the DNA conformation was observed upon binding of the cHMGI protein. A strong DNA bending activity of cHMG1a and its relative abundance in the cell suggests that this protein plays a very important role in modulation of chromatin structure. Local modulation of DNA structure is an important event in the organization of chromatin. The TATA box-binding regulatory protein induces large conformational changes in DNA, in particular helix unwinding, widening of the minor groove and DNA bending (1Juo Z.S. Chiu T.K. Leiberman P.M.

Proteins carrying conserved HMG1 box domain (HMG1-BD) 1The abbreviations used are: HMG1-BD, HMG1 box domain; HMG, high mobility group protein; AMCA-NHS, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid, succinimidyl ester; AMCA(13)-S-S-Py,N-[6–7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; cHMG1, Chironomus HMG protein 1; cHMGI,Chironomus HMG protein I; bp, base pair(s); SRY, sex-determining region Y factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor. and the (K/R)XRGRP (AT-hook) motif have been found to modulate the DNA conformation by interacting primarily with the minor groove of DNA (for a review, see Ref. 2Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ∼80-amino acid HMG1-BD DNA-binding element is found in eukaryotic proteins involved in diverse physiological processes, including regulation of transcription and development (3Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1992; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Each of the HMG1-BDs falls in one of the two classes: those that do or do not recognize specific DNA motifs. The HMG1-BDs of sex-determining region Y factor (SRY) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF-1) are the best understood members of the first class. The highly abundant HMG1/2-type proteins and the upstream binding factor are examples of the second class. A common feature of all HMG1-BDs is their ability to distort the conformation of B-DNA. The induced DNA bend by HMG1-BD-carrying proteins is thought to facilitate organization of higher order chromosomal structure (for reviews, see Refs. 2Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

The angles of the DNA bend induced by binding of HMG1-BDs of SRY and LEF-1 proteins have been determined by the circular permutation assay (4Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R.

The NMR studies revealed that the HMG1-BDs of human SRY and mouse LEF-1 bend their target DNAs by 70–80° and 107–127°, respectively. The bending of DNA induced by binding of sequence nonspecific HMG1-BD has been only indirectly demonstrated, using the ligase-mediated circularization assay (9Pil P.M. Chow C.S. Lippard S.J. Proc.

The sequences flanking the HMG1-BD at its C terminus are able to modulate its affinity for DNA. Changes in the number of positive and negative charges within the C-terminal portion of the insect HMG1 protein (14Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17170-17177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) increase and decrease the DNA-binding affinity of the protein, respectively (15Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a C-terminal addition of mainly positively charged residues to the HMG1-BD (box B) of mammalian HMG1 (12Teo S.-H. Grasser K.D. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and of human LEF-1 (6Lnenicek-Allen M. Read C.M. Crane-Robinson C.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) resulted in an increase of their DNA-binding affinity. The presence of this extension has also been suggested to be essential for DNA bending by HMG1-BD of LEF-1 (6Lnenicek-Allen M. Read C.M. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An AT-hook DNA-binding motif is the characteristic feature of the proteins of the HMGI/Y family, which comprises four structurally related proteins: the mammalian proteins HMGI and HMGY (17Johnson K.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins containing several AT-hook motifs have been found in plants (for a review, see Ref. 21Grasser K.D. Plant J. 1995; 7: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) andDrosophila (D1 protein; Ref. 22Ashley T.C. Pendleton C.G. Jennings W.W Saxena A. Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of HMGI to a DNA fragment of the positive regulatory domain II of the β-interferon gene resulted in a reduction of a intrinsic curvature of a fragment by 13° (23Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this report we analyzed the conformational changes of a 30-bp DNA upon binding of the Chironomus HMG1a and HMGI proteins. Employing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) distance measurements, we found that the cHMG1a protein bent the 30-bp DNA fragment by about 150°. We also show that the changes in the DNA-binding affinity of cHMG1a produced by deletion of the charged sequences flanking the HMG-BD have no apparent effect on the angle of DNA bending. The binding of the cHMGI protein induced only a small perturbation of DNA conformation. AMCA-NHS (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid, succinimidyl ester) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, AMCA(13)-S-S-Py (N-[6–7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide) was from Pierce, and CY5 (monofunctionalN-hydroxysuccinimide ester) was from Amersham Corp. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid anhydride (DTPA anhydride) and EuCl3 were from Aldrich. All other chemicals were of highest purity commercially available. The thiol-reactive europium chelate, DTPA-AMCA(13)-S-S-Py, was prepared as described previously (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce NdeI restriction site to the N-terminal end of the coding region of the cHMGI cDNA clone (pCW126, Ref. 20Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the vector pGEM-T (Promega), cut withNdeI/EcoRI and ligated with theNdeI-EcoRI fragment of pET3a to give the expression constructs. The cloned DNA inserts were sequenced to verify that only the intended changes had occurred. For the induction of expression, the constructs were transferred to Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Bacteria carrying constructs for the expression of the cHMG1a protein and its deletion mutant cHMG1a/102 were prepared as described previously (15Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C in 5 ml of LB medium in the presence of 300 μg of ampicillin on a rotary shaker with 240 revolutions/min. A 12-h-old culture was used to inoculate 200 ml of fresh LB medium containing 20 mg of ampicillin. The culture was grown to an optical density of 0.4 measured at 600 nm. The expression of the HMG proteins was then induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 1 mm. The induced culture was shaken for an additional 2 h under the same conditions. The cells were harvested in a centrifuge at 4 °C with 5000 × g. Cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Proteins were extracted from bacteria with 5% HClO4 by three thawing-freezing cycles. The supernatants were acidified with HCl to 0.35 m, precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone, and dried under vacuum. The extracted proteins were chromatographed on a MONO S column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) using a NaCl gradient in 25 mm boric acid/NaOH, pH 9.4. The fractions containing recombinant proteins eluting as a major peak at about 0.4 mNaCl were pooled, desalted on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia), and lyophilized. Finally, the HMG proteins were re-chromatographed on a Zorbax 300 SB C-18 reverse-phase column using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water. The HMG1-BD of cHMG1a (cHMG1a/84) was prepared by a limited digestion of the cHMG1a with trypsin as described previously (15Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The donor-labeled upper strand was prepared by using two approaches resulting in two different donor-labeled DNA molecules, differing in a size of the linker between DNA and the fluorochrome. In a first approach a reactive thiol group was introduced to a 5′ end of the oligonucleotide by a post-synthetic modification with cystamine of the 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide (25Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3682-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and subsequent modification with thiol-reactive europium chelate (DTPA-AMCA(13)-S-S-Py; structure and properties described in Ref. 24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The product was purified by two successive Sephadex G-25 spin columns as described previously (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This modification reaction produced a donor-labeled oligonucleotide with a 17 atom linker between the 5′ phosphorus atom and the coumarin ring of the europium chelate. To prepare a donor-labeled oligonucleotide with a shorter linker, a novel two-step procedure was used. The procedure described below allows europium chelate modification of an aliphatic amino group-containing oligonucleotides. In the first step, the 5′ aliphatic amino group was introduced by a post-synthetic modification with ethylenediamine of a 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide using procedures analogous to those used for cystamine modification (25Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3682-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The 5′-amino oligonucleotide was then modified with AMCA-NHS by incubation of 10 μm oligonucleotide in 0.1m sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) for 4 h at room temperature with 2 mm AMCA-NHS. The excess of unreacted AMCA-NHS was removed on a Sephadex G-25 spin column, and the labeled oligonucleotide was further purified by high performance liquid chromatography using a 4.1 mm × 150-mm PRP-1 reverse phase column (Hamilton, Reno, NV). The column was run at 1 ml/min, and a linear gradient of 50 ml of 10–60% “B” was used. Buffer “A” was 25 mm triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0), and buffer “B” was 25 mm triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0) containing 50% acetonitrile. Fractions containing AMCA-labeled oligonucleotide were pooled and were dried in Speed-Vac (Savant Instruments Inc., Holbrook, NY). In the second step, 7-amino group of DNA-bound AMCA was modified with DTPA anhydride. Dry AMCA-labeled oligonucleotide was dissolved in 0.2 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.7) and was reacted with DTPA anhydride (20 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The excess of unreacted DTPA was removed by running the sample twice through a Sephadex G-25 spin column. This two-step procedure results in donor-labeled DNA with a 6-atom linker between 5′ phosphorus atom and the coumarin ring of europium chelate. The structure of the europium chelate itself (Fig. 1 B) is identical to the thiol-reactive europium chelates described previously (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Figure 1A, modified 30-bp DNA used in our energy transfer experiments.

C, binding of the cHMG1a protein (circles) and cHMGI protein (squares) to fluorochrome-modified 30-bp DNA. The binding was monitored by measuring changes in fluorescence polarization (40Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) of the acceptor (CY5). The excitation was at 647 nm, and the emission was observed at 670 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CY5-labeled complementary oligonucleotide was prepared and purified using methods described previously (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To prepare fluorochrome-labeled DNA duplexes, equimolar amounts of europium chelate-labeled 30-nucleotide oligonucleotide were mixed with unlabeled complementary strand (donor-only 30-bp DNA) or with CY5-labeled complementary 30-nucleotide oligonucleotide (donor-acceptor 30-bp DNA) in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl containing 10 μm EDTA. The mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 30 s and were allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Europium chloride (EuCl3) was added to hybridized DNA samples to a concentration of 5 μm, and after 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the excess of europium was removed on a Sephadex G-25 column. The labeled DNA was stored at −20 °C until needed. Steady-state fluorescence and polarization measurements were performed on a SLM 500C spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL) equipped with an L-format polarization accessory. Luminescence lifetime measurements were performed on a laboratory-built two-channel spectrofluorometer with a pulsed nitrogen laser (LN300, Laser Photonics, Orlando, FL) as an excitation source (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This instrument allows simultaneous acquisition of donor decay (at 620 nm) and sensitized acceptor decay curves (at 670 nm). The decay curves were analyzed according to Equation 1.I=∑αiexp(−t/τi)Equation 1 I is the measured intensity at time tafter the excitation pulse, and α i and τ i are the amplitude and the lifetime of the ith decay component, respectively. The decay curves were fitted to Equation 1 by a non-linear regression using SCIENTIST (Micromath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT). The energy transfer (E) between europium chelate and CY5 was calculated from measurements of luminescence lifetime of a donor in the absence (τd) and in the presence of acceptor (τda).E=1−τd/τdaEquation 2 The distances between donor and acceptor were calculated according to Förster theory (26Förster T.

The R o was calculated using standard procedures (28Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar, 29Clegg R.M.

The quantum yield of europium in europium chelates was assumed to be 1 in 100% D2O (27Selvin P.R. Hearst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10024-10028Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The quantum yields of europium chelates in water and in water/D2O mixtures were calculated from Equation 5.qd=τd/τd(100%D2O)Equation 5 τd is a lifetime in water or water/D2O mixture, and τd(100% D2O) is a lifetime in 100% D2O. All fluorescence experiments were performed in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8), 80 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 μm EDTA. In some experiments 1 mm MgCl2 was included, but the results were essentially identical to those in buffer with no magnesium. The overall design of the experiments was to use the changes in the end-to-end distance of a DNA fragment induced by binding of the cHMG proteins to determine the extent of DNA deformation (bending). The end-to-end distance was measured in solution using FRET between fluorescence probes attached to the opposite ends of a DNA fragment. Fig.1 (A and B) shows a design of the fluorochrome-labeled 30-bp DNA molecules. The term donor-only DNA is used in this work to refer to a 30-bp DNA molecule with an europium chelate attached to the 5′ end of the upper strand. The donor-acceptor DNA refers to a 30-bp DNA with an europium chelate attached to the 5′ end of the upper strand and CY5 fluorochrome attached to the 5′ end of the lower strand. We used europium chelates as donors in FRET measurements because these luminescence probes offer several important advantages compared with organic dye fluorochromes traditionally used for FRET experiments (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Selvin P.R. Hearst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10024-10028Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 30Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). TheR 0 value of europium chelate-CY5 donor-acceptor pair calculated from absorbance and fluorescence emission spectra of the 30-bp fluorochrome-labeled DNA samples (data not shown) was 55 Å, a value identical to the one reported previously (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both the cHMG1a and cHMGI proteins were able to form a complex with fluorochrome-labeled 30-bp DNA, as illustrated by DNA binding experiments in solution using polarization of fluorochrome-labeled DNA fluorescence as an indicator of protein-DNA complex formation (Fig.1 C). Fluorescence anisotropy values of DNA complexes with cHMG1a and cHMGI were different, although the molecular mass values of these proteins are similar (12.9 kDa (14Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17170-17177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 10.4 kDa (20Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively), suggesting that the conformation of protein-DNA complex in both cases was different. The stoichiometry of cHMG1a·DNA complexes is not well established. In the presence of cHMG1a, there are probably two major species in solution (free DNA and a 1:1 protein-DNA complex) because: (i) protein concentrations used (0–1100 nm) for FRET measurements were not saturating (see Fig.1 C), (ii) the binding of cHMG1a to a short DNA fragment was shown to be non-cooperative (15Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (iii) cHMG1a was shown to preferentially bind to AT-rich sequences (14Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17170-17177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our 30-bp DNA fragment contains a 11-bp stretch of A and T nucleotides at its center, which should promote preferential binding of a single cHMG1a molecule to the center of the DNA fragment (binding site size for cHMG1a was shown to be 11–13 bp; Ref. 15Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the decay curves for donor-only 30-bp DNA in the absence and in the presence of cHMG1a. The decays were rigorously single-exponential in the absence and in the presence of cHMG1a, and the lifetimes of donor decay were not significantly changed in the presence of the protein. These data suggest that the donor molecules were not significantly perturbed by the binding of the protein to DNA. Such insensitivity of europium chelate decay to its microenvironment when attached to a macromolecule was observed previously (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Single-exponential decays of donor-only samples allow straightforward analysis of the effects observed in donor-acceptor DNA. Fig. 3 shows the decay curves of europium luminescence in donor-acceptor labeled 30-bp DNA in the absence of cHMG1a, with 250 nm cHMG1a, and with 1100 nmcHMG1a (Fig. 3, A–C, respectively). Without the protein, the donor decay was rigorously single-exponential and the determined lifetime was slightly smaller in comparison to donor-only sample (TableI). With cHMG1a, the decay could no longer be fitted to a single-exponential function and a satisfactory fit could only be obtained using double-exponential function. The longer lifetime component decayed with a lifetime essentially identical to the one observed in the absence of the protein. The amplitude of this component decreased with an increase in protein concentration (Fig. 3, B and C). Therefore, we concluded that this component corresponded to a population of DNA molecules that were not bound to the protein. As already discussed, the concentrations of cHMG1a used in luminescence decay experiments were not saturating; thus, the presence of free DNA was expected. The shorter lifetime component (∼200 μs) appears only in the presence of cHMG1a with donor-acceptor DNA, and its amplitude increases with an increase of cHMG1a concentration. Thus, we concluded that this component corresponded to donor-acceptor 30-bp DNA complexed with cHMG1a. The smaller value of the lifetime of this component compared with a lifetime of donor-only DNA molecule suggests that the end-to-end distance of 30-bp DNA in complex with cHMG1a was drastically decreased compared with free DNA.Table ISummary of energy transfer distance measurements in 30-bp DNA fragment in the absence and in the presence of cHMG1a protein and its deletion mutantsSample1-aThe results obtained with donor attached to DNA using a shorter linker (6-atom) are shown in this table.Lifetime1-bIn the case of multiexponential decays (donor-acceptor + protein samples), the lifetime shown is a component assigned to a protein-DNA complex.Energy transferDistanceμsEÅDonor602.9 ± 2Donor + cHMG1a616.7 ± 7Donor-acceptor586.4 ± 30.027 ± 0.01100.0 ± 10Donor-acceptor + cHMG1a226.0 ± 220.63 ± 0.0450.3 ± 1.5Donor + cHMG1a/102614.0 ± 1Donor-acceptor + cHMG1a/102233.0 ± 230.62 ± 0.0450.7 ± 1.5Donor + cHMG1a/84606.0 ± 4Donor-acceptor + cHMG1a/84243.9 ± 470.60 ± 0.0851.4 ± 3.01-a The results obtained with donor attached to DNA using a shorter linker (6-atom) are shown in this table.1-b In the case of multiexponential decays (donor-acceptor + protein samples), the lifetime shown is a component assigned to a protein-DNA complex. Open table in a new tab The assignment of the ∼200-μs component to a DNA in complex with cHMG1a was corroborated by two additional experiments. First, the decay of a sensitized acceptor emission in donor-acceptor DNA was measured in the presence and absence of cHMG1a (Fig.4). In the case of the europium chelate-CY5 pair used in our studies, a lifetime of a donor is in the microsecond range and the lifetime of an acceptor is in the nanosecond range. Thus, any emission of the acceptor recorded in microsecond time scale would be originating from acceptors that were excited by FRET (24Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Selvin P.R. Hearst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Consequently, the lifetime of sensitized acceptor fluorescence should reflect the lifetime of the donor engaged in FRET. Without the protein (Fig. 3 A), only a small background fluorescence is observed (the energy transfer in free DNA is very small, about 2% see Table I). Addition of the protein produced a large increase in the sensitized emission of the acceptor (Fig. 4,B and C) confirming a drastic increase of FRET in donor-acceptor 30-bp DNA with cHMG1a. The major component of sensitized acceptor emission decayed with a lifetime of ∼200 μs, essentially identical to the lifetime of a short component of donor decay. These data confirmed the assignment of a ∼200-μs component to DNA in complex with cHMG1a. A very short-lived component (∼20 μs) could be also observed in sensitized acceptor decays with the protein. Its nature is unclear, since this short-lived component could be observed only in sensitized emission of acceptor but not in donor decay measured directly. Therefore, the ∼2"

Recent crystallographic structures reveal the structural changes that occur when antithrombin is activated by the heparin pentasaccharide, with the exception of the final changes, which take place at the reactive center itself. Here we show that the side chain of the P1 Arg of α-antithrombin is only accessible to modification by the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase on addition of the heparin pentasaccharide, thereby inactivating the inhibitor, whereas the natural P1 His variant, antithrombin Glasgow, is unaffected, indicating that only the P1 Arg becomes accessible. Furthermore, the deimination of P1 Arg converts antithrombin to a form with 4-fold higher affinity for the heparin pentasaccharide, similar to the affinity found for the P1 His variant, due to a lowered dissociation rate constant for the antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex. The results support the proposal that antithrombin circulates in a constrained conformation, which when released, in this study by perturbation of the bonding of P1 Arg to the body of the molecule, allows the reactive site loop to take up the active inhibitory conformation with exposure of the P1 Arg.

The plasma serpin (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), antithrombin, is the major inhibitor of the serine proteinases of the coagulation network, especially thrombin and factor Xa (2Olson S.T. Bjork I. Berliner L.J. Thrombin: Structure and Function. Plenum Press, New York1992: 159-217Crossref Google Scholar). This inhibitory activity is stimulated by the complexing of antithrombin with the sulfated polysaccharide, heparin. In particular, the activity against factor Xa is mediated by a core pentasaccharide component of heparin. Antithrombin has an initial low affinity for heparin, but this immediately changes to a high affinity on initial binding, the change occurring concomitantly with the activation of inhibitory function (3Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of the heparin pentasaccharide with antithrombin and the associated mechanism of conformational activation of inhibition has recently been revealed in the crystal structure of a dimer of antithrombin complexed with the pentasaccharide (4Carrell R.W. Skinner R. Jin L. Abrahams J.-P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Linkage between the two antithrombin molecules in the dimer directly involves the reactive site loop of the inhibitory component, with a consequent constraint in the movement at its reactive site. Hence, while showing the commencement of the movement of the reactive site loop that results in activation, the crystal structure does not show the change that occurs at the reactive center itself. There is, however, a good model of the likely unconstrained active conformation of the reactive site loop of antithrombin. This is provided by the structure of the closely related serpin, α1-antitrypsin (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), in which the loop is fixed in the optimal canonical inhibitory conformation present in all other families of serine proteinase inhibitors. The transition of antithrombin to this conformation would require a shift of the side chain of the P1 arginine from an internally oriented position where it is hydrogen-bonded to the body of the molecule (6Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), to an external and exposed orientation, as found for the P1 residue of α1-antitrypsin. Furthermore, the perturbation of the bonding of the side chain of P1 Arg in antithrombin, as occurs in the natural variant antithrombin Glasgow (P1 Arg to His), is accompanied by a shift from low to high affinity binding of heparin (7Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This has led to the proposal (6Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 7Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that antithrombin is, in part, held in a conformation with initial low heparin affinity by the constraints on reactive site loop movement imposed by the internal bonding at the side chain of P1 Arg. To check these proposals, normal antithrombin and the Glasgow P1 His variant were each incubated, with and without the heparin pentasaccharide, with the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase (hereafter referred to as deiminase) (EC. 3.5.3.15), which acts on the side chain of arginine residues to produce the amino acid citrulline. We show that this enzyme interacts with the P1 Arg side chain, which is only vulnerable to modification in the presence of the heparin pentasaccharide. The deimination of the P1 Arg converts antithrombin to a form with higher affinity for the heparin pentasaccharide. Peptidylarginine deiminase was purchased from PanVera Corp., Madison, WI. Heparin pentasaccharide was a gift from Maurice Petitou, Sanofi Recherche, Toulouse, France. Thrombin was a gift from Professor Stuart Stone, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

Factor Xa was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Lewes, UK). The chromogenic substrate S2238 1The abbreviations used are: S2238,H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline hydrochloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl] glycine. was purchased from Quadratech (Epsom, UK). Plasma from a patient containing the variant antithrombin Glasgow was a gift from Dr. Isobel Walker, Glasgow, UK. Ampholine PAGplates for isoelectric focusing and Superdex 75 were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (St. Albans, UK). Normal α-antithrombin was purified from time-expired, slow bleed units of human plasma as described previously (10McKay E.J. Thromb. Res. 1981; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using a combination of heparin-Sepharose and anion exchange chromatography. Antithrombin Glasgow was purified as described (7Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with the high affinity variant eluting later on the salt gradient from heparin-Sepharose, distinct from the peak for normal α-antithrombin. The forms of antithrombin were pure as judged by PAGE (data not shown). Antithrombin (10 μm) was incubated with the deiminase at 37 °C at a molar ratio of 50:1 (inhibitor:enzyme) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, for up to 16 h in the presence or absence of heparin pentasaccharide (50 μm). The reaction was stopped using 50 mm EDTA. The deiminated antithrombin was separated from both the heparin pentasaccharide and the deiminase using gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex-75 column (1.6 × 35 cm = 70 ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 m NaCl, 10 mm citrate, 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.4. The eluted antithrombin was concentrated using centrifugal ultrafiltration on a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff device and buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmcitrate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Antithrombin (control and deiminated) at 4 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was incubated with heparin pentasaccharide (50 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C, following which 120 ng of human neutrophil elastase was added. The mixture was allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C, following which an equal volume of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and the whole boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was run on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels (11Shagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), following which proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (12Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The band corresponding to the low molecular mass subunit of cleaved antithrombin was sequenced by Alta Biosciences, Birmingham, UK. Antithrombin (200 nm) was incubated with thrombin (5 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C, following which residual activity was measured against 40 μm S2238 substrate, all in 20 mmNaH2PO4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (m/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4 (buffer with ionic strength of 0.3 (I0.3 buffer)). The time of incubation and concentration of antithrombin were chosen to ensure that normally active antithrombin should inactivate thrombin to completion at the end of the incubation period. This criterion was seen to be fulfilled for control samples. The equilibrium binding constants for the interaction between the antithrombins and the heparin pentasaccharide were determined by fluorometric titrations in I0.3 buffer as described (13Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The rapid kinetics of heparin pentasaccharide binding to antithrombin in I0.3 buffer were determined using stopped flow fluorometry essentially as described (3Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on 7.5% Tris/glycine gels (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing was carried out on precast Ampholine PAGplates (Pharmacia) using ampholytes in the range from pH 4 to pH 6.5. Incubation of antithrombin with deiminase at molar ratios of enzyme:inhibitor greater than 1:50, in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide, resulted in complete inactivation of antithrombin, as judged by its ability to inhibit thrombin under defined assay conditions, within 2 h. Lower enzyme:inhibitor ratios such as 1:100 and 1:200 resulted in less inactivation and longer times of incubation were required. No inactivation was found in the absence of heparin pentasaccharide. The site and number of residues of arginine modified by deiminase in α-antithrombin was deduced by comparison with the effects of deiminase on antithrombin Glasgow, a natural variant of antithrombin with a mutation of P1 Arg to His. Antithrombin, in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide, was modified such that its mobility in isoelectric focusing gels became more anodal, while antithrombin Glasgow was not changed in its mobility (Fig.1). Since no Arg residues were therefore modified in antithrombin Glasgow and as it only differs from normal antithrombin at the P1 position, these data strongly indicate that α-antithrombin is modified at a single site only, which is likely to be the P1 Arg. The site of modification was further examined using cleaved deiminase-treated antithrombin (deiminated antithrombin) and control α-antithrombin. Each of these was cleaved within their reactive site loops, using human neutrophil elastase (15Jordan R.E. Kilpatrick J. Nelson R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), thus generating the C-terminal fragment of antithrombin, which was electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride after separation on SDS-PAGE. This permitted N-terminal sequencing at the reactive site of antithrombin, since the sequence from the cleavage point of human neutrophil elastase should begin: AVIAGRSLNPNR, with theR representing the reactive site P1 Arg. N-terminal sequencing of control α-antithrombin showed the expected sequence, but sequencing of deiminated antithrombin revealed that the reactive site arginine had indeed been changed to a citrulline residue. Arg-399 was not altered, however. This confirmed the earlier hypothesis, generated by comparison with antithrombin Glasgow, that the reactive site residue had been modified and all the evidence indicates this is the only residue altered. Since it was previously shown that antithrombin Glasgow, which has a substitution of its P1 Arg residue, had increased affinity for heparin, as judged by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (7Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the affinity of both antithrombin Glasgow and deiminated antithrombin were measured in comparison with normal α-antithrombin. This was carried out using fluorometric titrations against the heparin pentasaccharide and revealed that both antithrombin Glasgow and deiminated antithrombin had higher affinity for the pentasaccharide than α-antithrombin, the gain being about 4.4-fold in both cases (TableI).Table IEquilibrium binding constants and rapid kinetic constants for the binding of heparin pentasaccharide to antithrombins at an ionic strength of 0.3Form of antithrombinK dk onk offnmμ m·s −1s −1α-Antithrombin555 ± 4111.4 ± 0.447.2 ± 0.65Antithrombin Glasgow121 ± 611.9 ± 0.42.02 ± 0.65Deiminated antithrombin135 ± 1111.7 ± 0.63.0 ± 0.55 Open table in a new tab The reason for the higher affinity binding of the pentasaccharide was investigated by determining the rapid kinetics of the interaction between the antithrombins and the heparin. It has been shown previously (3Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Olson S.T. Srinivasan K.R. Bjork I. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that antithrombin binds heparin in a two-step procedure, which may be evaluated using stopped flow fluorometry to assess the speed at which the antithrombin increases its intrinsic fluorescence upon binding heparin. When the kinetics of heparin pentasaccharide binding to antithrombin Glasgow were evaluated in this way, it was found that the increase in its affinity for pentasaccharide was due to a lower dissociation rate constant for the interaction (Fig.2 and Table I). This is most accurately and easily measured by stopped flow experiments at low heparin concentrations at ionic strengths of 0.3 (3Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this technique was applied directly to the deiminated antithrombin which was isolated in limited quantities, and it was shown to have the same profile as antithrombin Glasgow, with its dissociation rate constant lowered to a similar degree, while its association rate constant was unaffected, as for antithrombin Glasgow (Fig. 2 and Table I). The results of this study answer two central questions with respect to the heparin activation of antithrombin. First, it was shown that the side chain of P1 Arg only becomes available for modification by the deiminase after the addition of the pentasaccharide. This is in keeping with the prediction (5Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) that the release of the reactive site loop from its insertion into the A-β-sheet will allow the loop to adopt the canonical inhibitory conformation found in α1-antitrypsin (Fig.3). There is clear evidence that binding of the pentasaccharide results in an exposure of P1 Arg in a uniquely accessible position, the accessibility of this arginine side chain paralleling that of the P1 Arg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, which is fixed in the exposed canonical inhibitory conformation and is similarly uniquely available for deiminase modification (17Takahara H. Okamoto H. Sugawara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8378-8383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confirmation that it is the P1 Arg that is modified by the deiminase in the pentasaccharide-activated antithrombin, is provided by amino acid sequencing of the reactive site loop after deliberate cleavage with human neutrophil elastase, which shows that there is a citrulline at position P1. The evidence strongly indicates that only the P1 Arg is affected, as shown in parallel experiments with antithrombin Glasgow, which varies only in having P1 His and does not change in electrophoretic mobility on incubation with the deiminase, with or without added pentasaccharide. The concept that the conformation of antithrombin was constrained with respect to inhibitory activity and that heparin released this constraint to give optimal activity as inherently present in α1-antitrypsin arose from the finding that the mutant α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh, with an arginine at P1, was a potent thrombin inhibitor (18Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The reactive site loop of antithrombin becomes more exposed in the presence of heparin, as shown by its increased susceptibility to proteinase cleavage (15Jordan R.E. Kilpatrick J. Nelson R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 777-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,19Chang W.S. Wardell M.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), by NMR studies (20Gettins P.G. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and fluorescence studies (21Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All of these studies fit with a reactive loop rearrangement and activation as modeled in Fig. 3. The second question we have addressed relates to these concomitant changes in activation and heparin affinity; specifically whether the linkage of the side chain of P1 Arg to the body of the molecule is an inherent contributor to the structural constraints that limit the inhibitory activity and heparin affinity of circulating antithrombin. This was proposed based on the findings that antithrombins in which the P1 Arg has been replaced by a His (7Owen M.C. Beresford C.H. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Lane D.A. Lowe G.D. Flynn A. Thompson E. Ireland H. Erdjument H. Br. J. Haematol. 1987; 66: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or Pro (8Owen M.C. George P.M. Lane D.A. Boswell D.R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) had an increased heparin affinity. This view was strengthened by the crystallographic finding of the internal orientation and hydrogen bonding of the P1 Arg to the body of the molecule (6Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). If this bonding is a significant contributor to the structural constraints of inhibitory antithrombin, then modification of the side chain should release the constraint with a predictable increase in heparin affinity, as is indeed demonstrated here. The P1-deiminated antithrombin had a 4-fold increase in pentasaccharide affinity, due to a lowered dissociation constant, paralleling that present in antithrombin Glasgow, for which we have also shown (but not published) a similar 3-fold increased affinity for full-length heparin. The current structures of pentasaccharide-complexed active and latent antithrombins (4Carrell R.W. Skinner R. Jin L. Abrahams J.-P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) show the conformational basis for this increased affinity. The pentasaccharide induces a series of changes at its binding site on antithrombin, with a tilting of the D-helix, a shift at the commencement of the A-helix and the induction of a new 2-turn helix. These changes bring a series of side chains into a stable alignment for linkage to the pentasaccharide. This conformational change at the heparin binding site is accompanied by a transition at 30 Å distance, which releases the reactive site loop from the A-β-sheet, the two changes being linked by a series of intervening conformational shifts. Reactive loop expulsion is therefore linked to the transition to the high affinity state for heparin. A recent mutation of antithrombin, which stabilized the molecule in a reactive loop expelled form, had high affinity for heparin (21Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), most likely because it tended to be stabilized in the high affinity state. We propose that a similar mechanism occurs for antithrombin Glasgow and deiminated antithrombin, stabilizing the molecule into a high affinity state and thus lowering the dissociation constant for heparin binding. Taken together, the recent series of structures of antithrombin (4Carrell R.W. Skinner R. Jin L. Abrahams J.-P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R.

Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the data presented here, allow an overall view of the mechanism of heparin activation to be formed. Tempting though it is to describe this in terms of a sequential series of changes radiating from the heparin binding site, it is better to consider the transition as the consequence of the release of the broader constraints that hold the molecule in its low activity conformation. These constraints include: the partial insertion of the reactive site loop into the A-β-sheet, the stability of the partially opened A-β-sheet, and, as shown here, the bonding of P1 Arg to the body of the molecule. Perturbation of any of these constraints, as has already been demonstrated with loop insertion (21Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and A-β-sheet stability (25Bruce D. Perry D.J. Borg J.Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), will result in the reversion toward the unconstrained, high heparin affinity conformation. Thus the addition of heparin is just a special example of an induced loss of constraint, which results in reversion to a relaxed-loop inhibitory conformation. The initial low affinity of antithrombin for the pentasaccharide reflects the equilibrium between the unconstrained loop-expelled conformation, in which the pentasaccharide is tightly bound, and the constrained loop-inserted conformation, with more ready dissociation of the pentasaccharide. It follows from this that the loss of a structural constraint, as with perturbations of P1 Arg, will favor the loop-expelled, unconstrained conformation with the associated decrease in the pentasaccharide dissociation rate constant, as observed here. All of these findings fit with the deductions, from the initial finding of a P1 Arg mutant of α1-antitrypsin (18Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), that α1-antitrypsin acts as a model for heparin activated antithrombin. This earlier finding, that P1Arg-α1-antitrypsin had a thrombin inhibitory activity greater than antithrombin in the absence of the pentasaccharide, has been reinforced by a recent study of Hopkins and colleagues. 2P. C. R. Hopkins, R. N. Pike, and S. R. Stone, submitted for publication. They have shown that a more extensive mutation of the reactive site loop of α1-antitrypsin to give the reactive center P4-P3′ sequence present in antithrombin, IAGRSLN, results in an increase in inhibitory activity against factor Xa, an enzyme which is more sensitive to the reactive site loop conformation of antithrombin than thrombin, approximating to that of pentasaccharide activated antithrombin. Both functionally and structurally the model shown in Fig. 3 therefore provides a satisfying explanation of the changes that occur at the reactive center of antithrombin on heparin activation. In particular, these changes involve a shift at the heparin binding site to give the high affinity conformation with a concomitant breaking of the conformational constraint contributed by the linkage of P1 Arg to the body of the molecule, together with a movement of the side chain of P1 Arg to an exposed external orientation, likely to resemble the P1 canonical orientation seen in α1-antitrypsin. We thank Dr. Isobel Walker for her gift of plasma containing the antithrombin Glasgow variant."
https://openalex.org/W2327628680,"The v-ski oncogene promotes cellular transformation and myogenic differentiation. In quail embryo fibroblasts the two properties are displayed simultaneously and terminal muscle differentiation occurs only among cells already transformed by v-ski. To understand how the two phenotypes are derived from a single gene, we have undertaken to identify functionally important regions in v-ski and to test whether these regions can promote one phenotype without the other. We have generated both random and targeted mutations in v-ski and evaluated the effects of these mutations on expression, intracellular location, transformation, and myogenesis. Among a total of 26 mutants analysed, we have not found complete separation of the myogenic and transforming properties. Mutations in the region of v-Ski encoded by exon 1 of c-ski frequently abolish both its transformation and muscle differentiation activities, whereas mutations outside of this region are always tolerated. When expressed in cells from a minigene containing only the exon 1 sequence, the protein displays the transforming and myogenic activities similar to v-Ski. These results argue that the amino acid sequence encoded by exon 1 contains the core functional domain of the oncoprotein. To determine whether this functional domain has a structural counterpart, we have fragmented the v-Ski protein by limited proteolysis and found a single proteolytically stable domain spanning the entire exon 1-encoded region. Physical studies of the polypeptide encoded by exon 1 confirms that it folds into a compact, globular protein. The finding that both the transforming and myogenic properties of v-Ski are inseparable by mutation and are contained in a single domain suggests that they are derived from the same function."
https://openalex.org/W2048082777,"Recently, it was reported that the activity of rabbit P450 1A2 is markedly increased at elevated salt concentration (Yun, C-H., Song, M., Ahn, T., and Kim, H. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 31312–31316). The activity increase of P450 1A2 coincides with the raised α-helix content and decreased β-sheet content. The presence of phospholipid magnified this effect. Here, possible structural change of rabbit P450 1A2 accompanying the phospholipid-induced increase in its enzyme activity was investigated by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and absorption spectroscopy. Studies with the reconstituted system supported by cumene hydroperoxide or NADPH showed that the P450 1A2 activities were found to be dependent on the head group and hydrocarbon chain length of phospholipid. Phosphatidylcholines having short hydrocarbon chains with a carbon number of 8–12 were very efficient for reconstitution of the P450-catalyzed reactions supported by both cumene hydroperoxide and NADPH. It was found that the phospholipid increased the α-helix content and lowered the β-sheet content of P450. Intrinsic fluorescence intensity is also increased in the presence of phospholipid. The low spin iron configuration of P450 1A2 shifted toward the high spin configuration by most of the phospholipids in the endoplasmic reticulum. Some synthetic phospholipids having short hydrocarbon chains with a carbon number of 10–12 caused a shift in the spin equilibrium of P450 1A2 toward low spin. The effect of detergents on the activity and conformation of P450 1A2 was also studied. It was found that the addition of detergents to P450 1A2 solution increased the enzyme activity of P450 1A2. Detergents also increased the α-helix content and lowered the β-sheet content of P450 1A2. Intrinsic fluorescence emissions also increased with the presence of detergents. Octyl glucoside and deoxycholate caused a shift toward high spin. On the other hand, cholate caused a shift toward low spin. It was found that the activity increase of rabbit P450 1A2 coincides with the conformational change including raised α-helix content. It is proposed that the interaction with the phospholipid molecules surrounding P450 1A2 in the endoplasmic reticulum is important for a functional conformation of P450 1A2 in a monooxygenase system including NADPH-P450 reductase. Recently, it was reported that the activity of rabbit P450 1A2 is markedly increased at elevated salt concentration (Yun, C-H., Song, M., Ahn, T., and Kim, H. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 31312–31316).

It is proposed that the interaction with the phospholipid molecules surrounding P450 1A2 in the endoplasmic reticulum is important for a functional conformation of P450 1A2 in a monooxygenase system including NADPH-P450 reductase. The microsomal monooxygenase metabolizes a variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. This enzyme system includes cytochrome P450 (P450) 1The abbreviations used are: P450, cytochrome P450 (EC 1.14.14.1, also termed heme-thiolate protein P450 by the Enzyme Commission (1Palmer G.

Cytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase may also contribute to the electron flow (2Porter T.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13469-13472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P450-dependent activities can be reconstituted by mixing P450, NADPH-P450 reductase, and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (3Lu A.Y.H. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1331-1332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Strobel H.W. Lu A.Y.H. Heidema J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4851-4854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase seem to be distributed randomly on the plane of membranes, and they interact through lateral diffusion (5Taniguchi H. Imai Y. Sato R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 232: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Wu E.-S. Yang C.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the organization of constituent proteins in phospholipid membranes and their mechanism of interaction are not fully understood yet. P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase have been reported to interact by forming a functional complex for the electron transfer (7Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, P450 is present in the membrane in large excess over the reductase, with the molar ratios ranging from 10:1 to 25:1, depending on treatment with inducers (8Peterson J.A. Ebel R.E. O'Keeffe D.H. Matsubara T. Estabrook R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4010-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Estabrook R.W. Franklin M.R. Cohen B. Shigamatzu A. Hildebrandt A.G. Metabolism. 1971; 20: 187-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Since NADPH-P450 reductase is the limiting component in microsomes, different P450 enzymes must compete for the available reductases. Phospholipid molecules in the immediate vicinity of P450 in rabbit liver microsomes have been known to be highly organized as compared with those in bulk membrane (10Stier A. Sackmann E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 311: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The functional properties of many proteins in biological membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, seem to be closely related to the microenvironment provided by membrane lipids (11Coleman R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 300: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 12Vessey D.A. Zakim D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3023-3028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that the increase of P450 activities in a reconstituted system by the addition of phospholipid or detergent was mainly due to the increased interaction between P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase. It was also suggested that the interaction of phospholipid with P450 may be necessary for maintaining an active protein conformation and its ability to interact with NADPH-P450 reductase and necessary for efficient electron transfer (13French J.S. Guengerich F.P. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4112-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The P450 1A2 is one of P450 enzymes that is induced by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. It was demonstrated that the stimulated activity of P450 1A2 by the high concentration of salt accompanies structural change of P450 1A2 in the presence of phospholipid (14Yun C.-H. Song M. Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31312-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It seems worthwhile, therefore, to study the structural changes of P450 1A2 induced by phospholipid in detail to elucidate the relationship between the structure and the activity. The catalytic reactions by cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH) are studied to evaluate the role of the protein conformation in the catalytic function and to see how the environment of the heme is influenced by the conformational change induced by phospholipid and detergent. The relationship between phospholipid- or detergent-induced conformational changes and activities of the P450 is discussed. Here, the hydroperoxide system instead of NADPH-P450 reductase and NADPH is used to follow the change in the P450 1A2 conformation without a complicating effect of another protein, NADPH-P450 reductase. Sodium cholate, sodium deoxycholate, CHAPS, octyl glucoside, CuOOH, and most of the phospholipids (DDPC, DUPC, DLPC, DMPC, DPPC, DSPC, DAPC, DBPC, DLPE, DMPE, DPPE, DSPE, BBPC, BBPE, PS, PA, PI, PG, CL, and lyso-PC) were from Sigma. DCPC was obtained from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (Englewood Cliffs, NJ). 7-Ethoxycoumarin, Triton X-100, Triton X-102, and Tween 20 were obtained from Aldrich. 7-Ethoxyresorufin and resorufin were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Emulgen 911 and 913 were kindly provided by Dr. T. Shimada (Osaka Prefectural Institute of Public Health, Osaka, Japan). Other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. The phospholipid vesicles or micelles were prepared by hydrating a dry films in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), followed by sonication under nitrogen gas while cooling on ice. Titanium particles and any residual multilamellar structures were removed by centrifugation. The phospholipid concentration was determined as described previously (15Vaskovsky V.E. Kostetsky E.Y. Vasendin I.M. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 114: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The vesicles were freshly prepared and added to the P450 solution just before the activity assay and the spectral studies. It has been shown that P450 1A2 can be incorporated into preformed phospholipid vesicles (16Ingelman-Sundberg M. Glaumann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 599: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). P450 1A2 was purified from liver microsomes of 5,6-benzoflavone-treated rabbits as described (17Alterman M.A. Dowgii A.I. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1990; 4: 221-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The P450 1A2 was electrophoretically homogeneous and had a specific P450 content of 17 nmol/mg protein. NADPH-P450 reductase was purified to an apparent homogeneity from phenobarbital-treated rabbits as described (18Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. Raven Press, New York1994: 1259-1313Google Scholar). For the assay, two different approaches were taken to examine the effect of phospholipid and detergent on the P450 1A2 activity using the method described elsewhere with slight modification (14Yun C.-H. Song M. Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31312-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the NADPH-P450 reductase-supported reactions, 0.5 nmol of P450 1A2, 0.6 nmol of NADPH-P450 reductase, 15 μg of phospholipid or detergent, and an NADPH-generating system were mixed together. The volume of the reaction mixture in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) was 0.5 ml. Reactions were initiated by adding 2 μl of either 7-ethoxycoumarin (to 50 μm) or 7-ethoxyresorufin (to 5 μm) as the substrates. When the reaction was supported by CuOOH, each incubate contained 0.5 nmol of P450 1A2 and 15 μg of phospholipid or detergent in addition to the same concentrations of the substrates and phosphate buffer as described above for the NADPH-P450 reductase-supported reactions. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μl of CuOOH (to 0.1 mm). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, and the products were estimated fluorometrically as was described elsewhere for the assay of 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation (19Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7931-7939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 7ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation (20Pohl R.J. Fouts J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Protein was assayed using a bicinchoninic acid procedure according to the manufacturer's directions (Pierce). P450 concentrations were determined by Fe2+-CO versus Fe2+difference spectroscopy (21Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All spectroscopic experiments were done in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 25 °C using the methods described elsewhere with slight modification (14Yun C.-H. Song M. Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31312-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was measured on a Shimadzu RF5301 PC spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo) in a thermostated cuvette. Circular dichroic spectra were recorded on a Jasco J700 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo) in a thermostated cuvette. Blanks (buffer with or without phospholipid/detergent) were routinely recorded and subtracted from the original spectra. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 16 spectrophotometer (Norwalk, CT). Stock solutions of P450 1A2 and NADPH-P450 reductase contained 20% glycerol, but the final glycerol concentrations in all experiments were kept below 0.2%, since glycerol affects the NADPH-P450 reductase-mediated reactions (22Voznesensky A.I. Schenkman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14669-14676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the protein structure (14Yun C.-H. Song M. Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31312-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,23Timasheff S.N. Arakawa T. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 331-345Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of the head group and acyl chain length of phospholipids on the enzyme activity of P450 1A2, we examined the P450 1A2-catalyzed reaction in the presence of different types of phospholipids. The enzymatic activity of P450 1A2 was quantified by measuring its ability to catalyze theO-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin and 7-ethoxyresorufin. The activities toward both 7-ethoxyresorufin and 7-ethoxycoumarin, as determined in the presence of CuOOH in place of the reductase and NADPH, increased by 10–38% when BBPC or BBPE was added to the P450 1A2 solution (Table I). When lyso-PC was added, there were no changes in enzymatic activities. In the presence of negatively charged lipids, PS, PI, or PG, a substantial increase in the P450 1A2 activities (38–86%) was observed. PA and CL, on the other hand, inhibited P450 1A2-catalyzed reactions by 40–78%. Although mixed PC with various acyl chain lengths has been known to be an essential component of the microsomal P450 monooxygenase system, DLPC, a synthetic phospholipid, has been widely used for the reconstituted system (3Lu A.Y.H. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1331-1332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Strobel H.W. Lu A.Y.H. Heidema J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4851-4854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of the acyl chain length of phospholipids on the P450 1A2 activities using PC with a chain carbon number of 8–22 (Table I). PC is the major phospholipid in the endoplasmic reticulum. DCPC, DDPC, DUPC, and DLPC, having short hydrocarbon chains with a carbon number of 8–12, were very efficient for reconstitution of the CuOOH-supported reaction, and the activities increased by 50–124%. DMPC, DPPC, DSPC, DAPC, and DBPC having a chain carbon number of 14–22 were less efficient than PC with short hydrocarbon chains and showed the increase of activities by 32–48%. We also checked the chain length effect of PE, another major phospholipid in the endoplasmic reticulum. The effect of hydrocarbon chain length of PE is similar to that of PC. These results indicate that the chain length of both PC and PE exerts an effect on the P450 1A2-catalyzed reaction. When the reconstituted system contained P450 1A2, NADPH-reductase, and NADPH, it was observed that the activities were also dependent upon the type of phospholipids (Table I). In the presence of BBPC, there was a 24–32% reduction in the activities of P450 1A2. When BBPE was added, there was no change in the activities. The addition of the negatively charged phospholipids to P450 1A2 solution caused the 1.4–3.1-fold increase in the activities. PI among them was the most efficient to reconstitute the P450 1A2-catalyzed reactions. These results indicate that certain anionic phospholipids may be important for the reconstitution. The effect of hydrocarbon chain length of PC on the P450 1A2 activities was also shown. When the synthetic PC with a chain carbon number of 8–12 was added to the P450 1A2 solution, the activities increased 1.6–4.2-fold. DDPC was the most efficient at reconstituting the P450 1A2 activities. The phospholipids with a chain carbon number of 14–22 were less efficient. Some of them inhibited up to 32% of the P450 1A2 activities. It is possible that an inefficient transfer of electrons from NADPH to P450 1A2 in the presence of PC vesicles with long hydrocarbon chains may cause the decreased catalytic activities. We also investigated the effect of detergents on the P450 1A2 activities, because several detergents have been used for the P450 purification procedure and for the P450 reconstitution system (24Lu A.Y.H. Levin W. Kuntzman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Viner R.I. Novikov K.N. Ritov V.B. Kagan V.E. Alterman M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of detergents with the exception of deoxycholate was routinely observed and provided about 1.2–1.9-fold enhancement depending on the head group type and chain length when CuOOH was present (Table II). With the reconstitution system containing P450 1A2, NADPH-P450 reductase, and NADPH in addition to detergent, it was observed that the activities increased up to 2.4-fold. In the case of cholate and octyl glucoside, there were no apparent changes of turnover numbers. These results may be due to the differential effect of each detergent on the conformation of P450 1A2 itself and also on the interaction of P450 1A2 with NADPH-P450 reductase.Table IEffect of phospholipid on the catalytic activities of P450 1A2PhospholipidActivity7-EthoxycoumarinO-deethylation7-EthoxyresorufinO-deethylationCuOOHNADPHCuOOHNADPHnmol product/min/nmol P450None0.1360.1200.0800.182BBPC0.1490.0820.1010.138DCPC0.2110.2950.1520.511DDPC0.2790.5080.1790.706DUPC0.2370.3720.1630.599DLPC0.2040.2250.1310.297DMPC0.1850.1030.1060.173DPPC0.1890.1030.1110.155DSPC0.1880.1080.1100.146DAPC0.1840.0820.1150.142DBPC0.1850.0960.1180.144Lyso-PC0.1290.2390.0830.495BBPE0.1630.1220.1100.186DLPE0.1880.1010.0960.173DMPE0.1650.0880.1060.138DPPE0.1890.1300.1010.129DSPE0.1820.1130.1100.164PS0.2310.1790.1490.260PI0.2270.3710.1120.479PA0.0720.3040.0480.411PG0.1900.1780.1100.264CL0.0410.2120.0180.351The experimental protocols were set up as outlined in the general procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” for 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation and 7-ethoxycoumarinO-deethylation.

Rates are shown (means of duplicate experiments) for the reconstituted P450 1A2 system supported by NADPH-P450 reductase or CuOOH set up in the presence of the indicated detergent. It was reported that the absorption spectrum of P450 1A2 is sensitive to its own concentration and to the ionic strength of the solution (26Haugen D.A. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7929-7939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the concentration of P450 1A2 was 1 μm and the concentration of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was 100 mm, the spectrum was almost entirely originated from the absorption by the oxidized P450 1A2 in the presence of phospholipid or detergent without light scattering due to aggregation. Therefore, all of the spectroscopic studies were performed under these conditions. The effect of phospholipid and detergent on the secondary structure of the P450 1A2 was studied by CD in the far UV region. Fig.1 A shows the CD spectra of P450 1A2 in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of various types of PC and PE, the major phospholipids in the endoplasmic reticulum (27Depierre J.W. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 411-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The CD spectra were curve-fitted by the least squares method into the reference spectra obtained from five proteins: myoglobin, lysozyme, ribonuclease A, papain, and lactate dehydrogenase (28Yang J.-T. Wu C.-S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Analysis of the CD spectrum for the P450 1A2 in the absence of phospholipid and detergent yielded 32% α-helix, 24% β-sheet, 23% β-turns, and 21% random structure (TableIII). When various types of PC and PE, which have been known to have a high affinity on P450, were added, the α-helix content generally increased, while the amounts of β-sheet, β-turns, and random structure decreased (Fig. 1 A and TableIII). The CD spectra of P450 1A2, obtained in the presence of synthetic PC with a chain carbon number of 8–12, showed an increase of α-helix content by 11–16% (Fig. 1 A and Table III). However, the effect of PC and PE with a chain carbon number of 8–12 was smaller than that of these phospholipids with a chain carbon number of 14–22. Overall, PE seems to be more effective in increasing the α-helix content of P450 1A2 than PC. Lyso-PC was also efficient at increasing the α-helix content and decreasing β-sheet and random structures of P450 1A2.Table IIIEffect of phospholipid and detergent on the secondary structure contents of P450 1A2Additionsα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnRandom%None32 ± 124 ± 223 ± 221 ± 1Phospholipids BBPC50 ± 120 ± 211 ± 219 ± 2 DCPC43 ± 122 ± 316 ± 219 ± 3 DDPC45 ± 115 ± 222 ± 218 ± 2 DUPC45 ± 113 ± 122 ± 120 ± 2 DLPC48 ± 117 ± 117 ± 118 ± 1 DMPC50 ± 115 ± 314 ± 221 ± 2 DPPC48 ± 117 ± 220 ± 315 ± 3 DSPC50 ± 113 ± 420 ± 317 ± 2 DAPC51 ± 116 ± 318 ± 315 ± 2 Lyso-PC52 ± 125 ± 18 ± 215 ± 2 BBPE54 ± 113 ± 123 ± 310 ± 2 DLPE49 ± 113 ± 322 ± 316 ± 2 DMPE51 ± 116 ± 220 ± 213 ± 2 DPPE53 ± 113 ± 220 ± 314 ± 2 DSPE54 ± 112 ± 222 ± 212 ± 1 PS42 ± 116 ± 416 ± 426 ± 2 PA48 ± 11 ± 131 ± 220 ± 2Detergents Deoxycholate46 ± 315 ± 121 ± 117 ± 1 Cholate46 ± 313 ± 124 ± 117 ± 2 Tween 2051 ± 316 ± 112 ± 121 ± 2 Lubrol WX52 ± 122 ± 27 ± 219 ± 2 CHAPS48 ± 120 ± 116 ± 216 ± 2 Octyl glucoside47 ± 114 ± 123 ± 116 ± 1All CD spectra were recorded in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing components present in the additions.

To investigate the lipid specificity for the induction of secondary structure of the P450 1A2, a comparison was also made between zwitterionic (PC and PE) and anionic phospholipids (PS, PI, PA, PG, and CL). Fig. 1 B shows the CD spectra of P450 1A2 in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer in the presence of different anionic phospholipids. For both PS and PA, the spectra with two minima at 208 and 222 nm were observed, and the percentage of α-helix was calculated to be 42 and 48%, respectively (Table III). Although PS induced a substantial increase in α-helical structure (Fig.1 B, Table III), it is less than what PC, PE, and PA brought about. The observed difference in α-helical content of the P450 1A2 upon interaction with different phospholipids is most probably due to the head group specificity of the interaction. However, upon interaction with other negatively charged phospholipids, PG, CL, and PI, a decrease in CD spectral intensity of P450 1A2 was shown. It was not possible in these cases to curve fit the CD spectra to estimate the secondary structures using the reference spectra (28Yang J.-T. Wu C.-S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). It is possible that the P450 1A2 aggregates in the presence of PG, CL, or PI with an apparent molecular weight larger than its basic oligomeric structure of P450 1A2 (29Guengerich F.P. Holladay L.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5442-5449Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows the effect of detergents on the CD spectra of P450 1A2. All of the detergents showed an effect on the CD spectra of P450 1A2 similar to that of most phospholipids. All of the detergents increased the α-helix content by 14–20% and lowered β-sheet content by 2–11% (Table III). The intrinsic fluorescence of P450 1A2 reflects mainly the individual environments of its intrinsic fluorophores, Trp, which are spaced evenly throughout its sequence (30Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence spectra of P450 1A2 obtained in the presence of various types of phospholipids are shown in Fig.2. The fluorescence intensity increased in the presence of phospholipids, but there was no appreciable change in the λmax value except for the case of PS (Fig.2 B). This indicates that the change brought about by phospholipids reduces the quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence in the P450 1A2, but otherwise the overall environment of the intrinsic fluorophore appears to be remain unchanged. We did not observe any further change in fluorescence intensity when the concentration of phospholipid was increased (data not shown). When PC with a chain carbon number of 8–12, which increased the P450 1A2-catalyzed reactions supported by both of CuOOH and NADPH, and DLPE were present, the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of the P450 1A2 increased by about 30–60% as compared with in the absence of phospholipid (Fig. 2 A). Other PC and PE were less efficient in increasing the intrinsic fluorescence intensity. When DMPC, DPPC, DSPC, DAPC, or DBPC was added to the P450 1A2 solution, the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of P450 1A2 were similar to that of BBPC (data not shown). In the case of DMPE, DPPE, and DSPE, the spectra were similar to that of BBPE (data not shown). The addition of lyso-PC to the P450 1A2 solution caused a 2-fold increase in the intrinsic fluorescence intensity. The effect of the negatively charged phospholipids on the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of P450 1A2 was similar to those of the PC or PE with a chain carbon number of 10–12. Interestingly, the addition of PS to the P450 1A2 solution caused the typical red shift of the λmax from 330 to 335 nm, which indicated that some fluorophores were exposed to more hydrophilic environments. The detergents also increased the fluorescence intensity of P450 1A2 at λmax = 330 nm (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that the stimulation of catalytic activity by phospholipid and detergent involves the increased secondary structure as well as the change of the overall conformation of P450 1A2. The P450 1A2 exists as a mixture of high and low spin iron forms with corresponding absorption peaks at 395 and 414 nm, respectively. Fig. 3 gives the absorption spectra of P450 1A2 complexed with different types of phospholipids (Fig. 3, A and B) and detergents (Fig. 3 C). The spectra obtained in the absence of phospholipids and detergents are also given for comparison. When BBPC, BBPE, or lyso-PC was present, the absorption spectra shifted toward the high spin state in the spin equilibrium (Fig. 3, A andD). But the spectra shifted toward the low spin in the presence of synthetic PC or PE with a chain carbon number of 10–12. When the negatively charged phospholipids, PS, PI, PG, and CL, were added to the P450 1A2 solution, the absorption spectra shifted toward the high spin state (Fig. 3, B and E). Fig. 3,C and F, show the effects of detergents on the P450 1A2 spin state. Deoxycholate and octyl glucoside shifted the equilibrium toward the high spin state, but cholate shifted the equilibrium toward the low spin state. In contrast, no apparent changes were noted in the spin equilibrium in the case of CHAPS, Tween 20, and Lubrol WX. We could not obtain the spectra in the presence of Triton X-100, Triton X-102, Emulgen 911, or Emulgen 913 because of the high light scattering of the detergents (data not shown). The importance of the interaction of P450 with phospholipids in microsomes was recognized early on (3Lu A.Y.H. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1331-1332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Strobel H.W. Lu A.Y.H. Heidema J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4851-4854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC has been known to be an essential component in a reconstituted P450 monooxygenase system. The effect of phospholipids on P450 activities seems to be the result of their influences on the interaction between P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase for the electron transfer (31Voznesensky A.I. Schenkman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15724-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Imaoka S. Imai Y. Shimada T. Funae Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6063-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although synthetic DLPC and microsomal PC with varying lengths of acyl chain have been known to be very effective in the reconstituted P450 monooxygenase system (4Strobel H.W. Lu A.Y.H. Heidema J. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4851-4854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of phospholipid on the P450 conformation without a complicating effect of NADPH-P450 reductase is not fully understood yet. Although some attempts were made to see the effect of phospholipid on the P450 conformation (33Ingelman-Sundberg M. Haaparanta T. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4100-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Chiang Y.-L. Coon M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Coon M.J. Autor A.P. Strobel H.W. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1971; 3: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these were apparently overshadowed by glycerol, which is usually used to stabilize the P450. The addition of glycerol to the P450 1A2 solution induced an appreciable increase in the α-helix and decrease in the β-sheet content (14Yun C.-H. Song M. Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31312-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was reported that P450 1A2-catalyzed reactions in the DLPC system proceeded at a rate more than twice that in the egg yolk PC vesicles, but no pronounced differences were seen in NADPH oxidase activity between the two types of reconstituted systems (36Ingelman-Sundberg M. Johansson I. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4004-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The short synthetic phospholipid, DLPC, forms small micelles instead of bilayers (37Miwa G.T. Lu A.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The membranous reconstitution system has been shown to exhibit different P450 activities than the micellar DLPC system (36Ingelman-Sundberg M. Johansson I. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4004-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was also observed that P450 has different affinities for the NADPH-P450 reductase in different phospholipid vesicles (16Ingelman-Sundberg M. Glaumann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 599: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Ingelman-Sundberg M. Glaumann H. FEBS Lett. 1977; 78: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that each phospholipid may show the differential effect on the conformation of P450 itself and also on the interaction of P450 with NADPH-P450 reductase. It was found that some detergents such as Emulgen 911, Emulgen 913, Triton N-101, Triton X-100, Triton X-114, CHAPS, and Lubrol PX could substitute for phospholipid in a reconstituted P450 system (24Lu A.Y.H. Levin W. Kuntzman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Viner R.I. Novikov K.N. Ritov V.B. Kagan V.E. Alterman M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ionic detergents such as cholate and deoxycholate were found to be rather ineffective. It was suggested that the role of phospholipid is physical rather than chemical and that both DLPC and certain detergents form micelles of appropriate dimensions to facilitate interaction between P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase. It was also reported that the negative charge of the membrane is important for the catalytic activity of P450 2B4 (33Ingelman-Sundberg M. Haaparanta T. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4100-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that some typical P450 substrates, inhibitors, cytochrome b 5, or high salts can cause a shift in the spin equilibrium of P450 1A2 toward high spin (24Lu A.Y.H. Levin W. Kuntzman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,39Sandhu P. Guo Z. Baba T. Martin M.V. Tukey R.H. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem.

It has also been reported that detergents, several P450 substrates, or alcohols influence the conversion of rabbit and rat P450 1A2 from a high to low spin iron configuration (26Haugen D.A. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7929-7939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41White R.E. Coon M.J. J. Biol.

Wright S.T. Martin M.V. Kaminsky L.S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6019-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effect of most of the phospholipids, except the PC with a small chain carbon number of 10–12, on P450 1A2 is very similar to their effect on P450 2B4. The effect includes the configurational change toward the high spin state (33Ingelman-Sundberg M. Haaparanta T. Rydström J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4100-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been reported that there is no correlation between the spin state and the catalytic activity of the rat P450s in reconstituted systems and that not all of the P450s exhibited a relationship between the spin state and reduction potential (42Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the possible correlation between the increased enzyme activity and the conformational change of the P450 1A2 when the protein interacts with various types of phospholipids or detergents. The ability of the P450 1A2 to adopt the α-helix conformation has been proposed to be important for the high enzymatic activity (14Yun C.-H. Song M. Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31312-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This investigation established that the conformation of P450 1A2 is highly dependent on the presence of phospholipid and detergent. The results clearly show that all of the phospholipids and detergents tested here can increase the α-helix content and lower the β-sheet content of P450 1A2. Intrinsic fluorescence emissions also increased with the presence of all of the phospholipids (except for PS) and detergents. The low spin iron configuration of P450 1A2 shifted toward the high spin configuration in the presence of the phospholipids including PC and PE and detergents. These phospholipid- or detergent-induced conformational change coincided with elevated activity of P450 1A2-catalyzed reactions. These structural studies revealed a strong interaction of the P450 1A2 with phospholipid and detergent. It was impossible to determine whether the high α-helix content of P450 1A2 induced by phospholipid and detergent was the cause of the increased catalytic activity or if the high α-helix contents were simply parallel phospholipid- or detergent-induced phenomena without direct connection. Since the P450 is in close contact with phospholipids in the endoplasmic reticulum, the conformation of P450 1A2 induced by phospholipid may actually be the physiologically active form, which has high affinity for the NADPH-P450 reductase. The stimulation of the activity by phospholipid is consistent with the conformational change of P450 1A2 in addition to the stimulated interaction between P450 and NADPH-P450 reductase. Changes in the lipid microenvironment are likely to control how one of many P450s in the endoplasmic reticulum couples with a reductase present in relatively small amounts. It is also possible that the binding of a specific substrate alters the α-helix:β-sheet ratio of P450, allowing coupling with a reductase. The picture now emerging from this and previous studies (14Yun C.-H. Song M. Ahn T. Kim H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31312-31316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) on the interaction of the P450 1A2 and phospholipid is that the P450 1A2 binds preferentially to phospholipids present in the membrane. The P450 1A2 with high α-helix content and low β-sheet content appears to have a high affinity to NADPH-P450 reductase. The conformation of P450 1A2 should be important for the enzymatic activity and the interaction with NADPH-P450 reductase for an efficient electron transfer."

Inactivation of PAF was preceded by the release of PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity, which reached a plateau by 3–5 min and paralleled the release of β-hexosaminidase, a marker of mast cell exocytosis. Immunochemical and molecular biological studies revealed that the PAF-AH released from activated mast cells was identical to the plasma-type isoform. In support of the autocrine action of exocytosed PAF-AH, adding exogenous recombinant plasma-type PAF-AH markedly reduced PAF accumulation in activated BMMC. Furthermore, culture of BMMC with a combination of c-kit ligand, interleukin-1β and interleukin-10 for > 24 h led to an increase in plasma-type PAF-AH expression, accompanied by a reduction in stimulus-initiated PAF production. Collectively, these results suggest that plasma-type PAF-AH released from activated mast cells sequesters proinflammatory PAF produced by these cells, thereby revealing an intriguing anti-inflammatory aspect of mast cells.

Mast cells are highly specialized effector cells of the immune system which, when activated, release various biologically active molecules including histamine, proteoglycans, and proteases through exocytosis, arachidonic acid-derived mediators such as eicosanoids through activation of the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, and preformed and newly expressed cytokines (1Stevens R.L.

Lewis R.A. Razin E. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2958-2964PubMed Google Scholar). PAF has been implicated in a number of physiological and pathological processes, particularly allergy and inflammation, affecting the respiratory, vascular, digestive, and reproductive systems (3Hanahan D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 483-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Suga K. Kawasaki T. Blank M.L. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12363-12371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its accumulation is usually tightly regulated at the biosynthetic and degradative levels to avoid the inappropriately high accumulation observed in many diseases. PAF production often parallels immediate eicosanoid generation (5Ramesha C.S. Pickett W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7592-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the remodeling pathway for PAF biosynthesis proposed to occur in inflammatory cells, Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 may play a role in the production of both lysoPAF and arachidonic acid from 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, then acetyltransferase is thought to introduce an acetyl residue from acetyl-CoA to the sn-2 position of lysoPAF leading to the formation of biologically active PAF (3Hanahan D.J.

Intracellular PAF-AH type I (PAF-AH-I) is a heterotrimer complex composed of 45-, 30-, and 29-kDa subunits (16Hattori M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18748-18753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 45-kDa subunit, which is not essential for catalytic activity, exhibits striking homology (99%) with a protein encoded by the causal gene (LIS-1) for Miller-Dieker lissencephaly, a human brain malformation manifested by a smooth cerebral surface and abnormal neural migration (17Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Nature. 1994; 370: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The 30- and 29-kDa subunits, which are highly homologous with each other, belong to a novel type of serine proteases, and a sequence of ∼30 amino acids adjacent to their active serine residues exhibits significant similarity to the first transmembrane region of the PAF receptor (18Hattori M.

PAF-AH type II (PAF-AH-II) is a monomeric 40-kDa protein that exhibits broader substrate specificity than PAF-AH-I in that PAF-AH-II hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids as effectively as PAF, whereas PAF-AH-I is more specific for PAF (20Hattori K.

Plasma-type PAF-AH displays significant homology (∼40%) with intracellular PAF-AH-II, but not PAF-AH-I, over the whole sequence (21Hattori K. Adachi H. Matsuzawa A. Yamamoto K. Tsujimoto M. Aoki J.

In agreement with this similarity, plasma-type PAF-AH catalyzes hydrolysis of PAF and structurally related oxidized phospholipids (23Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G.

Pretreatment of animals with recombinant plasma-type PAF-AH has been shown to block PAF-induced inflammation (23Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S.

Interestingly, deficiency of plasma-type PAF-AH is an autosomal recessive syndrome that is associated with severe asthma in Japanese children (25Miwa M. Miyake T. Yamanaka T. Sugatani J. Suzuki Y. Sakata S. Araki Y. Matsumoto M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), in which a point mutation of exon 9 of the plasma-type PAF-AH gene results in production of inactive protein (26Stafforini D.M. Satoh K. Atkinson D.L. Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Yoshida H. Imaizumi T. Takamatsu S. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Gray P.W. Prescott S.M. J. Clin.

These observations, together with the finding that PAF receptor transgenic mice are more susceptible to methacholine-induced bronchial hypersensitivity than normal littermates (27Ishii S. Nagase T. Tashiro F. Ikuta K. Sato S. Waga I. Kume K. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), imply that PAF and plasma-type PAF-AH are involved in propagating and terminating allergic reactions, respectively.Although circulating blood is rich in plasma-type PAF-AH, the source of this enzyme in the extravascular space is poorly understood. Plasma-type PAF-AH activity increased dramatically in the peritoneal cavities of guinea pigs with endotoxic shock (28Karasawa K. Kuge O. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Nakano Y. Tomita M. Yokoyama K. Setaka M. Nojima S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that PAF-AH accumulating at inflamed sites is not only exudated from plasma but is also produced by tissue cells. Macrophages are likely to be one of the main sources of extravascular plasma-type PAF-AH, since monocytes have been shown to produce plasma-type PAF-AH during differentiation into macrophages (23Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Here we report that mast cells are a rich source of plasma-type PAF-AH. Plasma-type PAF-AH released from mast cells activated by various stimuli degrades PAF produced by these cells, revealing an anti-inflammatory property of mast cells during allergic and non-allergic inflammation.DISCUSSIONPlasma-type PAF-AH has potentially important physiological and pathological roles because of its ability to abolish the diverse effects of PAF and oxidized phospholipids, including inflammation, shock, and thrombosis (6Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that decreased degradation of these biologically active lipid molecules results in pathological responses. In plasma, PAF-AH is associated with lipoprotein particles and has been implicated in atherosclerosis, where it functions as a scavenger of oxidized phospholipids in modified low density lipoprotein (22Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acquired PAF-AH deficiency has been described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (34Tetta C. Bussolino F. Modena V. Montrucchio G. Segoloni G. Pescarmona G. Camussi G. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1990; 91: 244-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and septic shock (35Graham R.M. Stephens C.J. Silvester W. Leong L.L. Strurm M.J. Taylor R.R. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 22: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Increased levels of PAF have been reported in children with acute asthmatic attacks (36Hsieh K.-H. Ng C.-K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1993; 91: 650-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and inherited plasma-type PAF-AH deficiency, caused by a point mutation in exon 9 which leads to complete abolition of catalytic activity (26Stafforini D.M. Satoh K. Atkinson D.L. Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Yoshida H. Imaizumi T. Takamatsu S. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Gray P.W. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), has been observed in the Japanese population, especially in children with severe asthma (25Miwa M. Miyake T. Yamanaka T. Sugatani J. Suzuki Y. Sakata S. Araki Y. Matsumoto M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that mast cells are a potent source of plasma-type PAF-AH. The fact that the main effector cell of allergic inflammation, the mast cell, has the capacity to secrete this anti-inflammatory enzyme into the surrounding microenvironment provides new insight into the regulation of local and systemic allergic responses and is an unexplored anti-inflammatory aspect of mast cells.IgE-dependent and -independent activation of BMMC elicited immediate PAF generation (Fig. 1), which occurred in association with the other two well characterized immediate responses, β-hexosaminidase exocytosis and eicosanoid generation (8Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Murakami M. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Temporal and spatial differences exist in the evolution of PAF and eicosanoid production; the accumulation of PAF was transient, disappearing by 10 min after stimulation (Fig. 1), and remained cell-associated (Fig. 1 B), whereas prostaglandin D2 generation reaches a plateau lasting for several hours and is released predominantly into the supernatant (8Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Murakami M. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cell-associated property of PAF has been commonly observed in a wide variety of cell types (6Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Satoh K. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The amount of PAF produced by activated BMMC reached nearly 1 nmol/106 cells, which is comparable to that produced by endothelial cells (32McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Satoh K. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and is therefore likely to be biologically significant. In the early 1980s, it was shown that PAF was released from activated BMMC into the supernatant, but the amount was about 500 times less than that observed in the present study (2Mencia-Huerta J.-M. Lewis R.A. Razin E. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2958-2964PubMed Google Scholar). The rather low level of PAF detected in this earlier study might have been due to failure to extract most of the cell-associated PAF, since absolute ethanol, which is not an efficient extractor of phospholipids, was used to extract cell-associated PAF (2Mencia-Huerta J.-M. Lewis R.A. Razin E. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2958-2964PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the different conditions under which BMMC were cultured might have affected their capacity to produce PAF.The rapid inactivation of PAF by activated BMMC led us to the unequivocal finding that mast cells release PAF-AH upon activation. PAF-AH release occurred in parallel with the release of β-hexosaminidase with identical time course, dose, and stimulus specificity criteria (Figs. 2 and 3), implying that PAF-AH is stored in mast cell secretory granules. Immunochemical and molecular biological studies revealed that this secretory PAF-AH is identical to the plasma-type enzyme (Fig. 4). The involvement of plasma-type PAF-AH in degrading mast cell-associated PAF is supported by the following three lines of evidence. First, PAF-AH release, which reached a peak by 2 min (Fig. 2), preceded the degradation of PAF, which became evident after 5 min (Fig. 1). Second, adding recombinant plasma-type PAF-AH markedly reduced the accumulation of PAF in BMMC (Fig. 1 B). Third, increased expression of plasma-type PAF-AH in BMMC after culture with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β led to decreased A23187-induced PAF production (Fig. 5), even though the expression of cytosolic and secretory phospholipase A2s, which are implicated in PAF biosynthesis, increases in BMMC after such cytokine treatment (8Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M. Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the ability of extracellular PAF-AH to quench cell-associated PAF suggests that the PAF produced by BMMC is located predominantly in the plasma membranes of the activated cells.Unlike liver cells (37Tarbet E.B. Stafforini D.M. Elstad M.R. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16667-16673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and macrophages (23Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), which spontaneously secrete plasma-type PAF-AH into their culture supernatants, PAF-AH secretion from mast cells is principally regulated by the receptor-coupled signal transduction pathway coupled with degranulation. The observations that the release percentages of PAF-AH activity were similar to those of β-hexosaminidase in BMMC (Fig. 2), that the distribution of immunoreactive PAF-AH protein in the supernatants and pellets of activated BMMC correlated with that of PAF-AH activity (Fig. 4 A), and that the changes in PAF-AH activity and PAF-AH mRNA levels after cytokine treatment occurred in parallel (Fig. 5 A) suggest that the plasma-type isozyme is the dominant PAF-AH isoform expressed in BMMC. This conclusion is further supported by our recent preliminary study that the transcripts for the intracellular PAF-AH were barely detectable in BMMC even after culture with KL + IL-10 + IL-1β under the experimental conditions shown in Fig. 5. 2K. Nakajima, M. Murakami, and I. Kudo, unpublished observation. In contrast, the fact that the release percentages of PAF-AH activity were consistently about half of those of β-hexosaminidase in rat CTMC (Fig. 3) may reflect either granule heterogeneity or the presence of other PAF-AH isozymes in this mast cell phenotype.Limited information is currently available on the transcriptional regulation of PAF-AH enzymes. An anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid increased PAF-AH levels in the plasma of rats (38Yasuda K. Johnston J.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and increased the secretion of PAF-AH activity from macrophage-like differentiated HL-60 cells (39Narahara H. Fenkel R.A. Johnston J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An increase in plasma-type PAF-AH transcript has been reported during differentiation or maturation of monocytes into macrophages (23Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Here we showed that, among the cytokines tested, IL-10, when combined with KL, significantly increased PAF-AH at the transcript level and that the addition of IL-1β to KL + IL-10 increased its expression further (Fig. 5 A). It is notable that the cytokine triad, KL + IL-10 + IL-1β, represents a potent inflammatory stimulus for BMMC, inducing proinflammatory proteins such as secretory type II phospholipase A2 (12Bingham III, C.O. Murakami M. Fujishima H. Hunt J.E. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25936-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), cyclooxygenase-2 (7Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IL-1β (40Ogasawara T. Murakami M. Suzuki-Nishimura T. Uchida M.K. Kudo I. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 393-404PubMed Google Scholar), and IL-6 (41Lu-Kuo J.M. Austen K.F. Katz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22169-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the induction of these proinflammatory proteins occurred within 2–10 h after the initiation of culture, whereas PAF-AH induction, which occurred after 1 day of culture (Fig. 5 B), lags behind the induction of proinflammatory mediators. This relatively late induction of plasma-type PAF-AH, a presumptive anti-inflammatory enzyme, might reflect a signal for the termination of inflammatory reactions that mast cells initiate.In conclusion, a detailed analysis of PAF metabolism by activated mast cells revealed that plasma-type PAF-AH is exocytosed by these cells and contributes to autocrine degradation of PAF. Furthermore, its expression level in mast cells increases during the late phase of cell activation after inflammatory stimulus. In view of the potential anti-inflammatory properties of this enzyme, we speculate that mast cells contribute not only to the initiation of inflammation related to allergy by releasing a wide variety of inflammatory mediators, but also to its termination by sequestering the PAF produced by mast cell themselves and other effector cells at inflamed sites. Mast cells are highly specialized effector cells of the immune system which, when activated, release various biologically active molecules including histamine, proteoglycans, and proteases through exocytosis, arachidonic acid-derived mediators such as eicosanoids through activation of the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, and preformed and newly expressed cytokines (1Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 381-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). IgE-dependent activation of mast cells has also been reported to elicit production of platelet-activating factor (PAF), 1The abbreviations used are: PAF, platelet-activating factor; PAF-AH, PAF acetylhydrolase; KL, c-kit ligand; IL, interleukin; TNP, trinitrophenyl; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TNP-BSA, TNP-conjugated bovine serum albumin; BMMC, bone marrow-derived mast cells; CTMC, connective tissue mast cells; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: PAF, platelet-activating factor; PAF-AH, PAF acetylhydrolase; KL, c-kit ligand; IL, interleukin; TNP, trinitrophenyl; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TNP-BSA, TNP-conjugated bovine serum albumin; BMMC, bone marrow-derived mast cells; CTMC, connective tissue mast cells; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. a lipid mediator with a glycerophosphocholine backbone (2Mencia-Huerta J.-M. Lewis R.A. Razin E. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2958-2964PubMed Google Scholar). PAF has been implicated in a number of physiological and pathological processes, particularly allergy and inflammation, affecting the respiratory, vascular, digestive, and reproductive systems (3Hanahan D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 483-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Suga K. Kawasaki T. Blank M.L. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12363-12371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its accumulation is usually tightly regulated at the biosynthetic and degradative levels to avoid the inappropriately high accumulation observed in many diseases. PAF production often parallels immediate eicosanoid generation (5Ramesha C.S. Pickett W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7592-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the remodeling pathway for PAF biosynthesis proposed to occur in inflammatory cells, Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 may play a role in the production of both lysoPAF and arachidonic acid from 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, then acetyltransferase is thought to introduce an acetyl residue from acetyl-CoA to the sn-2 position of lysoPAF leading to the formation of biologically active PAF (3Hanahan D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 483-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Suga K. Kawasaki T. Blank M.L. Snyder F. J. Biol.

In turn, PAF is degraded and inactivated by PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) enzymes, a particular group of Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2s that remove the acetyl moiety at the sn-2 position (6Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1973212115,"The autolysis loop of thrombin comprises nine residues, from Glu146 to Lys149e, five of which (Ala149a–Lys149e) are inserted relative to trypsin and chymotrypsin. Deletion of the insertion Ala149a–Lys149e causes no significant change in the properties of the enzyme, except for a slight enhancement of protein C activation. Deletion of the entire Glu146–Lys149e loop, however, reduces fibrinogen clotting 240-fold, but decreases protein C activation only 2-fold. This loop-less mutant is de facto an exclusive activator of protein C, having lost the primary procoagulant function of thrombin.

Because the autolysis loop affects fibrinogen binding, but not protein C activation, it provides a target for new drugs designed to suppress exclusively the procoagulant activity of thrombin. Thrombin plays two major roles in blood coagulation. One is to promote clot formation upon cleavage of fibrinogen and the other is to temper the coagulation response by cleavage of protein C (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that these functions can be dissociated by site-directed mutagenesis in a rather effective way, tipping the balance in favor of the anticoagulant activity of the enzyme (2Gibbs C.S. Coutre S.E. Tsiang M. Li W.-X. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Law V.S. Mao C.T. Matsumura S.Y. Mejza S.J. Paborsky L.R. Leung L.L.K.

An underlying property of these mutations is that they involve residues located in proximity of the Na+ binding site and tend to decrease or abolish Na+ binding thereby stabilizing the anticoagulant slow form of thrombin. An alternative way of selectively interfering with fibrinogen binding has been revealed by a thrombin modulator that inhibits fibrinogen clotting and enhances protein C activation independent of Na+ or thrombomodulin binding (4Berg D.T.

This finding suggests that regions of the enzyme not involved directly in Na+ or thrombomodulin binding may serve as epitopes for fibrinogen, but not protein C recognition, and may provide targets for a new class of anticoagulants. One such region is identified here by site-directed mutagenesis. The two deletion mutants were constructed, expressed, and purified as described (3Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Ayala Y.M. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human fibrinogen, antithrombin III, protein C, and activated protein C were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT) and Enzyme Research (South Bend, IN). Heparin was from Sigma. Recombinant human thrombomodulin with chondroitin sulfate was from Lilly. Experimental conditions were 5 mm Tris, 145 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, pH 7.4 at 37 °C. The release of fibrinopeptides was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography, and thrombomodulin binding was determined by competition with fibrinopeptide A release (6Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Activation of protein C was quantified from analysis of progress curves in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 and a saturating concentration (100 nm) of thrombomodulin (3Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin III in the presence of 0.5 USP units/ml of heparin was quantified from analysis of progress curves (3Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Na+ binding was measured directly by fluorescence titrations using a PTI QM-1 spectrofluorometer, under experimental conditions of 275 nmthrombin, 5 mm Tris, I = 200 mm, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, pH 8.0 at 25 °C. Data were taken as triplicate measurements of intrinsic fluorescence by titrating a solution of thrombin in tetramethylammonium chloride with a solution of thrombin in NaCl, at the same I = 200 mm (7Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A structural domain of thrombin is strategically located in between the Na+ binding site and exosite I, which provides the locale for fibrinogen (8Stubbs M. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and thrombomodulin (9Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13547-13552Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) binding (Fig.1). This domain is the autolysis loop (10Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), so defined in view of its intrinsic susceptibility to proteolytic digestion, and spans nine residues, from Glu146 to Lys149e. The loop distinguishes itself from the homologous region in other serine proteases like trypsin and chymotrypsin for the five-residue insertion Ala149a–Lys149e (TableI). In the crystal structure (10Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 11Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) the autolysis loop assumes different conformations, depending on solution conditions, and seems to control the access to the active site, of which it defines the lower rim. These properties have suggested that the loop would play an important role in the remarkable selectivity of thrombin toward a limited number of physiological substrates compared with the wider specificity of trypsin (10Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). An unequivocal characterization of the role of this loop has, however, remained elusive.Table ISequence of the autolysis loop in thrombin from different species (* denotes a deletion)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Inspection of the sequence of the autolysis loop in thrombin from different species (12Banfield D.K. MacGillivray R.T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reveals a lack of conservation for the five-residue insertion Ala149a–Lys149e (TableI). The insertion is shorter in several species, and the nature of the amino acid present at each position seems inconsequential. This suggests that only the length of the insertion should matter, since no insertion is present in trypsin and chymotrypsin. However, deletion of the Ala149a–Lys149e five-residue insertion in human thrombin produces no significant change in the functional properties of the enzyme (Table II). Fibrinogen clotting is retained and so is thrombomodulin binding and inhibition by antithrombin III. Notably, protein C activation increases 3-fold as though a shorter loop would enhance accessibility of the active site for this substrate. Binding of Na+ is also unaffected by the deletion (Fig. 2).Table IISpecificity of wild-type and deletion mutants of the autolysis loop under physiological conditionsSlow form2-aData from (3).Fast form2-aData from (3).Wild-type2-aData from (3).ΔAla149a–Lys149eΔGlu146–Lys149eFibrinopeptide A release,k cat/K m (μm−1 s−1)1.5 ± 0.135 ± 417 ± 119 ± 10.071 ± 0.003Fibrinopeptide B release,k cat/K m (μm−1 s−1)0.73 ± 0.0417 ± 19.4 ± 0.57.0 ± 0.40.018 ± 0.001Protein C activation, k cat/K m (μm−1s−1)0.32 ± 0.010.21 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.010.58 ± 0.060.11 ± 0.01Thrombomodulin binding, K d (nm)5.3 ± 0.70.60 ± 0.020.99 ± 0.041.2 ± 0.16.4 ± 0.1Antithrombin III inhibition, k on(μm−1 s−1)4.0 ± 0.220 ± 213 ± 121 ± 10.55 ± 0.01RAP2-bRelative anticoagulant potency (3) of a mutant, (a mut/c mut)/(a wt/c wt), where a and c are the rates for cleavage of protein C and release of fibrinopeptide A.

The suffix wt refers to wild-type under physiological conditions. Open table in a new tab Unlike the insertion sequence, the sequence Glu146-Thr147-Trp148 in the autolysis loop is highly conserved (Table I). Both Glu146and Trp148 are present in all species, from human to hagfish. Conservation of Trp148 is unclear, because mutation of this residue has no effect on thrombin function (5Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Ayala Y.M. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11185-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conservation of Glu146, on the other hand, seems to be justified by the important ion pair formed with Arg221a in the Na+ binding loop (3Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Disruption of this ion pair in the R221aA mutant (3Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), or in the naturally occurring mutant E146A thrombin Salakta (13Miyata T. Aruga R. Umeyama H. Bezeaud A. Guillin M.C. Iwanaga S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), reduces fibrinogen clotting by 6-fold with minimal effects on protein C activation due to reduced Na+binding (3Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The insertion Ala149a–Lys149eplays no role, even when the Arg221a-Glu146 ion pair is broken. In fact, swapping the autolysis loop of thrombin with that of trypsin (Table I) results in functional properties similar to those of the R221aA and E146A mutants (14Di Bella E.E. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4427-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deletion of the Glu146–Trp148 segment alone reduces fibrinogen clotting 20-fold and protein C activation 16-fold (15Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19341-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given these previous findings and the properties of the deletion mutant ΔAla149a–Lys149e (Table II), we expected from simple additive effects that deletion of all nine residues Glu146–Lys149e would compromise both fibrinogen and protein C binding to similar extent. On the other hand, the ΔGlu146–Lys149e mutant has practically lost its clotting activity because of the remarkable reduction in the release of fibrinopeptides A and B by 240- and 520-fold, respectively, whereas its ability to activate protein C is reduced only 2-fold (TableII). Binding of thrombomodulin is reduced 6-fold, inhibition by antithrombin III is reduced 20-fold, and Na+ binding is reduced over 10-fold (Fig. 2). Some of the properties of the loop-less mutant can be explained in terms of a perturbation of the slow ↔ fast equilibrium. Thrombomodulin binds to the loop-less mutant with the same affinity as the slow form of thrombin, consistent with this mutant being essentially in the slow form under physiological conditions. Hence, the autolysis loop plays no role in thrombomodulin binding. A somewhat similar explanation can be invoked for antithrombin III and protein C. The loss in specificity experienced by these molecules in binding to the mutant compared with the slow form echoes that observed for the R221aA mutant (3Dang Q.D. Guinto E.R. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and likely originates from disruption of the Arg221a–Glu146 ion pair. The broken ion pair in R221aA also reduces the Na+ affinity as seen for the loop-less mutant. The effect on fibrinogen, on the other hand, cannot be reconciled entirely with a perturbation of the slow ↔ fast equilibrium in favor of the slow form, that would reduce specificity 10-fold relative to wild-type (Table II). Most of the effect must originate from direct perturbation of fibrinogen binding due to the loss of critical interactions in the loop-less mutant. Because none of the residues deleted in the loop-less mutant makes contact with fibrinopeptide A (8Stubbs M. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), other portions of the fibrinogen molecule must interact with the autolysis loop. The possibility that the conformation of other regions of thrombin interacting exclusively with fibrinogen is altered in the loop-less mutant cannot be ruled out, although the modest effect seen for protein C, antithrombin III and thrombomodulin binding excludes a drastic perturbation of thrombin structure. The crystal structure of the loop-less mutant will help clarify this point. Independent of whether the autolysis loop participates directly in fibrinogen binding or influences other regions of the enzyme, these results demonstrate that deletion of the loop selectively suppresses fibrinogen clotting. The 240-fold reduction in the release of fibrinopeptide A with a concomitant 2-fold loss of protein C activation implies that use of this mutant in vivo at twice the concentration as wild-type thrombin would generate the same amount of activated protein C, but would clot blood in 8 h instead of 4 min (16Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the limited life-span of thrombin in the blood (10–15 min) due to scavenging by antithrombin III (16Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the loop-less mutant isde facto an exclusive activator of protein C. Its properties are extraordinarily similar to those of the E217K mutant recently engineered for optimal anticoagulant activity in vivo (17Tsiang M. Paborsky L.R. Li W.-X. Jain A.K. Mao C.T. Dunn K.E. Lee D.W. Matsumura S.Y. Matteucci M.D. Coutre S.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16449-16457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and represent a substantial gain in anticoagulant potency compared with other single-site substitutions (2Gibbs C.S. Coutre S.E. Tsiang M. Li W.-X. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Law V.S. Mao C.T. Matsumura S.Y. Mejza S.J. Paborsky L.R. Leung L.L.K.

The most important implication of these results is that the autolysis loop represents an ideal target for molecules aimed at suppressing exclusively the procoagulant activity of the enzyme. An active-site inhibitor of thrombin would shut down both procoagulant and anticoagulant activities, whereas a drug that selectively suppresses fibrinogen binding would have an enhanced anticoagulant potency in view of the lack of inhibition of the protein C-dependent anticoagulant pathway. The pursuit of such thrombin modulators, fostered by the discovery of the allosteric nature of this enzyme (18Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), is quite realistic (4Berg D.T. Wiley M.R. Grinnell B.W. Science. 1996; 273: 1389-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and should be greatly facilitated by the identification of suitable molecular targets like the autolysis loop. Targeting this loop, that is more conspicuous in thrombin than trypsin, should also reduce the cross-reactivity of the modulator with the digestive protease that so often compromises the biological potency of active-site inhibitors of thrombin designed for oral availability."
https://openalex.org/W2319085791,"The chicken winged helix proteins, CWH-1, CWH-2 and CWH-3, were isolated and identified by homology cloning using the winged helix sequence of the retroviral oncogene qin as a probe. The CWH proteins act as growth stimulators in chicken embryo fibroblasts and in this activity resemble the Qin protein. Qin is a transcriptional regulator that functions as a repressor, and its oncogenic potential is correlated with the ability to repress transcription. In this communication we show that CWH proteins are localized in the cell nucleus, recognize the Qin DNA binding site and also function as transcriptional repressors. The repression activity of CWH-3 was mapped to the region of amino acids 211 to 311, a domain that is homologous to the major repression domain of Qin."
https://openalex.org/W1994184002,"To determine which amino acid sequences account for transmembrane folding of G7 receptors, the membrane domain of the rabbit cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) G-protein-coupled receptor has been investigated by in vitro transcription/translation of two types of fusion vectors containing sequences that include putative transmembrane segments. First, the seven putative transmembrane domains of the CCK-A receptor were inserted individually into pGEM vectors beginning with the cDNA encoding the first 101 (HK-M0) or 139 (HK-M1) amino acids of the α subunit of the gastric H,K-ATPase. These were separated by the cDNA for the inserted transmembrane domains from the cDNA encoding the last 177 amino acids of the β subunit of the H,K-ATPase containing five N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences (Bamberg, K., and Sachs, G. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16909–16919). Transcription/translation of these fusion vectors in rabbit reticulocyte lysate ± dog pancreatic microsomes followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis defined the presence of signal anchor sequences in HK-M0 by glycosylation and stop transfer sequences in HK-M1 by inhibition of glycosylation. Six out of the seven putative transmembrane domains had membrane insertion signals, but no membrane insertion activity was found for the H3 segment in these vectors. To test the effect of specific upstream and downstream sequences on membrane insertion, vectors were also made starting with the cDNA encoding the N terminus of the CCK-A receptor separated from the last 177 amino acids of the H,K-ATPase β subunit by cDNA encoding CCK-A receptor sequences of different lengths. In addition to transcription/translation, endoglycosidase H treatment was used to verify glycosylation when multiple bands were found in the presence of microsomes. The four positive charges in the loop between H1 and H2 were required for the correct orientation of the first transmembrane domain. The H3 segment acted as a stop transfer sequence only when the whole N terminus and H3 were followed by the positive charges in the cytoplasmic loop between H3 and H4. The activity of H6 as a signal anchor sequence depended on preceding positive charges. These translation data using two types of fusion vectors establish a seven-transmembrane folding model using only in vitrotranslation for the CCK-A receptor beginning with two signal anchor sequences and then alternating stop transfer and signal anchor insertions. Positive charges between H1 and H2, H3 and H4, and H5 and H6 function as cytoplasmic anchors in the membrane folding of this receptor."

CNTF also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a similar protein in cultured chick dorsal root ganglion and retinal neurons. In addition, we identify a second, 100-kDa form of STAT3 that appears in response to CNTF. Unlike previous reports, utilizing mammalian cell lines that detected a slower migrating form of STAT3 resulting from H7-sensitive protein phosphorylation, H7 did not prevent the appearance of the 100-kDa form in ciliary neurons.

However, the molecular mechanisms for these effects have not been clearly elucidated in defined neuronal populations. CNTF belongs to a family of neuropoietic cytokines, which display a high degree of redundancy in their biological activities, have structural similarity, share receptor subunits and signal transduction pathways, and yet are capable of generating unique cellular responses as well (1Stahl N.

Receptor activation by CNTF-related cytokines results in dimerization of the β-receptor components and activation of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the Jak family. Jaks or other cytoplasmic kinases phosphorylate tyrosine on the cytokine receptor components that selectively bind cytoplasmic transcription factors of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family (10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). In this model, established primarily from cell lines, STAT proteins are directly tyrosine-phosphorylated by Jaks and then dimerize and translocate to the cell nucleus and regulate gene transcription (11Bonni A.

There are at least six members of the STAT family, and the selection and activation of a particular STAT is dependent on receptor substrate-specifying motifs (10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Thus, cytokines utilizing gp130 mainly activate STAT3, initially identified as an acute phase response factor (10Ihle J.N.

It has recently been suggested that a cytoplasmic serine kinase may also phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT3 and be necessary for maximal gene activation (14Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E.

( Lond. ). 1974; 241: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) with an increase in expression of GPA in the developing eye (22Nishi R. J.

Halvorsen, unpublished data. In culture all embryonic ciliary neurons are rescued by a select group of CNTF-like neurotrophic factors but not by members of the neurotrophin family (20Koshlukova S.

Also, CNTF has trophic activities for motor, sensory, sympathetic, and hippocampal neurons, regulates acetylcholine receptors on autonomic neurons, and regulates neurotransmitter expression in cultured sympathetic and central nervous system neurons (23Lewis S.E.

Gehrke D. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have identified a class of functional CNTF receptors on cultured ciliary ganglion neurons where 125I-CNTF cross-linking studies detected a receptor component different in size from the previously described mammalian receptor subunits (20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These results also showed that CNTF produced the rapid induction of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa. The induction of the 90-kDa phosphoprotein was specific for CNTF and avian GPA in that it was not observed in response to other CNTF-related cytokines or basic fibroblast growth factors (20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of this 90-kDa protein, therefore, represents a potential signal transduction pathway activated specifically by mammalian CNTF and chick GPA. In this study we show for the first time in primary chicken neurons that the 90-kDa phosphoprotein is translocated to the nucleus and is immunologically identical with the transcription factor, STAT3. In addition, CNTF induces a modified 100-kDa form of STAT3 that appears distinct from previously described mammalian serine-phosphorylated STAT3 (14Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Ciliary ganglion neurons were dissociated from 8-day-old chick embryos and grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere as described previously (20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cells for the tyrosine phosphorylation assays were plated on 35-mm culture dishes on a substratum of poly-d-lysine and mouse laminin. The culture medium consisted of Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. The medium was adjusted to a final concentration of 25 mm KCl, which allows for complete survival of neurons and negligible survival of non-neuronal cells. Freshly dissociated retina from 11-day-old embryos were trypsin-digested (0.25%) for 30 min at 37 °C and then processed as described for ciliary ganglion neurons except that cells were plated on tissue culture dishes coated with poly-d-ornithine (10 μg/cm2) at a final density of 5 × 105cells/cm2 in MEM with 10% horse serum. Dorsal root ganglion neurons from 11-day-old embryos were cultured on a substratum of rat tail collagen in medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor, as described previously (30Margiotta J. Howard M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cell survival was determined on ciliary ganglion neurons by using a 1-(4,4-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide dye assay as described previously (20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Manthorpe M. Fagnani R. Skaper S. Varon S. Dev. Brain Res. 1986; 25: 191-198Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Ciliary ganglion neurons were grown in culture for 5 days, rinsed, and incubated in serum-free unsupplemented medium for 3 h; the neurons were then treated for the indicated periods with human CNTF (2 nm, 50 ng/ml unless otherwise indicated), washed in MEM containing 1 mmNa3VO4, and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) prior to immunoblotting as described previously (13Malek R.L. Halvorsen S.W. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cultures were treated for 20 min with 0.1 or 1 μm staurosporine, for 30 min with 200 μm H7, or for 5 min with 20 mm sodium fluoride prior to the treatment with CNTF. The proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 1% ovalbumin (or 5% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 4 h with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY4G10 (1:1000) as described previously (20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with a monoclonal antibody to STAT3 (1:1000) (13Malek R.L. Halvorsen S.W. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a polyclonal antibody directed against tyrosine-phosphorylated (Tyr-705) STAT3 (1:1000) (13Malek R.L. Halvorsen S.W. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or other anti-STAT monoclonal antibodies as recommended by the supplier. Following incubation with either goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase the reactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.). The level of antibody binding was quantified by scanning densitometry (Ultrascan XL, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). In some experiments the nitrocellulose membranes were stripped and analyzed using a different primary antibody as described in the ECL Manual (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.). Ciliary ganglion neurons (3.4 × 105 cells; 50 ganglion eq) grown for 5 days in culture were serum-starved for 3 h at 37 °C in MEM and then treated for 5 min with 2 nm CNTF. Cells were rinsed, solubilized with 30 μl of boiling 1% SDS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then diluted with 150 μl of 2 × cold immunoprecipitation buffer (1 × buffer is 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm Tris base, pH 7.4) and 120 μl of H2O. Anti-STAT3 monoclonal antibody or nonimmune mouse serum was added to cell lysates (1:100) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) was then added for 30 min, and the antibody-bound proteins were captured with protein A, washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 2 mm Na3VO4. The soluble proteins after the immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT3 antibodies were precipitated with 6 volumes of ice-cold acetone, and the dried pellet was solubilized in boiling Laemmli sample buffer containing 2 mm Na3VO4. Crude nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described (32Levy D. Kessler D. Pine R. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Ciliary ganglion neuron cultures were washed and lysed by homogenization in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Nuclei were separated by centrifugation at 200 ×g, and the pellet containing the nuclei was washed twice in hypotonic buffer without Nonidet P-40 before immunoblot analysis as described above. The cytoplasmic fraction (the supernatant from the first centrifugation) was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, and the proteins were precipitated with acetone and subjected to immunoblot analysis as above. Embryonated chick eggs (mixed heavy breed, Rhode Island Red/Barred Rock/White Rock) were obtained from Gawlak Farms (Lawton, NY) and grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Cell culture reagents and molecular weight markers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Laminin was from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA), staurosporine and H7 were from Calbiochem, and H7 was also obtained from Seikagaku America (Rockville, MD). Monoclonal antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), polyclonal anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and monoclonal antibodies to all other STATs were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Recombinant human CNTF was generously provided by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (Tarrytown, NY). CNTF induced the phosphorylation of an approximately 90-kDa protein in ciliary ganglion neurons that corresponded to the size described for members of the STAT family of transcription factors (M r = 84,000–113,000) (10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus we determined whether this CNTF-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from ciliary ganglion neurons was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as required for transcriptional activity. A tyrosine-phosphorylated 92-kDa protein was detected at very low levels in the nucleus before CNTF stimulation; however, after 15 min of CNTF treatment the 92-kDa phosphoprotein had accumulated in the nuclear fraction (Fig.1, left panel). Sodium fluoride (20 mm), an inhibitor of nuclear translocation of activated STAT1 (33Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.-J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), inhibited 80% of the CNTF-induced nuclear translocation of the 92-kDa phosphoprotein (Fig. 1, left panel). These results indicated that the CNTF-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was translocated to the nucleus by a fluoride-sensitive mechanism. The STAT family of transcription factors includes six known members through which cytokines can differentially modulate gene transcription. The CNTF family of cytokines has been reported to activate both STAT1 and STAT3 (11Bonni A. Frank D. Schindler C. Greenberg M. Science. 1993; 262: 1575-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We examined cell lysates of cultured ciliary ganglion neurons using antibodies against STAT1, -2, -3, -4, -5, or -6 to determine if similar sized products were detectable. Only antibodies to STAT3 produced a visible reaction at 92 kDa (±1 kDa, n = 6) in ciliary ganglion neurons (Fig.2 A). Two products close in size, a doublet of about 112/119 and 105 kDa, were detected using anti-STAT5 and -6 antibodies, respectively. In control experiments to test for cross-reactivity of STAT1, -2, and -4 with chick proteins, antibodies to STAT1 detected a doublet of 93/95 kDa in lysates from chick embryo fibroblasts, and the STAT2 antibody detected a band of 90 kDa in chick embryo spleen (data not shown). Therefore, these antibodies, except for anti-STAT4, recognize chick proteins comparable in size with those seen in mammalian cells. To confirm the identity of the 92-kDa product as STAT3 as compared with STAT1 we used antibodies specific for STAT1 and STAT3 to precipitate proteins from extracts of CNTF-treated ciliary ganglion neurons. Monoclonal antibodies to STAT3 immunoprecipitated proteins of 92 kDa (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, anti-STAT1 antibodies and nonimmune mouse serum failed to immunoprecipitate the 92-kDa protein (data not shown and Fig.2 C). Anti-STAT3 immunoprecipitates were further analyzed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY4G10, specifically detected the STAT3-precipitated 92-kDa protein only from CNTF-treated cells (Fig. 2 B). The majority of the CNTF-induced 92-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was depleted from cell lysates after immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT3 indicating that most, if not all, of this phosphoprotein was recognized by anti-STAT3 antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Further, the 92-kDa phosphoprotein that appeared in the nuclear fraction following CNTF treatment was recognized by the anti-STAT3 antibody (Fig. 1, right panel). A second band of approximately 80 kDa was often observed after probing blots of cell lysates with the anti-STAT3 antibody (Fig.2 C, left). This 80-kDa band may correspond to an alternatively spliced STAT3 product previously described (34Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar); however, it was not tyrosine-phosphorylated following CNTF treatment. These results identify the CNTF-induced 92-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in ciliary ganglion neurons as immunologically related to mammalian STAT3. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation initiated by ligand-receptor interaction is usually described as a rapid and transient event typically occurring within 1–5 min and declining after 30–60 min (14Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Time course experiments of CNTF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 92-kDa protein in cultured ciliary ganglion neurons showed unusual stability. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 92-kDa protein was detectable within 3 min of CNTF exposure and increased up to 15 min and remained at elevated levels during 2 h of continuous exposure (Fig. 3 A). To further confirm the identity of the 92-kDa phosphoprotein we used a recently developed antibody from New England Biolabs, Inc. that specifically recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated (Tyr-705) STAT3. The time course of tyrosine phosphorylation was similar whether determined using the anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) or the anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies, and little change in total STAT3 protein was observed with continued CNTF treatment (Fig. 3 A). These results provide strong evidence that the 92-kDa protein represents avian STAT3. A lighter intensity band of 100 kDa (±1 kDa, n = 4) was visualized in material prepared from CNTF-treated cells when immunoblots probed with the anti-STAT3 antibody were re-exposed to film for longer periods (Fig. 3 A, inset). CNTF has effects on a variety of chick neuronal types in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The CNTF-mediated activation of STAT3 was not limited to parasympathetic neurons of ciliary ganglia as cells cultured from both dorsal root ganglia and neural retina showed a 2-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 after 10 min of CNTF treatment (Fig. 4). Thus, other neurons whose in vitro survival is supported by CNTF, dorsal root ganglion neurons (35Simon R. Thier M. Kruttgen A. Rosejohn S. Weiergraber O. Heinrich P.C. Schroder J.M. Weis J. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 153-157PubMed Google Scholar), as well as neurons whose cholinergic development is regulated in vitro by CNTF, neural retina (36Hofmann H.-D. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), also show tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. The survival of cultured ciliary ganglion neurons requires the continued presence of trophic factor support (37Allsopp T.E. Wyatt S. Paterson H. Davies A.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). 3M. A. Wishingrad and S. W. Halvorsen, unpublished observation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 also required the continued presence of CNTF. Ciliary ganglion neurons were treated with CNTF for 5 min; the neurons were then rinsed and incubated with CNTF-free medium. After 1 h of CNTF deprivation the level of tyrosine phosphorylation returned to near prestimulation levels (Fig. 3 B). These results indicated that maintenance of the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 depended on the continued presence of CNTF. In addition, chronic growth in CNTF did not eliminate the response. Neurons grown in either 25 mmKCl medium, 1 nm CNTF, or 10 nm basic fibroblast growth factor/heparin for 4 days, each of which promotes survival of ciliary neurons, followed by incubation of cells for 3 h in unsupplemented medium and stimulation with 5 nm CNTF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (data not shown). Studies using inhibitors further suggested a relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation and cellular function. Incubation of neurons with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (0.1–1.0 μm), for 48 h prevented greater than 92% (n = 4) of CNTF-mediated cell survival. Preincubation of ciliary ganglion neurons with staurosporine also inhibited the CNTF-induced stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 5 A). The 100-kDa protein cross-reacting with the STAT3 antibody underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in response to CNTF and was recognized by the anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody (Fig. 5 B). The 100-kDa product was probably not seen in experiments utilizing PY4G10 due to masking by background tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the 94–105-kDa range following prolonged exposures. The appearance of the tyrosine-phosphorylated 100- kDa protein was prevented by pretreatment of cells with staurosporine (data not shown) but was unaffected by treatment with the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H7 (Fig.5 B). H7 from two different sources were each without effect on the appearance of the 100-kDa component. Confirmation that the H7 preparations were active was provided by experiments showing that the same concentration of H7 blocked the cell survival effects of CNTF on ciliary ganglion neurons (data not shown). The appearance of the 100-kDa protein following treatment with CNTF was enhanced over a similar time course (Fig. 3 A, inset) as tyrosine phosphorylation of the 92-kDa form. In addition, the appearance of the 100-kDa component and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 92- and 100-kDa components were each induced over a similar range of CNTF concentrations (Fig. 6). Finally, immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT3 antibodies of lysates from CNTF-treated cells revealed a 100-kDa product recognized by either the anti-STAT3 or the anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies (Fig. 2 C). The 100-kDa band was not detected in immunoprecipitates from untreated cells. These results suggest that both the 100- and 92-kDa bands represent structurally related forms of avian STAT3. We have previously shown that CNTF stimulation of ciliary ganglion neurons resulted in the rapid induction of a 92-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 92-kDa phosphoprotein was the only major phosphoprotein that consistently showed a specific increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to physiologically relevant concentrations of human CNTF and avian GPA but was not induced by a series of CNTF-related cytokines (19Adler R. Landa K. Manthorpe M. Varon S. Science. 1979; 204: 1434-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) (interleukin-6, interleukin-11, and oncostatin M). In this study we identified the 92-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in ciliary ganglion neurons as a member of the STAT family of transcription factors based on three criteria. First, the 92-kDa protein underwent tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following CNTF stimulation, a process necessary for DNA binding and gene regulation by STATs. Second, the nuclear translocation of the 92-kDa phosphoprotein was inhibited by sodium fluoride, which also inhibits activated STAT nuclear translocation in response to interferons and epidermal growth factor (32Levy D. Kessler D. Pine R. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 33Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.-J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Finally, the 92-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the carboxyl terminus of mammalian STAT3 and was recognized by a polyclonal antibody specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated (Tyr-705) STAT3. A second 100-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was induced by CNTF and recognized by both STAT3 antibodies. There was no evidence for cross-reactivity of either the 92- or 100-kDa proteins with antibodies to STAT1, -2, -4, -5, or -6. Although these antibodies were raised against mammalian forms of STAT proteins except for STAT4, control studies confirmed that all cross-react with chick homologues either in ciliary ganglion, chick spleen, or chick embryo fibroblasts. Mammalian STAT3 shares 40–50% amino acid identity to STAT1 and STAT2 and recognizes a DNA binding element that resembles the consensus sequence found for STAT1, -4, -5, and -6 and Drosophila STAT (10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). However, while STAT1 is activated by a number of cytokines and growth factors, STAT3 is activated mainly by the CNTF family of cytokines and epidermal growth factor and is implicated in the regulation of transcription of acute phase protein genes in liver cells. The gene for vasoactive intestinal peptide in rat also contains a cytokine response element (10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 12Symes A. Lewis S. Corpus L. Rajan P. Hyman S.E. Fink J.S. Mol.

Hocke G.M. Lottspeich F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29998-30006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The specificity of STAT3 activation, at least in part, is achieved by the tyrosine-based motifs in gp130 and LIFRβ, the signal transducer receptor components for the CNTF family of cytokines (40Stahl N. Farruggella T. Boulton T. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J. Yancopoulos G. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Recently, two cytokine-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of STAT3 have been characterized, STAT3f and STAT3s, differing in H7-sensitive secondary serine/threonine phosphorylation (14Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The two forms differ in apparent molecular mass by 2 kDa, undergo nuclear translocation, and recognize the same DNA sequences in vitrobut may act on distinct target genes in vivo, depending on the cell type (14Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In ciliary ganglia we found that CNTF induced the appearance of an additional 100-kDa form of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. We do not know if it was generated by a secondary modification of the 92-kDa STAT3. However, the 92-kDa STAT is the most likely source since it is the only other protein in cell lysates recognized by both the STAT3 and phospho-STAT3 antibodies. This CNTF-induced shift of apparent molecular mass of 8 kDa was significantly greater than the 2-kDa shift observed in mammalian cell lines (14Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). In cell lines, cytokines induce a time-dependent shift of STAT3f to STAT3s, whereas in ciliary ganglion neurons the 100-kDa form remained a small percentage of the total STAT3 immunoreactive pool even at higher CNTF concentrations and after extended treatment. It is yet to be determined if the newly generated 100-kDa pool is static or is actively turning over. A final difference between STAT3s and the chick 100-kDa STAT3 is the lack of sensitivity to H7 by the latter. Two different sources of H7 were unable to prevent the appearance of the 100-kDa STAT3, whereas H7 effectively prevented the conversion of STAT3f to STAT3s in CNTF-treated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. 4R. L. Malek and S. W. Halvorsen, unpublished observation. Additionally, H7 blocked CNTF and high KCl-mediated cell survival in cultured ciliary ganglion neurons in control experiments, indicating that H7 was active in these cells.3 Therefore, the 100-kDa band appears to be a novel STAT3 induced in chick neurons with distinct properties from those of the serine-phosphorylated STAT3s previously identified in cell lines. The question remains whether it represents an active form or a form associated with signal termination. The CNTF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in ciliary ganglion neurons was unusually stable. Analysis of the time course of the tyrosine phosphorylation showed that the effect was induced rapidly after CNTF stimulation and that the level of phosphorylation remained elevated for up to 2 h in the continued presence of CNTF. Removal of CNTF, however, produced a decrease in the phosphorylation to control levels within 1 h indicating that the stability of the induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 92-kDa STAT3 depended on the continued presence of CNTF. Rapid but transient tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor components and signaling molecules, including STAT proteins, characterizes CNTF and related cytokine responses in a variety of cell lines (14Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z.L. Darnell J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The functional importance of the stable tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in ciliary ganglion neurons is not clear yet. Cultured embryonic ciliary ganglion neurons are rescued by CNTF, and it is possible that continuous activation of STAT3 is required for CNTF-mediated cell survival. Consistent with this, staurosporine treatment inhibited both CNTF-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and CNTF-mediated cell survival. There are at least three physiological effects of CNTF on cultured embryonic ciliary ganglion neurons: long term survival, increased neuronal growth, and down-regulation of α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (20Koshlukova S. Finn T.P. Nishi R. Halvorsen S.W. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Halvorsen S.W. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3673-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Nishi R. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of STAT3 appears to be specific for the signal transduction pathway induced by CNTF in ciliary ganglion neurons. Identification of the CNTF-inducible 92- and 100-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins as immunologically identical and functionally similar to STAT3 in ciliary ganglion neurons, which display biologically relevant responses to CNTF/GPA, provides insight into the potential signal transduction mechanism(s) producing these diverse biological effects. The role of the newly identified 100-kDa form of STAT3 in CNTF signal transduction remains to be determined as does the composition of the activated STAT3 transcription complex and its target genes."

A partial tRNATrp gene, which contained only the anticodon stem-loop region of the mature tRNA, was fused to a carrier yeast tRNA gene for expression in H. volcanii. Transcripts from this hybrid gene were found to be processed by endonuclease and ligase at the tRNATrp exon-intron boundaries. These results verify that the substrate recognition properties of the halobacterial endonuclease observed in vitro reflect the properties of this enzymein vivo, namely that mature tRNA structure is not essential for recognition by the endonuclease. The independence of these reactions on mature tRNA provides further support for a relationship between archaeal tRNA and rRNA intron-processing systems and highlight a difference in the substrate recognition properties between the archaeal and eucaryal processing systems. The significance of these differences is discussed in light of the observation that the tRNA endonucleases of these organisms are related.

The significance of these differences is discussed in light of the observation that the tRNA endonucleases of these organisms are related. While intron-containing tRNAs are present in the Archaea (formerly the Archaebacteria), Eucarya, and Bacteria, these sequences do not represent a single homogeneous class of introns. Bacterial and chloroplast tRNA introns are either group I or group II introns, whereas the eucaryal nuclear and archaeal tRNA introns lack any identifiable sequence or structural relationship to the group I, group II, group III, or mRNA introns (1Westaway S.K. Abelson J. Soll D. RajBhandary T. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 79-92Google Scholar). In the absence of defining sequence or structural characteristics in the archaeal and eucaryal tRNA introns, speculation on the relatedness of these introns has been based primarily on comparisons of their splicing systems. Until recently, it was thought that the archaeal and eucaryal splicing enzymes were distinct systems that were related in function only, and consequently that eucaryal and archaeal introns potentially represented two separate classes of introns. This argument was based on the observations that the archaeal and eucaryal tRNA intron endonucleases differed in subunit composition and substrate recognition mechanisms. The eucaryal endonuclease was observed to be a heterotrimer (2Rauhut R. Green P.R. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18180-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has recently been shown to be a tetramer (3Trotta C.R. Miao F. Arn E.A. Ho C.K. Rauhut R. Abelson J.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), whereas the archaeal enzyme is a homodimer (4Kleman-Leyer K. Armbruster D.A. Daniels C.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recognition of the exon-intron boundaries by the eucaryal enzyme involves a complex mechanism that is dependent on the presence of mature tRNA structure. All eucaryal tRNA introns are located in the anticodon loop between positions 37 and 38 of the mature tRNA, extending the anticodon helix, while maintaining the overall mature tRNA structure (1Westaway S.K. Abelson J. Soll D. RajBhandary T. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 79-92Google Scholar). The eucaryal enzyme senses the distance from the top of the anticodon stem to the 5′ and 3′ cleavage sites (5Reyes V.M. Abelson J. Cell. 1988; 55: 719-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Mattoccia E. Baldi I.M. Gandini-Attardi D. Ciafre S. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Cell. 1988; 55: 731-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and requires the formation of a three-nucleotide bulge loop at the intron-exon 2 cleavage site, the A-I interaction (7Baldi M.I. Mattoccia E. Bufardeci E. Fabbri S. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Science. 1992; 255: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This mechanism is well suited for the identification of eucaryal tRNA introns where all introns are located in the same relative position. In contrast, in vitro studies with the Haloferax volcanii intron endonuclease showed that this enzyme does not require complete mature tRNA structure in its substrate (8Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17951-17959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18104-18111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme requires a defined structural element at the exon-intron boundaries, the bulge-helix-bulge motif (9Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18104-18111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this structure each cleavage site is located in a three-nucleotide bulge loop, and the two loops are separated by 4 base pairs. The enzyme senses the distance between the bulge loops, rather than the length of the anticodon stem (9Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18104-18111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism is well suited for the archaeal tRNA intron since these introns are not restricted to a single location in the mature domain of the tRNA. In the Archaea, tRNA introns have been observed in the anticodon loop, the anticodon stem, and the extra arm (10Daniels C.J. Gupta R. Doolittle W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Datta P.K. Hawkins L.K. Gupta R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Kaine B.P.

EMBO. 1987; 6: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Despite their variability in location, all archaeal intron-containing tRNAs can assume the bulge-helix-bulge structure at their intron-exon boundaries. With such fundamental differences in subunit composition and recognition mechanisms, the proposal that the archaeal and eucaryal tRNA processing systems were different appeared justified. However, the recent characterization of the genes encoding the H. volcanii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA intron endonucleases has unexpectedly revealed that these two enzymes are related (3Trotta C.R. Miao F. Arn E.A. Ho C.K. Rauhut R. Abelson J.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 4Kleman-Leyer K. Armbruster D.A. Daniels C.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of the halobacterial endonuclease monomer and the yeast endonuclease complex revealed that the halobacterial protein shared sequence similarity with two subunits of the yeast tetramer. This similarity extended over an approximately 115-amino acid region, and in each case, this sequence was located in the carboxyl terminus of the protein (4Kleman-Leyer K. Armbruster D.A. Daniels C.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Knowing that the archaeal and eucaryal endonucleases are related underscored the need to verify that the substrate recognition properties of the archaeal endonuclease defined in vitro are the same as those used in vivo. In this report we describe experiments to test the proposal that the halobacterial tRNA intron endonuclease can process a tRNA intron from a RNA molecule that lacks full tRNA structure. As an in vivo test for this model, we have constructed an H. volcanii expression module that is capable of producing a hybrid RNA that encodes a partial H. volcaniitRNATrp RNA fused to the 5′ leader region of the non-processing yeast tRNAProM RNA (17Palmer J.R. Nieuwlandt D.T. Daniels C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3820-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The tRNATrpΔ13115′-tRNAProM hybrid RNA encodes the tRNATrp anticodon stem-loop region and intact intron fused to the carrier RNA. This represents the minimum exon sequences required for in vitro cleavage. Analysis of RNA from cells carrying this hybrid gene demonstrate that this partial tRNATrp RNA is processed by both endonuclease and ligase enzymes in the absence of a complete mature tRNA structure. We discuss the implications of this observation in defining the relationships between archaeal and eucaryal tRNA processing systems and the roles of these archaeal enzymes in cellular RNA processing. H. volcaniistrain WFD11 (18Charlebois R.L. Lam W.L. Cline S.W. Doolittle W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8530-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was grown aerobically at 37 °C in complex medium (19Nieuwlandt D.T. Daniels C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7104-7110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and when necessary to ensure maintenance of pWL-based expression plasmids, this medium was supplemented with 20 μmmevinolin (a gift from Merck). Escherichia coli strains DH5α-F′ and JM110 were cultured in Luria Broth (LB) medium or LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin when cells carried pUC- or pWL-based plasmids. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow DNA polymerase, SuperScriptTMII, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and all restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; SequenaseTM, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; AmpliTaqTM DNA polymerase and GeneAmpTM core reagents were purchased from Perkin-Elmer, and Zeta-Probe nylon membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized by The Ohio State University Biochemical Instrument Center or Ransome Hill Biosciences, Inc. The intron-containing H. volcanii tRNATrpΔ13115′ gene, which contains a complete intron and only the anticodon stem and loop regions of the mature tRNATrp RNA, was isolated from plasmid pVT22-Δ13115′ (20Thompson, L. D. (1990) Ph.D thesis, Dept. of Microbiolgy, Ohio State University.Google Scholar) as a 150-base pairEcoRI-HindIII restriction fragment. Protruding 5′ and 3′ ends of the tRNATrpΔ13115′ fragment were filled in using Klenow DNA polymerase, and this fragment was cloned into theHincII restriction site of the vector pUC1318 (21Kay R. McPherson J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The tRNATrpΔ13115′ gene was recovered from the pUC1318 vector as aXbaI-XbaI restriction fragment, which was then subcloned into the XbaI site of the H. volcaniiexpression vector pWL302A1 (22Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) to yield the plasmid pWL302A1-Δ13115′. The A3 to T3 mutation of the tRNATrpΔ13115′ gene (Fig. 1 B) was prepared using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. The PCR reaction contained 30 mm Tricine, pH 8.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% gelatin, 0.1% Thesit, 200 μm each dNTP, 1 μm of the mutagenic primers T7O168A3-T (5′-AGCTCTAGATAATACGACTCACTATAGGCATGGCGACTGACTCCAGTGGCT-3′), 1 μm of the primer O168short (5′-AGGGATCTAGACCCGATCGACTG-3′), and 2.5 units of AmpliTaqTM DNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and polymerization was carried out for 30 cycles. Each cycle consisted of incubation at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The resulting fragment was cloned into pUC1318 and subcloned into pWL302A1 as described for the wild-type tRNATrpΔ13115′ gene, yielding the plasmid pWL302A1-Δ13115′T3. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli strain JM110, and the plasmids isolated from these strains were then used to transform H. volcanii strain WFD11 (22Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Passage through strain E. coli JM110 (dam −) reduces restriction during transformation of H. volcanii (23Holmes M.L. Nuttall S.D. Dyall-Smith M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3807-3813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled substrate RNAs were generated by T7 RNA polymerase transcription of PCR-amplified DNAs and gel-purified as described previously (9Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18104-18111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tRNATrpΔ13115′ and tRNATrpΔ13115′T3 genes were amplified using the primers T7O168 (5′-AGCTCTAGATAATACGACTCACTATAGGCATGGCGACTGACTCCA-3′) and T7O168A3-T (5′-AGCTCTAGATAATACGACTCACTATAGGCATGGCGACTGACTCCAGTGGCT-3′) as forward primers, respectively, and O1683′ (5′-AACCCCGATCGATCG-3′) as the reverse primer. Reactions were carried out as described above. A typical endonuclease reaction contained 2 μl of an H. volcanii S100 extract (8Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17951-17959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and32P-labeled substrate RNA (10,000 cpm) in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, and 2% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The products were separated by denaturing (8m urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. For analysis of tRNATrpΔ13115′-tRNAProM and tRNATrpΔ13115′T3-tRNAProM RNAs,H. volcanii cells were grown to anA 560 of 1.0 at 37 °C in complex medium (22Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) containing 20 μm mevinolin. Cells from a 25-ml culture volume were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × gand lysed by adding 1.25 ml of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm trisodium citrate, and 1.5% SDS) to the cell pellet. The lysate was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by an additional 10-min incubation on ice. DEPC (25 μl) and NaCl-saturated double distilled H2O (625 μl) were added to the mixture, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. DEPC was omitted from preparations to be used in reverse transcription reactions. The mixture was then transferred to a RNase-free Corex tube, and the contents were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was recovered, and the RNA was ethanol-precipitated. The resulting RNA pellet was washed once with 2 ml of 95% ethanol and resuspended in RNase-free double distilled H2O or RNA loading buffer (7m urea, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). A typical yield was 120 μg of total RNA per 25 ml of original culture volume. For Northern analysis, total RNA isolated from H. volcaniicells, approximately 50 μg in 50 μl of RNA loading buffer, was separated by electrophoresis in a 6% denaturing (7 m urea) polyacrylamide gel. After separation, the RNA was electrophoretically transferred to a Zeta-Probe membrane as described by the manufacturer (Idea Scientific Co., Minneapolis, MN). Northern blots were prehybridized at 50 °C for 10 min in a solution containing 5 × SSC (1 × SSC contains 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm trisodium citrate), 20 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, 10 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA. The prehybridization mixture was discarded and replaced with the same buffer at 150 μl/cm2 Zeta-Probe membrane. Transcripts were detected by probing with one of either two 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotides: ProExI (5′-CCCAAAGCGAGAATCATACCAC-3′) specific for the 3′ reporter gene tRNAProM or IntDel (5′-GGACTCTAGAATTCGAG-3′) specific for the splice junction formed by exons 1 and 2. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Hybridizations were conducted overnight at 50 °C for ProExI and 45 °C for IntDel. Following hybridization the membranes were washed three times for 15 min in 400 ml of wash buffer (2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS) at 22 °C. Hybrids were detected by autoradiography. For sequential hybridizations, blots were stripped between hybridizations by washing the membrane twice in a solution containing 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 95 °C. A reverse transcription-PCR approach was used to verify that the 180-nucleotide RNA species resulted from accurate exon-intron cleavage and exon ligation at the tRNATrpΔ13115′ processing site of the hybrid RNA. ProExI (20 pmol) was annealed with 25 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction volume of 1 × Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase buffer (50.0 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40 mm KCl, 6.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol) at 80 °C for 4 min. This mixture was then allowed to cool to room temperature over a course of 5 min. First strand cDNA synthesis was initiated with the addition of 30 μl of cDNA extension mixture (50.0 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40 mm KCl, 6.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.25 mm of each dNTP) and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase buffer; reactions were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. Reverse transcriptase was then inactivated by raising the reaction temperature to 95 °C for 2 min. RNA was degraded by adding 1 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) and incubation of the mixture for 10 min at 42 °C. Proteins were removed from the reaction by extracting the mixture once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform. cDNAs were ethanol- precipitated, and the precipitate was washed once with 400 μl of 75% ethanol, dried, and redissolved in 20 μl of double distilled H2O. cDNAs were amplified by PCR as described above using the primers Prol5′ (5′-GCAAGGGGACTCTAGAGT-3′) and ProExI. Reverse transcriptase DNA products from this reaction were cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19 and sequenced using the SequenaseTM system. Five individual pUC19 clones were examined, and each was determined to have the identical insert. Based on in vitro processing studies, the tRNATrpΔ13115′ variant of the H. volcanii tRNATrp gene was chosen as a model RNA to investigate the requirements for mature tRNA structure in in vivo tRNA splicing. This gene encodes an RNA having the complete tRNATrp intron and only the anticodon stem-loop of the mature tRNA. This RNA is accurately and efficiently cleaved by a partially purified H. volcanii tRNA intron endonuclease (8Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17951-17959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether these sequences and structures were sufficient for cleavage in vivo we needed a carrier RNA to express this potentially unstable form of the tRNATrp RNA. Previous in vivo expression studies showed that a modified version of the yeast tRNAPro(UGG) RNA, tRNAProM, could be expressed in H. volcanii on the expression plasmid pWL302A1 (22Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This gene encoded a single stable transcript that represented the primary transcript from this gene. The production of a single RNA species was the result of two processing defects in this RNA, a U6-U72 pair preventing 5′ and 3′ termini processing and an intron that is not recognized by the H. volcanii endonuclease (24Nieuwlandt D.T. Carr M.B. Daniels C.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The yeast tRNAProM DNA fragment also carried a RNA polymerase III termination element that functioned as a strong terminator in H. volcanii. 2Y-P. Kuo and C. J. Daniels, unpublished results. We reasoned that introduction of the tRNATrpΔ13115′ gene into the 5′ leader region of the yeast tRNAProM construct would lead to the production of a stable RNA hybrid. This hybrid gene and its expected transcript are show in Fig. 1. Processing of the tRNATrpΔ13115′-tRNAProM hybrid transcript was followed by Northern analysis. When an oligonucleotide specific to the yeast tRNAProM RNA exon 2 was used as a probe, three RNA species were detected (Fig. 2 A). The approximated sizes of these RNAs were 285, 180, and 140 nucleotides. The largest RNA species corresponded in size to the expected primary transcript, and the smallest RNA species, 140 nucleotides, corresponded in size to the predicted RNA resulting from cleavage at the tRNATrpΔ13115′ RNA intron-3′ exon boundary. The intermediate species, 180 nucleotides, was similar in size to the product predicted for cleavage at both exon-intron boundaries, followed by exon ligation (Fig. 2 A, left panel). The other expected intermediate of the reaction, exon 1-intron RNA, was also detected when an exon 1-specific probe was used (data not shown).Figure 2Processing of the hybrid H. volcanii tRNATrpΔ13115′-ProM and tRNATrpΔ13115′T3-ProM RNAs.

This probe hybridized to both the mature, chromosome-encoded tRNATrp RNA and the 180-nucleotide species, suggesting that correct cleavage and ligation had occurred with the hybrid RNA. As an independent test that the cleavage reactions observed in vivo were the result of the tRNA intron endonuclease activity, and not a general ribonuclease, the processing pattern of a cleavage-defective form of the tRNATrp RNA, tRNATrpΔ13115′T3-ProM, was also examined. This RNA contains a single point mutation at the exon 1-intron boundary, A3 to T3 at position 41 (see Fig. 1 B), which leads to an 80% decrease in in vitro cleavage when compared with the wild-type RNA (Fig.2 B, left panel). Northern analysis of RNAs from cells carrying the tRNATrpΔ13115′T3-ProM gene show that this RNA remains predominately as the primary transcript (Fig. 2 B,right panel). A minor species (<10% of the total), which corresponded in size to an RNA resulting from cleavage at the exon 1-intron boundary, was also detected. The inability of this RNA to process in vivo is consistent with its cleavage propertiesin vitro and suggests that the in vivo processing of the tRNATrpΔ13115′-ProM RNA was the result of endonuclease activity. To further verify that the 180-nucleotide RNA species produced from the tRNATrpΔ13115′-ProM gene was the product of both cleavage and ligation, cDNAs were synthesized from this RNA and used as template for PCR amplification. The cDNA was synthesized using a primer specific for the yeast tRNAProM RNA, and PCR amplification was carried out with oligonucleotides specific for sequences 5′ of the tRNATrpΔ13115′ encoding region and a sequence internal to the yeast tRNAProM RNA. This prevented cDNA synthesis and amplification of chromosome-encoded tRNATrp RNA. Five DNA products were sequenced, and all had the predicted sequence for accurate cleavage and ligation of the tRNATrpΔ13115′ RNA (Fig. 3). Based on in vitro processing studies of the H. volcanii tRNATrp RNA we predicted that in vivo cleavage of the intron from this pretRNA would be dependent on exon-intron boundary sequences and structures and independent of mature tRNA structure and sequences beyond those of the anticodon stem and loop (8Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17951-17959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18104-18111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the requirements observed in vitroreflected the requirements for in vivo processing we introduced the H. volcanii tRNATrpΔ13115′ gene into the 5′ unprocessed leader region of the yeast tRNAProM RNA. As anticipated, Northern analysis confirmed that the predicted hybrid RNA was produced and that this RNA underwent cleavage in the absence of a complete mature tRNA structure (Fig. 2 A). RNA species consistent with cleavage at both 5′ and 3′ exon-intron boundaries were detected indicating that both cleavage sites were recognized. The inability of the in vitro processing-defective tRNATrpΔ13115′T3-ProM RNA to undergo processing in vivo supported the proposal that the hybrid RNA was cleaved by endonuclease rather than a general ribonuclease. Unexpectedly, an additional 180 nucleotide species was detected in cells that carried the tRNATrpΔ13115′-ProM RNA gene. This RNA corresponded in size to an RNA that had undergone cleavage at both sites and exon ligation (Fig. 2 B). Sequence analysis of cDNAs derived from this 180-nucleotide RNA by reverse transcription and PCR amplification verified that this RNA resulted from both accurate cleavage and exon ligation (Fig. 3). These data confirm earlier in vitro observations that the halobacterial tRNA processing system is capable of acting on non-tRNA substrates (8Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17951-17959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and show for the first time that the tRNA ligation reaction is independent of mature tRNA structure. These results also provide an explanation for how a single endonuclease could act on a population of intron-containing pretRNAs where all introns are not located in the same relative position in the mature tRNA. In this case the primary criteria for recognition would be the presence of the bulge-helix-bulge motif. Indeed, most archaeal intron-containing tRNAs possess this or a closely related structure at their exon-intron boundaries (8Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17951-17959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Thompson L.D. Brandon L.D. Nieuwlandt D.T. Daniels C.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,26Kjems J. Garrett R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A processing system that is directed toward sequences and structures at the exon-intron boundaries could in theory cleave any RNA, regardless of its origin or final structure. Structural analysis of archaeal intron-containing 16 S and 23 S rRNA precursors has shown that these RNAs have the tRNA bulge-helix-bulge motif or closely related structures at their exon-intron boundaries (27Garrett R.A. Agaard C. Andersen M. Dalgaard J.Z. Lykke-Andersen J. Phan H.T.N. Trevisanato S. Ostergaard L. Larsen N. Leffers H. System. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 680-691Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Some rRNA introns also encode homing endonucleases (28Dalgaard J.Z. Garrett R.A. Belfort M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28885-28892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dalgaard J.Z.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4583-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) similar to those found in some group I introns; however, the characteristic core group I RNA structures and sequences are absent in these introns. This has led to the proposal that these intron-containing rRNAs are processed by the same enzyme system as the pretRNAs (8Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17951-17959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kjems J. Jensen J. Olesen T. Garrett R.A. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Thompson L.D. Brandon L.D. Nieuwlandt D.T. Daniels C.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Kjems J. Garrett R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In support of this proposal a partially purified Desulfurococcus mobilis 23 S rRNA intron endonuclease was found to cleave an intron-containing tRNA from this same organism (15Kjems J. Jensen J. Olesen T. Garrett R.A. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ability of this endonuclease to act on tRNA and rRNA substrates raises the question of whether this enzyme could act as a general RNA endonuclease. One possible candidate is the primary transcript from the rRNA operon. Sequence analysis of archaeal rRNA operons has shown that the 16 S and 23 S rRNA coding regions are flanked by large inverted repeats. As in bacterial cells, these helices are though to be sites for RNaseIII cleavage (32Apirion D. Miczak A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, we and others (25Thompson L.D. Brandon L.D. Nieuwlandt D.T. Daniels C.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Garrett R.A. Dalgaard J. Larsen N. Kjems J. Mankin A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have noted that the archaeal helices possess the characteristic bulge-helix-bulge motif of the tRNA exon-intron boundaries. It is possible that these structures are recognized by the tRNA endonuclease rather than a RNaseIII-like enzyme. Interestingly, a survey of the Methanococcus jannaschii genome (34Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.-F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar) did not reveal the presence of an RNaseIII-like gene in this organism. The results of this study also show that ligation can take place in the absence of mature tRNA structure. A ligase capable of joining exon ends held in close juxtaposition would be expected to act on those tRNAs where the intron was excised from a position other than the anticodon loop. This ligase could also act on the rRNA exons produced by endonuclease cleavage of introns from these RNAs. The lack of anin vitro assay for ligase has prevented us from determining if the archaeal ligase is similar to the ATP-GTP-requiring ligase of yeast and HeLa cells (35Phizicky E.M. Schwartz R.C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2978-2986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the ATP-independent ligase of vertebrates (36Perkins K.K. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Intron circularization has been observed during D. mobilis rRNA cleavage; however, the exons remain unligated in this reaction (37Kjems J. Garrett R.A. Cell. 1988; 54: 693-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Halophile extracts also lack ligase activity (8Thompson L.D. Daniels C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17951-17959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A survey of the M. jannaschii genome (34Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.-F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Merrick J.M. Glodek A. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar) did not reveal genes related to the eucaryal tRNA ligase. Similarities in the exon-intron boundaries of archaeal rRNAs and tRNAs and the finding that the halobacterial tRNA intron endonuclease and ligase enzymes act on non-tRNA RNAs provide further support for the proposal that the archaeal tRNA and rRNA introns are processed by the same enzyme system. In addition, the recently discovered similarities between the archaeal and eucaryal tRNA intron endonucleases (3Trotta C.R. Miao F. Arn E.A. Ho C.K. Rauhut R. Abelson J.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 4Kleman-Leyer K. Armbruster D.A. Daniels C.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the tRNA introns of these two domains and the rRNA introns of the Archaea represent a single class of introns. The molecular mechanisms that have led to changes in the substrate recognition properties of the archaeal and eucaryal endonucleases is not yet understood. It is likely that the these differences are in part due to the divergence in the two yeast endonuclease subunits that are related to the halobacterial endonuclease protein. These two subunits are not identical as they are in the archaeal enzyme, and as a consequence they may have different RNA binding characteristics. The presence of other subunits in the yeast endonuclease may also influence the interaction of this enzyme with its substrate. Finally, no intron-containing mRNAs have been detected in the Archaea to date; however, the properties of the archaeal intron processing system described in this report indicate that a tRNA-like intron could exist in a mRNA."

The functionality of the reconstituted ribosomes was demonstrated inin vitro mRNA-directed protein synthesis.

The reassembly proceeded well with immature precursors of ribosomal RNA but poorly if at all with mature cytoplasmic RNA species. Reassembly also required a preparation of small nuclear RNA(s), acting as morphopoietic factor(s). In vitro reconstitution of functional ribosomal subunits from free Escherichia coli rRNA and proteins was reported almost 30 years ago (1Traub P. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 737-741Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 2Nomura M. Erdmann V.A. Nature. 1970; 288: 744-746Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Maruta H. Tsukiya T. Mizuno D. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 61: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). More recently it has been accomplished also with archaebacteria (4Sanchez M.E. Amils R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 5Sanchez M.E. Londei P. Amils R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, all attempts to reconstitute eukaryotic ribosomes have failed, although their biogenesis in vivo has been well characterized (6Klootwijk J. Planta R.J.

Planta R.J. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 71-77PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe the in vitro reassembly of functional ribosomal subunits from free ribosomal RNA and proteins of Dictyostelium discoideum. The pioneer work of Nomura and co-workers (1Traub P. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 737-741Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 2Nomura M. Erdmann V.A. Nature. 1970; 288: 744-746Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) has established for the first time that the information sufficient to assemble a cell organelle are contained in its components. It has been extremely useful in studying the function of single ribosomal proteins both in ribosome assembly and in their interactions with the other components of the translation machinery. Nevertheless, the experimental conditions used to reconstitute bacterial ribosomal subunits in vitro were probably much different from those in which the assembly process occursin vivo. We have shown that a step requiring high energy and that could be accomplished in vitro only by the exposure of the reconstitution mixture to high, nonphysiological temperatures (1Traub P. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 737-741Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar,2Nomura M. Erdmann V.A. Nature. 1970; 288: 744-746Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was probably not the limiting step in ribosome assembly in vivo (14Turco E. Altruda F. Ponzetto A. Mangiarotti G. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4752-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although ribosome assembly also occurs in E. coli cells in discrete steps (15Mangiarotti G. Apirion D. Silengo L. Schlessinger D. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the high energy requirement is probably overcome in vivo by some factor(s) not present among the components derived from mature 70 S ribosomes. We and others have found that in E. coli newly formed 30 S ribosomal subunits still contain immature pre-16 S rRNA (16Lindhal T. Nature. 1973; 221: 132-133Google Scholar, 17Mangiarotti G. Turco E. Ponzetto A. Altruda F. Nature. 1974; 247: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The extra sequences present in immature rRNA must facilitate the assembly process, since in vitro pre-16 S rRNA, but not mature 16 S rRNA, was incorporated instantaneously into 30 S particles in the presence of ribosomal proteins even at 0 °C (18Mangiarotti G. Turco E. Perlo C. Altruda F. Nature. 1975; 253: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our interest in the in vitro reconstitution of eukaryotic ribosomes has been prompted by the finding that during development ofD. discoideum the stability of a class of mRNAs is controlled by a mechanism that involves the modification of one or several components of 40 S ribosomal subunits (19Mangiarotti G. Lefebrve P. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Mangiarotti G. Ceccarelli A. Lodish H.F.

Pergolizzi, manuscript in preparation.In trying to accomplish the reconstitution of eukaryotic ribosomes, we took advantage of our previous studies on ribosome assembly in E. coli. Here we report that D. discoideum immature precursor rRNAs are also better substrates than mature cytoplasmic 17 and 26 S rRNAs for the in vitro reconstitution process. Furthermore, a nuclear component, probably one or several small nucleolar RNAs, which are not present in 40 or 60 S ribosomal particles, plays an essential role. Dictyostelium discoideum AX2 cells were grown as described previously (22Mangiarotti G. Chung S. Zuker C. Lodish H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 9: 947-954Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Growing cells at a density of 2 × 106/ml were washed twice by centrifugation in Sorensen buffer and resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 2 × 108 cells/ml. In a typical experiment, 200 μCi of [H3]uracil were added to 10 ml of cell suspension for 30 min. Cells were then pelleted and lysed in ice-cold 25 mmHEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 25 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5% sucrose, and 2% Tergitol (buffer A). The lysate was spun in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at top speed for 20 s to remove cell debris and then for 5 min to pellet the nuclei, which contained most of the incorporated label. Nuclei were lysed by resuspension in buffer A not containing sucrose and Tergitol, and the lysate was centrifuged in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 170,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C through a 15–35% sucrose gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH.7.8, 0.5 mNH4Cl, 50 mm magnesium acetate, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer B). Fractions sedimenting at 40 and 60 S were collected separately, ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in buffer B, and centrifuged again through a sucrose gradient to isolate pure 40 and 60 S particles. From each of these preparations, RNA was extracted with Ultraspec-II RNA (Biotecx Laboratories), following the procedure suggested by the manufacturer. RNA (about 3–4 μg from 40 S particles and 6–8 μg from 60 S particles) was ethanol-precipitated and redissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (TE buffer). One mCi of [14C]uracil was added to another 10-ml cell suspension for 8 h, followed by a large excess of unlabeled uracil for 2 h. Cells were lysed, nuclei and cytoplasm were separated, and rRNA was extracted from isolated cytoplasmic 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits as described above. The effectiveness of nuclei and cytoplasm separation was verified by the fact that nuclei did not contain any 14C-labeled RNA, while cytoplasm did not contain any 3H-labeled 36 S RNA (the large precursor of ribosomal RNAs). 3H-Labeled (nuclear) and 14C-labeled (cytoplasmic) rRNAs, isolated as described above, were mixed together in an appropriate ratio, denatured by heating at 65 °C in 50% formamide for 5 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 6 m urea. At the end of the run, the gel was cut into 1.5-mm slices, which were counted in Triaton solution (Packard). 3H-Labeled rRNA was also extracted from in vitro reconstituted ribosomal particles isolated by sedimentation through sucrose gradients, and it was analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described above. 108 cells were starved, plated on a 2.8-cm Millipore filter embedded with 10 mCi of 32P in MES-PDF 3The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; pCp, cytidine 3′,5′-biphosphate. buffer (19Mangiarotti G. Lefebrve P. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After 2 h, cells were collected and lysed, and RNA was extracted from nuclear and cytoplasmic 40 and 60 S particles as described above. Each RNA preparation was sedimented through sucrose gradients to display nuclear precursor 19 and 28 S RNAs and cytoplasmic mature 17 and 26 S RNAs (23Iwabuchi M. Mizukami Y. Sameshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 228: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Frankel G. Cockburn A.F. Kindle K.L. Firtel R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 539-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Batts-Young B. Maizels N. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3952-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each fraction was concentrated by ethanol precipitation, digested with RNase T1, and analyzed as described by Batts-Younget al. (25Batts-Young B. Maizels N. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3952-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted with Ultraspec-II RNA from nuclei derived from 109 unlabeled growing cells, ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in TE buffer, and chromatographed on an oligo(dT)-cellulose column to eliminate poly(A)+ RNA, as described previously (19Mangiarotti G. Lefebrve P. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Poly(A)− RNA was fractionated on a 15–35% sucrose gradient containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, and 0.5 m NH4Cl in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 170,000 × g for 36 h to display 19 S RNA and smaller RNAs. Each fraction from the top half of the gradient was tested for its ability to support in vitro ribosome reconstitution. A fraction moving at about 7 S, which turned out to be active, was labeled with [32P]pCp (26England T.E. Bruce A.G. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 8% polyacrylamide gel in 6 m urea, followed by autoradiography. The nuclear RNA fraction sedimenting at about 7 S and labeled in vitrowith [32P]pCp was separated by gel electrophoresis into two major bands. A faint band was visible in front of each of the two major bands, while another 13 bands appeared after an exposure longer than the one shown in Fig. 5. However, the two major bands in the latter case obscured part of the gel. Therefore, the number of different small nuclear or nucleolar RNAs present in the fraction sedimenting at about 7 S could not be determined precisely. RNA was extracted as described in Ref. 24Frankel G. Cockburn A.F. Kindle K.L. Firtel R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 539-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar from the regions of the gel corresponding to each of the two major bands and the regions containing the faint bands. The RNA corresponding to each region of the gel was tested both for its ability to substitute for nuclear lysate in supporting in vitro reconstitution of ribosomal subunits (see below) and to hybridize to cloned DNAs containing rRNA genes. Phage DNAs each containing a different gene for rRNAs (17, 5.8, 26, and 5 S rRNA) were cloned with the hybridization competition technique described by Mangiarotti et al. (22Mangiarotti G. Chung S. Zuker C. Lodish H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 9: 947-954Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 7 S nuclear RNA corresponding to different regions of the gel shown in Fig.5 was hybridized to each of the cloned DNA containing an rRNA gene, in the absence or in the presence of an excess of the corresponding unlabeled rRNA species, following the procedure described in Ref.19Mangiarotti G. Lefebrve P. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. Nucleoli were isolated following the procedure described in Ref. 27Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 20: 115-122Google Scholar, as modified by Frankel et al. (24Frankel G. Cockburn A.F. Kindle K.L. Firtel R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 539-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Growing cells were collected and lysed in buffer B containing 2% Tergitol. Ribosomal 40 and 60 S subunits were isolated by centrifugation through sucrose gradients as described above. To extract ribosomal proteins, ribosomal subunits (50 A 260/ml) were adjusted to 0.1m magnesium acetate, and 2.2 volumes of glacial acetic acid were added dropwise with constant stirring in the cold, as described in Ref. 28Ramagopal S. Ennis H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. Stirring was continued for 1 h, and rRNA was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min. The extracted proteins were dialyzed against 300 volumes of 6 m urea, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 18 h in the cold. To facilitate the analysis of ribosomal proteins by two-dimensional gel electophoresis, growing cells were resuspended in Sorensen buffer and labeled with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine and cysteine for 3 h. The labeled proteins were extracted as described above from native or in vitro reconstituted 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits and analyzed as described by Ramagopal and Ennis (28Ramagopal S. Ennis H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 10 μg of 40 S ribosomal proteins in 0.2 ml of 6m urea were mixed with 4 μg of 3H-labeled 19 S RNA or 14C-labeled 17 S RNA in 0.1 ml of TE buffer and 20 μg of 60 S ribosomal proteins in 0.4 ml of 6 m urea were mixed with 8 μg of 3H-labeled 5, 5.8, and 28 S RNAs or14C-labeled 5, 5.8, and 26 S RNAs in 0.2 ml of TE buffer. The RNA and protein mixtures were dialyzed at 23 °C for 12 h against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.5 m NH4Cl, 20 mmMgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Growing cells were washed twice in Sorensen buffer and lysed in buffer A. The lysate was spun in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at top speed for 20 s to remove cell debris and then for 5 min to pellet nuclei. The nuclei were lysed by resuspension in TE buffer and centrifuged in a 55 Ti rotor in a TL Beckman ultracentrifuge at 250,000 × g for 2 h to discard any particle the size of ribosomal subunits or larger. When nuclear lysate was added to ribosomal subunit reconstitution mixtures, the amount of nuclear lysate and the amount of rRNA utilized were derived from a comparable number of cells. Cells were lysed in buffer A. The lysate was spun in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at top speed for 10 min to pellet microsomes and lysosomes. The supernatant was centrifuged in a 55 Ti rotor in a TL Beckman ultracentrifuge at 250,000 × g for 5 h to pellet all ribosomal particles. The supernatant (S55) was dialyzed for 3 h against buffer A not containing sucrose and Tergitol. S55 represented the source of all factors required for protein synthesis except ribosomes and mRNA. Protein synthesis was measured at 23 °C for 15 min in a total reaction volume of 100 μl containing 10 μg of S55 proteins in the presence of the following components: 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mmpotassium acetate, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3 μg of creatine phophokinase, 250 mm each of 19 amino acids (excluding methionine), 200 μg ofDictyostelium tRNA, 20 μCi of [35S]methionine. Poly(A)+ RNA, prepared as described by Mangiarotti et al. (19Mangiarotti G. Lefebrve P. Lodish H.F. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was added in the amount of 10 μg. The composition of the system was such that the rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine over the 15-min period of incubation increased linearly with the amount of native ribosomes added to the reaction mixture. The linearity was checked up to 40 μg of ribosomes/100 μl. Since we used much lower amounts of ribosomes in the experiment described in Table I, the data reported should reflect exclusively the functional capacity of the tested ribosomes without the interference of any other limiting factor.Figure 5Analysis of the 7 S nuclear RNA fraction. RNA contained in fraction 18 of the gradient shown in Fig. 3 was labeled with [32P]pCp and electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel (right lane). On a parallel lane (left lane) a sample containing 5 S RNA (lower band) and 5.8 S RNA (upper band) also labeled with [32P]pCp was electrophoresed. The gel was autoradiographed.

Open table in a new tab Nuclear and cytoplasmic ribosomal particles were labeled differentially with [3H]uracil and [14C]uracil. Nuclear particles cosedimenting with cytoplasmic 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits could be isolated. RNA contained in these particles was analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 A). Nuclear 40 S particles contained an RNA that was larger than the cytoplasmic 17 S rRNA, and nuclear 60 S particles contained 5 and 5.8 S RNA plus a molecule that was larger than the cytoplasmic 26 S rRNA. We call the two large RNAs 19 and 28 S from their sedimentation rate through the sucrose gradient (Fig. 3). These molecules are similar in size to the precursor rRNAs described previously in D. discoideum (23Iwabuchi M. Mizukami Y. Sameshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 228: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Frankel G. Cockburn A.F. Kindle K.L. Firtel R.A. J. Mol.

To determine whether they were also similar by sequence, we have analyzed the RNase T1 fingerprint of32P-labeled rRNAs present in nuclear and cytoplasmic 40 and 60 S particles (Fig. 2). The patterns obtained were practically superimposable to those reported in Ref.25Batts-Young B. Maizels N. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Nuclear immature rRNAs and cytoplasmic mature rRNAs were labeled in vivo with 32P, isolated, RNase T1-digested, and electrophoresed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A, 19 S RNA; panel B, 17 S RNA; panel C, 28 S RNA; panel D, 26 S RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the labeled rRNAs were incubated with 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunit proteins under different salt and temperature conditions, no particles sedimenting at 40 or 60 S were formed (Fig.3 A). However, when a small amount of nuclear lysate depleted of ribosomal subunits (see “Experimental Procedures”) was added to the incubation mixture,3H-labeled 19 S RNA was incorporated into particles sedimenting as 40 S and 3H-labeled 5, 5.8, and 28 S RNAs were incorporated into particles sedimenting as 60 S with an efficiency of 80–90%, while 14C-labeled mature RNAs were incorporated into similar particles with an efficiency of at most 10% (Fig. 3 B). The amount of nuclear lysate required was that derived from a number of cells comparable with the one from which the rRNA had been derived. The amount of ribosomal proteins needed was twice that of the rRNA, probably because some proteins were partially denatured during the extraction procedure. Ribosome reconstitution therefore proceeds more efficiently with nuclear immature rRNA than with cytoplasmic mature rRNA, and a nuclear component plays an important role in the assembly process. The required nuclear lysate could be replaced by an RNA fraction that was extracted from nuclei with guanidine and phenol and sedimented at about 7 S in zonal sedimentation in a sucrose gradient (Fig.4). The 7 S fraction contained two major RNA species plus several minor species, which could be separated by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5, right lane). The minor species are only partially visible in Fig. 5, but they became visible with a longer exposure of the gel. The number of small nuclear or nucleolar species present in the 7 S fraction was at least 17, but we cannot exclude the possibility that several species comigrated in our gel, masking an even greater complexity of this RNA fraction. The RNAs corresponding to each of the two bands shown in Fig. 5 (right lane) and to the faint bands were recovered from the gel and hybridized to cloned DNAs containing the gene of 17, 5.8, 26, or 5 S rRNA. The RNA corresponding to the upper major band hybridized only to DNA containing the 5.8 S RNA gene, but its hybridization was completely prevented by the addition of an excess of unlabeled 5.8 S rRNA (Fig. 6). The RNA corresponding to the lower major band and to the faint bands did not hybridize to any ribosomal DNA. Thus, the first RNA is probably a precursor of 5.8 S rRNA, not previously detected in D. discoideum but already described in other eukaryotic species (29Trapman J. Planta R.J. Raue H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 442: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,30Henry Y. Wood H. Morissey J.P. Petfalski E. Kearsey J. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2452-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), while the other RNAs must be small nuclear RNAs. The RNAs corresponding to the two major bands shown in Fig. 5(right lane) and to the faint bands were separately tested for their ability to promote ribosomal particle reconstitution in the absence of nuclear lysate. In the presence of the RNA corresponding to the upper major band, no ribosomal particles formed. Thus, the requirement for the 7 S nuclear fraction is not due to the requirement for an immature 5.8 S rRNA. In the presence of the RNA corresponding to the lower major band, nuclear 3H-labeled rRNA was incorporated into 40 and 60 S particles to an extent comparable to that with nuclear lysate (Fig. 7). Thus, the small nuclear RNA corresponding to the lower major band in Fig. 5 can fully replace the nuclear lysate in the reconstitution system. In the presence of the RNAs corresponding to the faint bands, no ribosomal particles formed. The active small nuclear RNA fraction has not yet been further characterized. Though it gives origin to only one band by gel electrophoresis analysis, it might contain several small nuclear RNAs that comigrate under our electrophoretic conditions. Thus, although the small nuclear RNA fraction is required for the reconstitution of both 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits, we cannot know whether this function is carried out by the same RNA species. We cannot determine the stoichiometry of the small nuclear RNA and of the rRNA in the assembly process, because we cannot detect the first RNA by the A 260 absorbance in the preparative sucrose gradient. However, since we have labeled with [32P]pCp the 7 S RNA fraction in parallel with known amounts of 5 and 5.8 S RNAs, we can roughly estimate that the labeled major 7 S lower band contained 10−3 μg of RNA, judging by the amount of the other two RNAs run on the gel to obtain bands of intensity comparable with the one of the 7 S RNA. Thus, the stoichiometry of the assembly reaction should be 1 small nuclear RNA/100–200 rRNA molecule species. It is evident that the 7 S RNA functions catalytically in stimulating ribosome assembly. We have repeated the experiments shown in Figs. 4 and 7 with RNA extracted from nucleoli. This RNA contained a fraction that sedimented at 7 S on a sucrose gradient, could be labeled with [32P]pCp, and gave an electrophoretic pattern similar to the one shown in Fig. 5 (right lane). The lower major band could support the in vitro reconstitution of 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits with the same efficiency as the 7 S nuclear band in the experiment of Fig. 7. This suggests that the active nuclear 7 S fraction is probably a small nucleolar RNA. Ribosomal proteins labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine were extracted from cytoplasmic 40 and 60 S subunits and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 8, A andC). An aliquot of these proteins was used to reconstitutein vitro 40 and 60 S particles starting from nuclear immature rRNA and in the presence of the 7 S small nuclear RNA fraction. As shown in Fig. 8, B and D, the reconstituted particles contained all of the ribosomal proteins present in native subunits at comparable amounts. To test their functionality, the 3H-labeled particles reconstituted in the presence of nuclear lysate or of the 7 S small nuclear RNA were incubated in a cell-free system for protein synthesis (31Sonneman J. Drugeon G. Haenni A. Mutzel R. FEBS Lett. 1933; 329: 183-188Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) lacking endogenous ribosomes and programmed with poly(A)+ RNA extracted from Dictyostelium cells. We tested native subunits alone and several amounts of each species of reconstituted particles in the presence of an excess of the other species of native subunit (Table I). As we mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” the added ribosomes are the only limiting factor of the rate of [35S]methionine incorporation. The relative activity of the tested ribosomes can therefore be directly compared. With all types of reconstituted particles, the efficiency of incorporation was 85–90% of that obtained with native ribosomal subunits. In additional experiments, the 3H-labeled ribosomal subunits reconstituted in the presence of nuclear lysate or of 7 S small nuclear RNA entered polyribosomes in a cell-free system to the same extent as native cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits (Fig.9). The three kinds of subunits entered polyribosomes at an efficiency of 50–60%, a level close to the one found in growing cells. Thus, the original activity of the subunits used for the reconstitution experiment, the efficiency of the reassembly, and the functionality of reconstituted particles were comparable with those obtained with E. coli ribosomes (1Traub P. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 737-741Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Data to be published elsewhere2 show that the in vitro reconstituted 40 S ribosomal subunits are also functional in an in vitro test of their ability to destabilize specific mRNAs, when their protein components are obtained from cells at a developmental stage in which the same mRNAs are highly unstablein vivo. Since in vitro reconstitution of ribosomal subunits requires small nuclear RNA and small nuclear (or nucleolar) RNA is known to be involved in rRNA processing (32Mattai I.W. Tollervey D. Seraphin B. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Chu S. Archer R.H. Zengel J.M. Lindhal L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1966; 272: 268-270Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar), one possibility to test was that ribosome reconstitution is dependent upon or concomitant with rRNA maturation. On the contrary, Fig.1 B shows that the rRNA molecules contained in reconstituted particles retained the same size they had in vivo. The results reported above suggested the possibility that in vivo assembled ribosomal subunits still present in nuclei and containing immature RNA can already function in protein synthesis. To examine this possibility, we tested3H-labeled ribosomal particles isolated from nuclei in thein vitro protein synthesis system described under “Experimental Procedures.” They were as active as unlabeled ribosomal subunits isolated from polyribosomes (Table I). The data reported here show that, in the presence of a nuclear component, eukaryotic 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits can be reconstituted in vitro from free D. discoideumrRNA and ribosomal proteins. This should provide a new opportunity to study the structure and function of eukaryotic ribosomes. The in vitro reconstituted ribosomal subunits have a full complement of ribosomal proteins and are fully functional in protein synthesis. Data to be published elsewhere2 show that they are active also in a newly discovered function, the control of the stability of a class of developmentally regulated mRNAs. The in vitro system described here for ribosome reconstitution indicates some principles that should be applicable to other eukaryotic organisms and help to solve the problem of thein vitro reconstitution of their ribosomal particles. One is that mature rRNA, extracted from cytoplasmic ribosomes, is an inadequate substrate for the reconstitution reaction. A much better substrate is immature precursor rRNA extracted from nuclei. It is likely that the extra sequences present in precursor RNA play some role in the assembly process. This is in agreement with the finding that nuclear particles sedimenting at 40 and 60 S and therefore presumably fully assembled still contain immature RNA. The same is true for ribosomal particles reconstituted in vitro and containing a full complement of ribosomal proteins. Both nuclear and in vitro reconstituted particles containing immature rRNA are active in protein synthesis. This suggests that in Dictyosteliumthe last step in ribosome assembly is RNA maturation, as in E. coli (17Mangiarotti G. Turco E. Ponzetto A. Altruda F. Nature. 1974; 247: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Mangiarotti G. Turco E. Perlo C. Altruda F.

FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and probably in yeast (40Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1412-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data to be published elsewhere2 show that in Dictyostelium, as inE. coli (14Turco E. Altruda F. Ponzetto A. Mangiarotti G.

FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), ribosomal subunits still containing immature RNA enter polyribosomes directly as they join the cytoplasm. Maturation of rRNA would therefore occur in polyribosomes. In vitro reconstitution of ribosomal particles does not occur autonomously but instead requires morphopoietic factors that are contained in the nucleus. Among these factors there is/are one or several small nuclear RNAs, since the nuclear lysate that drives the reconstitution reaction in our experimental conditions can be substituted by a small nuclear RNA fraction. Since rRNA incorporated in reconstituted particles is still immature, the small nuclear RNA that functions in our system is probably not involved in rRNA trimming but rather in the assembly process. In any case, the principle that the assembly of many cell organelles is facilitated and/or controlled by morphopoietic factors appears to be valid also for eukaryotic ribosomes, as already suggested by in vivo studies (33Chu S. Archer R.H. Zengel J.M. Lindhal L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,34Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev.

It is suggested that binding of the protein substrate initiates domain movement, which is extended to the nucleotide-binding site. The luminescence results are discussed in reference to the structure of GroEL derived from x-ray crystallographic studies. Electron microscopic studies of two-dimensional crystals have shown that Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL is a cylindrical homo-oligomer composed of two rings, each containing seven 57-kDa subunits (1Zahn R. Harris J.R. Pfeifer G. Pluckthun A. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More recently the three-dimensional structure of GroEL (2Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), solved to 2.8-Å resolution, has given a more detailed insight into the domain structure of the GroEL subunit; the apical domain forming the opening of the central cavity contains the substrate-binding site, whereas the largest equatorial domain provides a nucleotide-binding site. GroEL is known to bind at least half of the E. coli proteins in their denatured states (3Vitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that flexibility is required to bind a large variety of proteins differing in primary, secondary and tertiary structure. Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that binding of nucleotides to GroEL induces conformational changes in the apical domain, which influences the affinity of peptides and unfolded proteins (4Jackson G.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16344-16349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ATP-induced conformational changes have been detected with fluorometric techniques in a chemically modified form of GroEL (7Hansen J.E. Gafni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6286-6289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in GroEL mutants containing tryptophan residues in the apical domain (8Gibbons D.L. Hixson J.D. Hay N. Lund P. Gorovits B.M. Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31989-31995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that binding of protein substrates stimulate ATPase activity(4), it is not known whether the same binding process is responsible for conformational changes at the level of the nucleotide-binding site in the equatorial domain. Does the binding of the protein substrate alter the conformation of the nuleotide-binding site? In an attempt to detect coupling between the apical and equatorial domains of GroEL, the luminescence properties of a probe coordinated to the nucleotide-binding site were investigated in detail. The ATP analog 2-deoxy-3-anthraniloyladenosine-5-triphosphate (ANT-dATP) 1The abbreviations used are: ANT-dATP, 2-deoxy-3-anthraniloyladenosine-5-triphosphate; mMDH, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate. 1The abbreviations used are: ANT-dATP, 2-deoxy-3-anthraniloyladenosine-5-triphosphate; mMDH, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate. coordinated to the ion Tb3+ was used for these experiments, because it forms a tightly bound complex with GroEL, which does not undergo a process of hydrolysis, resulting in the formation of ADP and phosphate. Moreover, the donor-acceptor pair, anthraniloyl-Tb3+ is ideally suited for energy transfer experiments, because the absorption band of the acceptor overlaps the emission band of the donor to yield a critical distance of transfer of 5 Å (9Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The fluorescence band of anthraniloyl, maximum at around 410 nm, is easily distinguished from the four phosphorescence bands of Tb3+, which are centered at 490, 545, 580, and 620 nm (10De Harrocks W. Sudnik D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1981; 14: 384-392Crossref Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The results obtained with two different spectroscopic methods, i.e. fluorescence and phosphorescence, covering the time range 2 ns to 1ms, lend support to the contention that the interaction of unfolded proteins with GroEL perturbs the microenvironment of the nucleotide site. The E. coli GroEL gene (11Fayet O. Louran J.M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Gen.

Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH) purchased from Boehringer Mannheim was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography using a linear gradient from 20 to 100 mm of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.

Partially folded mMDH does not recover its catalytic activity in the absence of GroEL, Mg·ATP and GroES. It was prepared essentially as described by Hiratsuka (17Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys.

For titration of GroEL, aliquots from a stock solution (0.2 mm) containing equimolar concentrations of terbium chloride and ANT-dATP in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, were added to GroEL in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7, containing 50 mm KCl. They were performed on Tb3+·ANT-dATP coordinated to GroEL at pH 7 in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 50 mm KCl. E=LTb3+·Qant/Fant·QTb3+Equation 1 where LTb3+ andF ant are the integrated areas for Tb3+ phosphorescence and ANT-dATP fluorescence, respectively, corrected for instrumental response.Q ant = 0.12 and QTb3+ = 0.28 are the quantum yields determined as described in Ref. 9Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. Due to the value ofLTb3+/F ant = 0.013 for Tb ANT-dATP, the efficiency of energy transfer is low. The critical distance of transfer R o = 5 Å for the pair anthraniloyl-Tb3+ was determined with the aid of Förster's equation as described in Ref. 9Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. Experimental data were fitted using the software Kaleidagraph (Albeck Software) and Statgraphics (Statistical Graphic System STSC, Inc.). The affinity of Tb3+for ANT-dATP varies between 0.2 and 0.02 μm, depending upon the pH of the medium. At pH 7, a dissociation constant of 0.05 μm has been determined for the coordinated complex (9Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The anthraniloyl moiety of Tb3+·ANT-dATP exhibits a fluorescence band at around 410 nm and phosphorescence bands at 490, 545, 580, and 620 nm due to sensitized luminescence of Tb3+upon excitation at 320 nm (9Churchich J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Upon binding to GroEL, the fluorescence intensity remains practically constant (Fig. 1), although the emission anisotropy of the derivatized nucleotide in the presence of protein undergoes a significant change from A o = 0.03 for free ligand to A m = 0.15 for bound ligand (Table II).Table IILuminescence properties of Tb 3+ · ANT-dATPSampleAnisotropyEnergy transfer (efficiency)Phosphorescence decaymsTb3+ · ANT-dATP0.030.00651.0Tb3+ · ANT-dATP + GroEL0.150.0111.10Tb3+ · ANT-dATP + GroEL + mMDH0.160.01821.15 Open table in a new tab When the interaction of the ATP analog with the chaperonine was investigated by sensitized luminescence spectroscopy, it was found that the characteristic emission band of Tb3+ at 490, 545, 580, and 620 nm was at least 2-fold enhanced with respect to free Tb3+ ANT-dATP excited at the same wavelength of 320 nm (Fig. 2). Under this set of experimental conditions, i.e. excitation at 320 nm and micromolar concentrations of Tb3+, the luminescence of free Tb3+ ions could not be detected. The enhancement of sensitized luminescence could be attributed to a change in the relative position or orientation of the donor-acceptor pair induced by changes in the microenvironment where ATP binds. This change in efficiency of sensitized luminescence was exploited to determine the stoichiometry of binding. As can be seen from the results included in Fig. 3, the sensitized luminescence at 550 nm increases as a function of Tb3+·ANT-dATP concentration until a maximum value of the intensity is attained at a mixing molar ratio of approximately 1 mol of subunit/mol of Tb3+·ANT-dATP. A truncated subunit obtained by limited thermolysin proteolysis of GroEL failed to bind Tb3+·ANT-dATP, suggesting that the nucleotide binding structure of the chaperonine has been disrupted by proteolysis (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the observation that the truncated protein of 35 kDa stimulates rhodanese activity without the participation of MgATP (15Makino Y. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In an effort to measure the dissociation constant of Tb3+·ANT-dATP bound to GroEL, sensitized luminescence measurements were performed at GroEL concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 μm. At the lowest concentration of protein tested,i.e. 0.1 μm, the addition of 1.4 μm Tb3+·ANT-dATP yields a 2-fold increase in sensitized luminescence when compared with free Tb3+·ANT-dATP. Due to weak signals of the sensitized luminescence at protein concentrations below 0.1 μm, it was difficult to determine the dissociation constant of Tb3+·ANT-dATP coordinated to the protein. However, it is inferred that Tb3+·ANT-dATP binds more tightly than MgATP, whose dissociation constant is above 1 μm(4). To ascertain whether binding of a denatured protein to GroEL influences the spectroscopic properties of a probe positioned at the nucleotide-binding site, the fluorescence and luminescence properties of Tb3+·ANT-dATP coordinated to GroEL were measured in the absence and presence of denatured mMDH. Several reasons led us to choose denatured mMDH for the luminescence experiments. Denaturation of mMDH by guanidinium chloride, followed by dilution with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7, does not restore the physical and biological properties of the undenatured enzyme (19Peralta D. Hartman D.J. Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,20Li, W., and Churchich, J. E. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). Indeed, the formation of partially folded species are easily detected by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography (20Li, W., and Churchich, J. E. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). Spontaneous recovery of catalytic activity occurs in the presence of GroEL, ATP, and GroES. GroEL alone inhibits the spontaneous refolding of mMDH (21Hutchinson J.P. Elthaner T.S.H. Miller A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When partially folded mMDH was added to a solution of GroEL containing an equimolar amount of Tb3+·ANT-dATP, it was found that the emission band of the anthraniloyl chromophore was enhanced with a concomitant red shift in the band position (Fig. 1). A control containing partially folded mMDH and Tb3+·ANT-dATP gave an emission band identical to that of free Tb3+·ANT-dATP, indicating that the fluorescence shift is not due to binding of the ATP analog to the protein substrate. Similar enhancement of anthraniloyl fluorescence was observed when samples of partially folded mMDH, passed through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove guanidinium chloride, were allowed to interact with Tb+3·ANT-dATP-GroEL as shown by the results included in Fig. 4. Hence, changes in anthraniloyl fluorescence induced by addition of partially folded mMDH could not by attributed to perturbation of the structure of GroEL by the denaturing agent. The increase in fluorescence intensity at 410 nm was used to determine the stoichiometry of binding. As can be seen from the results included in Fig. 4, the fluorescence emitted by the anthraniloyl chromophore increases as a function of denatured mMDH concentration until it reaches a maximum at a molar mixing ration of GroEL to partially folded mMDH of approximately 1:1. The binding of partially folded mMDH to GroEL not only influences the fluorescence emitted by the anthraniloyl chromophore, but also the sensitized luminescence of Tb3+ as shown by the results included in Fig. 2. It might be argued that the increase in fluorescence and sensitized luminescence of Tb3+·ANT-dATP is due to the formation of a complex in which the denatured protein interacts directly with the ATP-binding sites of GroEL. Although denatured mMDH does not bind ANT-dATP, the possibility exists that upon binding to GroEL additional hydrophobic binding sites on the denatured protein are exposed to interactions with anthraniloyl chromophores. To test this hypothesis, the exposure of hydrophobic groups in partially folded mMDH was followed by measuring changes in the fluorescence emission of the extrinsic probe, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS), which is known to recognize hydrophobic clusters in proteins. Fig.5 shows the results obtained when the denatured protein, in the absence and presence of GroEL, was allowed to interact with 40-fold molar excess of ANS. A pronounced increase in the fluorescence yield of the extrinsic probe is due to the presence of denatured mMDH. Further increase is observed in the presence of GroEL, but this enhancement of fluorescence is due to binding of ANS to the chaperonin as shown by the results included in Fig. 5. Thus, it appears that binding of partially folded mMDH to GroEL does not result in the exposure of additional hydrophobic sites. Moreover, it should be noted that the binding of partially folded mMDH to Tb+3·ANT-dATP-GroEL results in 20% increase in anthraniloyl fluorescence, even when only 6 mol of Tb+3·ANT-dATP are bound to 1 mol of GroEL (results not shown). According to x-ray crystallographic studies (2Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), the diameter of the central cavity of GroEL is about 47 Å and the length 146 Å. If the volume occupied by an unfolded protein is about 30% greater than its native counterpart, then the central cavity would accept a protein of 70 kDa, which is twice the size of denatured mMDH. If, on the other hand, binding of partially folded mMDH occurs exclusively at the outer GroEL surface, as has been proposed for other protein substrates (22Azem A. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Science. 1994; 265: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Vitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), then it is impossible to explain direct interaction of the unfolded protein with the ATP-binding sites. The most likely explanation for the change in the luminescence properties of bound Tb3+·ANT-dATP, elicited by binding of unfolded forms of the protein substrate, must be sought in conformational changes of the equatorial domains of GroEL. The functional role played by conformational changes of GroEL in the rearrangement of the protein substrate can be discussed in reference to the structure provided by x-ray crystallography (2Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hedge R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). According to these studies, the equatorial domain is highly α-helical and well ordered. It provides most of the side-to-side contacts between subunits in the ring and most of the contacts between the rings across the equatorial plane. The ATP-binding site resides in the equatorial domain of each subunit of GroEL. Hence, subtle changes in interdomain contacts might alter the flexibility of the chaperonine, which is required to facilitate the folding of the protein substrate. The samples of GroEL used in this work were kindly provided by Professor M. G. Gore. The technical assistance of Dario R. Churchich is appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2000971573,"p70 S6 kinase (p70s6k) is a serine/threonine kinase which is activated through an unidentified pathway by mitogenic stimuli. Here we demonstrate that stable- and transient-overexpression of wild type (WT)-p70s6k results in perturbation of cytokinesis in NIH3T3 cells. Cells overexpressing WT-p70s6k demonstrated a slow growth rate and lower viability, whereas cells overexpressing a mutant T229A-p70s6k had a similar growth rate and viability as those of parental NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, WT-p70s6k cells demonstrated several abnormalities in cellular morphology; both the cytoplasm and the nuclei were large and a proportion of the cells was multi-nucleated. Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells demonstrated that about 50% of the cells had 4N or greater content of DNA. When cell division in WT-p70s6k cells was monitored by time-lapse video microscopy, cytokines was often incomplete after mitosis, producing binucleated cells. Addition of rapamycin to WT-p70s6k cells, which inactivates endogenous and transfected p70s6k, failed to reverse any of the morphological abnormalities. These indicate that overexpression of p70s6k but not increases in activity of p70s6k, is responsible for the phenotype. A molecule which interacts with p70s6k may be involed in this regulation of cytokinesis."
