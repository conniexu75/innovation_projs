We noted that pathway components for acetogenesis are more abundantly and consistently represented in the gut microbiomes of monozygotic twins and their mothers than components for methanogenesis or sulfate reduction and subsequently analyzed the metabolic potential of two sequenced human gut acetogens, Blautia hydrogenotrophica and Marvinbryantia formatexigens in vitro and in the intestines of gnotobiotic mice harboring a prominent saccharolytic bacterium. To do so, we developed a generally applicable method for multiplex sequencing of expressed microbial mRNAs (microbial RNA-Seq) and, together with mass spectrometry of metabolites, showed that these organisms have distinct patterns of substrate utilization. B. hydrogenotrophica targets aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. It increases the efficiency of fermentation by consuming reducing equivalents, thereby maintaining a high NAD(+)/NADH ratio and boosting acetate production. In contrast, M. formatexigens consumes oligosaccharides, does not impact the redox state of the gut, and boosts the yield of succinate. These findings have strategic implications for those who wish to manipulate the hydrogen economy of gut microbial communities in ways that modulate energy harvest."
https://openalex.org/W2007374658,"Food insecurity is emerging as an important barrier to antiretroviral (ARV) adherence in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, but little is known about the mechanisms through which food insecurity leads to ARV non-adherence and treatment interruptions.We conducted in-depth, open-ended interviews with 47 individuals (30 women, 17 men) living with HIV/AIDS recruited from AIDS treatment programs in Mbarara and Kampala, Uganda to understand how food insecurity interferes with ARV therapy regimens. Interviews were transcribed, coded for key themes, and analyzed using grounded theory.Food insecurity was common and an important barrier to accessing medical care and ARV adherence. Five mechanisms emerged for how food insecurity can contribute to ARV non-adherence and treatment interruptions or to postponing ARV initiation: 1) ARVs increased appetite and led to intolerable hunger in the absence of food; 2) Side effects of ARVs were exacerbated in the absence of food; 3) Participants believed they should skip doses or not start on ARVs at all if they could not afford the added nutritional burden; 4) Competing demands between costs of food and medical expenses led people either to default from treatment, or to give up food and wages to get medications; 5) While working for food for long days in the fields, participants sometimes forgot medication doses. Despite these obstacles, many participants still reported high ARV adherence and exceptional motivation to continue therapy.While reports from sub-Saharan Africa show excellent adherence to ARVs, concerns remain that these successes are not sustainable in the presence of widespread poverty and food insecurity. We provide further evidence on how food insecurity can compromise sustained ARV therapy in a resource-limited setting. Addressing food insecurity as part of emerging ARV treatment programs is critical for their long-term success."
https://openalex.org/W2050266242,"Background The human endometrium undergoes cyclical regeneration throughout a woman's reproductive life. Ectopic implantation of endometrial cells through retrograde menstruation gives rise to endometriotic lesions which affect approximately 10% of reproductive-aged women. The high regenerative capacity of the human endometrium at eutopic and ectopic sites suggests the existence of stem/progenitor cells and a unique angiogenic system. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize putative endometrial stem/progenitor cells and to address how they might be involved in the physiology of endometrium. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that approximately 2% of the total cells obtained from human endometrium displayed a side population (SP) phenotype, as determined by flow cytometric analysis of Hoechst-stained cells. The endometrial SP (ESP) cells exhibited preferential expression of several endothelial cell markers compared to endometrial main population (EMP) cells. A medium specific for endothelial cell culture enabled ESP cells to proliferate and differentiate into various types of endometrial cells, including glandular epithelial, stromal and endothelial cells in vitro, whereas in the same medium, EMP cells differentiated only into stromal cells. Furthermore, ESP cells, but not EMP cells, reconstituted organized endometrial tissue with well-delineated glandular structures when transplanted under the kidney capsule of severely immunodeficient mice. Notably, ESP cells generated endothelial cells that migrated into the mouse kidney parenchyma and formed mature blood vessels. This potential for in vivo angiogenesis and endometrial cell regeneration was more prominent in the ESP fraction than in the EMP fraction, as the latter mainly gave rise to stromal cells in vivo. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that putative endometrial stem cells are highly enriched in the ESP cells. These unique characteristics suggest that ESP cells might drive physiological endometrial regeneration and be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis."
https://openalex.org/W2083232571,"Recent studies suggested that induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) might confer both metastatic and self-renewal properties to breast tumor cells resulting in drug resistance and tumor recurrence. TGFbeta is a potent inducer of EMT and has been shown to promote tumor progression in various breast cancer cell and animal models.We report that chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin activates TGFbeta signaling in human and murine breast cancer cells. Doxorubicin induced EMT, promoted invasion and enhanced generation of cells with stem cell phenotype in murine 4T1 breast cancer cells in vitro, which were significantly inhibited by a TGFbeta type I receptor kinase inhibitor (TbetaRI-KI). We investigated the potential synergistic anti-tumor activity of TbetaR1-KI in combination with doxorubicin in animal models of metastatic breast cancer. Combination of Doxorubicin and TbetaRI-KI enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin in reducing tumor growth and lung metastasis in the 4T1 orthotopic xenograft model in comparison to single treatments. Doxorubicin treatment alone enhanced metastasis to lung in the human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 orthotopic xenograft model and metastasis to bone in the 4T1 orthotopic xenograft model, which was significantly blocked when TbetaR1-KI was administered in combination with doxorubicin.These observations suggest that the adverse activation of TGFbeta pathway by chemotherapeutics in the cancer cells together with elevated TGFbeta levels in tumor microenvironment may lead to EMT and generation of cancer stem cells resulting in the resistance to the chemotherapy. Our results indicate that the combination treatment of doxorubicin with a TGFbeta inhibitor has the potential to reduce the dose and consequently the toxic side-effects of doxorubicin, and improve its efficacy in the inhibition of breast cancer growth and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2039012729,"Background Characteristics of the human neonatal immune system are thought to be responsible for heightened susceptibility to infectious pathogens and poor responses to vaccine antigens. Using cord blood as a source of immune cells, many reports indicate that the response of neonatal monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) to Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists differs significantly from that of adult cells. Herein, we analyzed the evolution of these responses within the first year of life. Methodology/Principal Findings Blood samples from children (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 month old) and healthy adults were stimulated ex vivo with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4 agonist) or CpG oligonucleotides (TLR9 agonist). We determined phenotypic maturation of monocytes, myeloid (m) and plasmacytoid (p) DC and production of cytokines in the culture supernatants. We observed that surface expression of CD80 and HLA-DR reaches adult levels within the first 3 months of life for mDCs and 6–9 months of life for monocytes and pDCs. In response to LPS, production of TNF-α, IP-10 and IL-12p70 reached adult levels between 6–9 months of life. In response to CpG stimulation, production of type I IFN-dependent chemokines (IP-10 and CXCL9) gradually increased with age but was still limited in 1-year old infants as compared to adult controls. Finally, cord blood samples stimulated with CpG ODN produced large amounts of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and IL-10, a situation that was not observed for 3 month-old infants. Conclusions The first year of life represents a critical period during which adult-like levels of TLR responses are reached for most but not all cytokine responses."
https://openalex.org/W1976263764,"Background Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are expanding in the World Ocean as a result of climate change and direct anthropogenic influence. OMZ expansion greatly affects biogeochemical processes and marine life, especially by constraining the vertical habitat of most marine organisms. Currently, monitoring the variability of the upper limit of the OMZs relies on time intensive sampling protocols, causing poor spatial resolution. Methodology/Principal Findings Using routine underwater acoustic observations of the vertical distribution of marine organisms, we propose a new method that allows determination of the upper limit of the OMZ with a high precision. Applied in the eastern South-Pacific, this original sampling technique provides high-resolution information on the depth of the upper OMZ allowing documentation of mesoscale and submesoscale features (e.g., eddies and filaments) that structure the upper ocean and the marine ecosystems. We also use this information to estimate the habitable volume for the world's most exploited fish, the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens). Conclusions/Significance This opportunistic method could be implemented on any vessel geared with multi-frequency echosounders to perform comprehensive high-resolution monitoring of the upper limit of the OMZ. Our approach is a novel way of studying the impact of physical processes on marine life and extracting valid information about the pelagic habitat and its spatial structure, a crucial aspect of Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management in the current context of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2000515790,"Protein transport from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi is primarily conducted by coated vesicular carriers such as COPII. Here, we describe zebrafish bulldog mutations that disrupt the function of the cargo adaptor Sec24D, an integral component of the COPII complex. We show that Sec24D is essential for secretion of cartilage matrix proteins, whereas the preceding development of craniofacial primordia and pre-chondrogenic condensations does not depend on this isoform. Bulldog chondrocytes fail to secrete type II collagen and matrilin to extracellular matrix (ECM), but membrane bound receptor β1-Integrin and Cadherins appear to leave ER in Sec24D-independent fashion. Consequently, Sec24D-deficient cells accumulate proteins in the distended ER, although a subset of ER compartments and Golgi complexes as visualized by electron microscopy and NBD C6-ceramide staining appear functional. Consistent with the backlog of proteins in the ER, chondrocytes activate the ER stress response machinery and significantly upregulate BiP transcription. Failure of ECM secretion hinders chondroblast intercalations thus resulting in small and malformed cartilages and severe craniofacial dysmorphology. This defect is specific to Sec24D mutants since knockdown of Sec24C, a close paralog of Sec24D, does not result in craniofacial cartilage dysmorphology. However, craniofacial development in double Sec24C/Sec24D-deficient animals is arrested earlier than in bulldog/sec24d, suggesting that Sec24C can compensate for loss of Sec24D at initial stages of chondrogenesis, but Sec24D is indispensable for chondrocyte maturation. Our study presents the first developmental perspective on Sec24D function and establishes Sec24D as a strong candidate for cartilage maintenance diseases and craniofacial birth defects."

Our analysis of potential miR-10b targets identified Tiam1 (T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1), a guanidine exchange factor for Rac. We demonstrate, using an miR-10b synthetic precursor, expression vector, and antisense oligonucleotide, that miR-10b represses Tiam1 expression in breast carcinoma cells and that it interacts with the 3′-UTR of Tiam1. Consistent with the involvement of Tiam1 in cell motility, we observed that miR-10b suppresses the ability of breast carcinoma cells to migrate and invade. Importantly, we demonstrate that miR-10b also inhibits Tiam1-mediated Rac activation. These data provide a mechanism for the regulation of Tiam1-mediated Rac activation in breast cancer cells and need to be considered in the context of other reported functions for miR-10b.

The challenge ahead is to elucidate specific mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate such processes. microRNA green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase guanidine exchange factor small interfering RNA quantitative real-time PCR. miR-10b expression has been reported to be significantly deregulated in breast cancer (3Iorio M.V. Ferracin M. Liu C.G. Veronese A. Spizzo R. Sabbioni S. Magri E. Pedriali M. Fabbri M. Campiglio M. Ménard S. Palazzo J.P. Rosenberg A. Musiani P. Volinia S. Nenci I. Calin G.A. Querzoli P. Negrini M.

Teruya-Feldstein J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 2007; 449: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Given the potential importance of miR-10b in breast and other cancers, a key issue is the identification of miR-10b targets that execute its biological functions. HoxD10 has been identified as a miR-10b target, a finding that is significant because HoxD10 represses expression of the prometastatic gene RHOC (11Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 2007; 449: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). Most likely, however, miR-10b targets additional genes that affect the behavior of breast carcinoma cells. In the current study, we sought to identify such novel targets of miR-10b and to assess their regulation by miR-10b in the context of breast cancer cell biology. The SUM159PT and SUM149PT cell lines were obtained from Dr. Steve Ethier (University of Michigan). T-47D and MDA-MB-435 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) detection of the mature form of miRNAs was performed using TaqMan miRNA reverse transcription kit and TaqMan human microarray assays for miR-10b and the miR-10b mutant (Ambion). U6 small nuclear RNA was used as an internal control. Pre-miR miRNA precursor molecules (Dharmacon) are synthetic miRNA mimics designed for functional analyses and target site validation. Cells were transfected with 20 nm pre-miR hsa-miR-10b precursor, a custom-designed miR-10b seed mutant precursor with a single base pair substitution in the seed region of the mature strand, or a pre-miR miRNA precursor nontargeting negative control at 50% confluence using DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon). 72 h after transfection, cells were plated for migration and invasion assays or harvested for Rac activity assays. A custom-designed 2′-O-methyl antisense oligonucleotide (Dharmacon) to mature miR-10b was used for loss-of-function analyses along with a control antisense oligonucleotide that targets luciferase (Dharmacon). T-47D and MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with 20 nm antisense oligonucleotide as above. Nontargeting siRNA or siRNAs designed to target Tiam1 were SMARTPools from Dharmacon and cells were transfected with 20 nm each pool. For Tiam1 rescue experiments, cells were transfected with 20 nm miRNA precursor and 0.6 pmol of a human Tiam1 full-length construct (Kathleen O'Connor, University of Kentucky) using DharmaFECT Duo transfection reagent (Dharmacon). For migration assays, both the upper and lower surfaces of transwell chambers (8-μm pore, Costar) were coated overnight with collagen (15 μg/ml, BD Biosciences) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. For invasion assays, the upper surface of the transwells was coated overnight with 0.5 μg Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were harvested at 80% confluence by trypsinization and resuspended in HamsF12 or RPMI 1640 containing 0.25% heat-inactivated fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The coated surfaces of the transwells were blocked with media containing bovine serum albumin for 30–60 min at 37 °C. Cells (2 × 104 in a total volume of 100 μl) were loaded into the upper chamber and NIH-3T3 conditioned media was added to the lower chamber. Assays proceeded for 4 h for SUM159PT cells, 6 h for MDA-MB-435 cells, and 24 h for SUM149PT and T-47D cells at 37 °C. At the completion of the assays, the upper chamber was swabbed to remove residual cells and fixed with methanol. Cells on the lower surface of the membrane were mounted in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting media (Vector Laboratories), and the number of cells was determined for five independent fields in triplicate with a 10× objective and fluorescence. The MDH1-PGK-GFP-premiR-10b and MDH1-PGK-GFP vectors were obtained from Addgene (11Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 2007; 449: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected at 50% confluence by a Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) complex containing a ratio of envelope plasmid (1.75 μg), packaging plasmid (3.25 μg), and MDH1-PGK-GFP-2.0 vector expressing pre-miR-10b or no insert in Optimem (Invitrogen). Virus was harvested 2 days following transfection and clarified, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter to be used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Recipient SUM159PT and SUM149PT cells were plated to reach 50% confluence after 24 h, and virus was added to cells at a ratio of virus:fresh media containing polybrene (8 μg/ml) of 1:1. For luciferase assays, a 60-bp region of the Tiam1 3′-UTR containing the binding site for miR-10b was cloned into the pMIR-REPORT luciferase construct (Ambion). A second insert containing a single base pair mutation in the seed-binding site, comparable to the miR-10b mutant, was cloned into the same construct to generate a luciferase construct with a mutated miR-10b-binding site for control. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates (50 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20, blotted with the antibodies for Tiam1 (1:800, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), actin and tubulin (1:5000, Sigma), or Rac1 (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories) overnight, followed by secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies, and detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells in 24-well plates at 50% confluence were co-transfected with firefly luciferase reporter gene construct (200–0.5 μg) and 1–0.5 μg of Renilla luciferase construct (for normalization) using DharmaFECT Duo (Dharmacon). Cell extracts were prepared 24–48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega). Rac activity assays were based on established protocols (12Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 13Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

The bacterially produced Rac/cdc42 binding domain of Pak (PBD)-GST fusion protein was extracted and used to coat glutathione Sepharose (GST) beads. Serum-starved cells were harvested by addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and 10% of the total was removed. GST-PBD-coupled beads were added to the remaining extracts with 2 volumes of binding buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min on a rotating platform at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in binding buffer and eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Aliquots of both total cell extracts and the eluents from the PBD beads were immunoblotted for Rac1. For experiments designed to test the contribution of Rac and cdc42 to miR-10b-regulated migration, MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with control antisense or miR-10b antisense oligonucleotides as described above. After 24 h, these cells were transfected with N17Rac and N17Cdc42 constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously (14Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Expression of these constructs at equivalent levels was verified by GST immunoblotting. Migration assays were performed 48 h post-transfection of the Rac and cdc42 constructs. In some experiments, cells were transfected with these constructs alone and assayed for migration. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. The Student's t test was used to assess the significance of independent experiments. The criterion p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Initially, we used computational algorithms to identify potential miR-10b target genes. The search program TargetScan revealed several predicted targets of interest in the context of cancer cell biology, including Tiam1 (T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1) targetscan/miR10. Tiam1 was of particular interest because it is a member of the Dbl family of guanidine exchange factors (GEFs) and its acts as a GEF for the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (15Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Its expression correlates with epithelial tumorigenicity, the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cell lines (16Minard M.E. Kim L.S. Price J.E. Gallick G.E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and increased breast cancer grade (17Adam L. Vadlamudi R.K. McCrea P. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28443-28450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The predicted target site for miR-10b is a single 8-mer site, comprised of the seed match flanked by both the match at position 8 and the A at position 1 (18Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9644) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of miR-10b to regulate Tiam1 expression, we used a miR-10b precursor for de novo expression in breast carcinoma cell lines that either lack (SUM149PT and SUM159PT) or express (T-47D and MDA-MB-435) miR-10b (Fig. 1A). This precursor is a chemically modified, double-stranded RNA modeled on the sequence of mature miR-10b. For a control, we designed a miR-10b mutant with a single base pair substitution in the seed sequence of the mature strand (Fig. 1B). By introducing mismatch into the critical seed region, binding of the miRNA to its target genes should be reduced or abolished. A nontargeting miRNA was used as an additional negative control. To examine whether the miR-10b mutant was being expressed at the same level as miR-10b, we conducted qPCR to amplify miR-10b and the miR-10b mutant using sequence specific primers and found that the miR-10b mutant was expressed 1.5-fold higher than miR-10b (Fig. 1B), allaying concerns that the miR-10b mutant was expressed at lower levels than miR-10b. We observed a dramatic reduction in Tiam1 expression in both SUM159PT and SUM149PT cells expressing miR-10b, as compared with controls (Fig. 1C). Co-transfection of the miR-10b precursor with a miR-10b antisense oligonucleotide rescued expression of Tiam1. We next asked whether inhibition of endogenous miR-10b in breast carcinoma cells that express this miR would affect Tiam1 expression. Indeed, expression of a miR-10b antisense oligonucleotide increased Tiam1 expression significantly in both cell lines compared with a control oligonucleotide (Fig. 1D). We also used a miR-10b expression vector to confirm that miR-10b inhibits Tiam1 expression and that we were not observing an artifact of the miRNA precursor. This retroviral vector encodes the genomic sequence of the human miR-10b gene in the 3′-UTR of GFP and requires that mature miR-10b be generated through endogenous cellular processing. Ectopic expression of this miR-10b in SUM159PT cells resulted in a significant decrease in Tiam1 expression (Fig. 1E). To determine whether regulation of Tiam1 expression by miR-10b is direct, we utilized a luciferase reporter gene fused to a sequence of the 3′-UTR of Tiam1 that contains the predicted miR-10b-binding site. Expression of miR-10b reduced the activity of luciferase, whereas a miR-10b seed mutant had no effect, indicating that miR-10b targets Tiam1 directly (Fig. 1F). As a control, we developed a second luciferase reporter with a single base pair mutation in the predicted miR-10b-binding site, at the site corresponding to the miR-10b seed mutant. As expected, miR-10b had no effect on the luciferase activity of this reporter, whereas the miR-10b seed mutant, a perfect match in the seed region, repressed the luciferase signal (Fig. 1F). Given that Tiam1 can regulate the motility and invasion of tumor cells (15Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), we asked whether miR-10b regulation of Tiam1 affected migration and invasion. Expression of the miR-10b precursor in SUM159PT cells resulted in a 40% decrease in both migration and invasion as compared with nontargeting and mutant controls (Fig. 2A). Similarly, expression of the miR-10b vector inhibited the migration and invasion of both SUM159PT and 149PT cells significantly in comparison to expression of a control vector (Fig. 2B). We next asked whether inhibition of endogenous miR-10b in T-47D and MDA-MB-435 cells would affect their motility. Indeed, expression of the miR-10b antisense oligonucleotide increased the migration and invasion of T-47D cells significantly (Fig. 2C). A similar effect of the miR-10b antisense oligonucleotide was seen for the migration of MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 2C). Next, we determined whether Tiam1 down-regulation is responsible for inhibition of cell motility by miR-10b. To determine whether SUM159PT cells are dependent on Tiam1 for cell motility, we silenced Tiam1 expression in these cells using a Tiam1 siRNA pool (Fig. 3A). Knockdown of Tiam1 resulted in a 40% decrease in both cell migration and cell invasion, similar to the change seen with de novo expression of miR-10b (Fig. 3A). Importantly, co-transfection of miR-10b and Tiam1 cDNA lacking the 3′-UTR was able to rescue miR-10b-induced repression of cell motility (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Tiam1 is a key factor responsible for decreased cell motility in cells expressing miR-10b. Given that Tiam1 is a GEF for Rac, we hypothesized that miR-10b-induced down-regulation of Tiam1 results in a corresponding decrease in Rac activation, thereby impairing cell motility. Decreasing Tiam1 expression in SUM159PT cells by siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in Rac activation (Fig. 4A), confirming that Tiam1 expression is necessary for optimal Rac activation. Similarly, de novo expression of miR-10b in this cell line also repressed activation of Rac as compared with both the non-targeting control and the miR-10b seed mutant (Fig. 4B). Co-transfection of miR-10b and Tiam1 cDNA partially rescued Rac activation (Fig. 4C), indicating that miR-10b represses cell motility in part via down-regulation of Tiam1, which leads to decreased activation of Rac. The role of miR10b in regulating Rac was verified in MDA-MB-435 cells that express endogenous miR-10b. For this purpose, we used a dominant negative Rac construct (N17Rac), as well as a dominant negative Cdc42 construct (N17Cdc42) for comparison. Expression of either of these constructs inhibited the ability of MDA-MB-435 cells to migrate significantly (Fig. 4D, left panel). The ability of the miR-10b antisense oligonucleotide to increase the migration of MDA-MB-435 cells (see Fig. 2C) was abrogated by expression of N17Rac. In contrast, expression of N17Cdc42 was unable to abrogate this increase in migration caused by inhibiting miR-10b (Fig. 4D; right panel). These data argue that the ability of miR-10b to regulate migration is Rac-dependent. We conclude from our data that Tiam1, a Rac GEF, is a target of miR-10b and that miR-10b-mediated regulation of Tiam1 in breast carcinoma cell lines influences Rac activation, migration, and invasion. These data support the emerging hypothesis that Rho GTPase signaling can be regulated by specific miRs (e.g. Ref. 19Park S.Y. Lee J.H. Ha M. Nam J.W. Kim V.N. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Given that a single miR can regulate the expression of multiple proteins, however, the ability of miR-10b to target Tiam1 and influence Tiam1-mediated functions likely is to be dependent on multiple factors including cell type, pattern of miR expression and signals that regulate Tiam1 expression and function. It is intriguing to note, however, that inhibition of miR-10b function in breast carcinoma cells is sufficient to increase their migration and that this increase in migration is Rac-dependent (Fig. 4D), suggesting that Tiam1 is a key target of miR-10b in this context. In contrast to our findings, miR-10b was reported recently to promote the migration and invasion of human esophageal carcinoma cell lines by targeting KLF4, a tumor suppressor gene for esophageal carcinoma (20Tian Y. Luo A. Cai Y. Su Q. Ding F. Chen H. Liu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7986-7994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These opposing findings substantiate the hypothesis that the function of specific miRNAs can differ markedly depending on oncogenic context (21Gebeshuber C.A. Zatloukal K. Martinez J. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Although Tiam1 expression correlates with breast cancer grade and progression (16Minard M.E. Kim L.S. Price J.E. Gallick G.E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 84: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Adam L. Vadlamudi R.K. McCrea P. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28443-28450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), little is known about how this GEF is regulated in breast tumors. The ability of miR-10b to target Tiam1 provides one such mechanism, which is substantiated by the observation that miR-10b expression in human breast carcinomas correlates inversely with tumor size and grade (22Gee H.E. Camps C. Buffa F.M. Colella S. Sheldon H. Gleadle J.M. Ragoussis J. Harris A.L. Nature. 2008; 455 (author reply E9): E8-E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our data, however, must be considered in the context of the report that miR-10b promotes the migration and invasion of breast carcinoma cells and that it is causally associated with metastasis (11Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 2007; 449: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). In this important study, HoxD10 was identified as miR-10b target and it was proposed that HoxD10 represses expression of RHOC, which has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. The ability of miR-10b to target HoxD10 could be significant, given the observation that this homeobox gene may have tumor suppressive functions in breast cancer (23Carrio M. Arderiu G. Myers C. Boudreau N.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7177-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, we question the purported role of miR-10b in inducing RhoC expression because SUM149PT and SUM159PT cells, which lack miR-10b expression (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 11Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 2007; 449: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar) express relatively high levels of RHOC (24Simpson K.J. Dugan A.S. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8694-8701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Kleer C.G. Griffith K.A. Sabel M.S. Gallagher G. van Golen K.L. Wu Z.F. Merajver S.D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2005; 93: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) indicating that RHOC can be expressed in breast carcinoma cells in the absence of miR-10b. Clearly, miR-10b has significant effects on cellular functions that underlie the progression of breast and other cancers including RhoGTPase regulation, migration, and invasion. The challenge ahead is to resolve some of the discrepant observations that exist and unify the current data into a coherent mechanism of miR-10b function within the same tumor type.

Inhibition of FcϵRI signaling by anti-IgE therapy is indirect and has a slow onset of action (11Beck L.A. Marcotte G.V. MacGlashan D. Togias A. Saini S. J Allergy Clin.

This approach has been applied to the high affinity IgE receptor FcϵRI, and several groups have demonstrated that cross-linking FcϵRI with the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb can inhibit FcϵRI activation and its downstream biology in mast cells and basophils (19Daëron M.

However, the development of a human therapeutic that cross-links FcϵRI with FcγRIIb and that is suitable for chronic administration in asthma has so far been unsuccessful due to multiple factors including immunogenicity, a short in vivo half-life, a lack of specificity for FcγRIIb over other activating Fcγ receptor isoforms, competition by serum IgE for binding to FcϵRI, and challenges for large-scale manufacturing (27Saxon A. Kepley C. Zhang K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2008; 121: 320-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Previously, an antibody technology was developed that enabled the efficient generation of fully human bispecific antibodies on a small scale (28Merchant A.M. Zhu Z. Yuan J.Q. Goddard A. Adams C.W. Presta L.G. Carter P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This technology consisted of sterically complementary “knobs-into-holes” mutations in the antibody heavy chain CH3 domain that promoted heavy chain heterodimerization combined with a single common light chain that prevented heavy chain/light chain mispairing. However, large-scale production of these knobs-into-holes bispecific antibodies in mammalian cells was hindered by variable heterodimer purity.Here we have improved and extended the knobs-into-holes, common light chain bispecific antibody format by developing a two-part antibody discovery strategy that facilitates proof-of-concept studies and clinical candidate antibody generation. The first part consists of the efficient small-scale generation of bispecific antibodies lacking a common light chain and the hinge disulfides, enabling proof-of-concept studies without the need to identify antibodies having a common light chain. The second part consists of the identification of a common light chain bispecific antibody clinical candidate for large-scale production with high purity and yield. We have applied this approach to produce a fully human bispecific antibody that cross-links FcϵRI with FcγRIIb. The bispecific antibody is highly specific for FcγRIIb, is not blocked by serum IgE binding to FcϵRI, and inhibits FcϵRI-mediated activation of mast cells in vitro. Moreover, the bispecific antibody has in vivo pharmacokinetic properties that are comparable with normal human IgG1 antibodies produced in mammalian cells, and large-scale manufacturing of the bispecific antibody for clinical studies is feasible. Our approach for generating a human full-length bispecific antibody may be applicable to a range of clinical applications that require chronic antibody treatment.DISCUSSIONBispecific antibodies have numerous potential clinical applications, including neutralization of different pathogenic mediators, redirection of cellular activity by recruitment of different cell types to each other, and modification of cell signaling by recruitment of two different receptors on the same cell. However, the development of bispecific antibodies as human therapeutics, especially for chronic administration in human diseases, requires a technology platform that exhibits high stability, favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and feasibility for large-scale manufacturing, properties that have been difficult to achieve to date (7Holliger P. Hudson P.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar, 8Kriangkum J. Xu B. Nagata L.P. Fulton R.E. Suresh M.R. Biomol.

Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) by developing a two-part antibody discovery strategy that facilitates proof-of-concept studies and clinical candidate antibody generation. Significantly, the adaptation of bacterial antibody production technology to the generation of knobs-into-holes, common light chain bispecific antibodies, enables the large-scale manufacturing of clinical candidates. Because the expression scheme utilizes E. coli bacteria, the resulting antibodies are not glycosylated and, therefore, lack Fc effector function (29Simmons L.C. Reilly D. Klimowski L. Raju T.S.

This limits the applications of bispecific antibodies that are produced using this approach to therapeutic applications that do not require Fc effector functions but in some cases may enable the application of bispecific antibodies to targets where Fc effector function is not desired. Interestingly, a recent report describes Fc variants of aglycosylated antibodies with tight FcγRI binding, which could be adapted to our bispecific antibody system to enable the generation of bispecific antibodies with Fc effector functions (39Jung S.T. Reddy S.T. Kang T.H. Borrok M.J. Sandlie I. Tucker P.W. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Aglycosylated antibodies have previously been shown to have normal FcRn binding and pharmacokinetics (29Simmons L.C. Reilly D. Klimowski L. Raju T.S. Meng G. Sims P. Hong K. Shields R.L. Damico L.A. Rancatore P. Yansura D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 263: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), consistent with our bispecific antibody pharmacokinetic data, and have not been immunogenic when administered to humans (40Friend P.J. Hale G. Chatenoud L. Rebello P. Bradley J. Thiru S. Phillips J.M. Waldmann H. Transplantation. 1999; 68: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Additional bispecific antibody technologies that are amenable to expression in mammalian cells, including the recently published dual-variable-domain immunoglobulin (10Wu C. Ying H. Grinnell C. Bryant S. Miller R. Clabbers A. Bose S. McCarthy D. Zhu R.R. Santora L. Davis-Taber R. Kunes Y. Fung E. Schwartz A. Sakorafas P. Gu J. Tarcsa E. Murtaza A. Ghayur T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and dual-acting-Fab immunoglobulin (41Bostrom J. Yu S.F. Kan D. Appleton B.A. Lee C.V. Billeci K. Man W. Peale F. Ross S. Wiesmann C. Fuh G. Science. 2009; 323: 1610-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), provide alternative technological approaches to the generation of therapeutic bispecific antibodies that may be suitable for chronic dosing in human diseases. However, neither of these alternative formats is adaptable to the specific cross-linking of cellular receptors, and therefore, they cannot be applied to our therapeutic application of targeting FcϵRIα and FcγRIIb, as discussed below.We have applied our bispecific antibody technology to generate bispecific antibodies against FcϵRIα and FcγRIIb that can inhibit IgE-induced activation of mast cells and basophils in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, targeting of IgE signaling through FcϵRI is a clinically validated and efficacious approach for the treatment of asthma (13Chang T.W. Wu P.C. Hsu C.L. Hung A.F. Adv. Immunol. 2007; 93: 63-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Holgate S. Casale T. Wenzel S. Bousquet J. Deniz Y. Reisner C. J. Allergy Clin.

Immunol. 2005; 115: S376-S385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), but to date the successful generation of human bispecific agents targeting this pathway and suitable for the chronic treatment of human asthma patients has not been achieved. Two recent studies have reported the generation of bifunctional FcϵRI cross-linkers that inhibit FcϵRI activation in vitro and in vivo (25Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang K. Terada T. Yamada T. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 446-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Zhu D. Kepley C.L. Zhang M. Zhang K. Saxon A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These cross-linkers are fusion proteins that consist of the Fc region of human IgG1 linked to either the Fc region of human IgE or an allergen protein and that thereby recruit FcγRIIb to either FcϵRI or FcϵRI that has been loaded with allergen-specific IgE, respectively. However, these bifunctional cross-linkers as well as all other agents developed to date that cross-link FcϵRI with FcγRIIb or another inhibitory receptor have been limited by one or more liabilities that prohibit successful clinical development. In addition, neither the dual-variable-domain nor the dual-acting-Fab immunoglobulin formats is suitable for inhibiting FcϵRI signaling, as these antibody formats may cross-link FcϵRI to itself in the absence of FcγRIIb engagement, thereby leading to the activation of FcϵRI and subsequent unacceptable anaphylactic reactions. In particular, a dual-acting-Fab antibody can bind either two of the same antigen or two different antigens such that some dual-acting-Fab antibodies against FcϵRI and FcγRIIb could bind and cross-link two FcϵRI, leading to receptor activation. Dual-variable-domain antibodies may not efficiently co-engage all FcϵRI and FcγRIIb due to steric constraints associated with the tandem variable domain format, leading to some cross-linking and activation of FcϵRI in the absence of FcγRIIb engagement. Our fully human bispecific antibody 9202.1/5411 is not subject to the limitations of these other cross-linking approaches. Specifically, the 9202.1/5411 bispecific antibody comprises an anti-FcϵRIα Fab that is not blocked by IgE binding to FcϵRIα, an anti-FcγRIIb Fab that does not cross-react with FcγRIIa or any other activating Fcγ receptor isoforms, and a fully human antibody format that has comparable pharmacokinetic properties to regular human IgG1 antibodies. Moreover, the 9202.1/5411 bispecific antibody can be expressed and purified at yields and purity levels that are compatible with large-scale manufacturing.Our studies demonstrate that bispecific antibodies utilizing the knobs-into-holes, common light chain antibody format can be produced in large quantities in bacterial cells. Our bacterially produced bispecific antibodies are active in vivo and have pharmacokinetic properties that are comparable with those of regular human IgG1 antibodies expressed in mammalian cells. In addition, the bispecific antibody platform is fully human, such that human immunogenicity is minimized. Interestingly, the 9202.1/5411 bispecific antibody can bind FcϵRIα with subnanomolar affinity and can discriminate between FcγRII homologs that have greater than 90% sequence identity despite having a single common light chain sequence. This is consistent with previous work demonstrating that the knobs-into-holes, common light chain antibody format can be used to generate antibodies that bind to a diverse range of antigens with high affinity and specificity (28Merchant A.M. Zhu Z. Yuan J.Q. Goddard A. Adams C.W. Presta L.G. Carter P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, the bispecific antibody technology developed here may be generally applicable for the creation of bispecific therapeutic agents for human diseases.

However, the development of a human therapeutic that cross-links FcϵRI with FcγRIIb and that is suitable for chronic administration in asthma has so far been unsuccessful due to multiple factors including immunogenicity, a short in vivo half-life, a lack of specificity for FcγRIIb over other activating Fcγ receptor isoforms, competition by serum IgE for binding to FcϵRI, and challenges for large-scale manufacturing (27Saxon A. Kepley C. Zhang K. J. Allergy Clin.

Zhu Z. Yuan J.Q. Goddard A. Adams C.W. Presta L.G. Carter P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This technology consisted of sterically complementary “knobs-into-holes” mutations in the antibody heavy chain CH3 domain that promoted heavy chain heterodimerization combined with a single common light chain that prevented heavy chain/light chain mispairing. However, large-scale production of these knobs-into-holes bispecific antibodies in mammalian cells was hindered by variable heterodimer purity.Here we have improved and extended the knobs-into-holes, common light chain bispecific antibody format by developing a two-part antibody discovery strategy that facilitates proof-of-concept studies and clinical candidate antibody generation. The first part consists of the efficient small-scale generation of bispecific antibodies lacking a common light chain and the hinge disulfides, enabling proof-of-concept studies without the need to identify antibodies having a common light chain. The second part consists of the identification of a common light chain bispecific antibody clinical candidate for large-scale production with high purity and yield. We have applied this approach to produce a fully human bispecific antibody that cross-links FcϵRI with FcγRIIb. The bispecific antibody is highly specific for FcγRIIb, is not blocked by serum IgE binding to FcϵRI, and inhibits FcϵRI-mediated activation of mast cells in vitro. Moreover, the bispecific antibody has in vivo pharmacokinetic properties that are comparable with normal human IgG1 antibodies produced in mammalian cells, and large-scale manufacturing of the bispecific antibody for clinical studies is feasible. Our approach for generating a human full-length bispecific antibody may be applicable to a range of clinical applications that require chronic antibody treatment."

To further identify the novel components involved in PSII biogenesis, we isolated and characterized a high chlorophyll fluorescence low psii accumulation19 (lpa19) mutant, which is defective in PSII biogenesis. LPA19 encodes a Psb27 homolog (At1g05385). Interestingly, another Psb27 homolog (At1g03600) in Arabidopsis was revealed to be required for the efficient repair of photodamaged PSII. These results suggest that the Psb27 homologs play distinct functions in PSII biogenesis and repair in Arabidopsis. Chloroplast protein labeling assays showed that the C-terminal processing of D1 in the lpa19 mutant was impaired. Protein overlay assays provided evidence that LPA19 interacts with D1, and coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that LPA19 interacts with mature D1 (mD1) and precursor D1 (pD1). Moreover, LPA19 protein was shown to specifically interact with the soluble C terminus present in the precursor and mature D1 through yeast two-hybrid analyses. Thus, these studies suggest that LPA19 is involved in facilitating the D1 precursor protein processing in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2054493690,"Calcium oxalate stone formation occurs under pathological conditions and accounts for more than 80% of all types of kidney stones. In the current study, we show for the first time that calcium oxalate stones are formed in the mouse inner ear of a genetic model for hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction in humans. The vestibular system within the inner ear is dependent on extracellular tiny calcium carbonate minerals for proper function. Thousands of these biominerals, known as otoconia, are associated with the utricle and saccule sensory maculae and are vital for mechanical stimulation of the sensory hair cells. We show that a missense mutation within the Slc26a4 gene abolishes the transport activity of its encoded protein, pendrin. As a consequence, dramatic changes in mineral composition, size, and shape occur within the utricle and saccule in a differential manner. Although abnormal giant carbonate minerals reside in the utricle at all ages, in the saccule, a gradual change in mineral composition leads to a formation of calcium oxalate in adult mice. By combining imaging and spectroscopy tools, we determined the profile of mineral composition and morphology at different time points. We propose a novel mechanism for the accumulation and aggregation of oxalate crystals in the inner ear."

We now directly demonstrate from seven structures of Aeromonus punctata PEP that the mechanism is instead induced fit: the native enzyme exists in a conformationally flexible opened state with a large interdomain opening between the β-propeller and α/β-hydrolase domains; addition of substrate to preformed native crystals induces a large scale conformational change into a closed state with induced-fit adjustments of the active site, and inhibition of this conformational change prevents substrate binding.

How mitotic kinases interact with each other and coordinately regulate mitosis remains to be fully understood. Here we employed a chemical biology approach using selective small molecule kinase inhibitors to dissect the relationship between Cdk1 and Aurora A kinases during G2/M transition. We find that activation of Aurora A first occurs at centrosomes at late G2 and is required for centrosome separation independently of Cdk1 activity. Upon entry into mitosis, Aurora A then becomes fully activated downstream of Cdk1 activation. Inactivation of Aurora A or Plk1 individually during a synchronized cell cycle shows no significant effect on Cdk1 activation and entry into mitosis. However, simultaneous inactivation of both Aurora A and Plk1 markedly delays Cdk1 activation and entry into mitosis, suggesting that Aurora A and Plk1 have redundant functions in the feedback activation of Cdk1. Together, our data suggest that Cdk1, Aurora A, and Plk1 mitotic kinases participate in a feedback activation loop and that activation of Cdk1 initiates the feedback loop activity, leading to rapid and timely entry into mitosis in human cells. In addition, live cell imaging reveals that the nuclear cycle of cells becomes uncoupled from cytokinesis upon inactivation of both Aurora A and Aurora B kinases and continues to oscillate in a Cdk1-dependent manner in the absence of cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleated, polyploidy cells.

This enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 13 and catalyzes the branching of a linear glucose chain during glycogenesis by cleaving a 1-->4 bond and making a new 1-->6 bond. Here, we show the crystal structure of full-length MtbGlgB (MtbGlgBWT) at 2.33-A resolution. MtbGlgBWT contains four domains: N1 beta-sandwich, N2 beta-sandwich, a central (beta/alpha)(8) domain that houses the catalytic site, and a C-terminal beta-sandwich. We have assayed the amylase activity with amylose and starch as substrates and the glycogen branching activity using amylose as a substrate for MtbGlgBWT and the N1 domain-deleted (the first 108 residues deleted) MtbDelta108GlgB protein. The N1 beta-sandwich, which is formed by the first 105 amino acids and superimposes well with the N2 beta-sandwich, is shown to have an influence in substrate binding in the amylase assay. Also, we have checked and shown that several GH13 family inhibitors are ineffective against MtbGlgBWT and MtbDelta108GlgB. We propose a two-step reaction mechanism, for the amylase activity (1-->4 bond breakage) and isomerization (1-->6 bond formation), which occurs in the same catalytic pocket. The structural and functional properties of MtbGlgB and MtbDelta108GlgB are compared with those of the N-terminal 112-amino acid-deleted Escherichia coli GlgB (ECDelta112GlgB)."

Adult mice lacking the intermediate filament proteins GFAP and vimentin (GFAP−/−Vim−/−) show attenuated reactive gliosis, reduced glial scar formation and improved regeneration of neuronal synapses after neurotrauma. GFAP−/−Vim−/− mice exhibit larger brain infarcts after middle cerebral artery occlusion suggesting protective role of reactive gliosis after adult focal brain ischemia. However, the role of astrocyte activation and reactive gliosis in the injured developing brain is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We subjected GFAP−/−Vim−/− and wild-type mice to unilateral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) at postnatal day 9 (P9). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 25 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally twice daily from P9 to P12. On P12 and P31, the animals were perfused intracardially. Immunohistochemistry with MAP-2, BrdU, NeuN, and S100 antibodies was performed on coronal sections. We found no difference in the hemisphere or infarct volume between GFAP−/−Vim−/− and wild-type mice at P12 and P31, i.e. 3 and 22 days after HI. At P31, the number of NeuN+ neurons in the ischemic and contralateral hemisphere was comparable between GFAP−/−Vim−/− and wild-type mice. In wild-type mice, the number of S100+ astrocytes was lower in the ipsilateral compared to contralateral hemisphere (65.0±50.1 vs. 85.6±34.0, p<0.05). In the GFAP−/−Vim−/− mice, the number of S100+ astrocytes did not differ between the ischemic and contralateral hemisphere at P31. At P31, GFAP−/−Vim−/− mice showed an increase in NeuN+BrdU+ (surviving newly born) neurons in the ischemic cortex compared to wild-type mice (6.7±7.7; n = 29 versus 2.9±3.6; n = 28, respectively, p<0.05), but a comparable number of S100+BrdU+ (surviving newly born) astrocytes. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that attenuation of reactive gliosis in the developing brain does not affect the hemisphere or infarct volume after HI, but increases the number of surviving newborn neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2049428666,"We cultured (5 days) rat alveolar epithelial cells to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPk) signaling in ventilator induced epithelial barrier dysfunction. Cells were stretched to a magnitude of 12% or 37% change in surface area at a rate of 0.25 Hz with and without pretreatment with either the JNK inhibitor SP600125 or the ERK inhibitor U0126. Following stretch (0, 10, 30, or 60 min), MAPk phosphorylation was examined, monolayer permeability to the uncharged tracer carboxyfluorescein measured (0, 10, 60 min of stretch), and occludin expression determined (0 and 60 min of stretch). Stretch to 12%, previously shown not to increase monolayer permeability, did not alter phosphorylation of any MAPk or occludin expression at any time point. Following stretch to 37%, phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 was significantly higher by 10 minutes than in unstretched monolayers. Phosphorylation of JNK and p38 subsided as stretch continued, and by 30 minutes returned to unstretched levels. Phosphorylation of ERK remained significantly elevated compared to unstretched levels at all stretch durations. Epithelial permeability increased significantly by 10 minutes of stretch compared to unstretched controls, with further significant increases by 60 minutes. Inhibition with U0126 and SP600125 prevented stretch-induced phosphorylation increases of ERK and JNK, respectively, however neither prevented increases in permeability following 10 minutes. Separately, inhibition of JNK or ERK prevented subsequent additional permeability increases as stretch continued to 60 minute time points. Inhibition of JNK, not ERK, prevented loss of occludin, and minimized loss of cell-cell contact following 60 minutes of stretch. These data suggest that stretch-induced JNK signaling modulates epithelial permeability through regulation tight junction protein expression, and is a potential target for clinical treatments during mechanical ventilation."

https://openalex.org/W2021653386,"Background The tumor microenvironment has been described as a critical milieu determining tumor growth and metastases. A pivotal role of metastasis-inducing S100A4 in the development of tumor stroma has been proven in animal models and verified in human breast cancer biopsies. Expression and release of S100A4 has been shown in various types of stroma composing cells, including fibroblasts and immune cells. However, the events implicated in upstream and downstream pathways regulating the activity of the extracellular S100A4 protein in the tumor milieu remain unsolved. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the interplay between the tumor cell-derived cytokine regulated-upon-activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES; CCL5) and S100A4 which were shown to be critical factors in tumor progression. We found that RANTES stimulates the externalization of S100A4 via microparticle shedding from the plasma membrane of tumor and stroma cells. Conversely, the released S100A4 protein induces the upregulation of fibronectin (FN) in fibroblasts and a number of cytokines, including RANTES in tumor cells as well as stimulates cell motility in a wound healing assay. Importantly, using wild type and S100A4-deficient mouse models, we demonstrated a substantial influence of tumor cell-derived RANTES on S100A4 release into blood circulation which ultimately increases the metastatic burden in mice. Conclusions/Significance Altogether, the data presented strongly validate the pro-metastatic function of S100A4 in the tumor microenvironment and define how the tumor cell-derived cytokine RANTES acts as a critical regulator of S100A4-dependent tumor cell dissemination. Additionally, for the first time we demonstrated the mechanism of S100A4 release associated with plasma membrane microparticle shedding from various cells types."

IntroductionEndothelial cells line the luminal surface of blood vessels where they regulate the flux and/or transport of fluid, macromolecules and white blood cells from the vascular space to the interstitium. A loss of barrier function as found with inflammation leads to the accumulation of fluid that can disrupt tissue function. Thrombin, a key pro-coagulant serine-protease, is a well known inflammatory mediator that induces endothelial barrier dysfunction by activating endothelial expressed protease-activated receptors (PARs), resulting in activation of key signaling pathways, including increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), that mediate cytoskeletal reorganization through myosin light chain (MLC)-dependent EC contraction (1Sandoval R.

Four primary isoforms are encoded by separate homologous genes (α, β, δ, γ), each of which is alternatively spliced to produce a larger number of isoform variants. Evidence suggests structural diversity in CaMKII isoform variants is an important determinant of cellular function (8Hudmon A. Schulman H. Biochem.

In pulmonary artery endothelial cells, CaMKII has been linked to thrombin-induced increases in monolayer permeability (hyperpermeability) (16Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Shi S. Liu F. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L983-L990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through activation of ERK1/2 (17Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Liu F. Crow M.T. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L43-L54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and filamin phosphorylation (16Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Shi S. Liu F. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L983-L990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these conclusions are based largely on pharmacological approaches (KN-62, KN-93) aimed at selectively inhibiting CaMKII activity and/or consequences of CaMKIIα isoform overexpression, an isoform mainly restricted to neuronal tissue (18Tobimatsu T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17907-17912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the lack of knowledge on which isoforms predominate in endothelial cells, and potential non-specificity of KN62/KN93, the role and mechanisms of endogenous CaMKII isoforms in endothelial barrier function still remains unclear. Characterization of the endogenous CaMKII isoform(s) expressed in endothelium followed by specific molecular approaches, such as loss-of-function small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing, would provide a valuable approach to resolve the functional importance of endogenous CaMKII in regulating thrombin-induced EC barrier dysfunction.In the present study, we identified the δ6 isoform as the predominant endogenous CaMKII isoform in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). CaMKIIδ6 lacks an alternatively spliced 21 amino acid C terminus present in the more common CaMKIIδ variants such as the δ2 and δ3 (δC and δB, by alternative nomenclature) expressed, for example, in VSM or heart. Loss-of-function siRNA approaches were used to evaluate the functional role of the CaMKIIδ6 isoform in thrombin-induced HUVEC signaling and hyperpermeability (or barrier dysfunction). Our data indicate that CaMKIIδ6 mediates thrombin-induced HUVEC barrier dysfunction through RhoA/Rho kinase as downstream intermediates. In contrast to previous studies using alternative approaches to manipulate CaMKII activity in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC) (17Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Liu F. Crow M.T. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L43-L54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we found that in HUVECs ERK1/2 activation in response to thrombin stimulation was not mediated by CaMKII and was not involved in thrombin-induced hyperpermeability. The relative contribution of the CaMKII/RhoA pathway(s) was only significant in response to low concentration thrombin (2.5 nm) stimulation indicating recruitment of alternative signaling pathways mediating endothelial barrier dysfunction, dependent upon thrombin concentration.DISCUSSIONThrombin, as a vasoactive mediator, has long been known to increase both endothelial [Ca2+]i and endothelial permeability in vivo (5Birnbaumer L. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Tiruppathi C. Freichel M. Vogel S.M. Paria B.C. Mehta D. Flockerzi V. Malik A.B. Circ.

How the downstream effectors of Ca2+ fit into current paradigms of endothelial permeability mechanisms is still unclear. In this study, we tested regulation of thrombin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction by CaMKII, a direct downstream effector of intracellular Ca2+ signals, as well as ERK1/2 and RhoA, two indirect effectors of Ca2+ signals, previously implicated as mediators of thrombin-induced endothelial permeability.For the first time, we defined the predominant endogenous CaMKII isoform in HUVEC and several other primary endothelial cell lines as the CaMKIIδ6 isoform, identical to the δ2 isoform primarily expressed in cultured VSM but lacking an alternatively spliced 21-amino acid C-terminal (6Tiruppathi C.

Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1465-C1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Limited CaMKII δ6 expression has been reported in mouse gastric mucosal cells (31Chew C.S. Chen X. Zhang H. Berg E.A. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2008; 295: G1159-G1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but to the best of our knowledge, endothelial cells are the first identified cell type where the δ6 isoform is the predominant endogenous CaMKII. The immediate significance of this observation was that it allowed us to rationally target the bulk of endogenous HUVEC CaMKII with δ-isoform specific siRNA silencing approaches. Importantly, small amounts of δ2 and γb isoforms were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting with subtype-specific antibodies and our studies do not rule out their potential functional significance from the standpoint of CaMKII holoenzyme subcellular targeting or specific protein interactions.CaMKII is one of several upstream signaling pathways known to converge on mechanisms regulating endothelial permeability (32Cai H. Liu D. Garcia J.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 77: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier reports suggesting a dependence of thrombin-induced EC permeability on CaMKII (16Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Shi S. Liu F. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L983-L990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Liu F. Crow M.T. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L43-L54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we documented thrombin-induced activation of CaMKII in HUVECs, inferred by assessing autophosphorylation on Thr287. Thr287 autophosphorylation is known to be a result of Ca2+/CaM-dependent activation of individual kinase subunits and intersubunit phosphorylation within the large CaMKII holoenzyme (15Mercure M.Z. Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1465-C1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Van Riper D.A. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2000; 213: 83-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C754-C761Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the extent and kinetics of CaMKII activation were not markedly dependent upon thrombin concentration over the range used and activation appeared maximal in response to the lowest concentration tested. Functional coupling of this signal to increases in permeability, as determined by siRNA mediated suppression of CaMKIIδ, was only significant in response to low concentrations of thrombin, inferring recruitment of alternative CaMKII-independent pathways by increasing concentrations of thrombin. While it is difficult to judge how the concentrations of commercial thrombin used in our in vitro experiments relate to physiological and pathophysiological relevant thrombin concentrations in vivo, thrombin concentrations reported in blood plasma following venipuncture (0.08–2.4 nm) are in the low range of concentrations used in the present study (33Shuman M.A. Levine S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1102-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Shuman M.A. Majerus P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 1249-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, the selective function of a CaMKIIδ6-mediated pathway in response to 2.5 nm thrombin could be significant under physiological or pathophysiological conditions of thrombin stimulation. Although it remains to be tested, other Ca2+-dependent endothelial cell stimuli may also be found to be partially or fully dependent upon this signaling pathway.Given the reported dependence of endothelial cell permeability on ERK1/2 activation (16Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Shi S. Liu F. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L983-L990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Liu F. Crow M.T. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L43-L54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), as well as our and others previous studies indicating ERK1/2 activation as a point of convergence of multiple proximal signaling pathways, including CaMKII in other cell systems (10Rokolya A. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C537-C545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lu K.K. Armstrong S.E. Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C754-C761Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), CaMKII-dependent ERK1/2 activation was logically proposed to contribute to thrombin-induced HUVEC hyperpermeability. However, our results clearly demonstrate independent activation of CaMKII and ERK1/2 in response to thrombin in HUVEC. This is in marked contrast to our previous studies using cultured vascular smooth muscle where Ca2+ stimulus-dependent ERK1/2 activation is partially CaMKII δ2-dependent (12Lu K.K. Armstrong S.E. Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C1343-C1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2506-2513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To the extent that the alternatively spliced 21-amino acid C terminus present in the δ2 but not the δ6 isoform may result in specific CaMKII targeting or function, that specificity would not be a property of the kinase expressed in endothelial cells and may explain the difference in coupling of Ca2+ signals to ERK1/2 activation in the two cell types.Borbiev et al. (17Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Liu F. Crow M.T. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L43-L54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) previously reported that the CaMKII-selective inhibitor KN-93 inhibited ERK1/2 activation in response to thrombin and over-expression of constitutively active CaMKIIα increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BAEC, suggesting a role for CaMKII in regulating endothelial ERK1/2 activation. Although the reasons for the differences between the results in that study and the current results are not known, there are reported non-selective effects of KN-62 and KN-93 on other CaM kinases, including CaMKIV (36Gao L. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 1606-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and nonspecific inhibitory effects of these drugs on membrane ion channel activities (37Rezazadeh S. Claydon T.W. Fedida D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 317: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active or wild-type multifunctional protein kinase, especially an isoform (CaMKIIα) not endogenously expressed, could result in nonspecific activation of signaling pathways due to loss of temporal and spatial control of activity. We believe that the molecular loss-of-function approach used here is a more conservative and specific approach targeting the predominant endogenous endothelial CaMKII δ isoform, and our results effectively rule out involvement of this specific isoform in regulating ERK1/2 in HUVECs. However, we cannot yet formally exclude the possibility that an alternative weakly expressed CaMKII isoform, such as CaMKIIγb, which is detectable in HUVECs, could potentially mediate thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation.Both ERK1/2 and ROCK have been reported to mediate thrombin-induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in endothelial cells and contribute to increases in monolayer permeability in response to thrombin (17Borbiev T. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Liu F. Crow M.T. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2003; 285: L43-L54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Birukova A.A. Smurova K. Birukov K.G. Kaibuchi K. Garcia J.G. Verin A.D. Microvasc. Res. 2004; 67: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, in our studies the widely used and effective ERK1/2 activation inhibitor, U0126, had no effects on thrombin-induced HUVEC permeability. The differences in ERK1/2 dependence reported here might be due to variability across endothelial cell types with respect to the relative importance of various thrombin-induced signaling pathways. For example, Cai and Garcia (32Cai H. Liu D. Garcia J.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 77: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) proposed that ERK1/2 might play a major role in microvascular endothelium and a minor role in macrovascular endothelial cells.A recent study reported that thrombin-induced Ca2+ entry causes RhoA/ROCK activation leading to increases of human endothelial cell permeability (27Gavard J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29888-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the downstream effectors of Ca2+ signals, which lead to activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling were not identified in that study. Our results indicate a role for endogenous CaMKIIδ6 in regulating thrombin-induced RhoA activation. This function of CaMKIIδ6 was also thrombin concentration-dependent with additional non-CaMKII-dependent pathways leading to RhoA activation recruited with higher levels of thrombin stimulation. This scenario is consistent with previous studies showing high thrombin concentration-induced RhoA activation which was only partially calcium-dependent (27Gavard J. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29888-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on sensitivity to the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, our data confirm ROCK as a downstream mediator of thrombin signaling leading to increases in HUVEC permeability. While low concentration thrombin-induced increases in HUVEC permeability were almost completely abolished by as little as 1 μm Y27632, permeability in response to high concentration thrombin was only partially inhibited by 5 μm Y27632. This suggested that there might be additional RhoA/ROCK-independent pathways culminating in increased permeability that are activated as a function of increasing concentration of thrombin.Downstream targets of RhoA/ROCK signaling were not evaluated in the present studies. However, there are numerous studies implicating likely cytoskeletal targets which could affect endothelial cell mechanics, cell/cell interactions and ultimately monolayer integrity. Possibilities include RhoA-dependent regulation of actin filament dynamics (39Wójciak-Stothard B. Potempa S. Eichholtz T. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), focal adhesions (40van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Natarajan K. Yin G. Hoefen R.J. Osawa M. Haendeler J. Ridley A.J. Fujiwara K. van Hinsbergh V.W. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and adherens or tight junctions (41Chiasson C.M. Wittich K.B. Vincent P.A. Faundez V. Kowalczyk A.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine if CaMKIIδ6-dependent activation of RhoA selectively contributed to the regulation of one or more of these likely cytoskeletal targets in a thrombin-concentration dependent manner. Given this possibility and the observation that less than a third of individual cells from one confluent HUVEC monolayer displayed Ca2+ responses upon low concentration thrombin stimulation (supplemental data S3), an important consideration in future experiments will be potential localization of CaMKIIδ6/RhoA signaling in a subset of endothelial cells and in discrete subcellular compartments.Taken together, the present studies provide a new perspective on thrombin-induced endothelial barrier function that is summarized in a model depicted in Fig. 7. The key findings are: 1) a function for the CaMKIIδ6 isoform in mediating thrombin-induced increases in endothelial barrier permeability, dependent upon the level of thrombin stimulation; 2) the CaMKIIδ6-dependent pathway mediating HUVEC permeability involves downstream activation of RhoA and consequently ROCK; 3) redundant CaMKIIδ6-independent pathways recruited by increasing concentrations of thrombin resulting in Rho/ROCK activation; 4) RhoA/ROCK-independent pathways leading to thrombin-induced endothelial permeability may be recruited by increasing levels of thrombin stimulation; and 5) ERK1/2 activation in response to thrombin in HUVEC independent of CaMKIIδ6 and not involved in regulating thrombin-induced increases in permeability. Stimulus-dependent complexities in endothelial signaling should be kept in mind when designing and interpreting permeability experiments in vitro and when designing inhibitory approaches to attenuate endothelial barrier dysfunction in vivo. IntroductionEndothelial cells line the luminal surface of blood vessels where they regulate the flux and/or transport of fluid, macromolecules and white blood cells from the vascular space to the interstitium. A loss of barrier function as found with inflammation leads to the accumulation of fluid that can disrupt tissue function. Thrombin, a key pro-coagulant serine-protease, is a well known inflammatory mediator that induces endothelial barrier dysfunction by activating endothelial expressed protease-activated receptors (PARs), resulting in activation of key signaling pathways, including increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), that mediate cytoskeletal reorganization through myosin light chain (MLC)-dependent EC contraction (1Sandoval R.

https://openalex.org/W2080188178,"Great efforts have been made to develop novel and efficacious therapeutics against pancreatic cancer to improve the treatment outcomes. Tumor-necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is such a therapeutic cytokine with selective killing effect toward malignant cells. However, some human pancreatic cancers are intrinsically resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis or therapy. In this study, we have shown that the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 can synergize with TRAIL to augment apoptosis even in TRAIL-resistant cells. LBH589 decreased c-FLIP levels in every tested cell line and survivin levels in some of the tested cell lines. Enforced expression of ectopic c-FLIP, but not survivin, abolished the cooperative induction of apoptosis by the combination of LBH589 and TRAIL, indicating that c-FLIP downregulation plays a critical role in LBH589 sensitization of pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL. Moreover, LBH589 decreased c-FLIP stability and the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented c-FLIP from reduction by LBH589. Correspondingly, we detected increased levels of ubiqutinated c-FLIP in LBH589-treated cells. These data thus indicate that LBH589 promotes ubiqutin/proteasome-mediated degradation of c-FLIP, leading to downregulation of c-FLIP. Collectively, LBH589 induces c-FLIP degradation and accordingly sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, highlighting a novel therapeutic regimen against pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2039174984,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at certain frequencies increases thresholds for motor-evoked potentials and phosphenes following stimulation of cortex. Consequently rTMS is often assumed to introduce a ""virtual lesion"" in stimulated brain regions, with correspondingly diminished behavioral performance.Here we investigated the effects of rTMS to visual cortex on subjects' ability to perform visual psychophysical tasks. Contrary to expectations of a visual deficit, we find that rTMS often improves the discrimination of visual features. For coarse orientation tasks, discrimination of a static stimulus improved consistently following theta-burst stimulation of the occipital lobe. Using a reaction-time task, we found that these improvements occurred throughout the visual field and lasted beyond one hour post-rTMS. Low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation yielded similar improvements. In contrast, we did not find consistent effects of rTMS on performance in a fine orientation discrimination task.Overall our results suggest that rTMS generally improves or has no effect on visual acuity, with the nature of the effect depending on the type of stimulation and the task. We interpret our results in the context of an ideal-observer model of visual perception."
https://openalex.org/W2009784145,"Background Back pain is the cause of bad welfare in humans and animals. Although vertebral problems are regularly reported on riding horses, these problems are not always identified nor noticed enough to prevent these horses to be used for work. Methodology/Principal Findings Nineteen horses from two riding centres were submitted to chiropractic examinations performed by an experienced chiropractor and both horses' and riders' postures were observed during a riding lesson. The results show that 74% of horses were severely affected by vertebral problems, while only 26% were mildly or not affected. The degree of vertebral problems identified at rest was statistically correlated with horses' attitudes at work (neck height and curve), and horses' attitudes at work were clearly correlated with riders' positions. Clear differences appeared between schools concerning both riders' and horses' postures, and the analysis of the teachers' speech content and duration highlighted differences in the attention devoted to the riders' position. Conclusion/Significance These findings are to our knowledge the first to underline the impact of riding on horses' back problems and the importance of teaching proper balance to beginner riders in order to increase animals' welfare."
https://openalex.org/W1999765917,"Using x-ray crystallography we have determined the structure of the cytoplasmic fragment (residues 384–732) of the flagellum secretion system protein FlhA from Helicobacter pylori at 2.4-Å resolution (r = 0.224; Rfree = 0.263). FlhA proteins and their type III secretion homologues contain an N-terminal integral membrane domain (residues 1–350), a linker segment, and a globular C-terminal cytoplasmic region. The tertiary structure of the cytoplasmic fragment contains a thioredoxin-like domain, an RNA recognition motif-like domain inserted within the thioredoxin-fold, a helical domain, and a C-terminal β/α domain. Inter-domain contacts are extensive and the H. pylori FlhA structure appears to be in a closed conformation where the C-terminal domain closes against the RNA recognition motif-fold domain. Highly conserved surface residues in FlhA proteins are concentrated on a narrow surface strip comprising the thioredoxin-like and helical domains, possibly close to the export channel opening. The conformation of the FlhA N-terminal linker segment suggests a likely orientation for the FlhA cytoplasmic fragment relative to the membrane-embedded export pore. Comparison with the recently published structures of the Salmonella FlhA cytoplasmic fragment and its type III secretion counterpart InvA highlight a conformational change where the C-terminal β/α domain in H. pylori FlhA moves 15 Å relative to Salmonella FlhA. The conformational change is complex but primarily involves hinge-like movements of the helical and C-terminal domains. Interpretation of previous mutational screens suggest that the C-terminal domain of FlhAC plays a regulatory role in substrate class switching in flagellum export.

Helicobacter pylori is a motile Gram-negative ϵ-proteobacterium that colonizes the human gastric mucosa. Infection with H. pylori causes inflammation typically resulting in gastritis, peptic and duodenal ulcer diseases, and in the most severe cases, gastric adenocarcinoma (reviewed in Refs. 1Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Gastroenterology. 2009; 136: 1863-1873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar and 2Veldhuyzen van Zanten S.J. Sherman P.M. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1994; 150: 177-185PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori is motile by means of multiple flagella that are similar in many respects to the well studied flagella of enteric bacteria, with the exception that they are sheathed by an extension of the outer membrane and located at the cell poles (3O'Toole P.W. Kostrzynska M. Trust T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 4O'Toole P.W. Lane M.C. Porwollik S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Motility is also an essential factor for colonization and persistence of H. pylori in the gastric mucosa of the host organism (5Eaton K.A. Morgan D.R. Krakowka S. J. Med. Microbiol. 1992; 37: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 6Kavermann H. Burns B.P. Angermuller K. Odenbreit S. Fischer W. Melchers K. Haas R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Bacterial flagella consist of four major substructures: a basal body containing the flagellar motor and the export apparatus, a hollow rod that spans the cell envelope, a hook that functions as the torque-generating universal joint, and the flagellar filament that protrudes into the aqueous medium and provides motility (reviewed in Refs. 7Aizawa S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and 8Macnab R.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The basal body is composed of two connected, but distinct structures, the C- or cytoplasmic ring containing FliG, FliM, and FliN, which interact with both the flagellar motor (MotA and MotB proteins) and the MS (motor-stator)-ring. The MS-ring houses the export apparatus, and is composed of 24–26 copies of the ∼570 residue FliF protein (9Suzuki H. Yonekura K. Murata K. Hirai T. Oosawa K. Namba K. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Suzuki H. Yonekura K. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Thomas D.R. Francis N.R. Xu C. DeRosier D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7039-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The MS-ring is anchored to the cell membrane via two membrane spanning segments of FliF situated at approximately residues 23–42 and 449–460 (12Jenal U. Shapiro L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2393-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Associated with the MS-ring are the membrane-spanning proteins FlhA, FlhB, FliO, FliP, FliQ, and FliR, which are thought to assemble together in the cytoplasmic membrane to make an export pore (8Macnab R.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 77-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The pore proteins interact with FliI and FliH, two soluble cytoplasmic components of the export apparatus, and together direct substrates to and facilitate their passage through the export pore in a defined order to ensure correct flagellum assembly. Efficient export of flagellum components requires both ATP hydrolysis, by the flagellum specific ATPase FliI, and the transmembrane protonmotive force (13Minamino T. Namba K. Nature. 2008; 451: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Paul K. Erhardt M. Hirano T. Blair D.F. Hughes K.T. Nature. 2008; 451: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Of the membrane-inserted components of the flagellar export apparatus, FlhA and FlhB are the most well characterized subunits (13Minamino T. Namba K. Nature. 2008; 451: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Minamino T. Yoshimura S.D. Morimoto Y.V. González-Pedrajo B. Kami-Ike N. Namba K. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 343: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). FlhA encodes a ∼700 residue protein that is essential for flagellum biogenesis and which contains an N-terminal integral membrane domain (amino acids 1–350) predicted to contain either six or eight membrane-spanning helices (16McMurry J.L. Van Arnam J.S. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A globular C-terminal domain, FlhAC (residues 350–730 of Hp FlhA), resides in the cytoplasm and likely interacts with the soluble components of the export apparatus and/or export substrates as Salmonella strains harboring a plasmid carrying the FlhAC fragment in a wild-type background exhibit a dominant-negative phenotype, including impaired motility and impaired export of rod/hook substrates (16McMurry J.L. Van Arnam J.S. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A number of Salmonella FlhAC point mutants have been mapped that impair motility at restrictive temperatures (19Saijo-Hamano Y. Minamino T. Macnab R.M. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Genetic suppressor and biochemical studies indicate that the membrane-spanning segment of FlhA interacts directly with the MS-ring protein FliF (16McMurry J.L. Van Arnam J.S. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Kihara M. Minamino T. Yamaguchi S. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The globular C-terminal cytoplasmic region of FliF is also known to interact with the C-ring protein FliG (12Jenal U. Shapiro L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2393-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Grünenfelder B. Gehrig S. Jenal U. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1624-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and has been reported to interact with the cytoplasmic C-terminal fragment of FlhA in Chlamydia pneumoniae (21Stone C.B. Bulir D.C. Gilchrist J.D. Toor R.K. Mahony J.B. BMC Microbiol. 2010; 10: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other studies show that FlhA plays an important role in keeping the flagellar export gate closed in the absence of the export regulator FliH or the flagellar ATPase FliI (13Minamino T. Namba K. Nature. 2008; 451: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Minamino T. González-Pedrajo B. Kihara M. Namba K. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Salmonella FlhAC fragment has been well characterized (16McMurry J.L. Van Arnam J.S. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7586-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and crystallized (22Saijo-Hamano Y. Imada K. Minamino T. Kihara M. Macnab R.M. Namba K. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. 2005; 61: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and a structure for Salmonella FlhAC has been published online (23Saijo-Hamano Y. Imada K. Minamino T. Kihara M. Shimada M. Kitao A. Namba K. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The structure of the C-terminal domain of Salmonella InvA, the type III secretion homolog of FlhA, was also published online (24Worrall L.J. Vuckovic M. Strynadka N.C. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In H. pylori, FlhA is a 733-amino acid polypeptide essential for motility (25Schmitz A. Josenhans C. Suerbaum S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 987-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of FlhA or FlgM (the anti-σ factor for σ28) causes repression of the transcription of a broad range of flagellum genes (26Colland F. Rain J.C. Gounon P. Labigne A. Legrain P. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). FlgM/FlhA double mutants have higher than normal flagellar gene expression levels for the genes down-regulated in the flhA mutant, suggesting an interaction between FlhA and FlgM (26Colland F. Rain J.C. Gounon P. Labigne A. Legrain P. De Reuse H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Josenhans C. Niehus E. Amersbach S. Hörster A. Betz C. Drescher B. Hughes K.T. Suerbaum S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 307-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Niehus E. Gressmann H. Ye F. Schlapbach R. Dehio M. Dehio C. Stack A. Meyer T.F. Suerbaum S. Josenhans C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 947-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Rust M. Borchert S. Niehus E. Kuehne S.A. Gripp E. Bajceta A. McMurry J.L. Suerbaum S. Hughes K.T. Josenhans C. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4824-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An interaction between H. pylori FlhAC and FlgM was recently demonstrated by a bacterial two-hybrid assay and also affinity pulldowns where purified FlgM is added to His-tagged FlhAC in Escherichia coli extracts, the interaction was, however, not confirmed using the two purified proteins, suggesting an additional interaction factor in E. coli extracts (29Rust M. Borchert S. Niehus E. Kuehne S.A. Gripp E. Bajceta A. McMurry J.L. Suerbaum S. Hughes K.T. Josenhans C. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4824-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In Salmonella, FlgM is a filament class export substrate, and is exported after hook completion. Unlike its Salmonella orthologue, H. pylori FlgM is not secreted and remains in the cytoplasm (29Rust M. Borchert S. Niehus E. Kuehne S.A. Gripp E. Bajceta A. McMurry J.L. Suerbaum S. Hughes K.T. Josenhans C. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4824-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hence there are likely to be important differences in the function of FlhA in H. pylori, as compared with its role in Salmonella. Studies on FlhA from Campylobacter and other bacteria suggest functions in addition to flagellar protein export, where secretion of certain non-flagellar outer membrane proteins requires FlhA (30Ghelardi E.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3296-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Studies on LcrD, the Yersinia pestis type III secretion system homolog of FlhA, also demonstrate a role in the regulation of other secretion system components, suggesting this may be a general feature of the FlhA homolog function (33Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Plano G.V. Straley S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3536-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Plano G.V. Straley S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3843-3854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the high level of sequence conservation between FlhA and its type III secretion orthologs, the important central role of FlhA in regulation of H. pylori flagellum assembly and the secretion of flagellum components, and the diverse role of FlhA in the secretion of non-flagellar outer membrane proteins, we chose to study the three-dimensional structure of the soluble cytoplasmic domain of FlhA (FlhAC) from H. pylori CCUG17874. E. coli XL-1 Blue (Invitrogen) was used as the host strain for molecular cloning. Genomic DNA from H. pylori CCUG17874 (Culture Collection University of Gothenburg, Sweden) was used as a template for gene amplification. E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used for protein overexpression. H. pylori CCUG 17874 genomic DNA was extracted as previously described (36Douillard F.P. Ryan K.A. Caly D.L. Hinds J. Witney A.A. Husain S.E. O'Toole P.W. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 7975-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The gene fragment corresponding to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the H. pylori flhA gene (designation hp1041 in strain 26695) was amplified by PCR from H. pylori CCUG 17874 gDNA. PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). The fragment corresponding to amino acids 373–732 (the C-terminal Phe residue was deleted) of H. pylori FlhA was cloned into the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector pGEX-6P-3 (GE Healthcare) using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Forward and reverse primer sequences are 5′-GAC CTG GGA TCC ACA AGG GCT AAA ACC CAA GAA GAG 3′, and 5′-GAC GAC GAA TTC TTA GTT AAT ATG GAT CGT GCC TAA GGC. Sequencing of the insert indicated that the predicted amino acid sequence of the hp1041 gene fragment from strain 17874 differed at five positions from the published sequence from the HP strain 26695. The mutations are conservative and likely have minimal impact on the tertiary structure or function of the protein. They are L381I, K482R, E502D, T503A, V670G, and I710V. E. coli BL21 cells harboring the pFlhAC plasmid were grown at 37 °C with shaking (225 rpm) in Luria-Bertani broth, containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7 and expression of the truncated recombinant FlhAC protein was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After induction, cells were grown at 25 °C for an additional 16–18 h. E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by passage twice through a French Press. The resultant supernatant was clarified by centrifugation two times at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The selenomethionine-labeled protein was prepared in a similar fashion, but once cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7 in LB, the E. coli cells were transferred to M9 minimial medium supplemented with selenomethionine (60 mg) and the following amino acids to inhibit the E. coli methionine biosynthetic pathway (Lys, Phe, Thr (100 mg); Val, Leu, Ile (50 mg)). After the cells recovered for 0.5 h at 37 °C, they were then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 25 °C for an additional 16–18 h. For both wild-type and SeMet 2The abbreviations used are: SeMetselenomethionineGSTglutathione S-transferaseBisTris propane2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolr.m.s.root mean squareRRMRNA recognition motifPDBProtein Data Bank. protein, the soluble fraction containing the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was loaded onto an ÄKTA FPLC instrument, fitted with a column packed with 10 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin and equilibrated in lysis buffer. After extensive washing, the GST fusion protein was eluted using a gradient wash of reduced glutathione. The eluted GST fusion protein fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight into cleavage buffer, and then incubated with PreScission Protease for 16 h at 4 °C (GE Healthcare). The GST tag and PreScission Protease were removed by a second passage of the sample over the glutathione-Sepharose column. The C-terminal domain of FlhA (FlhAC) was further purified by anion exchange chromatography (Source Q) on an ÄKTA FPLC (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, elution gradient of 0.0–0.5 m NaCl). FlhAC was further purified by gel filtration chromatography in 50 mm Tris buffer with 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.2 using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. The purity of FlhAC was assessed after each purification step by SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were concentrated using 10-kDa molecular mass Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford dye binding assay, and/or absorbance of aromatic residues at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 14,400 m−1 cm−1; absorbance of 0.373 for 1 mg/ml soln). selenomethionine glutathione S-transferase 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol root mean square RNA recognition motif Protein Data Bank. Highly purified FlhAC protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm BisTris propane buffer, pH 6.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The FlhAC protein was crystallised at 20 °C in hanging-drop vapor diffusion experiments. Drops contained 1.0 μl of purified protein and an equivalent volume of reservoir solution and were sealed over a reservoir filled with 1 ml of crystallization solution. Small clusters of plate-like crystals were obtained from commercial sparse matrix screens containing ∼20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m Ca2+ or Mg2+ salts. Extensive optimization of the crystallization conditions yielded large, but thin plate crystals (0.5 × 0.3 × 0.03 mm) from 13.5 to 15% (w/v) monomethyl ether-polyethylene glycol 5000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate buffered at pH 6.2–6.7, 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, and 6–8% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol. Crystals of selenometionine-incorporated FlhAC protein were grown as described above and incubated in mother liquor plus 18% (w/v) glycerol, mounted in 20-μm nylon loops (Hampton Research), and flash frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen gas. A Selenium K-edge MAD experiment was performed on the CMCF-I 08ID-1 beamline at the Canadian Light Source Synchrotron (Saskatoon, Canada). Diffraction data at peak, inflection, and remote (low energy) wavelengths (Table 1) were then collected and processed with the HLK-2000 package (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals of the SeMet-labeled protein diffracted to a nominal resolution of 3.0 Å. The unit cell parameters fitted a C-centered orthorhombic lattice (space group C2221), with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). Analysis of the anomalous scattering signal from the selenium atoms, using Solve, revealed a strong signal to ∼3.4-Å resolution (38Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar, 39Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Eight of the nine Se atoms were located with Solve, the resultant Z-score was 31.5 with a figure of merit of 0.55 for all data between 50.0 and 3.00 Å resolution. A solvent-flattened electron density map (70% solvent in the unit cell) was calculated to 3.0-Å resolution with Resolve clearly revealed the overall trace of the polypeptide chain, and the positions of eight of the nine expected SeMet residues (supplemental Fig. S3). Subsequent model building was carried out with Coot (41Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The initial model was refined against the SeMet peak data using CNS (42Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

https://openalex.org/W2036615570,"In specific cell types like keratinocytes, Notch signaling plays an important pro-differentiation and tumor suppressing function, with down-modulation of the Notch1 gene being associated with cancer development. Besides being controlled by p53, little else is known on regulation of Notch1 gene expression in this context. We report here that transcription of this gene is driven by a TATA-less “sharp peak” promoter and that the minimal functional region of this promoter, which extends from the −342 bp position to the initiation codon, is differentially active in normal versus cancer cells. This GC rich region lacks p53 binding sites, but binds Klf4 and Sp3. This finding is likely to be of biological significance, as Klf4 and, to a lesser extent, Sp3 are up-regulated in a number of cancer cells where Notch1 expression is down-modulated, and Klf4 over-expression in normal cells is sufficient to down-modulate Notch1 gene transcription. The combined knock-down of Klf4 and Sp3 was necessary for the reverse effect of increasing Notch1 transcription, consistent with the two factors exerting an overlapping repressor function through their binding to the Notch1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2066104693,"Background Biodiversity offsets provide a mechanism to compensate for unavoidable damages from new energy development as the U.S. increases its domestic production. Proponents argue that offsets provide a partial solution for funding conservation while opponents contend the practice is flawed because offsets are negotiated without the science necessary to backup resulting decisions. Missing in negotiations is a biologically-based currency for estimating sufficiency of offsets and a framework for applying proceeds to maximize conservation benefits. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we quantify a common currency for offsets for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) by estimating number of impacted birds at 4 levels of development commonly permitted. Impacts were indiscernible at 1–12 wells per 32.2 km2. Above this threshold lek losses were 2–5 times greater inside than outside of development and bird abundance at remaining leks declined by −32 to −77%. Findings reiterated the importance of time-lags as evidenced by greater impacts 4 years after initial development. Clustering well locations enabled a few small leks to remain active inside of developments. Conclusions/Significance Documented impacts relative to development intensity can be used to forecast biological trade-offs of newly proposed or ongoing developments, and when drilling is approved, anticipated bird declines form the biological currency for negotiating offsets. Monetary costs for offsets will be determined by true conservation cost to mitigate risks such as sagebrush tillage to other populations of equal or greater number. If this information is blended with landscape level conservation planning, the mitigation hierarchy can be improved by steering planned developments away from conservation priorities, ensuring compensatory mitigation projects deliver a higher return for conservation that equate to an equal number of birds in the highest priority areas, provide on-site mitigation recommendations, and provide a biologically based cost for mitigating unavoidable impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2028752334,"Background Short cycle treatment interruption could reduce toxicity and drug costs and contribute to further expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs. Methods A 72 week, non-inferiority trial enrolled one hundred forty six HIV positive persons receiving ART (CD4+ cell count ≥125 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA plasma levels <50 copies/ml) in one of three arms: continuous, 7 days on/7 days off and 5 days on/2 days off treatment. Primary endpoint was ART treatment failure determined by plasma HIV RNA level, CD4+ cell count decrease, death attributed to study participation, or opportunistic infection. Results Following enrollment of 32 participants, the 7 days on/7 days off arm was closed because of a failure rate of 31%. Six of 52 (11.5%) participants in the 5 days on/2 days off arm failed. Five had virologic failure and one participant had immunologic failure. Eleven of 51 (21.6%) participants in the continuous treatment arm failed. Nine had virologic failure with 1 death (lactic acidosis) and 1 clinical failure (extra-pulmonary TB). The upper 97.5% confidence boundary for the difference between the percent of non-failures in the 5 days on/2 days off arm (88.5% non-failure) compared to continuous treatment (78.4% non failure) was 4.8% which is well within the preset non-inferiority margin of 15%. No significant difference was found in time to failure in the 2 study arms (p = 0.39). Conclusions Short cycle 5 days on/2 days off intermittent ART was at least as effective as continuous therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2025099296,"Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that isoflavones exhibit anti-proliferative activity against epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-positive malignancies of the breast, colon, skin, and prostate. 7,3',4'-Trihydroxyisoflavone (7,3',4'-THIF) is one of the metabolites of daidzein, a well known soy isoflavone, but its chemopreventive activity and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, 7,3',4'-THIF prevented EGF-induced neoplastic transformation and proliferation of JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cells. It significantly blocked cell cycle progression of EGF-stimulated cells at the G(1) phase. As shown by Western blot, 7,3',4'-THIF suppressed the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein at Ser-795 and Ser-807/Ser-811, which are the specific sites of phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4. It also inhibited the expression of G(1) phase-regulatory proteins, including cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2. In addition to regulating the expression of cell cycle-regulatory proteins, 7,3',4'-THIF bound to CDK4 and CDK2 and strongly inhibited their kinase activities. It also bound to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), strongly inhibiting its kinase activity and thereby suppressing the Akt/GSK-3beta/AP-1 pathway and subsequently attenuating the expression of cyclin D1. Collectively, these results suggest that CDKs and PI3K are the primary molecular targets of 7,3',4'-THIF in the suppression of EGF-induced cell proliferation. These insights into the biological actions of 7,3',4'-THIF provide a molecular basis for the possible development of new chemoprotective agents."
https://openalex.org/W1992760776,"Background A total of six Neocalanus species inhabit the oceans of the world. Of these, three species plus form variants (N. cristatus, N. plumchrus, N. flemingeri large form, and N. flemingeri small form), which constitute a monophyletic group among Neocalanus copepods, occur in the Northwestern Pacific off Japan. In the present study, we have tried to discriminate the three species plus form variants of Neocalanus copepods based on sequences of four DNA marker regions. Methodology/Principal Findings Discrimination was performed based on the DNA sequence information from four genetic markers, including the mitochondrial COI, 12S, nuclear ITS, and 28S gene regions. Sequence dissimilarity was compared using both distance- and character-based approaches. As a result, all three species were confirmed to be distinct based on the four genetic marker regions. On the contrary, distinction of the form variants was only confirmed based on DNA sequence of the mitochondrial COI gene region. Conclusions/Significance Although discrimination was not successful for the form variants based on the mitochondrial 12S, nuclear ITS, and 28S genes, diagnostic nucleotide sequence characters were observed in their mitochondrial COI gene sequences. Therefore, these form variants are considered to be an important unit of evolution below the species level, and constitute a part of the Neocalanus biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2064583746,"Apicomplexan parasites (including Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii) employ a four-carbon pathway for de novo heme biosynthesis, but this pathway is distinct from the animal/fungal C4 pathway in that it is distributed between three compartments: the mitochondrion, cytosol, and apicoplast, a plastid acquired by secondary endosymbiosis of an alga. Parasite porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) resides within the apicoplast, and phylogenetic analysis indicates a plant origin. The PBGS family exhibits a complex use of metal ions (Zn2+ and Mg2+) and oligomeric states (dimers, hexamers, and octamers). Recombinant T. gondii PBGS (TgPBGS) was purified as a stable ∼320-kDa octamer, and low levels of dimers but no hexamers were also observed. The enzyme displays a broad activity peak (pH 7–8.5), with a Km for aminolevulinic acid of ∼150 μm and specific activity of ∼24 μmol of porphobilinogen/mg of protein/h. Like the plant enzyme, TgPBGS responds to Mg2+ but not Zn2+ and shows two Mg2+ affinities, interpreted as tight binding at both the active and allosteric sites. Unlike other Mg2+-binding PBGS, however, metal ions are not required for TgPBGS octamer stability.

https://openalex.org/W2083339077,"Background Multiple studies have provided compelling evidence that the FTO gene variants are associated with obesity measures. The objective of the study was to investigate whether FTO variants are associated with a broad range of obesity related anthropometric traits in an island population. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined genetic association between 29 FTO SNPs and a comprehensive set of anthropometric traits in 843 unrelated individuals from an island population in the eastern Adriatic coast of Croatia. The traits include 11 anthropometrics (height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, bicondilar upper arm width, upper arm circumference, and biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and abdominal skin-fold thicknesses) and two derived measures (BMI and WHR). Using single locus score tests, 15 common SNPs were found to be significantly associated with “body fatness” measures such as weight, BMI, hip and waist circumferences with P-values ranging from 0.0004 to 0.01. Similar but less significant associations were also observed between these markers and bicondilar upper arm width and upper arm circumference. Most of these significant findings could be explained by a mediating effect of “body fatness”. However, one unique association signal between upper arm width and rs16952517 (P-value = 0.00156) could not be explained by this mediating effect. In addition, using a principle component analysis and conditional association tests adjusted for “body fatness”, two novel association signals were identified between upper arm circumference and rs11075986 (P-value = 0.00211) and rs16945088 (P-value = 0.00203). Conclusions/Significance The current study confirmed the association of common variants of FTO gene with “body fatness” measures in an isolated island population. We also observed evidence of pleiotropic effects of FTO gene on fat-free mass, such as frame size and muscle mass assessed by bicondilar upper arm width and upper arm circumference respectively and these pleiotropic effects might be influenced by variants that are different from the ones associated with “body fatness”."
https://openalex.org/W2050165881,"A novel viral responsive protein, namely hemocyte homeostasis-associated protein (HHAP), was characterized for its role in the response of shrimp to white spot syndrome virus infection. The full-length cDNAs of HHAP from the black tiger shrimp (PmHHAP), Penaeus monodon, and the fresh water crayfish (PlHHAP), Pacifastacus leniusculus, were obtained and showed high sequence identity to a hypothetical protein from various organisms, with the highest identity to the hypothetical protein TcasGA2_TC006773 from the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (54% amino acid sequence identity). Transcripts of PmHHAP were expressed in various shrimp tissues with the highest expression in hematopoietic tissue, whereas the transcripts of PlHHAP were found in the hematopoietic and nerve tissues. Upon white spot syndrome virus infection, a high up-regulation level of shrimp hemocytic HHAP mRNA and protein was observed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. Gene silencing of PmHHAP by RNA interference resulted in a significant decrease in the number of circulating hemocytes and 100% shrimp mortality within 30 h of the double-stranded PmHHAP RNA injection (but not in control shrimp), indicating that HHAP is essential for shrimp survival. Interestingly, severe damage of hemocytes was observed in vivo in the PmHHAP knockdown shrimp and in vitro in shrimp primary hemocyte cell culture, suggesting that PmHHAP plays an important role in hemocyte homeostasis. Thus, it is speculated that the up-regulation of PmHHAP is an important mechanism to control circulating hemocyte levels in crustaceans during viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2113314359,"The fully organized structure of the eukaryotic nucleosome remains unsolved, in part due to limited information regarding the binding site of the H1 or linker histone. The central globular domain of H1 is believed to interact with the nucleosome core at or near the dyad and to bind at least two strands of DNA. We utilized site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo photobleaching to identify residues that contribute to the binding of the globular domain of the somatic H1 subtype H1c to the nucleosome. As was previously observed for the H10 subtype, the binding residues for H1c are clustered on the surface of one face of the domain. Despite considerable structural conservation between the globular domains of these two subtypes, the locations of the binding sites identified for H1c are distinct from those of H10. We suggest that the globular domains of these two linker histone subtypes will bind to the nucleosome with distinct orientations that may contribute to higher order chromatin structure heterogeneity or to differences in dynamic interactions with other DNA or chromatin-binding proteins.

Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). Two molecules each of the four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, form an octamer around which is wrapped 147 bp of DNA to form the nucleosome core particle (3Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K.

In higher organisms, the linker histones have a conserved tripartite structure consisting of a short, flexible N-terminal tail, a highly conserved central globular domain of ∼80 residues, and a long (∼100-residue) unstructured, highly basic C-terminal tail (10Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The central domain is organized into a three-helix bundle containing a winged helix motif similar to that found in some transcription factors (11Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L.

Via a mechanism that requires the C-terminal tail, linker histone binding promotes and/or stabilizes folding of nucleosomal arrays into higher order structures (5Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J.

It is now clear that chromatin in general, and specifically the H1 histones, are much more dynamic than previously thought and that regulation of the dynamic properties of the linker histones is a key aspect of many chromatin-mediated processes (19Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 20Brown D.T. Biochem.

In mice, linker histones exist as a class of at least 11 nonallelic primary sequence variants or subtypes (22Cole R.D. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1987; 30: 433-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Seven of these are expressed in somatic tissues whereas the remaining subtypes are germ line-specific. Five of the somatic subtypes (H1a–H1e) are generally classified as replication-dependent and are expressed to varying degrees in most cell types. They display significant sequence heterogeneity in the N- and C-terminal tails but are very highly conserved (87–99% identity) within the globular core domain. The replication-independent or replacement subtype H10 is expressed to the highest level in terminally differentiated cells. The globular domain of this subtype displays considerable sequence divergence from those of the H1a–H1e subtypes (44–45% identity). The least characterized somatic subtype, H1x, is the most divergent in sequence and is expressed at low levels in most somatic tissues (24Izzo A. Kamieniarz K. Schneider R. Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). There is a large amount of experimental evidence that individual subtypes differ from one another in their interactions with chromatin, supporting the concept of a functional significance to the evolutionarily conserved heterogeneity (24Izzo A. Kamieniarz K. Schneider R. Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 25Brown D.T. Genome. Biol. 2001; 2 (REVIEWS0006)Google Scholar, 26Happel N. Doenecke D. Gene. 2009; 431: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, a mechanistic explanation for how this is mediated is lacking. X-ray crystallographic data of H1-containing nucleosomes has not been reported to date, and there is little direct structural information regarding the exact location of the linker histone on the nucleosome (16Thomas J.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Travers A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 4-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Staynov D.Z. Crane-Robinson C.

Ramakrishnan V. Travers A. Muyldermans S. Nature. 1998; 395: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This information is crucial to understanding how these proteins promote or stabilize chromatin condensation and how they might function to regulate gene expression at the nucleosomal level. Recently, we combined mutagenesis and photobleaching techniques to identify specific residues in the globular domain of the H10 subtype involved in binding of this domain to the nucleosome in vivo (30Brown D.T. Izard T. Misteli T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Utilizing existing structural information on the nucleosome core particle (3Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6917) Google Scholar) and the globular domain of the H10 ortholog H5 (11Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), we generated a map of the nucleosomal interaction surface of the H10 globular domain and were able to propose a model for binding of this subtype to the nucleosome (30Brown D.T. Izard T. Misteli T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The H10 subtype constitutes a minor fraction of the total linker histone composition of most cell types. Here, we sought to apply the same experimental approach to a representative of the main or replication-dependent class of H1 proteins that make up the bulk of the linker histone in somatic cells. The H1c subtype was chosen for this study partly because a high resolution NMR structure of the globular domain of the chicken ortholog is available (31Cerf C. Lippens G. Ramakrishnan V. Muyldermans S. Segers A. Wyns L. Wodak S.J. Hallenga K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11079-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). There are only seven differences, all conservative, between these globular domains of the mouse and chicken proteins. In addition, we had previously shown that, upon overexpression, the H10 and H1c subtypes had very different effects on cell cycle progression and gene expression in cultured fibroblasts (32Brown D.T. Alexander B.T. Sittman D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Through domain-swapping experiments, we demonstrated that these differences were attributable to sequence or structural differences between the globular domain of these two proteins (33Brown D.T. Gunjan A. Alexander B.T. Sittman D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5003-5009Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the results presented here indicate that, despite the strong conservation of overall structure of the globular domains of these two subtypes, there are more differences than similarities in the spatial orientation of the binding residues, indicating that they are likely to bind to the nucleosome with distinct geometries. Plasmids MTH10GFPneo and MTH1cGFPneo have been described previously (19Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In these plasmids, the coding sequence for enhanced GFP 2The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinFRAPfluorescent recovery after photobleachingt50half-time. is fused to the C terminus of the coding region for the histone, and expression is under control of the mouse metallothionein promoter. Point mutations were introduced with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or by introduction of annealed oligonucleotides between restriction sites. Constructs were introduced into mouse BALB/c 3T3 cells, and multiple stable transfectants were isolated and analyzed as described (30Brown D.T. Izard T. Misteli T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays, cultures were grown in the absence of inducer. Under these conditions, H1-GFP comprises less than 5% of the total H1 population (19Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). green fluorescent protein fluorescent recovery after photobleaching half-time. For FRAP, cells were plated and observed in LabTekII chambered coverslips (Nalgene). FRAP was performed on a Zeiss 510 Meta LSM confocal microscope using the 488-nm line of an argon laser (nominal output 30 W). All experiments were done at 37 °C, and imaging was done with an Apochromat 63/1.4 DIC objective lens. Scanning was bidirectional at the highest possible rate using a ×4 zoom with a pinhole of 1 Airy unit. Bleaching was achieved using three consecutive bleach scans of 49-ms duration at maximal laser power. The bleached region was a 2-μm spot that included euchromatin and heterochromatin but excluded nucleoli. Recovery was detected at 500–575 nm and recorded until the recovery signal reached a plateau. Identical imaging settings (1% laser intensity, 0.1% attenuation) were used for all pre- and postbleach images. Image analysis was carried out with MBF ImageJ, and alignment was performed with the TurboReg Plugin (34Thévenaz P. Ruttimann U.E. Unser M. IEEE Trans. Image Process. 1998; 7: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar). Normalized recovery rates were determined as described (35Phair R.D. Gorski S.A. Misteli T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 393-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). All datasets consisted of at least eight cells/experiment. To compare the binding affinity of H1c and H10 directly, we created additional multiple individual stable cell lines expressing either H10 or H1c with GFP fused to the C terminus. The binding affinity of each was measured by quantitative FRAP analysis under identical conditions (Fig. 1 and Table 1). We observed a significant difference in the recovery curves of these two constructs. Recovery of H1c-GFP reached a plateau by 90–100 s whereas that of H10-GFP occurred at ∼170–180 s. Each of the curves was fit to a single exponential and yielded half-times for recovery, t50, of 18.6 s and 35.1 s for H1c and H10, respectively. The results indicate that H1c binds to chromatin with significantly less affinity than does H10 in 3T3 fibroblasts. We previously reported that H1c also binds with lower affinity than does H10 in both differentiated and undifferentiated murine erythroleukemia cells (36Yellajoshyula D. Brown D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18568-18573Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FRAP experiments in human cells indicate that the H1c ortholog H1.2 binds significantly less tightly than any of the other variants assayed (37Th'ng J.P. Sung R. Ye M. Hendzel M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27809-27814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Quantitative FRAP analysis of H1-GFP constructsConstructt50aValues for t50 were determined as described previously (30).

Values are the mean ± S.D. from at least six independent measurements.b Versus wild type H1c. Open table in a new tab The binding of linker histones to chromatin is primarily electrostatic in nature (38Clark D.J. Kimura T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We therefore created a comprehensive set of H1c-GFP mutant constructs in which each of the basic residues located on the surface of the globular domain of H1c was individually mutated to alanine (Fig. 2a). Each construct was stably transfected into mouse fibroblasts and analyzed by FRAP (Fig. 2, b–e and Table 1). The mutants fell into two distinct classes. Five mutants, K63A, K74A, K80A, K84A, and K89A, reached a stable plateau by ∼45 s and displayed t50 values of 6–9 s (Fig. 2, b and c). The binding properties of these five mutants are significantly different from that of the wild type construct (Fig. 2g and Table 1). The remaining seven mutants, K45A, K51A, R53A, K96A, K105A, K108A, and K109A, displayed FRAP recovery curves that are not significantly different from the wild type construct (Fig. 2, d, e, and g, and Table 1). We previously showed that the H1c-GFP protein behaves identically to the endogenous protein with respect to release by micrococcal nuclease digestion or by salt extraction (19Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We also reported that these cell lines expressed H1c-GFP to <5% of the total H1 population and that expression of the fusion protein had no effect on cell-cycle progression or cell morphology. H1c-GFP co-localizes with DNA staining by Hoechst 33342 or propidium iodide, indicating that it is incorporated into both euchromatin and heterochromatin. We also demonstrated that H1-GFP constructs are fully functional in somatic cell nuclear transfer experiments (39Becker M. Becker A. Miyara F. Han Z. Kihara M. Brown D.T. Hager G.L. Latham K. Adashi E.Y. Misteli T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Proper positioning of linker histones on the nucleosome is most stringently assayed by detection of a ∼170-bp kinetic intermediate, termed the chromatosome, generated during micrococcal nuclease digestion of native chromatin (14Noll M. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 15Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To confirm that H1c-GFP is properly positioned, we separated mononucleosome particles containing H1c-GFP from those containing endogenous H1 by electrophoresis on nucleoprotein gels following micrococcal nuclease digestion (supplemental Fig. S1). DNA purified from H1c-GFP-containing particles and those containing endogenous H1 were each ∼170–180 bp in length. We also demonstrated that three mutants that displayed fast FRAP recovery, K63A, K80A, and K84A, also confer protection of a discrete chromatosome-sized fragment of DNA (supplemental Fig. S1). We also created and analyzed additional constructs in which the lysine residues at positions 63, 80, and 84 were mutated to arginine. FRAP analyses of these mutants each displayed a recovery curve that was not significantly different from that of wild type (Fig. 2f) as would be expected if these residues were interacting electrostatically with DNA. We conclude that lysine residues at positions 63, 74, 80, 84, and 89 are the major contributors to binding interactions between the globular domain of H1c and the nucleosome (Table 1 and Fig. 2g). Seven residues, lysines at positions 45, 51, 96, 105, 108, and 109, and arginine at position 53 are located on the surface of the domain but do not make major contributions to binding. To visualize the interaction surface of the H1c globular domain, we mapped the position of the major binding residues onto the NMR structure of the chicken ortholog (31Cerf C. Lippens G. Ramakrishnan V. Muyldermans S. Segers A. Wyns L. Wodak S.J. Hallenga K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11079-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3a). The binding residues are not scattered around the surface of the domain but are clustered on one face of the domain. One major cluster consists of Lys-80, Lys-84, and Lys-89 in helix 3. The two remaining binding residues, Lys-63 and Lys-74, are oriented away from the major cluster and may constitute a single cluster or two independent binding sites. All but one of the residues identified as nonbinding are located on the opposite face of the domain, well separated from the binding residues. Note that the interaction surface of the H1c globular domain is quite different from that previously determined for H10 (30, Fig. 3) in that the latter has considerably more binding residues arranged into two distinct clusters. In our previous study we were able to propose a model for the positioning of H10 on the nucleosome (30Brown D.T. Izard T. Misteli T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The large size of the primary binding site of the H10 globular domain could only be accommodated by binding to curved DNA in the nucleosome core. Positioning of the secondary site to interact with DNA on the entering/exiting strand dictated an asymmetric location for the primary site on one side of the nucleosomal core approximately one helical turn from the dyad. The model was refined by energy minimization and tested by additional mutagenesis. Because of the smaller number of binding sites, we were not able to propose a consensus model for the location of H1c on the nucleosome. However, attempts to model the H1c globular domain into the position determined for that of H10 failed due to multiple unfavorable interactions (supplemental Fig. S2). The linker histone family of proteins in mice and humans is a markedly heterogeneous collection of at least 11 nonallelic primary sequence subtypes or variants (23Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Happel N. Doenecke D. Gene. 2009; 431: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Results from gene knock-out studies indicate that there is some level of redundancy among the variants in their role as chromatin architectural proteins in that knock-out or knockdown of a single subtype could be compensated by up-regulation of others (40Fan Y. Nikitina T. Zhao J. Fleury T.J. Bhattacharyya R. Bouhassira E.E. Stein A. Woodcock C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Cell. 2005; 123: 1199-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 41Sancho M. Diani E. Beato M. Jordan A. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000227Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A considerable amount of experimental data indicates that individual variants differ in their expression patterns in different tissues and in their quantitative ability to condense chromatin (42Clausell J. Happel N. Hale T.K. Doenecke D. Beato M. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e0007243Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and references therein). These, and additional observations, have led to the view that a functional significance underlies the evolutionarily conserved linker histone heterogeneity of higher organisms (for recent reviews, see 24Izzo A. Kamieniarz K. Schneider R. Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Happel N. Doenecke D. Gene. 2009; 431: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, despite extensive and ongoing investigation, what is lacking is a mechanism for how this is mediated. Here, we have used photobleaching and mutagenesis to map the nucleosome interaction surface of the globular domain of the replication-dependent H1c variant and to compare it with that determined previously for the replication-independent H10. The primary amino sequences for the globular domains of H1c and H10 and the results of this and our previous study (30Brown D.T. Izard T. Misteli T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) are aligned in Fig. 2a. Surprisingly, at only two positions, Lys-80 and Lys-84 in helix 3 of H1c, corresponding to Lys-69 and Lys-73 of H10, are the sequence and binding properties conserved. Two of the remaining three H1c-binding residues, Lys-74 and Lys-89, are not conserved in H10, having been replaced by neutral amino acids. Lys-63 of H1c was determined to be a major contributor to binding, but the conserved Lys-52 of H10 was previously shown not to be significantly involved in binding. Three additional binding residues in H10, His-25, Lys-47, and Arg-74, are not conserved in the H1c sequence. Conspicuously, mutation of residues Lys-96, Arg-53, Lys-105, or Lys-108 in H1c did not significantly affect binding. These residues are conserved in all of the major somatic linker histone subtypes of mouse and human (23Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Happel N. Doenecke D. Gene. 2009; 431: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Mutation of each of the corresponding residues in H10 significantly compromised binding, and three of these, Arg-52, Arg-94, and Lys-97, comprise a major DNA binding site as determined by molecular modeling (30Brown D.T. Izard T. Misteli T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, at the primary amino acid sequence level there are far more differences than similarities in the location of the binding residues for these two domains. These differences led to distinct nucleosomal surface interaction maps for the globular domains of these two linker histone subtypes (Fig. 3). The stoichiometry and nucleosome binding geometry of the linker histones are expected to have a major influence on the structure of compacted chromatin (7Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Grigoryev S.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Koster A.J. Woodcock C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 8Robinson P.J. Rhodes D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The structure of the secondary level of folding, the so-called 30-nm fiber, remains controversial (43Woodcock C.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 639-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 44Tremethick D.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 651-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the one-start or interdigitated solenoid model (45Finch J.T. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 1897-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), the fiber is coiled such that successive nucleosomes are adjacent to one another joined by bent linker DNA. This model is supported by electronmicrographic analysis of long nucleosomal arrays containing stoichiometric amounts of linker histone (46Routh A. Sandin S. Rhodes D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8872-8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the two-start or zigzag model (47Horowitz R.A. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Woodcock C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), consecutive nucleosomes are separated by relatively straight linker DNA such that each nucleosome is closest to its n+1 neighbor. This model is supported by the crystal structure of a tetranucleosome compacted in the absence of H1 (48Schalch T. Duda S. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that both structures may exist in vivo, with the more compact one-start structure representing H1-containing chromatin and the zigzag structure predominating in H1-depleted regions (8Robinson P.J. Rhodes D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This may be an oversimplification as cross-linking studies indicate that H1-containing nucleosomal arrays can adopt a zigzag conformation (49Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study provides evidence that both structures may be simultaneously present in a structurally heteromorphic chromatin fiber of 30 nm (50Grigoryev S.A. Arya G. Correll S. Woodcock C.L. Schlick T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13317-13322Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the binding geometry of the globular domain of H1 in the chromatosome is expected to contribute to the stability of the folded structure by constraining the entry/exit angle of the linker DNA. Monte Carlo simulations of chromatin fiber folding, utilizing the H10-containing chromatosome structure we previously proposed (30Brown D.T. Izard T. Misteli T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), were interpreted as evidence for an interdigitated one-start helix (51Kepper N. Foethke D. Stehr R. Wedemann G. Rippe K. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 3692-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here suggest that the globular domain of the H1c subtype will not be easily accommodated in this structure. We do not mean to suggest or imply that the linker histone subtype dictates the conformation of the 30-nm fiber. However, if the globular domains of individual H1 subtypes exhibit different binding geometries they may stabilize or be more easily accommodated in alternate structures. Differences among H1 variants in the binding sites of the globular domain within the nucleosome might also influence how they interact within the dynamic network of chromatin-binding proteins (for recent reviews, see 52Zlatanova J. Seebart C. Tomschik M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 53McBryant S.J. Lu X. Hansen J.C.

Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the methylated DNA-binding protein MeCP2 (55Nikitina T. Ghosh R.P. Horowitz-Scherer R.A. Hansen J.C.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) interact directly with the nucleosome at or near the site of H1 binding. Most studies addressing linker histone heterogeneity have focused on quantitative assessment of the binding affinity or chromatin condensing abilities of the various subtypes and conclude that the highly divergent C terminus is the primary domain responsible for these differences (24Izzo A. Kamieniarz K. Schneider R. Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Happel N. Doenecke D.

PLoS One. 2009; 4: e0007243Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here, we show, utilizing in vivo photobleaching of unperturbed chromatin, that there are qualitative differences in the binding surfaces of the conserved globular domains of two somatic H1 variants. We suggest that these two linker histone subtypes will bind to the nucleosome with distinct orientations that may contribute to higher order chromatin structure heterogeneity or to differences in dynamic interactions with other chromatin-binding proteins.

With [RNQ+] prion variants, we found that the prion variant does not correlate with the rate of aggregation as anticipated but does correlate with stability. Interestingly, we found that there are differences in the ability of the [RNQ+] prion variants to faithfully propagate themselves and to template the aggregation of other proteins. Incorporating the mechanism of variant formation elucidated in this study with that previously proposed for [PSI+] variants has provided a framework to separate general characteristics of prion variant properties from those specific to individual prion proteins.

Interestingly, we found that there are differences in the ability of the [RNQ+] prion variants to faithfully propagate themselves and to template the aggregation of other proteins. Incorporating the mechanism of variant formation elucidated in this study with that previously proposed for [PSI+] variants has provided a framework to separate general characteristics of prion variant properties from those specific to individual prion proteins. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect many mammals. Prions are responsible for diseases such as scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). These diseases are linked to either mutations in the gene encoding the prion protein (PRNP) or aggregation of the prion protein (PrP) itself (2Chesebro B. Br. Med. Bull. 2003; 66: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Wadsworth J.D. Hill A.F. Beck J.A. Collinge J. Br. Med. Bull. 2003; 66: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Self-propagating aggregates of PrP are implicated in the infectious transmission of prion disease among mammals (4Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar). One interesting feature of prion diseases lies in the apparent heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and disease pathology (5Croes E.A. Theuns J. Houwing-Duistermaat J.J. Dermaut B. Sleegers K. Roks G. Van den Broeck M. van Harten B. van Swieten J.C. Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C. van Duijn C.M. J. Neurol. Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2004; 75: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6King A.

Knight R.S. Budka H. J. Neurol. 2002; 249: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that this heterogeneity in pathology is partly due to the existence of different prion strains (8Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The mechanism of prion strain generation is not entirely understood, but is an important aspect of prion disease. Elucidating mechanisms that dictate the generation of prion strains is crucial to understanding the biology underlying prion diseases, protein misfolding, and aggregation. Naturally occurring prions that exist in fungi such as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae may not be associated with disease, but can act as a mechanism to alter phenotype. Recent studies have uncovered several prion-like proteins in yeast (9Du Z. Park K.W. Yu H. Fan Q. Li L. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Patel B.K.

The three extensively characterized prions in yeast are the [PSI+], [RNQ+], and [URE3] prions (14Uptain S.M. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 703-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15Wickner R.B. Masison D.C. Edskes H.K. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1671-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The [PSI+] prion manifests as a result of the aggregation of Sup35p (17Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 18Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Science. 1996; 273: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), which is the S. cerevisiae eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) (19Zhouravleva G. Frolova L. Le Goff X. Le Guellec R. Inge-Vechtomov S. Kisselev L. Philippe M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In the [psi−] state, Sup35p binds Sup45p, and this complex is required for translation termination at stop codons (20Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I. Paushkin S.V. Nierras C.R. Cox B.S. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Tuite M.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4365-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In the [PSI+] state, however, much of the Sup35p is in the aggregated state and not available to function in translation termination (17Paushkin S.V. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3127-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). A premature stop codon in a metabolic pathway, such as that in the ade1-14 allele, provides a convenient method of detecting the [PSI] state of yeast cells. Yeast grown on nutrient-rich medium that harbor the ade1-14 allele are white in color in the [PSI+] state, but red in color in the [psi−] state due to the accumulation of a metabolic intermediate in the adenine biosynthetic pathway (21Serio T.R. Lindquist S.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 661-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Yeast can maintain different variants of the [PSI+] prion and these cause different levels of read through of the ade1-14 premature stop codon that correlate to the amount of aggregated Sup35p (22Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Valouev I.A. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Yeast. 2001; 18: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Uptain S.M. Sawicki G.J. Caughey B. Lindquist S.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This results in different levels of pigment accumulation in cells and weaker strains of [PSI+] manifest as shades of pink (24Derkatch I.L. Chernoff Y.O. Kushnirov V.V. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype has proven very useful in investigating the mechanism of prion variant generation. The structure of different [PSI+] prion variants have been revealed by biophysical and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on conformationally-distinct fibers of the prion-forming domain (PFD) 2The abbreviations used are: PFDprion-forming domainTEMtransmission electron microscopeRRP[RNQ+] reporter proteinGdnHClguanidine hydrochlorideTh-Tthioflavin-TRFUrelative fluorescence unitsYPDrichmedia. of Sup35p (Sup35NM) formed in vitro at different temperatures (25Krishnan R. Lindquist S.L. Nature. 2005; 435: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 26Toyama B.H. Kelly M.J. Gross J.D. Weissman J.S.

Yonekura K. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2005; 121: 49-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the protected amyloid core of the strong variant is short relative to the amyloid core of the weak variant. A model designed to explain the propagation of prion variants related structural and biochemical properties of amyloid fibers to the prion variant phenotype (29Tanaka M. Collins S.R. Toyama B.H. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2006; 442: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). This model suggests that the propagation of prion variants can be explained by differences in the rate of fiber growth and sensitivity to shearing. Because the addition of new protein appears to occur on fiber ends (30Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e321Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 31Scheibel T. Kowal A.S. Bloom J.D. Lindquist S.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 366-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it follows that the most efficient propagation requires more free ends to template the addition of new protein. Thus, more free ends may relate to a faster rate of aggregation. The mechanism for prion variant generation has been proposed primarily based on work conducted using Sup35NM and the [PSI+] prion. prion-forming domain transmission electron microscope [RNQ+] reporter protein guanidine hydrochloride thioflavin-T relative fluorescence units richmedia. Two other prions in yeast, [URE3] and [RNQ+], have also been reported to display variant phenotypes (32Schlumpberger M. Prusiner S.B. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Edskes H.K. McCann L.M. Hebert A.M. Wickner R.B. Genetics. 2009; 181: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The [URE3] prion in S. cerevisiae is propagated by the Ure2 protein (16Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Recombinant Ure2p can form fibers in vitro and when transformed into yeast can induce different variants of the [URE3] prion (33Edskes H.K. McCann L.M. Hebert A.M. Wickner R.B. Genetics. 2009; 181: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The [RNQ+] prion is caused by the aggregation of the Rnq1 protein (34Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the [rnq−] state, the Rnq1 protein has no known function. However, in the [RNQ+] state, aggregated Rnq1p facilitates the induction of the [PSI+] prion (35Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 36Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S.

Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [RNQ+] also exists as different variants (38Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that appear when recombinant Rnq1p fibers are transformed into yeast (39Patel B.K. Liebman S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the generation of specific [RNQ+] variants by altering the conditions of in vitro amyloid formation has not been investigated. As such, the physical basis for the generation of [URE3] and [RNQ+] variants has not been described and it remains to be determined if the properties described for [PSI+] variants can be generalized. We have taken advantage of the [RNQ+] reporter protein (RRP) previously described by our laboratory to phenotypically assess the [RNQ+] prion status as well as [RNQ+] variants (40Bardill J.P. True H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The RRP molecule is a chimeric protein with the proposed PFD of Rnq1p (amino acids 153–405) fused to the translation termination domain of Sup35p (the MC region, amino acids 124–685) (41Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Didichenko S.A. Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Smirnov V.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 42Vitrenko Y.A. Pavon M.E. Stone S.I. Liebman S.W. Curr. Genet. 2007; 51: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The RRP fusion presumably co-aggregates with Rnq1p in the [RNQ+] state, which results in prion-dependent nonsense suppression. As such, this provides a phenotypic assay for the [RNQ] state. This assay allowed us to detect both intragenic and extragenic effectors of [RNQ+] propagation (40Bardill J.P. True H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 43Bardill J.P. Dulle J.E. Fisher J.R. True H.L. Prion. 2009; 3: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We found that the level of nonsense suppression afforded by RRP changes with [RNQ+] prion variants, and this enables us to distinguish variants by phenotype. In this study, we created and characterized variants of the [RNQ+] prion by controlling conditions of fiber formation and transforming the fibers into yeast strains with Rnq1p in the non-prion state, [rnq−]. We show that the proposed PFD of Rnq1p forms amyloid fibers with distinct characteristics when generated in different conditions. Additionally, infection of these fibers into yeast induces different [RNQ+] prion variants in vivo. Each [RNQ+] variant maintains and propagates a unique set of characteristics in vivo and in vitro. Finally, our data suggest the existence of both similarities and differences between the mechanisms that dictate [RNQ+] and [PSI+] variant propagation. The pHis10-Rnq1PD (amino acids 132–405) construct (39Patel B.K. Liebman S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Resultant transformants were scraped to inoculate large cultures in CircleGrow medium, and the cells were grown to an A600 ∼0.6. The expression of Rnq1PFD was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h. The cells were harvested and incubated with agitation at room temperature for 1 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea (Buffer A, pH 8). The cells were then further lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by spinning at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Subsequently, the beads were packed in a column and washed with 25 column volumes (CV) Buffer A, pH 8. The beads were then washed successively with four CV each of Buffer A, pH 6.3 and Buffer A, pH 5.9, before eluting with Buffer A, pH 4.5. Rnq1p in the eluted fractions was verified for purity by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The fractions containing the protein were filtered through a 100-kD molecular mass cut off column (Amicon) and stored in methanol at −80 °C. Kinetic assays of fiber formation were done in a SpectraMax M2e fluorimeter microplate reader. Rnq1PFD fibers were diluted 75-fold from 7 m guanidine hydrochloride to a concentration of 4 μm in FFB buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KPO4, 2 m urea, pH 7.4) with 50-fold molar excess Thioflavin-T to initiate fiber formation in the presence of glass beads for agitation. The change in Thioflavin-T fluorescence over time was measured using an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and emission wavelength of 481 nm. The plate was agitated each minute prior to reading for 10 s. Fibers were also formed in a rotator (end-over-end) at a monomer concentration of 4 μm for thermostability assays and to obtain seeds for seeding experiments. For the seeded experiments, the fibers were seeded using 5% (w/w) seed. Pre-formed fibers were treated with 2% SDS for 5 min at different temperatures (gradient from 55 to 95 °C, with 5–7 °C increments). The treated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using an anti-Rnq1p antibody. The bands were quantified using ImageJ software and values were normalized to the 95 °C band. Results were plotted using Origin 6.1 statistical software. Samples of fibrillar Rnq1PFD were allowed to settle onto freshly glow-discharged 200 mesh carbon-formvar coated copper grids for 10 min. Grids were then rinsed twice with water and stained with 1% uranyl acetate (Ted Pella) for 1 min. Samples were viewed on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA). Transformation of Rnq1PFD fibers into a [rnq−] 74-D694 (ade1-14, ura3-52, leu2-3,112, trp1-289, his3-200, sup35::RRP) yeast strain was conducted as described (44Tanaka M. Weissman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 412: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The resulting colonies were replica plated onto rich medium (YPD) plates to assay for colony color. Colonies that appeared to have acquired the prion state by nonsense suppression were picked and spotted on YPD, YPD containing 3 mm GdnHCl and SD-ade for phenotypic analyses. Three independent protein transformants for each of the [RNQ+] prion variants were grown in liquid YPD medium overnight (∼16 h) to an A600 of ∼2.0. The cultures were diluted 8,000-fold in water and 250 μl were plated on 13-cm (diameter) YPD plates. Approximately 750 colonies for each transformant and a total of >2,000 colonies were counted for each variant. The average and standard deviation is reported for each variant. The percentage of cells that lost the prion was calculated by dividing the number of red cells by the total number of cells. The loss of the [RNQ+] prion was confirmed by Rnq1p solubility assays for 10 representative colonies of each variant. Yeast strains containing the [RNQ+] prion were transformed with pEMBL-SUP2 (41Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Didichenko S.A. Chernoff Y.O. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Smirnov V.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and plated on SD-ura. Transformants were grown in selective medium to an A600 of ∼1.6 and plated on YPD. After 5 days of growth, [PSI+] cells were counted as any cell with a light pink sector. Representative colonies were checked for curing by transient growth on medium containing 3 mm GdnHCl. The protocol was adapted from previously published work (34Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast cells were lysed in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5% dithiothreitol, 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 3 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and EDTA-free complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Lysis was performed by vortexing with glass beads. Following lysis, an equal volume of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) was added to the lysate, and cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 3,300 × g for 15 s. A portion of this cleared lysate was saved for the total protein sample. Aggregated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 80,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor for 30 min. The supernatant containing the soluble protein was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in a 1:1 mix of lysis buffer and RIPA buffer. The total, supernatant, and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with an anti-Rnq1p antibody. We purified recombinant Rnq1PFD in 8 m urea as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified Rnq1PFD protein formed amyloid fibers when diluted out of denaturant. The length of the lag phase of fiber formation is a parameter that can be used to measure the ability of the protein to aggregate and is one determinant for prion variant formation; a longer lag phase indicates a reduced ability to aggregate. In order to create [RNQ+] prion variants, we used different temperatures to generate structural variation in the fibers of Rnq1PFD. We followed fiber formation of Rnq1PFD at 25 and 37 °C using a Thioflavin-T fluorescence assay. At 25 °C, Rnq1PFD fibers had a lag phase of ∼470 min followed by a logarithmic growth phase (Fig. 1A). In contrast, fiber formation of Rnq1PFD at 37 °C had a shorter lag phase of ∼300 min. The ability of seeds to enhance the conversion of monomeric protein into fibers is an important feature of nucleated conformational conversion for amyloid fiber formation (45Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). We formed Rnq1PFD fibers at 25 and 37 °C and tested the ability of the fibers to act as seeds and template the addition of freshly diluted monomeric Rnq1PFD. Interestingly, even though Rnq1PFD fiber formation occurs with a shorter lag phase at 37 °C, the seeds obtained from fibers formed at 25 °C were more efficient at templating new fiber formation at both 25 and 37 °C (Fig. 1, B and C). Seeds obtained from fibers formed at 37 °C also enhanced fiber formation reactions but were less efficient at seeding Rnq1PFD monomer at either temperature (Fig. 1, B and C). Prion proteins in yeast can maintain different variants of the prion state that are a consequence of different self-propagating structures (46Perrett S. Jones G.W. Curr. Opin. Struct Biol. 2008; 18: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The variants differ from each other based on their phenotype, the ratio of soluble to aggregated protein, and their ability to maintain and propagate the prion (23Uptain S.M. Sawicki G.J. Caughey B. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Derkatch I.L. Chernoff Y.O. Kushnirov V.V. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W.

Variants of the [RNQ+] prion have also been characterized in vivo and display different abilities to induce the [PSI+] prion (38Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 49Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these variants arose spontaneously and were originally referred to as [PIN+] strains for [PSI+] inducibility (37Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Masse S.V. Zadorsky S.P. Polozkov G.V. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additionally, some variants of [PIN+] were acquired when fibers of Rnq1PFD were transformed into [rnq−] yeast, but these were not characterized (39Patel B.K. Liebman S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Characterization of [RNQ+] variants has been limited since the only methods to assay the [RNQ+]/[PIN+] status of yeast cells involved either [PSI+] induction or Rnq1p solubility assays. In our laboratory, we have been able to circumvent some of these tedious procedures by taking advantage of the previously described RRP ([RNQ+] Reporter Protein), which enables the use of a colony color assay to determine the presence of different prion variants of [RNQ+]. We found that RRP not only reported on the presence of the [RNQ+] prion, but also showed changes in phenotype depending on the [RNQ+]/[PIN+] variant ((40Bardill J.P. True H.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2A). High [PIN+] and [pin−] are readily discernible from low [PIN+] and medium [PIN+] when RRP-expressing strains are grown on nutrient-rich medium. Low [PIN+] and medium [PIN+] strains are phenotypically similar to each other in this assay. To create [RNQ+] variants for characterization, we first asked whether amyloid fibers of Rnq1PFD formed at different temperatures corresponded to the generation of different prion variants, as previously observed with Sup35NM and [PSI+] (48Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 51Chien P. DePace A.H. Collins S.R. Weissman J.S.

We transformed [rnq−] 74-D694 cells expressing both wild-type RNQ1 and the RRP chimeric protein with amyloid fibers of recombinant Rnq1PFD formed at 18, 25, and 37 °C. Transformants were picked, diluted, and spotted on plates to assess phenotype. We scored the transformants that turned white, light pink, or dark pink as strong, medium, or weak [RNQ+] variants, respectively (Fig. 2B and Table 1). We also correlated the colony color phenotype of the variants to their growth on medium lacking adenine (SD-ade). Transformants were also grown on medium containing guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), which inactivates Hsp104 (52Ferreira P.C. Ness F. Edwards S.R. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. Mol.

[RNQ+] variants were verified for curability on medium containing GdnHCl using color as an indicator of change in nonsense suppression. [RNQ+] RRP strains converted from either white or pink to red, and the cured strains remained red upon removal from medium containing GdnHCl. Rnq1PFD fibers formed at 18 °C only induced strong and medium variants of [RNQ+] when transformed into [rnq−] cells (Table 1). Fibers formed at 25 °C induced weak, medium, and strong [RNQ+] variants when transformed into [rnq−] cells. In contrast, cells infected with fibers formed at 37 °C yielded primarily medium and weak [RNQ+] variants and very few strong [RNQ+] variants. These data suggest that the temperature at which fibers were formed in vitro influenced the distribution of [RNQ+] variants propagated in cells. Specifically, increasing the temperature decreased the fraction of strong [RNQ+] variants and increased the weak variants of [RNQ+].TABLE 1Distribution of [RNQ+] prion variantsDistribution of [RNQ+] variantsWeakMediumStrong18 °C0257525 °C15463937 °C29683 Open table in a new tab In the case of Sup35NM and the [PSI+] prion, weaker variants have a longer amyloid core and stronger variants have a shorter amyloid core (25Krishnan R.

Additionally, the more stable amyloid fibers with a longer core propagate weaker prion variants while less stable fibers with a shorter core propagate stronger prion variants.

https://openalex.org/W2117433002,"Lysine methylation is one of the most common protein modifications. Although lysine methylation of histones has been extensively studied and linked to gene regulation, that of non-histone proteins remains incompletely understood. Here, we show a novel regulatory role of ribosomal protein methylation. Using an in vitro methyltransferase assay, we found that Schizosaccharomyces pombe Set13, a SET domain protein encoded by SPAC688.14, specifically methylates lysine 55 of ribosomal protein L42 (Rpl42). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that endogenous Rpl42 is monomethylated at lysine 55 in wild-type S. pombe cells and that the methylation is lost in Delta set13 mutant cells. Delta set13 and Rpl42 methylation-deficient mutant S. pombe cells showed higher cycloheximide sensitivity and defects in stress-responsive growth control compared with wild type. Genetic analyses suggested that the abnormal growth phenotype was distinct from the conserved stress-responsive pathway that modulates translation initiation. Furthermore, the Rpl42 methylation-deficient mutant cells showed a reduced ability to survive after entering stationary phase. These results suggest that Rpl42 methylation plays direct roles in ribosomal function and cell proliferation control independently of the general stress-response pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2000939882,"Scytalidoglutamic peptidase (SGP) is the prototype of fungal glutamic peptidases that are characteristically pepstatin insensitive. These enzymes have a unique catalytic dyad comprised of Gln(53) and Glu(136) that activate a bound water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile peptide bond. The hydrolysis by SGP at peptide bonds with proline in the P(1)' position is a rare event among peptidases that we investigated using the series of fluorescence resonance energy transfer peptides, Abz-KLXPSKQ-EDDnp, compared with the series Abz-KLXSSKQ-EDDnp. The preference observed in these two series for Phe and His over Leu, Ile, Val, Arg, and Lys, seems to be related to the structure of the S(1) subsite of SGP. These results and the pH profiles of SGP activity showed that its S(1) subsite can accommodate the benzyl group of Phe at pH 4 as well as the positively charged imidazolium group of His. In the pH range 2 to 7, SGP maintains its structure and activity, but at pH 8 or higher it is irreversibly denatured. The intrinsic fluorescence of the Trp residues of SGP were sensitive to the titration of carboxyl groups having low pK values; this can be attributed to the buried Asp(57) and/or Asp(43) as described in SGP three-dimensional structure. The solvent kinetic isotope effects and the proton inventory experiments support a mechanism for the glutamic peptidase SGP that involves the nucleophilic attack of the general base (Glu(136)) activated water, and establish a fundamental role of the S(1) subsite interactions in promoting catalysis."

IntroductionLysosomal enzymes are responsible for the catabolism of metabolic products in the cell. Deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes lead to lysosomal storage diseases, characterized by an accumulation of undegraded substrates in the lysosome. In humans, there are at least 40 different lysosomal storage diseases (including, for example, Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff, Gaucher, and Fabry diseases), each of which is caused by a lack of a specific enzymatic activity. Fabry disease is caused by a defect in the GLA gene, leading to loss of activity in the enzyme α-galactosidase (α-GAL, 3The abbreviations used are: α-GALα-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22)α-NAGALα-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49)Gb3globotriaosylceramidepNP-α-Galpara-nitrophenyl-α-galactosepNP-α-GalNAcpara-nitrophenyl-α-N-acetylgalactosaminer.m.s.d.root mean square deviation.

McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3733-3774Google Scholar). The α-GAL enzyme cleaves substrates containing terminal α-galactosides, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, and polysaccharides. Defects in the GLA gene in Fabry patients lead to the accumulation of unprocessed neutral substrates (primarily globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)), which then leads to the progressive deterioration of multiple organ systems and premature death. Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disorder with an estimated prevalence of ∼1 in 40,000 male births but may be highly underdiagnosed (1Desnick R.J. Ioannou Y.A. Eng C.M. Scriver C.R.

The two genes are derived from a common ancestor (4Wang A.M. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21859-21866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), encoding proteins that share 46% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1A); they belong to glycoside hydrolase family 27 and clan D (5Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4032) Google Scholar). The α-NAGAL enzyme recognizes and cleaves substrates containing terminal α-N-acetylgalactosaminide (α-GalNAc) sugars, and (less efficiently) substrates containing terminal α-galactosides. Defects in the NAGA gene lead to the lysosomal storage disease Schindler disease, characterized by the accumulation of glycolipids and glycopeptides, resulting in a wide range of symptoms, including neurological, skin, and cardiac anomalies (3Desnick R.J.

One problem with this treatment is that up to 88% of patients develop IgG antibodies against the injected recombinant enzyme (6Eng C.M. Guffon N. Wilcox W.R. Germain D.P. Lee P. Waldek S. Caplan L.

Transplant. 2006; 21: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In patients who make no functional α-GAL enzyme, the recombinant α-GAL used in enzyme replacement therapy can be treated as a foreign antigen. Because the GLA gene is located on the X-chromosome, hemizygous males who inherit a non-functional copy of the gene have no second copy to establish immunotolerance.Previously, we determined the three-dimensional crystallographic structures of the human α-GAL and α-NAGAL enzymes (9Garman S.C. Garboczi D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 10Clark N.E. Garman S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As expected for two structures that share 46% sequence identity, the overall folds of the two enzymes are similar (Fig. 1, B and C). Each enzyme is a dimer where each monomer contains an N-terminal (β/α)8 barrel with the active site and a C-terminal antiparallel β domain. The monomers of the two enzymes superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.90 Å for 378 α carbons. The active sites of the two structures are highly similar, as 11 of the 13 active site residues are conserved. The only differences in the active sites of the two structures correspond to where the substrates are different: in α-GAL, the residues near the 2-OH on the substrate include larger glutamate and leucine, whereas in α-NAGAL, the larger 2-N-acetyl on the substrate interacts with the smaller serine and alanine residues on the enzyme (Fig. 1, B and C). As we and others have noted, in glycoside hydrolase family 27, the two residues primarily responsible for recognition of the 2-position of the ligand are both located on the same loop in the structure, the β5–α5 loop in the (β/α)8 barrel domain (9Garman S.C. Garboczi D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 10Clark N.E. Garman S.C. J. Mol.

Garboczi D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 14Tajima Y. Kawashima I. Tsukimura T. Sugawara K. Kuroda M. Suzuki T. Togawa T. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Ohno K.

We replaced two residues in the active site of α-GAL (E203S and L206A), leading to a new protein (α-GALSA) with the enzymatic specificity of an α-NAGAL enzyme. Additionally, we replaced two residues in the active site of α-NAGAL (S188E and A191L), leading to a new protein (α-NAGALEL) with the enzymatic specificity of an α-GAL enzyme. In this report, we show that the designed enzymes maintain the antigenicity of the original protein, but have the specificity of the other enzyme. X-ray crystallographic studies of the α-GALSA protein provide a structural basis for ligand specificity in the family of proteins.DISCUSSIONThe active site of human α-GAL is unable to accommodate 2-N-acetylated ligands due to steric clashes between the protein and the N-acetyl group on the ligand. Here, we have engineered α-GALSA, the first α-GAL enzyme capable of binding α-GalNAc ligands. In the reciprocal experiment, the engineered α-NAGALEL enzyme has lost all of its activity against α-GalNAc ligands and has enhanced activity against α-galactosides.Enzyme Replacement TherapyEnzyme replacement therapy can successfully treat Fabry disease. However, up to 88% of male patients develop an immune response to the injected recombinant enzyme, including both IgG- and IgE-based reactions (6Eng C.M. Guffon N. Wilcox W.R. Germain D.P. Lee P. Waldek S. Caplan L. Linthorst G.E. Desnick R.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar, 8Schiffmann R. Ries M. Timmons M. Flaherty J.T. Brady R.O. Nephrol. Dial.

Med. 2008; 10: 353-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The antigenicity of the glycoproteins used in enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease patients might limit the effectiveness of the treatment by reducing the amount of enzyme effectively delivered to the lysosomes. We envision the α-NAGALEL molecule would have little immunogenicity in Fabry disease patients (who make typical amounts α-NAGAL glycoprotein and are thus immunologically tolerant toward α-NAGAL). Consistent with this, heterozygous female Fabry disease patients (with one wild-type copy of the GLA gene) do not make the comparable immune responses as their hemizygous male counterparts against injected enzyme during enzyme replacement therapy (24Vedder A.C. Breunig F. Donker-Koopman W.E. Mills K. Young E. Winchester B. Ten Berge I.J. Groener J.E. Aerts J.M. Wanner C. Hollak C.E. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2008; 94: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Bénichou B. Goyal S. Sung C. Norfleet A.M. O'Brien F. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2009; 96: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Although patients with the severe form of Fabry disease have little or no α-GAL enzyme activity, patients with the variant forms of Fabry disease can have from 5 to 35% of wild-type enzyme activity (26Mayes J.S. Scheerer J.B. Sifers R.N. Donaldson M.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1981; 112: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 27Ries M. Gupta S. Moore D.F. Sachdev V. Quirk J.M. Murray G.J. Rosing D.R. Robinson C. Schaefer E. Gal A. Dambrosia J.M. Garman S.C. Brady R.O. Schiffmann R. Pediatrics. 2005; 115: e344-e355Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This suggests that the threshold level of α-GAL enzymatic activity necessary to prevent Fabry disease symptoms is <100% wild-type activity. Although the enzymatic activity of the engineered proteins is lower than their wild-type equivalents, in enzyme replacement therapy, the reduced immunogenicity of the designed proteins might compensate for their reduced activity.Sakuraba and colleagues have also tested this hypothesis by reporting a protein similar in design to α-NAGALEL, but expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, leading to a different glycosylation pattern (14Tajima Y. Kawashima I. Tsukimura T. Sugawara K. Kuroda M. Suzuki T. Togawa T. Chiba Y. Jigami Y. Ohno K. Fukushige T. Kanekura T. Itoh K. Ohashi T. Sakuraba H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2009; 85: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When injected in a mouse model of Fabry disease, the mammalian-expressed protein led to a reduction in the amount of Gb3 in the tissues of the mouse. This further suggests that the designed enzyme might act as a useful tool for the treatment of Fabry disease.Properties of the Engineered EnzymesWestern blotting with anti-α-GAL and anti-α-NAGAL antibodies shows that the former reacts only with α-GAL and α-GALSA, whereas the latter reacts only with α-NAGAL and α-NAGALEL. The sequence divergence between α-GAL and α-NAGAL is sufficient to show no immunological cross-reactivity. Thus, engineering the active sites of α-GAL and α-NAGAL to have novel substrate specificities leads to new enzyme activities without altering antigenicity. This approach may be useful as a general strategy for protein-based therapeutics where reducing immunogenicity is an issue, such as Gaucher disease, where 15% of patients on enzyme replacement therapy develop IgG antibodies to the recombinant enzyme (28Starzyk K. Richards S. Yee J. Smith S.E. Kingma W. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2007; 90: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).The diverse sequences in glycoside hydrolase family 27 (which includes human α-GAL and α-NAGAL) show high conservation of the active site residues, indicating strong evolutionary pressure on the active site. One modular component of ligand binding in the family is the recognition of the 2-position of the sugar ring. In this family, a single loop on the protein, the β5–α5 loop in the N-terminal domain, interacts with the substituent on the 2-position of the sugar. The similarity across the members of the family allowed us to interconvert the ligand recognition through substitution of two residues in the loop. The modularity of the loop is also seen in the structures of other members of the family, including the rice and Hypocrea jecorina α-GAL structures, where one turn of helix in the β5–α5 loop is replaced with a shorter loop and a longer β5 strand (12Fujimoto Z. Kaneko S. Momma M. Kobayashi H. Mizuno H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20313-20318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Golubev A.M. Nagem R.A. Brandão Neto J.R.

In those structures, Cys and Trp residues fill the space of the Glu-203 and Leu-206 residue of α-GAL or the Ser-188 and Ala-191 residues in α-NAGAL.The newly engineered enzymes α-GALSA and α-NAGALEL are not as catalytically efficient as their wild-type equivalents. The structures of α-GALSA suggest that there is considerably more flexibility in the active site of the α-GALSA enzyme when compared with α-NAGAL, the enzyme with an identical active site constellation.The glycerol-soaked structures of α-GALSA provide a structural explanation for the reduced catalytic efficiency of the engineered enzyme. When the larger Glu-203 and Leu-206 residues of α-GAL are replaced with smaller Ser and Ala residues in α-GALSA, the active site has more open space in it. This allows the Arg-227 side chain to move toward the space vacated by the shortening of the Glu-203 side chain, and the β6–α6 loop containing Asp-231 moves toward the space vacated by the shortening of the Leu-206 side chain. The crystal structures indicate that the active site of α-GALSA is more dynamic than the active sites of the wild-type enzymes α-GAL and α-NAGAL, which might explain the reduced catalytic efficiency of the designed α-GALSA enzyme. Another indication of the higher mobility of the active site of α-GALSA appears in the glycerol-soaked α-GALSA structure, which has higher atomic B-factors in the rearranged β6–α6 loop.In this report, we describe the first instance of bidirectional interconversion of the enzymatic activities of two human lysosomal enzymes. Rational design of enzymatic function is a challenging task and generally requires large changes in the active site: for example, the classic case of conversion of trypsin activity into that of chymotrypsin required 11 substitutions in 4 sites on the protein (30Perona J.J. Hedstrom L. Rutter W.J. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In general, changing substrate specificity is easier than changing the reaction mechanism of an enzyme (31Toscano M.D. Woycechowsky K.J. Hilvert D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 3212-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The family of lysosomal glycosidases might prove to be a fruitful target for further enzyme engineering, because many glycosidases use a similar mechanism with an arrangement of two carboxylates located on opposite sides of the glycosidic linkage to be cleaved.In conclusion, we have shown the viability of a rational design approach to engineering new functionality into human lysosomal enzymes. This approach allows for encoding new enzymatic functions into existing protein scaffolds. By reusing existing proteins in new ways, our approach avoids the immunogenicity problems that are frequently seen in enzyme replacement therapies. This approach might also be used for a wide range of protein-based therapeutics when immunogenicity problems exist. IntroductionLysosomal enzymes are responsible for the catabolism of metabolic products in the cell. Deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes lead to lysosomal storage diseases, characterized by an accumulation of undegraded substrates in the lysosome.

One problem with this treatment is that up to 88% of patients develop IgG antibodies against the injected recombinant enzyme (6Eng C.M. Guffon N. Wilcox W.R. Germain D.P. Lee P. Waldek S. Caplan L.

In patients who make no functional α-GAL enzyme, the recombinant α-GAL used in enzyme replacement therapy can be treated as a foreign antigen. Because the GLA gene is located on the X-chromosome, hemizygous males who inherit a non-functional copy of the gene have no second copy to establish immunotolerance.Previously, we determined the three-dimensional crystallographic structures of the human α-GAL and α-NAGAL enzymes (9Garman S.C. Garboczi D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 10Clark N.E. Garman S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 393: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As expected for two structures that share 46% sequence identity, the overall folds of the two enzymes are similar (Fig. 1, B and C). Each enzyme is a dimer where each monomer contains an N-terminal (β/α)8 barrel with the active site and a C-terminal antiparallel β domain. The monomers of the two enzymes superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.90 Å for 378 α carbons. The active sites of the two structures are highly similar, as 11 of the 13 active site residues are conserved. The only differences in the active sites of the two structures correspond to where the substrates are different: in α-GAL, the residues near the 2-OH on the substrate include larger glutamate and leucine, whereas in α-NAGAL, the larger 2-N-acetyl on the substrate interacts with the smaller serine and alanine residues on the enzyme (Fig. 1, B and C). As we and others have noted, in glycoside hydrolase family 27, the two residues primarily responsible for recognition of the 2-position of the ligand are both located on the same loop in the structure, the β5–α5 loop in the (β/α)8 barrel domain (9Garman S.C.

We replaced two residues in the active site of α-GAL (E203S and L206A), leading to a new protein (α-GALSA) with the enzymatic specificity of an α-NAGAL enzyme. Additionally, we replaced two residues in the active site of α-NAGAL (S188E and A191L), leading to a new protein (α-NAGALEL) with the enzymatic specificity of an α-GAL enzyme. In this report, we show that the designed enzymes maintain the antigenicity of the original protein, but have the specificity of the other enzyme. X-ray crystallographic studies of the α-GALSA protein provide a structural basis for ligand specificity in the family of proteins. Lysosomal enzymes are responsible for the catabolism of metabolic products in the cell. Deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes lead to lysosomal storage diseases, characterized by an accumulation of undegraded substrates in the lysosome. In humans, there are at least 40 different lysosomal storage diseases (including, for example, Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff, Gaucher, and Fabry diseases), each of which is caused by a lack of a specific enzymatic activity. Fabry disease is caused by a defect in the GLA gene, leading to loss of activity in the enzyme α-galactosidase (α-GAL, 3The abbreviations used are: α-GALα-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22)α-NAGALα-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49)Gb3globotriaosylceramidepNP-α-Galpara-nitrophenyl-α-galactosepNP-α-GalNAcpara-nitrophenyl-α-N-acetylgalactosaminer.m.s.d.root mean square deviation.

Defects in the GLA gene in Fabry patients lead to the accumulation of unprocessed neutral substrates (primarily globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)), which then leads to the progressive deterioration of multiple organ systems and premature death. Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disorder with an estimated prevalence of ∼1 in 40,000 male births but may be highly underdiagnosed (1Desnick R.J. Ioannou Y.A. Eng C.M. Scriver C.R.

https://openalex.org/W2062456780,"Three-dimensional structures of β2-microglobulin (β2m) from chicken and various mammals have been described previously, but aside from genomic sequences, very little is known about the three-dimensional structures of β2m in species other than warm-blooded vertebrates. Here, we present the first three-dimensional structure of β2m from bony fish grass carp (Ctid-β2m), resolved at 2.1 Å. The key structural differences between this new structure and previously published structures are two new hydrogen bonds at positions Ile37 and Glu38 in strand C and Lys66 in strand E, and a hydrophobic pocket around the center of the protein found in Ctid-β2m. Importantly, Ctid-β2m has a short D strand and a long loop between stands C and D, rather than the flexible region found in other β2m structures that serves as a putative binding region for the major histocompatibility complex heavy chain. Comparing the Ctid-β2m structure with those of bovine and human β2ms, the Cα root mean square deviation of the latter are 1.3 Å and 1.8 Å, respectively. Compared with the constant domains of Lamprey T cell receptor-like receptor (Lamp-TCRLC) and Amphioxus V and C domain-bearing protein (Amphi-VCPC), Ctid-β2m exhibits very different topology. The three-dimensional structures of domains predicted from Amphi-VCPC/Lamp-TCRLC are distinctly lacking in strand A of β2ms. There are 18 amino acids at the N terminus of Amphi-VCPC that may have evolved into strand A of β2ms. A mutation in the BC loops of Amphi-VCPC may have led to the novel topology found in β2m. Based on these results, Ctid-β2m may well reflect evolutionary characteristics of ancestral C set molecules.

Many protein molecules possessing the IgSF C domain exist in numerous organisms, but only two forms have been discovered in the immune system. One form is composed of IgSF domains, comprising the B cell receptor, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the T cell receptor (TCR), in which IgSF C is combined with the IgSF variable (V) domain (3.Hernández Prada J.A.

The other form consists of independent molecules, such as the β2m molecules (4.Trinh C.H. Smith D.P. Kalverda A.P. Phillips S.E. Radford S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Both forms, including dependent and independent molecules, play important roles in the adaptive immune system. β2m is a functional molecule that noncovalently associates with MHC class I molecules to stabilize their heavy chain three-dimensional structure, which is required to bind foreign antigen peptides and to facilitate T helper lymphocyte, cytotoxic T lymphocyte, and natural killer cells during the immune response (6.Bjorkman P.J.

The known β2m structures are composed of 99 mature residues with a seven-stranded β-sandwich fold and thus belong to the typical IgSF C1 set of molecules. In the reported three-dimensional structures of β2m, strands A, B, and E comprise one β-sheet; strands C, F, and G form the second β-sheet; and the D strand runs between the layers. A central disulfide bond, bridging Cys25 and Cys80 on the B and F stands, respectively, contributes to protein stability (14.Yu C. Dong M. Wu X. Li S. Huang S. Su J. Wei J. Shen Y. Mou C. Xie X. Lin J. Yuan S. Yu X. Yu Y. Du J. Zhang S. Peng X. Xiang M. Xu A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The D strand is divided by a two-residue β-bulge into two short two-residue β-strands (D1 and D2). This β-bulge has been found in all solved β2m structures and is considered a common feature of β-sheet proteins. The loss of the β-bulge, together with changes in the positions of three residues in the CD loop linking the C and D strands, results in the formation of a new continuous six-residue β-sheet. Structural rearrangements of the D strand by a possible edge-to-edge mechanism have been implicated in human β2m amyloidosis (12.Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the IgSF C domains are not only highly conserved in B cell receptor, TCR, and MHC class I and II but also appear in FcγR I, CD2, CD4, and CD8; the C domain has even been found in lower animals, such as in the lamprey TCR-like receptor (Lamp-TCRLC) and in the Amphioxus V and C domain-bearing protein (Amphi-VCPC) (13.Pancer Z.

However, it generally has been believed that the β2ms emerged suddenly in the antigen presentation system of the adaptive immune system and are present only in jawed vertebrates. Very little is known about the three-dimensional structure of β2m in the early vertebrate bony fishes, and, therefore, its evolutionary origin cannot be explained adequately. Fish β2m genes were first reported by Ono and co-workers (15.Ono H. Figueroa F. O'hUigin C. Klein J. Immunogenetics. 1993; 38: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Dixon et al. in 1993 (16.Dixon B. Stet R.J. van Erp S.H. Pohajdak B. Immunogenetics. 1993; 38: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To date, β2m genes have been reported in 16 fish species, including grass carp (17.Hao H.F. Yang T.Y. Yan R.Q. Gao F.S. Xia C. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2006; 20: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), zebrafish (15.Ono H. Figueroa F. O'hUigin C. Klein J.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), channel catfish (18.Criscitiello M.F. Benedetto R. Antao A. Wilson M.R. Chinchar V.G. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. McConnell T.J.

Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Research has demonstrated that the 116 amino acids encoded by the fish β2m genes (except for in sturgeon) are three residues shorter than those of humans, mammals, and chickens. Fish β2m genes have a number of unique characteristics that are not shared by their mammalian homologues, such as a deletion of two amino acids in the mature protein and a single N-linked glycosylation site in grass carp (17.Hao H.F. Yang T.Y. Yan R.Q. Gao F.S. Xia C. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2006; 20: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and catfish (18.Criscitiello M.F. Benedetto R. Antao A. Wilson M.R. Chinchar V.G. Miller N.W. Clem L.W. McConnell T.J. Immunogenetics. 1998; 48: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, as first discovered in rainbow trout, the fish β2m locus consists of three linked genes: two similar expressed genes and one gene that is incomplete and not expressed (9.Magor K.E. Shum B.P. Parham P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have reported previously a representative bony fish grass carp β2m (Ctid-β2m) gene (17.Hao H.F. Yang T.Y. Yan R.Q. Gao F.S. Xia C. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2006; 20: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we resolved the first three-dimensional structure of Ctid-β2m at 2.1 Å. Ctid-β2m closely resembles the previously described human and bovine monomeric β2m structures, with some significant variations. Two new hydrogen bonds and a hydrophobic pocket were found in Ctid-β2m. In particular, the structure of Ctid-β2m revealed an unusually flexible conformation in the region of the CD loop. This β2m structure highlights the evolutionary propensity toward stability with the existence of an unusually flexible CD loop in bony fish. Because fish β2m is evidently the evolutionary turning point of the IgSF C set of molecules, the three-dimensional structures of Lamp-TCRLC and Amphi-VCPC were predicted, and their topologies were compared with that of Ctid-β2m. Based on the structures presented here, Ctid-β2m may well reflect evolutionary characteristics tracing back to ancestral C-set molecules. The Ctid-β2m gene was amplified from the plasmid p2X-Ctid-β2m, which was constructed previously by our research group using PCR (21.Chen W. Chu F. Peng H. Zhang J. Qi J. Jiang F. Xia C. Gao F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains a unique NdeI restriction site, a stop codon and a unique XhoI restriction site (21.Chen W. Chu F. Peng H. Zhang J. Qi J. Jiang F. Xia C. Gao F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect F Struct.

The products were ligated into a pET21a vector (Novagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The recombinant proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies, which were then lysed using a sonicator and centrifuged at 2,000 × g. The pellet was washed three times with a solution containing Triton X-100 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then once with the same solution without Triton X-100. The inclusion body was dissolved overnight in urea buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerine, 10 mm dithiothreitol) using ∼1 ml of urea buffer per 30 mg of protein. The Ctid-β2m was refolded by the gradual dilution method using the following refolding buffer: 100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 400 mm l-arginine-HCl, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm NaN3, pH 8.0. After stirring for 48 h at 4 °C, the remaining soluble proteins were concentrated and purified using a Superdex G-200 (Amersham Biosciences) size-exclusion column followed by Resource-Q (Amersham Biosciences) ion-exchange chromatography (21.Chen W.

The purified Ctid-β2m was adjusted to a concentration of 10 mg/ml with crystallization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl). An initial crystallization trial was set up with Crystal Screens I and II (Hampton Research) at 18 °C using the hanging drop method. The drop, containing equal volumes (1 μl each) of protein solution and reservoir crystallization buffer, was placed over a well containing 200 μl of reservoir solution using VDX plates. Crystals suitable for data collection were grown in 3–5 days under optimized conditions using 0.1 m MES pH 6.5, 12% polyethylene glycol 20000, 3% (v/v) ethanol, and a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. For data collection, the crystals were soaked for several minutes in reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant and then flash cooled directly in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.1 Å resolution on a Rigaku MicroMax007 rotating-anode x-ray generator operated at 40 kV and 20 mA (CuKα; λ = 1.5418 Å) equipped with an R-AXIS VII2+ image plate detector.

Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Although fusion molecules, including the IgSF C domain, exist widely in the adaptive immune system, only two proteins, Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC, were predicted to possess the IgSF C domain in jawless vertebrates and protochordates (13.Pancer Z. Mayer W.E. Klein J. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13273-13278Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14.Yu C. Dong M. Wu X. Li S. Huang S. Su J. Wei J. Shen Y. Mou C.

Because the three-dimensional structures of Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC are not yet available, but are necessary to determine the evolutionary origin of the IgSF C set, the three-dimensional structures of Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC were predicted by amino acid homology modeling using the SWISS-MODEL server based on the existing three-dimensional structures of ligand binding protein (Lingo-1) (PDB code 2ID5) and T cell surface glycoprotein CD4 (PDB code 2NY4) in the Protein Data Bank. DNAMAN was used to analyze the differences among these molecules and the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (DeLano Scientific) was used for figure preparation. The mature Ctid-β2m contains 97 amino acids (compared with 99 for human and mice). As expected, the Cα root mean square deviation of Ctid-β2m (PDB code 3GBL) is 1.3 and 1.8 Å, similar to values for the structures of monomer bovine β2m (PDB code 1BMG) and human β2m (PDB code 1LDS). The chains are folded into a typical “β-barrel” configuration dominated by two antiparallel pleated sheets; one sheet is composed of four strands, and the other sheet is composed of three strands (Fig. 1A). The Ctid-β2m structure is composed of two face-to-face β-sheets of different sizes: the “large β-sheet” is composed of strands A (6–11 aa), B (21–28 aa), D (55–57 aa), and E (60–70 aa), and the “small β-sheet” is formed by strands C (36–41 aa), F (78–84 aa), and G (87–92 aa). Six loop regions (AB, BC, CD, CE, EF, and FG) connect these strands. The two β-sheets are linked by a Cys25-Cys80 disulfide bridge, which is highly conserved in all known β2ms and provides strong geometric constraints on the surrounding residues. A cluster of hydrophobic residues (Ile7, Ile9, and Tyr10 on strand A; Leu23, Ile24, Ytr26, and Val27 on strand B; Ile37, Leu39, and Leu40 on strand C; Phe54 on strand D; Trp69, Leu64, Thr65, Val68, and Ple70 on strand E; Typ78 and Val82 on strand F; and Thr88 and Val92 on strand G) that are likely to form a strong hydrophobic pocket is found on both the large and small β-sheets (Fig. 1B). An alignment of Ctid-β2m with zebrafish, trout, catfish, salmon, chicken, bovine, mouse, and human β2ms revealed 37 identical amino acids (38% homology). Without Ctid-β2m, 48 amino acids are identical among an alignment of the other β2ms (48% homology) (Fig. 2A). In Ctid-β2m, there are 20 amino acid residues that are distinct from the other homologues. These residues are randomly distributed throughout the β-sheets and loops. Previous studies have shown that most β2ms in teleosts are mature proteins composed of 97 amino acids. They have two amino acid deletions at positions 91 and 92, in which they differ from mammalian β2ms (9.Magor K.E. Shum B.P. Parham P. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17.Hao H.F. Yang T.Y. Yan R.Q. Gao F.S. Xia C. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2006; 20: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Compared with human β2m, it has been indicated that bovine monomeric β2m has an additional deletion at position 48 (28.Rosano C. Zuccotti S. Bolognesi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1753: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The function of the amino acid deletion is as yet unknown. The strands of Ctid-β2m are slightly different compared with previously described β2ms. Strand B spans residues 21–28, which is the same as in mouse β2m, whereas this strand in human β2m is composed of residues 21–30. Strand G is longer than in other described β2m structures. Because of the two amino acids deleted in Ctid-β2m at positions 91 and 92, loop FG is shorter than its human β2m counterpart (Fig. 2, B and C). Strand E is two amino acids longer than in human β2m and corresponds to residues 60–70 as opposed to 62–70 in human β2m. Compared with bovine and human β2ms, the total Cα root mean square deviation values of Ctid-β2m are 1.3 and 1.8Å, respectively, using the program DALI (Table 1). The main difference between Ctid-β2m and human β2m is found around the loops from His11 to Asn20 and from His83 to Lys86, which correspond to Arg13 to Phe23 and Asn84 to Lys92 in human β2m (PDB code 1LDS). Compared with bovine β2m, the loops in Ctid-β2m are different in sequence, from residue Glu56 to Trp59 and from His83 to Lys86, which correlate to Ser56 to Ser60 and Lys82 to Arg90 in bovine β2m (Fig. 2). Altogether, these data indicate small changes in β-sheet composition among different species. A total of ∼60 intramolecular hydrogen bonds (mostly main chain to main chain) stabilize the folded human β2m (28.Rosano C. Zuccotti S. Bolognesi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1753: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonds of Ctid-β2m between strands D and E are conserved, as compared with human β2m. Both human β2m and Ctid-β2m form hydrogen bonds. Ctid-β2m has hydrogen bonds between Gln50–Ser67, Thr52–Thr65, and Ala55–His63, whereas the corresponding bonds of human β2m are Glu50–Tyr67, Ser52–Leu65, and Ser55–Tyr63. Asp53 is highly conserved in all β2ms and forms significant hydrogen bonds to the heavy chain in the human HLA-β2m complex structure. In human β2m, Asp53 is located in the β-bulge and forms hydrogen bonds to Gln32, Arg35, and Arg48 in the α1 domain of the HLA heavy chain, whereas the counterpart residues in the grass carp heavy chain are Gln31, Tyr34, and Lys45. These three residues (Gln32, Arg35, and Arg48) are also highly conserved in Ctid-β2m. However, two new hydrogen bonds in Ctid-β2m appear between the directly adjacent C and E strands (Fig. 3A). Two hydrogen bonds are formed at positions Ile37 and Glu38 in strand C to integrate with Lys66 in strand E. A hydrogen atom from the ϵ-amino group of Lys and an oxygen atom provided by the carboxyl group of Ile formed one hydrogen bond. Another hydrogen bond was formed by the above mentioned hydrogen atom and an oxygen atom from the γ-carboxyl group of Glu. The lengths of these hydrogen bonds are 2.75 and 3.54 Å, respectively, whereas the distance between the two strands is 7.65 Å. Lys66 is a fish species-specific residue not present in mammalian and chicken β2ms, whereas Ile37 is highly conserved (Fig. 3B). The disulfide bond formed by residues Cys25 and Cys80 occurs between strands B and F and is highly conserved among all β2ms, including Ctid-β2m. The two new hydrogen bonds between strands C and D, which have not been found in any other resolved β2m structures, and the newly described hydrophobic pocket indicate a stable interaction between strands C and D in Ctid-β2m. The most structurally important part of the β2ms is strand D, which binds to the surface of the MHC heavy chain (6.Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar, 23.Chu F. Lou Z. Chen Y.W. Liu Y. Gao B. Zong L. Khan A.H. Bell J.I. Rao Z. Gao G.F. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Residues 50–56 (D1–D2 strands) interact with the heavy chain and are part of a region formed by two small strands. Residues Glu50–His51 comprise D1 and Ser55–Phe56 comprise D2. Between the D1–D2 strands, a noticeable β-bulge is formed by Asp53–Leu54 in the human structure (6.Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). The β-bulge is found in all β2m structures described to date, as well as in monomeric bovine β2m (5.Becker J.W. Reeke Jr., G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4225-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, strand D in Ctid-β2m starts at positions 55–57, and only a short β-sheet was observed. Ctid-β2m is different from human monomeric β2m in that a longer β-sheet begins at positions 51–56. Much attention has been paid to the short D strand region, which can be involved in contacts with the heavy chain. A rather flexible domain from the CD loop to the D strand was found in Ctid-β2m (Fig. 4). Thus, Ctid-β2m appears to form a relatively unusual flexible region, which contributes greatly to the instability of its MHC class I complex. In jawless vertebrates, Lamp-TCRLC possessing the IgSF C domain was found to have 20.7% identity with Ctid-β2m at the amino acid level (13.Pancer Z. Mayer W.E. Klein J. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13273-13278Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine the evolutionary origin of the IgSF C set, the three-dimensional structure of Lamp-TCRLC was predicted using amino acid homology modeling. Using the first approach mode in SWISS-MODEL, the three-dimensional structure of the Lingo-1 molecule (PDB code 2ID5; 29.Mosyak L. Wood A. Dwyer B. Buddha M. Johnson M. Aulabaugh A. Zhong X. Presman E. Benard S. Kelleher K. Wilhelm J. Stahl M.L. Kriz R. Gao Y. Cao Z. Ling H.P. Pangalos M.N. Walsh F.S. Somers W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36378-36390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was found to have 24.68% identity with the Lamp-TCRLC at the amino acid level. The Expect-value of the constructed Lamp-TCRLC three-dimensional structure is 2.20e−8. The three-dimensional structure of Lamp-TCRLC is composed of 76 residues (amino acids 19–94) that form a six-stranded β-sandwich fold (Fig. 5A), but it is not a typical IgSF C molecule. In the three-dimensional structure of Lamp-TCRLC, strands A (20–24 aa) and C (56–59 aa) comprise one β-sheet, whereas strands B (34–38 aa), E (73–81 aa), and F (84–92 aa) form the second β-sheet, and strand D (66–69 aa) runs between the layers (Fig. 5B). A central disulfide bond between Cys25 and Cys76 on loop AB and strand E, respectively, may stabilize the protein. Strand D lies on top of the two β-sheets. Altogether, the topology of Lamp-TCRLC is very different from that of Ctid-β2m (Fig. 5C). In protochordates, only a single gene, which is referred to as Amphi-VCP, has been predicted to have the IgSF C domain (14.Yu C. Dong M. Wu X. Li S. Huang S. Su J. Wei J. Shen Y. Mou C. Xie X. Lin J. Yuan S. Yu X. Yu Y. Du J. Zhang S. Peng X. Xiang M. Xu A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Amphi-VCP was found to have 17.6% identity with Ctid-β2m at the amino acid level. To further determine the evolutionary origin of the IgSF C set, the three-dimensional structure of Amphi-VCPC was predicted using amino acid homology modeling based on part of the CD4 complex (PDB code 2NY4B; 30.Zhou T. Xu L. Dey B. Hessell A.J. Van Ryk D. Xiang S.H. Yang X. Zhang M.Y. Zwick M.B. Arthos J. Burton D.R. Dimitrov D.S. Sodroski J. Wyatt R. Nabel G.J. Kwong P.D. Nature. 2007; 445: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Amphi-VCPC was found to have 16.88% identity with the human T cell surface glycoprotein CD4 molecule (PDB code 2NY4B). The E-value of the constructed three-dimensional structure is 1.00e−8. The predicted three-dimensional structure of the Amphi-VCPC domain is composed of 75 residues (in the 8–82 region) that form a six-stranded β-sandwich fold (Fig. 5D), which is not typical for IgSF C set molecules. In the three-dimensional structure of Amphi-VCPC, strands A (17–20 aa) and C (48–51 aa) comprise one β-sheet, whereas B (31–35 aa), E (62–69 aa), and F (72–79 aa) form the second β-sheet. Strand D (56–58 aa) is positioned on top of the two β-sheets (Fig. 5E). However, the predicted central disulfide bond connecting Cys21 and Cys65 on loop AB and strand E is not found in the predicted three-dimensional structure. Compared with Ctid-β2m, the topology of Amphi-VCPC is quite different (Fig. 5F), whereas the three-dimensional structures of Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC are remarkably similar. By examining the topology of the bony fish β2m, Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC molecules, features indicating the evolutionary origin of the IgSF C set were found. The β2m molecule might be traceable as a descendent of the ancestor of Amphi-VCPC/Lamp-TCRLC-like molecules. In support of this possibility, 1) 18–19 aa in the N terminus of Amphi-VCPC/Lamp-TCRLC could have evolved to become the A strand of β2m, and 2) a mutation in the BC loops of Amphi-VCPC/Lamp-TCRLC molecules may have led to the novel topology found in β2m. In the study, we determined to 2.1 Å the three-dimensional structure of the β2m molecule in bony fish, which is the first β2m described in non-warm-blooded animals. The results show that Ctid-β2m is composed of A, B, D, and E strands and C, F, and G strands like a standard IgSF C set molecule. Two extra hydrogen bonds at positions Ile37 and Glu38 and a hydrophobic pocket around the center of Ctid-β2m were also found. Importantly, a short D strand and a longer CD loop might compose a flexible region for binding to the MHC heavy chain in bony fish. These features are different from the structures of mammalian and chicken β2ms, which have two strands, D1 and D2. To explore the evolutionary origin of the unattached IgSF C set, we homology modeled Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC at the three-dimensional level. The proteins in the fusion form as well as the IgSF C might be precursors of β2ms, although β2m emerged suddenly in fish species. These results highlight the evolutionary propensity toward stability with the presence of an unusual flexible CD loop that co-evolved with the MHC class I molecules 400 million years ago. IgSF domains can be classified as variable, constant, strand-switched, or hybrid based on their β-strand topology (2.Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). Although the IgSF domains exist widely in the adaptive immune system of vertebrates, only two genes, Amphi-VCP and Lamp-TCRL, have highlighted the significance of the C domains in the jawless vertebrates and protochordates (13.Pancer Z. Mayer W.E. Klein J. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13273-13278Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14.Yu C. Dong M. Wu X. Li S. Huang S. Su J. Wei J. Shen Y. Mou C. Xie X. Lin J. Yuan S. Yu X. Yu Y. Du J. Zhang S. Peng X. Xiang M. Xu A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3493-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To approach the evolutionary origin of the IgSF C, the three-dimensional structures of Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC were predicted, although homology modeling is not precise. The three-dimensional structure of Lamp-TCRLC is composed of 76 residues that form a six-stranded β-sandwich fold but is not typical for IgSF C set molecules. The three-dimensional structure of Amphi-VCPC is composed of 75 residues and also forms a six-stranded β-sandwich fold. Surprisingly, the topologies of Lamp-TCRLC and Amphi-VCPC are identical, although Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC molecules split more than 500 million years ago. We hypothesized that the precursors of β2ms are the IgSF C set-related molecules as well as Amphi-VCP/Lamp-TCR-like molecules. In support of this hypothesis, the C domains of Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC lack the A strand, which is similar to Ctid-β2m. That might imply that the B strand of β2m is the hodiernal A strand in Amphi-VCPC/Lamp-TCRLC. There are 18–19 aa at the N terminus of the Amphi-VCPC/Lamp-TCRLC molecules that could have evolved to become an A strand, as in β2m. In addition, a mutation event might have occurred in the BC loops of Amphi-VCPC/Lamp-TCRLC that led to the origination of a new strand. If so, the topology of Amphi-VCPC/Lamp-TCRLC might have either evolved to be the precursor of β2m or led to the creation of new fusion molecules, such as B cell receptor, TCR, Ig, MHC, CD4, and CD8. In conclusion, the crystal structure of Ctid-β2m was solved by molecular replacement. In the three-dimensional structure of Ctid-β2m, two new hydrogen bonds and a strong hydrophobic pocket were discovered, resulting in two more stable β-sheets. On the other hand, a single D strand and long CD loop were found, which are indicative of an unusual flexible D strand in Ctid-β2m. The three-dimensional structure of Ctid-β2m highlights the evolutionary propensity toward stability, with the presence of an unusual flexible CD loop for binding to the MHC class I heavy chain. We hypothesize that β2ms evolved from C set molecules, such as Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC molecules, in evolutionarily earlier animals. The predicted three-dimensional structures of both Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC distinctly lacked the A and D strands of β2m. Furthermore, a region of 18–19 aa in the N terminus of Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC could have evolved to be the A strand of β2ms. Altogether, a mutation occurring in the BC loops of Amphi-VCPC and Lamp-TCRLC-like molecules may have led to a new topology, forming the basis for what is now a standard C set molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2061440214,"The immune system is engaged in a constant antigenic surveillance through the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation pathway. This is an efficient mechanism for detection of intracellular infections, especially viral ones. In this work we describe conformational patterns shared by epitopes presented by a given MHC allele and use these features to develop a docking approach that simulates the peptide loading into the MHC cleft. Our strategy, to construct in silico MHC:peptide complexes, was successfully tested by reproducing four different crystal structures of MHC-I molecules available at the Protein Data Bank (PDB). An in silico study of cross-reactivity potential was also performed between the wild-type complex HLA-A2-NS31073 and nine MHC:peptide complexes presenting alanine exchange peptides. This indicates that structural similarities among the complexes can give us important clues about cross reactivity. The approach used in this work allows the selection of epitopes with potential to induce cross-reactive immune responses, providing useful tools for studies in autoimmunity and to the development of more comprehensive vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1980925228,"The C. elegans eat-6 gene encodes a Na+, K+-ATPase α subunit and is a homolog of the familial hemiplegic migraine candidate gene FHM2. Migraine is the most common neurological disorder linked to serotonergic dysfunction. We sought to study the pathophysiological mechanisms of migraine and their relation to serotonin (5-HT) signaling using C. elegans as a genetic model. In C. elegans, exogenous 5-HT inhibits paralysis induced by the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb. We found that the eat-6(ad467) mutation or RNAi of eat-6 increases aldicarb sensitivity and causes complete resistance to 5-HT treatment, indicating that EAT-6 is a component of the pathway that couples 5-HT signaling and ACh neurotransmission. While a postsynaptic role of EAT-6 at the bodywall NMJs has been well established, we found that EAT-6 may in addition regulate presynaptic ACh neurotransmission. We show that eat-6 is expressed in ventral cord ACh motor neurons, and that cell-specific RNAi of eat-6 in the ACh neurons leads to hypersensitivity to aldicarb. Electron microscopy showed an increased number of synaptic vesicles in the ACh neurons in the eat-6(ad467) mutant. Genetic analyses suggest that EAT-6 interacts with EGL-30 Gαq, EGL-8 phospholipase C and SLO-1 BK channel signaling to modulate ACh neurotransmission and that either reduced or excessive EAT-6 function may lead to increased ACh neurotransmission. Study of the interaction between eat-6 and 5-HT receptors revealed both stimulatory and inhibitory 5-HT inputs to the NMJs. We show that the inhibitory and stimulatory 5-HT signals arise from distinct 5-HT neurons. The role of eat-6 in modulation of excitatory neurotransmission by 5-HT may provide a genetic explanation for the therapeutic effects of the drugs targeting 5-HT receptors in the treatment of migraine patients."

The multimerization into tetramers increased the inhibition of cancer cell growth by the hEx3 diabody. Furthermore, 1:2 stoichiometric binding for both antigens was observed in a thermodynamic analysis, indicating that the tetramer has bivalent binding activity for each target, and the structure may be in a circular configuration, as is the case for the single-chain Fv tetrabody. In addition to enhanced cytotoxicity, the functional affinity and stability of the hEx3 tetrabody were superior to those of the hEx3 diabody. The increase in molecular weight is also expected to improve the pharmacokinetics of the bispecific diabody, making the hEx3 tetrabody attractive as a therapeutic antibody fragment for cancer immunotherapy.

Bispecificity can be used in cancer immunotherapy to cross-link tumor cells to immune cells such as cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages. This cross-linking accelerates the destruction of the tumor cells by the immune cells, which may translate into improved antitumor therapy and lower production costs by decreasing the doses needed (1Cao Y.

Advances in recombinant technology have made it feasible to generate small recombinant BsAbs constructed from two different variable antibody fragments. Bispecific diabodies are the smallest available BsAbs, and the distance between the two antigen-binding sites is sufficient to link two cells (6Perisic O. Webb P.A. Holliger P. Winter G.

Blood. 1999; 94: 2562-2568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effectiveness of bispecific diabodies in cancer therapy has been shown extensively in in vitro and in vivo models (8Gao Y. Xiong D.

Sakurai N. Teramae A. Ebara S. Katayose Y. Shinoda M. Suzuki M. Imai K. Matsuno S. Kudo T. Kumagai I. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Asano R. Kudo T. Nishimura Y. Makabe K. Hayashi H. Suzuki M. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In particular, the humanized bispecific diabody hEx3 has marked antitumor activity and can retarget lymphokine-activated killer cells with the T cell phenotype (T-LAK cells) against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive cell lines (13Asano R. Sone Y. Makabe K. Tsumoto K. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 4036-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Asano R. Sone Y. Ikoma K. Hayashi H. Nakanishi T. Umetsu M. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The compact structure of bispecific diabodies contributes to low immunogenicity, high tumor penetration, and the potential for large scale preparation through bacterial expression systems; however, the downsizing results in rapid clearance from blood. In addition, the structure contains only one binding domain for each target, which results in low functional affinity (15Le Gall F. Reusch U. Little M. Kipriyanov S.M. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Kipriyanov S.M. Moldenhauer G. Braunagel M. Reusch U. Cochlovius B. Le Gall F. Kouprianova O.A. Von der Lieth C.W. Little M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Multimerization of small recombinant antibodies is one available strategy for improving their pharmacokinetic and binding affinity. In single-chain Fvs (scFvs), the length and composition of the polypeptide linker between the variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) domains strongly influence the formation of the multimeric structure. A linker of 15 amino acid residues leads to the formation of an scFv, but reducing the linker length to 8–12 residues causes the scFvs to assemble into dimers, so that diabodies are formed. A further reduction to less than five residues leads to the formation of scFv trimers or tetramers (known as triabodies or tetrabodies) (17Pei X.Y. Holliger P. Murzin A.G. Williams R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Dolezal O. Pearce L.A. Lawrence L.J. McCoy A.J. Hudson P.J. Kortt A.A.

These scFv multimers are larger and have higher valency than the monomeric form; consequently, their clearance from circulation and accumulation on tumors are improved (22Wu A.M. Chen W. Raubitschek A. Williams L.E. Neumaier M. Fischer R. Hu S.Z. Odom-Maryon T. Wong J.Y. Shively J.E. Immunotechnology. 1996; 2: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Adams G.P. Schier R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Bispecific diabodies are generally produced from heterodimerization of two different hetero-scFvs (e.g. VHA-VLB and VHB-VLA) with a glycine-rich linker (GGGGS; 8Gao Y. Xiong D. Yang M. Liu H. Peng H. Shao X. Xu Y. Xu C. Fan D. Qin L. Yang C. Zhu Z. Leukemia. 2004; 18: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Blanco B. Holliger P. Vile R.G. Alvarez-Vallina L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The hetero scFvs can also form higher multimeric structures (25Bühler P. Wolf P. Gierschner D. Schaber I. Katzenwadel A. Schultze-Seemann W. Wetterauer U. Tacke M. Swamy M. Schamel W.W. Elsässer-Beile U. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2008; 57: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the multimeric bispecific diabodies formed are expected to have multivalent bispecificity and appropriate molecular weight. Here, we examined the multimerization of hEx3 by preparing monodisperse tetramers (hEx3 tetrabodies). These bispecific tetrabodies had much higher affinity for each antigen than normal diabodies due to an avidity effect, which led to strong inhibition of cancer cell growth. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed quantitative characterization of functional bispecific tetrabodies. For the expression and preparation of hEx3, we used three different methods in accordance with previous reports: a preparation using a bacterial expression and in vitro refolding system (13Asano R. Sone Y. Makabe K. Tsumoto K. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 4036-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a preparation using a mammalian expression system (14Asano R. Sone Y. Ikoma K. Hayashi H. Nakanishi T. Umetsu M. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and a preparation using Fc fusion format and restriction protease digestion (26Asano R. Kawaguchi H. Watanabe Y. Nakanishi T. Umetsu M. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. J. Immunother. 2008; 31: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Asano R. Ikoma K. Kawaguchi H. Ishiyama Y. Nakanishi T. Umetsu M. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Size-exclusion chromatography with a HiLoad Superdex 200-pg column (26/60; GE Healthcare) was used to fractionate each prepared hEx3 solution. The column was equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then 5 ml of purified recombinant antibodies was applied to the column at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and static light scattering (SLS) measurements were carried out at 20 °C on a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK) using a He-Ne laser (λ = 633 nm). All of the antibody solutions were filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene filter. For DLS, the antibody solutions at 15 μm were measured using a noninvasive back-scatter optical system, and the correlation curve was fitted using the default exponential g2(τ) fit function to estimate the hydrodynamic diameters of the antibodies. For analyzing molecular weight, SLS of the antibody solutions at 0.3–1.0 mg/ml was measured, and a Debye plot was made using the scattering intensity. T-LAK cells were induced as reported previously (28Asano R. Watanabe Y. Kawaguchi H. Fukazawa H. Nakanishi T. Umetsu M. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27659-27665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured for 48 h at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in a medium supplemented with 100 international units/ml of recombinant human interleukin-2 (kindly supplied by Shionogi Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) in a culture flask (A/S Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) that was precoated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml). In vitro growth inhibition of TFK-1 (human bile duct carcinoma) cells was assayed with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)- 2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) assay kit (CellTiter 96 AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay; Promega, Madison, WI) as reported previously (28Asano R. Watanabe Y. Kawaguchi H. Fukazawa H. Nakanishi T. Umetsu M. Hayashi H. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27659-27665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic analyses for the interactions of recombinant antibodies for soluble EGFR (sEGFR) and CD3 were performed by microtitration calorimetry using a VP-ITC from MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA) (29Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). The method for expression and purification of sEGFR has been described previously (30Makabe K. Nakanishi T. Tsumoto K. Tanaka Y. Kondo H. Umetsu M. Sone Y. Asano R. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1156-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The expression vector for CD3 was kindly provided by Dr. Katsumi Maenaka (Kyushu University), and a preparation of CD3 was performed according to the previous report (31Kjer-Nielsen L. Dunstone M.A. Kostenko L. Ely L.K. Beddoe T. Mifsud N.A. Purcell A.W. Brooks A.G. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7675-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each sample (1.5 μm in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.005% Tween 20) was placed in a calorimeter cell and titrated with 30 μm sEGFR in the same buffer; for CD3, 1.25 μm hEx3 was titrated with 50 μm CD3. The ligand solution was injected 25 times in 10-μl portions over a period of 15 s. Data acquisition and subsequent nonlinear regression analysis were done in terms of a simple binding model, using the MicroCal ORIGIN 5.0 software package. The interactions between sEGFR and bispecific antibodies were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy with BIACORE 2000 (GE Healthcare). sEGFR was immobilized onto the cells in a CM5 sensor chip up to 2716 resonance units. Various concentrations of bispecific antibodies in 0.005% PBS with Tween 20 (PBS-T) were flowed over the sEGFR. The data were normalized by subtracting the response of a blank cell only with blocking. BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare) was used to analyze the data. Kinetic parameters were calculated by a global fitting analysis with the assumptions of the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. To examine in vitro stability, hEx3s were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h in human plasma. Growth inhibition relative to untreated hEx3s was then evaluated with the MTS assay. Gel filtration analysis with a HiLoad Superdex 200-pg column (10/300) was used to evaluate the long term stability of the hEx3 tetramer in storage. After storage for 1 month at 4 °C, 250 μl of fractionated hEx3 tetramers was applied to a column equilibrated with PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. We prepared the small recombinant bispecific antibody hEx3 using three different methods: refolding from insoluble aggregates expressed in Escherichia coli, secretory expression by Chinese hamster ovary cells, and Fc fusion expression by Chinese hamster ovary cells. Size-exclusion chromatography of each hEx3 preparation showed the predominant formation of dimers, but multimeric forms were also observed. The proportion of multimers varied with the method of preparation; refolded hEx3 produced only a small amount of multimers (Fig. 1A), whereas the secretory preparation using Chinese hamster ovary cells promoted the formation of multimeric forms, which corresponded to the fraction position of tetramers (Fig. 1B). Thus, hEx3 predominantly formed dimers but has the potential to form tetramers. hEx3 prepared from the Fc fusion format via restriction protease digestion also formed tetramers (Fig. 1C), and this method enabled the preparation of sufficient amounts of dimers and tetramers for further evaluation. The final yields of dimers and tetramers are 5 mg and 1 mg/liter culture, respectively. An SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractionated hEx3 showed that both the anti-EGFR VH–linker–anti-CD3 VL (h5HhOL) and anti-CD3 VH–linker–anti-EGFR VL (hOHh5L) hetero-scFv fragments formed equal proportions of dimers and tetramers with all the expression methods (SDS-PAGE for hEx3 from the Fc fusion is shown in Fig. 1D as a representative example). To confirm the formation of tetramers, we employed DLS and SLS spectroscopy to quantify the size and molecular weights of the dimers and tetramers fractionated from hEx3 prepared with the Fc fusion format. An IgG-type mouse anti-CD3 antibody, OKT3, was used as a control for comparison. Both the dimer and tetramer had narrow distributions, centered at 3.4 and 6.6 nm, respectively; the size of tetramer was about twice that of dimer and two-thirds that of IgG (Fig. 2 and Table 1). SLS measurement supported the molecular weight estimated from size-exclusion chromatography. Therefore, the multimer at the 190-ml fraction formed a monodisperse tetramer with equal amounts of h5HhOL and hOHh5L scFvs.TABLE 1Diameter and molecular mass of antibodies evaluated by DLS and SLSCalculated MMaMM, molecular mass.Diameter from DLS (distribution)MM from SLSkDanmkDadimer533.43 (2.7–4.19)n.d.bn.d., not determined.tetramer1066.57 (4.85–10.1)111mOKT3 IgG1509.07 (5.61–15.7)156a MM, molecular mass.b n.d., not determined. Open table in a new tab To analyze the influence of the tetramerization on the inhibition of human carcinoma cell growth, we analyzed prepared dimeric and tetrameric hEx3s with MTS. In the presence of T-LAK cells, both hEx3 forms strongly inhibited the growth of TFK-1 cells, but the tetramer was effective at a much lower concentration, 10 fmol/ml (Fig. 3A). When peripheral blood mononuclear cells were applied as effector cells, although high concentrations of hEx3s were required, the tetramer also inhibited more effectively than the dimer (Fig. 3B). Thus, the multimerization into tetramers increased the function of hEx3. To investigate the binding stoichiometry of each fraction in hEx3 for EGFR and CD3, we performed thermodynamic analyses by ITC. IgG and Fab were used as control molecules with bivalent and monovalent binding, respectively. The binding constants and stoichiometry are summarized in Table 2. Dimeric hEx3 showed 1:1 stoichiometric binding for EGFR (Fig. 4C) and CD3 (Fig. 4D), similar to Fab, indicating that the anti-EGFR Fv and anti-CD3 Fv portions in the dimeric hEx3 had formed correctly; that is, the prepared dimers were monomorphous diabodies without inactive homodimers. This result is consistent with our previous results supporting the formation of monomorphous hEx3 diabodies (14Asano R. Sone Y. Ikoma K. Hayashi H. Nakanishi T. Umetsu M. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the case of tetramers, the integration plots for EGFR and CD3 showed the same binding stoichiometry as IgG but not Fab, that is, a 1:2 stoichiometric binding for both antigens (Fig. 4, C and D). The tetramer therefore formed monomorphous hEx3 tetrabodies with bivalency for two individual targets.TABLE 2KA value and stoichiometry (n) for sEGFR and CD3ϵγ evaluated by ITCsEGFRCD3ϵγKA (×107 m−1)nKA (×106 m−1)nFab14.71.17.70.9IgG21.92.010.71.7dimer2.01.05.01.0tetramer15.71.810.42.1 Open table in a new tab To confirm the effect of the multivalency of tetrameric hEx3, we evaluated the binding kinetics for immobilized sEGFR by surface plasmon resonance. The binding kinetics for CD3 were not determined, because the CD3 receptors were inactivated when immobilized on a sensor chip. The sensorgram for tetrameric hEx3 against EGFR showed an association curve similar to that of the dimer, but the dissociation of the tetramer was slower than that of the dimer (Fig. 5). A global fitting to a 1:1 interactional model with a mass transport term indicated that the tetramers had an association rate similar to that of the dimers, but the dissociation rate was one-seventh of the dimer rate (Table 3); consequently, the affinity constant of the tetramer was 17-fold that of the dimer. The multimerization into a tetramer influenced the dissociation process of diabodies, resulting in increased affinity for the antigen.TABLE 3Binding kinetics for sEGFR evaluated with surface plasmon resonancekonkoffKA×105 m−1 s−1×10−4 s−1×107 m−1dimer2.655.24.8tetramer6.78.181.9 Open table in a new tab Physiologic stability is a critical factor for potential therapeutic recombinant proteins. Therefore, we examined the cytotoxicity of dimeric and tetrameric hEx3 after preincubation at 37 °C in human plasma. The activity of the dimers was slightly reduced; however, the intense cytotoxicity of the tetramer was retained (Fig. 6A). The stability of assembled structure was also evaluated by size-exclusion chromatography of the tetramer after storage for a month (Fig. 6B). Although a few tetramers were converted into dimers, we confirmed that the tetrameric structure was sufficiently stable for use after 1 month in storage. Bispecific diabodies show several advantages over BsAbs produced from hybrid hybridomas or chemical conjugation; however, bispecific diabodies are also cleared rapidly, and their decrease in valence generally causes low functional affinity (15Le Gall F. Reusch U. Little M. Kipriyanov S.M. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Kipriyanov S.M. Moldenhauer G. Braunagel M. Reusch U. Cochlovius B.

Shortening the middle linker in scFv leads to self-multimerization, and the multimerization can improve the pharmacokinetics and increase functional affinity due to an avidity effect (17Pei X.Y.

Katzenwadel A. Schultze-Seemann W. Wetterauer U. Tacke M. Swamy M. Schamel W.W. Elsässer-Beile U. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2008; 57: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but the effectiveness of bispecific diabodies has not been studied to date. In the present study, we found that hEx3 formed multimers. We purified these multimers, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of each hEx3 fraction quantitatively demonstrated that the tetramer had two functional binding sites for each antigen (Fig. 4 and Table 2). This increase in binding sites provided strong growth inhibition activity. The multimerization was effective even for bispecific diabodies. Engineering of linkers in single-chain diabodies (scDbs), in which two hetero-scFvs are tandemly conjugated, can provide tetravalent bispecific dimers called tandem scDbs (tanDbs). The tanDbs exhibit not only higher functional affinity and stability under physiological conditions in vitro than scDbs but also longer blood retention and higher therapeutic effects in vivo (15Le Gall F.

Biol. 1999; 293: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study, we prepared highly functional bispecific tetrabodies from hetero-scFv fragments with molecular sizes approximately half those of scDbs. Although the bispecific tetrabodies formed as a by-product of bispecific diabodies, the formation from smaller fragments might be an advantage in protein expression. In contrast to the structure of tanDbs, in which all four variable domains of one chain interact with the variable domains of the second chain (33Kipriyanov S.M. Moldenhauer G. Schuhmacher J. Cochlovius B. Von der Lieth C.W. Matys E.R. Little M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 34Völkel T. Korn T. Bach M. Müller R. Kontermann R.E. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 815-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the structure of the hEx3 tetramer is probably a circular structure, similar to that of the scFv tetramer (known as a tetrabody; Refs. 18Dolezal O. Pearce L.A. Lawrence L.J. McCoy A.J. Hudson P.J. Kortt A.A. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Kortt A.A. Dolezal O. Power B.E. Hudson P.J. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 18: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We previously reported a strong interdomain interaction between the cognate VH and VL domains of hEx3 (14Asano R. Sone Y. Ikoma K. Hayashi H. Nakanishi T. Umetsu M. Katayose Y. Unno M. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); this strong interaction probably contributes to the formation of a stable circular structure for the hEx3 tetrabody with four active binding sites. To date, several different small BsAb formats have been proposed to increase efficacy and availability, including not only scDb and tanDb but also tandem scFv (36Schlereth B. Fichtner I. Lorenczewski G. Kleindienst P. Brischwein K. da Silva A. Kufer P. Lutterbuese R. Junghahn I. Kasimir-Bauer S. Wimberger P. Kimmig R. Baeuerle P.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53907-53914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Bispecific tetrabodies like the hEx3 tetramer also should be considered small BsAb formats for the development of effective cancer therapeutic antibodies. Although in vivo experiments with the hEx3 tetramer are now under way, we did confirm their stability in physiologic conditions and in long term storage (Fig. 6). In conclusion, we showed that the multimeric molecules in hEx3 solution were homogenous tetramers with high cytotoxicity. The multimerization of small antibody fragments can lead to improved pharmacokinetics and binding affinity, resulting in an enhancement of the therapeutic effect. To increase the population of hEx3 tetramers for therapeutic application, we are working to modify the middle linker in hetero-scFvs, to change the orientation of VH and VL, and to create mutations to minimize the steric interference in the tetrameric form, similar to how the scFv multimer has been modified (35Kortt A.A.

https://openalex.org/W2077912810,"In the vertebrates, the BMP/Smad1 and TGF-beta/Smad2 signaling pathways execute antagonistic functions in different contexts of development. The differentiation of specific structures results from the balance between these two pathways. For example, the gastrula organizer/node of the vertebrates requires a region of low Smad1 and high Smad2 signaling. In Drosophila, Mad regulates tissue determination and growth in the wing, but the function of dSmad2 in wing patterning is largely unknown. In this study, we used an RNAi loss-of-function approach to investigate dSmad2 signaling during wing development. RNAi-mediated knockdown of dSmad2 caused formation of extra vein tissue, with phenotypes similar to those seen in Dpp/Mad gain-of-function. Clonal analyses revealed that the normal function of dSmad2 is to inhibit the response of wing intervein cells to the extracellular Dpp morphogen gradient that specifies vein formation, as measured by expression of the activated phospho-Mad protein. The effect of dSmad2 depletion in promoting vein differentiation was dependent on Medea, the co-factor shared by Mad and dSmad2. Furthermore, double RNAi experiments showed that Mad is epistatic to dSmad2. In other words, depletion of Smad2 had no effect in Mad-deficient wings. Our results demonstrate a novel role for dSmad2 in opposing Mad-mediated vein formation in the wing. We propose that the main function of dActivin/dSmad2 in Drosophila wing development is to antagonize Dpp/Mad signaling. Possible molecular mechanisms for the opposition between dSmad2 and Mad signaling are discussed."

We investigated whether extracellular matrix protein fragments could be targeted with antibodies to ischemically injured myocardium to promote angiogenesis and myocardial repair.Four peptides, 2 derived from fibronectin and 2 derived from Type IV Collagen, were assessed for in vitro and in vivo tendencies for angiogenesis. Three of the four peptides--Hep I, Hep III, RGD--were identified and shown to increase endothelial cell attachment, proliferation, migration and cell activation in vitro. By chemically conjugating these peptides to an anti-myosin heavy chain antibody, the peptides could be administered intravenously and specifically targeted to the site of the myocardial infarction. When administered into Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent ischemia-reperfusion myocardial infarction, these peptides produced statistically significantly higher levels of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis 6 weeks post treatment.We demonstrated that antibody-targeted ECM-derived peptides alone can be used to sufficiently alter the extracellular matrix microenvironment to induce a dramatic angiogenic response in the myocardial infarct area. Our results indicate a potentially new non-invasive strategy for repairing damaged tissue, as well as a novel tool for investigating in vivo cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2161864112,"Integumentary wounds in mammalian fetuses heal without scar; this scarless wound healing is intrinsic to fetal tissues and is notable for absence of the contraction seen in postnatal (adult) wounds. The precise molecular signals determining the scarless phenotype remain unclear. We have previously reported that the eta subunit of the chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide (CCT-eta) is specifically reduced in healing fetal wounds in a rabbit model. In this study, we examine the role of CCT-eta in fibroblast motility and contractility, properties essential to wound healing and scar formation. We demonstrate that CCT-eta (but not CCT-beta) is underexpressed in fetal fibroblasts compared to adult fibroblasts. An in vitro wound healing assay demonstrated that adult fibroblasts showed increased cell migration in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation, whereas fetal fibroblasts were unresponsive. Downregulation of CCT-eta in adult fibroblasts with short inhibitory RNA (siRNA) reduced cellular motility, both basal and growth factor-induced; in contrast, siRNA against CCT-beta had no such effect. Adult fibroblasts were more inherently contractile than fetal fibroblasts by cellular traction force microscopy; this contractility was increased by treatment with EGF and PDGF. CCT-eta siRNA inhibited the PDGF-induction of adult fibroblast contractility, whereas CCT-beta siRNA had no such effect. In each of these instances, the effect of downregulating CCT-eta was to modulate the behavior of adult fibroblasts so as to more closely approximate the characteristics of fetal fibroblasts. We next examined the effect of CCT-eta modulation on alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression, a gene product well known to play a critical role in adult wound healing. Fetal fibroblasts were found to constitutively express less alpha-SMA than adult cells. Reduction of CCT-eta with siRNA had minimal effect on cellular beta-actin but markedly decreased alpha-SMA; in contrast, reduction of CCT-beta had minimal effect on either actin isoform. Direct inhibition of alpha-SMA with siRNA reduced both basal and growth factor-induced fibroblast motility. These results indicate that CCT-eta is a specific regulator of fibroblast motility and contractility and may be a key determinant of the scarless wound healing phenotype by means of its specific regulation of alpha-SMA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2034614648,"Background Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is an enzyme catalysing the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), the latter being an essential messenger molecule for a range of biological processes. Whilst its role in higher vertebrates is well understood little is known about the role of this enzyme in early metazoan groups. For instance, NOS-mediated signalling has been associated with Cnidaria-algal symbioses, however controversy remains about the contribution of enzyme activities by the individual partners of these mutualistic relationships. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a modified citrulline assay we successfully measured NOS activity in three cnidarian-algal symbioses: the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida, the hard coral Acropora millepora, and the soft coral Lobophytum pauciflorum, so demonstrating a wide distribution of this enzyme in the phylum Cnidaria. Further biochemical (citrulline assay) and histochemical (NADPH-diaphorase) investigations of NOS in the host tissue of L. pauciflorum revealed the cytosolic and calcium dependent nature of this enzyme and its in situ localisation within the coral's gastrodermal tissue, the innermost layer of the body wall bearing the symbiotic algae. Interestingly, enzyme activity could not be detected in symbionts freshly isolated from the cnidarians, or in cultured algal symbionts. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that NOS-mediated NO release may be host-derived, a finding that has the potential to further refine our understanding of signalling events in cnidarian-algal symbioses."
https://openalex.org/W1967184687,"UvrD (DNA helicase II) has been implicated in DNA replication, DNA recombination, nucleotide excision repair, and methyl-directed mismatch repair. The enzymatic function of UvrD is to translocate along a DNA strand in a 3′ to 5′ direction and unwind duplex DNA utilizing a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. In addition, UvrD interacts with many other proteins involved in the above processes and is hypothesized to facilitate protein turnover, thus promoting further DNA processing. Although UvrD interactions with proteins bound to DNA have significant biological implications, the effects of covalent DNA-protein cross-links on UvrD helicase activity have not been characterized. Herein, we demonstrate that UvrD-catalyzed strand separation was inhibited on a DNA strand to which a 16-kDa protein was covalently bound. Our sequestration studies suggest that the inhibition of UvrD activity is most likely due to a translocation block and not helicase sequestration on the cross-link-containing DNA substrate. In contrast, no inhibition of UvrD-catalyzed strand separation was apparent when the protein was linked to the complementary strand. The latter result is surprising given the earlier observations that the DNA in this covalent complex is severely bent (∼70°), with both DNA strands making multiple contacts with the cross-linked protein. In addition, UvrD was shown to be required for replication of plasmid DNAs containing covalent DNA-protein complexes.

Escherichia coli UvrD (DNA helicase II) is a member of the SF1 superfamily of DNA helicases, and its activity has been implicated in many genome maintenance functions including replication, methyl-directed mismatch repair, homologous recombination, and nucleotide excision repair (NER). 3The abbreviations used are: NERnucleotide excision repairAPapurinic/apyrimidinicCPDcyclobutane pyrimidine dimerDPCDNA-protein cross-linkSSBsingle-strand binding proteinT4-pdgT4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase/AP site lyasecamchloramphenicolampampicillintettetracyclinekankanamycin. UvrD functions as a 3′ to 5′ helicase and translocates via a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity (1Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UvrD-deficient E. coli cells are hyper-recombinogenic (2Arthur H.M. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 180: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), have increased levels of spontaneous mutagenesis (3Ossanna N. Mount D.W. J.

UvrD helicase activity can be significantly stimulated by interactions with the NER UvrAB complex (6Atkinson J. Guy C.P. Cadman C.J. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. McGlynn P. J. Biol.

UvrD is involved in several replication-associated processes and has been shown to co-purify with the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme complex (9Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). UvrD is also implicated in the processing of Okazaki fragments, such that E. coli cells that are deficient in polymerase I are unable to grow on rich media but do survive when grown on defined minimal media (10Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 636-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these cells are extremely defective in the joining of Okazaki fragments, an alternative UvrD-dependent replication pathway is hypothesized to remove RNA primers and fill in these gaps. This alternative pathway requires not only UvrD but also UvrA and UvrB (not UvrC) (6Atkinson J. Guy C.P. Cadman C.J. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. McGlynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9612-9623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Moolenaar G.F. Moorman C. Goosen N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5706-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) such that double mutants of polymerase I and UvrA, -B, or -D are lethal. It is hypothesized that the UvrABD complex can replace the strand-displacement function of polymerase I, whereas alternative exonucleases and polymerases complete lagging strand DNA synthesis (6Atkinson J. Guy C.P. Cadman C.J. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. McGlynn P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9612-9623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). UvrD is also essential for removal of Tus protein bound at Ter sites and has been proposed to promote recombination-dependent replication restart from forks arrested by Ter-Tus complexes (12Bidnenko V. Lestini R. Michel B. Mol Microbiol. 2006; 62: 382-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In temperature-sensitive dnaN and dnaE cells, UvrD has been implicated in the removal of RecA molecules that are bound to the arrested replication forks (13Florés M.J. Sanchez N. Michel B. Mol Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1664-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, UvrD disrupts RecA bound to synthetic recombination intermediates, and it is hypothesized that in the absence of UvrD, the inability to disrupt RecA filaments leads to the hyper-recombinogenic phenotype (14Veaute X. Delmas S. Selva M. Jeusset J. Le Cam E. Matic I. Fabre F. Petit M.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In agreement with these conclusions, cells expressing the hyper-helicase mutant of UvrD (UvrD303) have anti-recombinogenic and anti-mutator phenotypes (15Zhang G. Deng E. Baugh L. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 377-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Centore R.C. Leeson M.C. Sandler S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite the hyper-helicase activity, UvrD303 cells remain UV-sensitive, and this phenotype is epistatic with RecA but additive with UvrA (16Centore R.C. Leeson M.C. Sandler S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A possible function of UvrD in NER is to facilitate the release of the UvrABC complex, thus accelerating protein turnover (17Husain I. Van Houten B. Thomas D.C. Abdel-Monem M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 6774-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Kumura K. Sekiguchi M. Steinum A.L. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1483-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Caron P.R. Kushner S.R. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4925-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The specific role for the helicase activity has been assumed to involve strand displacement of the incised damage-containing strand. However, it was subsequently shown that the addition of UvrD to a bound UvrAB complex did not change the UvrAB footprint, with a slight hint of UvrD binding near the 5′ incision site (20Van Houten B. Gamper H. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16553-16560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This same study also showed that UvrD did not affect the ability of DNA polymerase I to catalyze strand displacement synthesis at the dual incision sites and release of UvrABC. These data were in good agreement with the earlier studies that demonstrated that tracks of NER-dependent repair synthesis were normal in UvrD-deficient cells and that the incision steps were not affected in this strain (21Carlson K.M. Smith K.C. Mutat. Res. 1981; 84: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 22Kuemmerle N.B. Ley R.D. Masker W.E. Mutat. Res. 1982; 94: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Further, Matson et al. (1Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that UvrD may participate in the turnover of UvrABC through protein-protein interactions rather than its DNA unwinding activity. Thus, the exact role of UvrD in NER is not precisely defined. In addition to the various functions described above, the UvrABC complex-independent role of UvrD was demonstrated in modulating cytotoxicity of norfloxin, an inhibitor of gyrase and topoisomerase IV (23Khodursky A.B. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27668-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because gyrase and topoisomerase IV function ahead of and behind the replication fork, respectively, it was interesting that the uvrD mutant showed increased sensitivity to norfloxin when topoisomerase IV, but not gyrase, was targeted. Thus, UvrD appears to be specifically involved in facilitating the repair of the topoisomerase IV but not gyrase-norfloxacin-DNA complexes. Overall, these data suggest that UvrD may be important for displacing non-covalent protein-DNA interactions. However, at present no data are available concerning how UvrD interacts with DNA containing covalent DNA-protein complexes (DPCs). In this regard, we have recently reported that a yeast helicase, Sgs1, is important for cellular tolerance to formaldehyde-induced DPCs (24de Graaf B. Clore A. McCullough A.K. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent report has investigated the role of DNA helicases as sensors for DNA damage (25Suhasini A.N. Sommers J.A. Mason A.C. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Wold M.S. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18458-18470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although several helicases were differentially affected by the relative positioning of a thymine glycol lesion, the UvrD helicase activity was not inhibited by this lesion on either the translocating or complementary DNA strand. The present work addresses a biological role for UvrD in processing of DPCs and is the first study that characterizes the in vitro function of a helicase on DNA substrates containing a site-specific, structurally well defined DPC. The oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. One of the two DNA strands of the partial duplexes used in the helicase reactions was 32P-labeled by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, Inc., 10 units) and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP in a total volume of 20 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. The annealing reactions were performed by incubating the 32P-labeled strand and the complementary strand (2–3-fold excess) in TM buffer (Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm MgCl2) containing 50 mm NaCl. The resultant partial duplex DNAs contained deoxyuridine (dU) either on the translocating or non-translocating strand (Fig. 1). To form the site-specific DPC, an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site was created by reaction with uracil DNA glycosylase followed by a reaction with T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase/AP site lyase (T4-pdg) protein in the presence of NaBH4 as previously described (26Minko I.G. Zou Y. Lloyd R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Purification of UvrD was done as described previously (27Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the helicase assay, UvrD was preincubated with DNA substrates (1 nm) in 10 μl of buffer T20 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 20 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol). The helicase reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of buffer T20 supplemented with 2 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2 (final concentration) and an excess of unlabeled DNA strand (10-fold excess over the 32P-labeled strand). This DNA trap was added to minimize any re-annealing of the unwound DNA products from the helicase reaction. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for the indicated times. The reactions were terminated by adding 2.5 μl of quenching solution (0.4 m EDTA and 10% glycerol) and 2.5 μl of loading dye (40% (w/v) sucrose and 0.25% bromphenol blue (w/v)). DNAs were separated by electrophoresis through a 5% native gel in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA for 1.5 h at 190 V. The results were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analyses. For helicase sequestration studies, UvrD (10 nm) was preincubated in standard helicase reaction buffer in the presence of the indicated amounts (0–8 nm) of unlabeled partial duplex DNA that were either unadducted or contained a DPC. After incubation in the presence of 2 mm ATP for 5 min at room temperature, 1 nm 32P-labeled non-damaged partial duplex substrate (50T-30T) was subsequently added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were then quenched and resolved on native polyacrylamide gels as described above. Typically, 70–75% of the 32P-labeled substrate was unwound in reactions lacking the competitor DNA molecule. The extent of strand separation was calculated relative to the control reactions lacking the competitor DNA. ATPase assays were carried out using the colorimetric ATPase assay kit purchased from Innova Biosciences and performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) were prepared in T20 buffer, 2 nm duplex DNA substrate and varying concentrations of UvrD helicase (5–20 nm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of a mixture (100 μl) containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm ATP and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of Lock Gold and accelerator mixture (50 μl and 0.5 μl, respectively). After 2 min, 20 μl of stabilizer was added, and after 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 650 nm using an Spectra Max 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Absorbance (A650) values were plotted as a function of increasing UvrD concentrations. Bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table 1. All strains were maintained in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth that was supplemented with kanamycin (kan) (50 μg/ml) for the ΔuvrD strain and chloramphenicol (cam) (50 and 20 μg/ml, respectively) for the AK100 and AK101 strains. The deletion in the uvrD gene was confirmed by PCR (supplemental Fig. S1).TABLE 1E. coli strains used in this studyStrainsGenotypeSourceBW25113Δ(araD-araB)567, ΔlacZ4787(::rrnB-3), LAM-, rph-1, Δ(rhaD-rhaB)568, hsdR514E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale UniversityJW3786-5Δ(araD-araB)567, ΔlacZ4787(::rrnB-3), LAM-, rph-1, ΔuvrD769::kan, Δ(rhaD- rhaB)568, hsdR514E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale UniversityDY329W3110 ΔlacU169 nadA::Tn10 gal490 λcl857 Δ(cro-bioA)J.

Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Strain AK100 was constructed by transformation of DY329 with a linear donor DNA that was designed to disrupt the uvrA gene by replacing it with a cam selective marker. The donor DNA was obtained by PCR amplification using the DNA template that was derived from a cam-resistant cassette (Stratagene). Primer sequences were 5′-TGTGACGGAAGATCACTTCGGGGCGCCCGCACCCATAATCTCAAAAACATGTGACGGAAGATCACTTCG-3′ (uvrA-cam forward primer) and 5′-CGGCTTAAGGAAGCGTGCCGTGTGTGATGCTTCGCACTCCACCAGCAATAGACACCAGCAATAGACATAAGCG-3′ (uvrA-cam reverse primer). These primers were designed such that the 5′ 20-nucleotide (nt)-long ends were homologous to the flanking regions of the target gene followed by the 40-nt-long stretches priming the cam cassette DNA for replication. The reactions were carried out using Fermentas PCR master mix. The conditions for PCR were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min followed by 29 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min and a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was purified from a 1% agarose gel using a Qiagen PCR purification kit. Electroporation of the donor DNA into DY329-competent cells was performed as described (28Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). The electroporated cells were diluted with 1 ml of LB broth and incubated overnight at 30 °C, and the recombinant cells were selected on LB-cam plates. To generate strain AK101, P1 phage was passed through the strain AK100, and the phage lysate was used for transduction of the BW25113 strain. The extractions of genomic DNA and RNA were done using Qiagen genomic DNA and RNA extraction kits, respectively. The deletion in the uvrA gene was confirmed by PCR amplification in four independent colonies (supplemental Fig. S2). Fresh overnight cultures (grown in the presence of appropriate antibiotics) were diluted 1:100 in LB medium and grown to an A595 ∼ 0.3. The culture was diluted 1:500 in LB, and 100 μl aliquots were incubated with varying concentrations of formaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by plating on LB agar plates. To introduce DPCs into plasmid DNA, the catalytic chemistry of T4-pdg was exploited in which T4-pdg proceeds via a covalent DNA-protein intermediate. Specifically, after scission of the glycosidic bond at the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) site, T4-pdg forms an imine intermediate with the C1′ of the deoxyribose at an AP site and generates a nick in the DNA strand (29Dodson M.L. Schrock 3rd, R.D. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Schrock 3rd, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 880-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, the imine intermediate can be trapped to produce a stable complex between DNA and protein (29Dodson M.L. Schrock 3rd, R.D. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8284-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Schrock 3rd, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 880-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, the number of CPDs per plasmid molecule was determined empirically. The pMS2 vector (31Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) (100 ng/μl) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA was exposed to 254-nm UV light at 100 microwatts/cm2, and 2 μl aliquots of DNA were collected during the course of exposure to measure the rate of CPD formation. Subsequently, these DNAs were incubated with T4-pdg in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA to generate single-stranded breaks at the CPD sites, converting plasmids from the supercoiled form (Form I) to the nicked relaxed (Form II) and linear (Form III) forms. Incubations were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C, and the various topological forms of the DNA were separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.2 μg/ml), and the intensity of each band was determined using an Alpha Innotech Imaging system. Based on an assumption of a Poisson distribution of CPDs throughout the plasmid population, the number of CPDs per plasmid molecule was calculated using the equation, CPD number = −ln(1.42IForm I/(1.42IForm I + IForm II + IForm III)), where I is the band intensity, and 1.42 is a factor to correct for the reduced intercalation of ethidium bromide into the supercoiled DNA (32Lloyd R.S. Haidle C.W. Hewitt R.R. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3191-3196PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the time course experiment are shown in supplemental Fig. S3, panels A and B. After these initial analyses, the pMS2 vector was exposed under the same conditions as above for 4 min to introduce ∼8 CPDs per plasmid molecule. To generate plasmids containing DPCs (pMS2-DPC), 300 ng of UV-irradiated pMS2 were reacted with T4-pdg (0.4 μm) and freshly prepared NaBH4 (100 mm) in a total volume of 40 μl. The T4-pdg and NaBH4 were mixed first and immediately added to the plasmid DNA. Formation of DPCs was confirmed by the decreased electrophoretic mobility of the vector DNA through a 1% agarose gel. As a non-DPC control, UV-irradiated pMS2 was treated with NaBH4 in the absence of T4-pdg; these plasmids (pMS2-UV) along with pMS2-DPC were used in the plasmid reactivation assays. The pMS2-UV and pMS2-DPC plasmids were individually mixed with the non-damaged pBR322 plasmid at a 15 to 1 weight ratio, and the mixture was used to transform wild-type and ΔuvrD E. coli strains. The pBR322 plasmid served as an internal control for measuring transformation efficiency. Although pMS2 confers resistance to ampicillin (amp) only, pBR322 encodes for two selective markers, amp and tetracycline (tet); thus, the pMS2- and pBR322-containing bacterial clones can be easily distinguished. The transformation of bacteria was done by electroporation using the conditions described previously (33Kanuri M. Minko I.G. Nechev L.V. Harris T.M. Harris C.M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18257-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing amp (100 μg/ml). For further screening, the transformants were individually grown first in LB broth containing amp (100 μg/ml) in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 4–6 h. A 20-μl aliquot from each 96-well was transferred to another 96-well plate containing LB broth with tet (5 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Separate generalized linear models were fit to the data depending on the particular outcome being modeled. Pixel density as a function of UvrD concentration (helicase reactions) was best described using a gamma distribution. The number of surviving colonies as a function of formaldehyde concentration (survival assays) followed a negative binomial distribution, while absorbance as a function of UvrD enzyme concentration (ATPase assays) followed a normal distribution. All models also included indicator variables identifying the particular treatment (e.g. damaged versus non-damaged) along with interactions between concentration (of UvrD or formaldehyde) and treatment. Models also employed a log link between the particular outcome and the explanatory variables, thereby allowing model parameters to be interpreted as log ratios of the mean response. In particular, fitted values measured relative to the model's intercept term reflect the (log) mean response relative to control conditions (where formaldehyde or UvrD concentration is 0). Exponentiation of these log ratios re-expresses the relative change in the mean response on the original scale of measurement, with 95% confidence intervals for the corresponding effect similarly back-transformed. All models were fit using R (Version 2.10.1; R Development Core Team, 2009) with the associated MASS package (34Venables W.N. Ripley B.D. Modern Applied Statistics with S. 4th Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York2002Crossref Google Scholar) to fit the negative binomial model. Several strategies have been used to create site-specific DNA-protein cross-links (35Sung J.S. Demple B.

In this study, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides were prepared in which a dU had been introduced either at position 16 from the 5′ end of the non-translocating strand or at position 14 from the 5′ end of the translocating strand (Fig. 1). After annealing the appropriate strands, partial duplex DNAs were formed in which a 24 base-paired duplex was adjacent to a 6-nucleotide mismatched region followed by a 20-mer poly(dA) tail, ending in a 3′-OH. To form the site-specific DPC, an AP site was created by reaction with uracil DNA glycosylase followed by a reaction with T4-pdg in the presence of NaBH4 to reduce the covalent imine intermediate between the C1′ of the deoxyribose and the α-amino group of T4-pdg (29Dodson M.L.

This reaction is very efficient and results in 90–95% covalently bound product (Figs. 2A and 3A, the first lanes designated to DPC-containing DNA). dU-containing DNAs were used as controls in this study. Independent experiments were performed to confirm that UvrD unwinding activity was comparable for both uracil DNA glycosylase-treated and untreated DNA substrates (supplemental Fig. S4); these observations exclude the possibility that any of the differences observed between control (non-damaged) and DPC-containing DNA were caused by minor amounts of contaminating AP-containing DNA.FIGURE 3UvrD helicase activity on a DNA substrate containing DPC in the translocating strand. A, UvrD helicase activity on the non-damaged (50T-30T) and the damaged duplex substrate containing a DPC in the translocating strand. The 32P-labeled 30-mer oligodeoxynucleotide (30T) was annealed to the complementary 50-mer oligodeoxynucleotide (50T), and T4-pdg was covalently linked to the 50-mer strand. Reaction mixtures containing 1 nm concentrations of the indicated duplex DNA substrate and specified concentrations of UvrD were incubated at room temperature for 5 min under standard conditions.

Data in panel A demonstrate that UvrD was capable of unwinding DPC-containing DNA without any hindrance. Because the co-crystal structure of T4-pdg covalently bound to an AP site reveals that the protein bends the DNA to ∼70° and makes numerous contacts over ∼6 base pairs with both the strand to which it is bound and the complementary strand (38Golan G.

https://openalex.org/W2072199305,"The development of alternative strategies to prevent HIV infection is a global public health priority. Initial efforts in anti-HIV microbicide development have met with poor success as the strategies have relied on a non-specific mechanism of action. Here, we report the development of a microbicide aimed at specifically blocking HIV entry by displaying molecular components of the HIV/host cell attachment complex on the surface of Caulobacter crescentus, a harmless aquatic bacterium. This bacterium can be readily manipulated to present heterologous proteins at high density on its surface by genetic insertion into its crystalline surface layer protein [1], [2]. In separate constructions, we generated bacteria displaying domain 1 of CD4 and MIP1α. Each moiety reacted with specific antibodies by Western immunoblot and immuno-fluorescence microscopy. Microbicide functionality was assessed using an HIV pseudotype virus assay system representing Clade B subtypes. Bacteria displaying MIP1α reduced infectivity by 35–78% depending on the specific subtype while CD4 display reduced infection by as much as 56%. Combinations of both constructs reduced infectivity by nearly 98%. We demonstrated that HIV infection could be inhibited using a strategy aimed at HIV-specific molecular interactions with Caulobacter surface protein display, and that sufficient protein folding and conformation could be mimicked to bind and block entry. Further, this is the first demonstration that Caulobacter surface protein display may be a useful approach to preventing HIV infection or other viruses as a microbicide. We propose that this harmless bacterium, which is inexpensive to produce and formulate, might be suitable for topical applications as a viable alternative in the search for effective microbicides to counteract the world wide incidence of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2051834312,"Background The four and a half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) is capable of shuttling between focal adhesion and nucleus where it signals through direct interaction with a number of proteins including β-catenin. Although FHL2 activation has been found in various human cancers, evidence of its functional contribution to carcinogenesis has been lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have investigated the role of FHL2 in intestinal tumorigenesis in which activation of the Wnt pathway by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc) or in β-catenin constitutes the primary transforming event. In this murine model, introduction of a biallelic deletion of FHL2 into mutant ApcΔ14/+ mice substantially reduces the number of intestinal adenomas but not tumor growth, suggesting a role of FHL2 in the initial steps of tumorigenesis. In the lesions, Wnt signalling is not affected by FHL2 deficiency, remaining constitutively active. Nevertheless, loss of FHL2 activity is associated with increased epithelial cell migration in intestinal epithelium, which might allow to eliminate more efficiently deleterious cells and reduce the risk of tumorigenesis. This finding may provide a mechanistic basis for tumor suppression by FHL2 deficiency. In human colorectal carcinoma but not in low-grade dysplasia, we detected up-regulation and enhanced nuclear localization of FHL2, indicating the activation of FHL2 during the development of malignancy. Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate that FHL2 represents a critical factor in intestinal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995082893,"Background Barn owls integrate spatial information across frequency channels to localize sounds in space. Methodology/Principal Findings We presented barn owls with synchronous sounds that contained different bands of frequencies (3–5 kHz and 7–9 kHz) from different locations in space. When the owls were confronted with the conflicting localization cues from two synchronous sounds of equal level, their orienting responses were dominated by one of the sounds: they oriented toward the location of the low frequency sound when the sources were separated in azimuth; in contrast, they oriented toward the location of the high frequency sound when the sources were separated in elevation. We identified neural correlates of this behavioral effect in the optic tectum (OT, superior colliculus in mammals), which contains a map of auditory space and is involved in generating orienting movements to sounds. We found that low frequency cues dominate the representation of sound azimuth in the OT space map, whereas high frequency cues dominate the representation of sound elevation. Conclusions/Significance We argue that the dominance hierarchy of localization cues reflects several factors: 1) the relative amplitude of the sound providing the cue, 2) the resolution with which the auditory system measures the value of a cue, and 3) the spatial ambiguity in interpreting the cue. These same factors may contribute to the relative weighting of sound localization cues in other species, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2035427674,"A goal of sensory coding is to capture features of sensory input that are behaviorally relevant. Therefore, a generic principle of sensory coding should take into account the motor capabilities of an agent. Up to now, unsupervised learning of sensory representations with respect to generic coding principles has been limited to passively received sensory input. Here we propose an algorithm that reorganizes an agent's representation of sensory space by maximizing the predictability of sensory state transitions given a motor action. We applied the algorithm to the sensory spaces of a number of simple, simulated agents with different motor parameters, moving in two-dimensional mazes. We find that the optimization algorithm generates compact, isotropic representations of space, comparable to hippocampal place fields. As expected, the size and spatial distribution of these place fields-like representations adapt to the motor parameters of the agent as well as to its environment. The representations prove to be well suited as a basis for path planning and navigation. They not only possess a high degree of state-transition predictability, but also are temporally stable. We conclude that the coding principle of predictability is a promising candidate for understanding place field formation as the result of sensorimotor reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2049019227,"For many, the genetic code was to provide the key to understanding protein synthesis. For those with a bit more sophistication, it was the Shine-Dalgarno region (in prokaryotes) or scanning and the Kozak consensus sequence (in eukaryotes). In all of these, the answer was in the nucleic acid sequence of the mRNA and was based on the assumption of a single mechanism to explain translation initiation. However, like all of the macromolecular synthetic pathways, there have been two repetitive observations. First, they are considerably more complicated than anticipated, and second, there is not a single mechanism. Beginning in the late 1980s, it was becoming apparent that there were a number of “nonstandard” events associated with translation, especially in eukaryotic systems. Much of this fell under the description of “post-translational control of gene expression,” and many of the examples would, indeed, reflect changes in the initiation efficiency of specific mRNAs. More recent examples also reflect changes in mRNA stability, alternate splicing, or microRNAs. The intent of this minireview series is to prepare readers for the time when translation becomes a part of their research, especially for those interested in the regulation of gene expression as it relates to the basic mechanisms of processes, such as development and disease. I will initiate this minireview series with a general review of issues to be covered and will point to a number of issues that are either not like “globin mRNA” or for which there is currently no consensus. Among these issues are cap-dependent translation with long or structured 5′-untranslated regions, mRNAs with upstream open reading frames (How do they really work?), cellular IRES 2The abbreviation used is: IRESinternal ribosome entry site. elements (Do they really exist?), cross-talk of translation with the cell, etc. internal ribosome entry site. The next two articles will focus on “standard translation initiation studies” that relate to the mechanism and the use of genetics to evaluate translation in vivo. Michael Altmann and Patrick Linder will describe how the “awesome power of yeast genetics” has provided and will provide answers to the mechanisms involved in translation. To date, the mechanics of protein synthesis have been elucidated largely in vitro (and mostly using mammalian systems). However, much of our understanding of the regulation of this process has come from in vivo studies using yeast. Past examples include Thomas Donahue's work (SSL and SUI mutants), use of temperature-sensitive mutants, Alan Hinnebusch's study of the amino acid regulation of the transcription factor GCN4, and others. Jon Lorsch and Thomas Dever offer their perspectives on the biochemistry/structural biology findings relating to translation initiation. Although many are familiar with the almost heroic efforts that have resulted in the crystal structure of the bacterial ribosome, equally impressive data on the structure of ribosome/factor complexes and the complexity of the eukaryotic initiation pathway are emerging. For the first time, structure, function, and kinetics are being combined to explain the mechanism and regulation of protein-synthesis initiation. Most of the current in vivo studies use yeast or tissue culture cells. However, what does one do if one wants to consider a real, intact multicellular organism? What type of signals predominate, why is leucine the “magic amino acid,” and just how many signaling pathways might be at work to confound the investigator? The key feature is that multicellular organisms, especially mammalian systems, maintain homeostasis. Thus, attempts to isolate effects to specific organs have been challenging. Scot Kimball and Leonard Jefferson will provide us with insights into where new methodologies are needed to relate effects on protein synthesis to the overall goal/strategy of the organism for survival. The study of IRESs began with the groundbreaking work of Nahum Sonenberg, Eckard Wimmer, and their colleagues that examined the initiation of poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus mRNAs. Subsequent studies, mostly using mammalian systems, have examined the existence of cellular IRES elements that are present in normal cellular mRNAs. In stark contrast to progress in the characterization of viral IRESs, which has produced detailed molecular and even structural descriptions of several distinct mechanisms, the work with cellular IRES elements has been more refractory because they are generally inefficient. Wendy Gilbert will describe current studies in this area as well as her own efforts to identify and characterize IRES elements in yeast. The real task is to define the mRNAs with IRES elements and to begin to explore their regulation (IRES trans-acting factors anyone?) in vivo, and perhaps, sooner or later, in vitro. As is true for any key macromolecular pathway, protein synthesis seems to be a thermometer for cellular good health. A variety of signals trigger the alteration of protein synthesis, either as the absolute level of expression (i.e. as total amino acid incorporation) or as the relative alteration of expression of the population of mRNAs within the cell (as competition or as specific activation or repression of existing mRNAs). A commonly identified protein associated with such changes is eEF1A, the most abundant of the translation factors at about 2% of the total cellular protein. Maria Mateyak and Terri Goss Kinzy will describe many of their studies that link eEF1A function with cytoskeletal formation and more recent research that implicates this protein in regulating the interaction of the ribosome and the cell. Identifying the proteins that interact with eEF1A may explain concepts of localized translation and the influence of changes in cellular morphology on translation at different stages of the cell cycle. One of the potentially important new areas of research involves the role of small noncoding RNAs in cell growth and development and their use to manipulate the levels of gene expression in systems that do not have the genetic plasticity found in yeast. Although both small interfering RNAs and microRNAs are now part of the molecular biologist's toolbox, microRNAs have been associated with a variety of processes. An example is the recent work of Joan Steitz and her colleagues showing that microRNAs are either positive or negative regulators of gene expression. Timothy Nilsen will explore what has been learned about these RNAs and whether we might expect that there is a common mechanism for both or whether there might be a series of unique regulatory pathways. In an intriguing new area of research, progress is being made in determining the role of protein synthesis in learning. Previous efforts using drugs have shown that unlike short term memory, long term memory requires protein synthesis. How does this work? With the recent advances in understanding the mechanism of protein synthesis and the characterization of the proteins/factors that are required, it is now possible to examine what proteins are involved in this process. Nahum Sonenberg, Christos Gkogkas, and Mauro Costa-Mattioli will review our current knowledge and some suggestions as to where research is going in terms of examining learning at the molecular level. How long will it be before we have a real mechanistic interpretation, and how might we get there? The GCN2−/− mouse is a start. What is next? Finally, we will present a recap of this year's Nobel Prize awards for the structure of the ribosome. Although much of the early work from the laboratories of Ada Yonath and Thomas Steitz focused on the structure of the bacterial ribosome in the absence of protein synthesis components, the Venki Ramakrishnan group provided mechanistic insights into the catalytic workings on the surface of the bacterial ribosome. One of the participants in this Nobel effort, Dr. Poul Nissen, and his colleague Charlotte Knudsen, will provide us with an update of the current workings of the ribosome as it relates to the molecular enzymology of protein biosynthesis. The variety of events that affect the regulation of translation, specifically or globally, and the site-specific translation of proteins (as best evidenced in neurons) have led to exceptionally diverse patterns of expression of proteins. These, coupled with the already known controls at the level of transcription, mRNA processing, and mRNA turnover (at the level of macromolecular events) and the post-translational modifications that alter enzyme/factor activities, ensure that multicellular organisms have many mechanisms to control growth and development and to maintain homeostasis."
