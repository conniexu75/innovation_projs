Here we show that TOR deficiency in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans more than doubles its natural lifespan. This new function for TOR signalling in ageing control may represent a link between nutrition, metabolism and longevity."

https://openalex.org/W2053982496,"The erosion of mountain belts controls their topographic and structural evolution1,2,3 and is the main source of sediment delivered to the oceans4. Mountain erosion rates have been estimated from current relief and precipitation, but a more complete evaluation of the controls on erosion rates requires detailed measurements across a range of timescales. Here we report erosion rates in the Taiwan mountains estimated from modern river sediment loads, Holocene river incision and thermochronometry on a million-year scale. Estimated erosion rates within the actively deforming mountains are high (3–6 mm yr-1) on all timescales, but the pattern of erosion has changed over time in response to the migration of localized tectonic deformation. Modern, decadal-scale erosion rates correlate with historical seismicity and storm-driven runoff variability. The highest erosion rates are found where rapid deformation, high storm frequency and weak substrates coincide, despite low topographic relief."

https://openalex.org/W2107731318,"Physical processes that could facilitate coherent control of light propagation are under active exploration. In addition to their fundamental interest, these efforts are stimulated by practical possibilities, such as the development of a quantum memory for photonic states. Controlled localization and storage of photonic pulses may also allow novel approaches to manipulating of light via enhanced nonlinear optical processes. Recently, electromagnetically induced transparency was used to reduce the group velocity of propagating light pulses and to reversibly map propagating light pulses into stationary spin excitations in atomic media. Here we describe and experimentally demonstrate a technique in which light propagating in a medium of Rb atoms is converted into an excitation with localized, stationary electromagnetic energy, which can be held and released after a controllable interval. Our method creates pulses of light with stationary envelopes bound to an atomic spin coherence, offering new possibilities for photon state manipulation and nonlinear optical processes at low light levels."
https://openalex.org/W2070098406,"The synthesis of triglycerides is catalyzed by two known acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes. Although they catalyze the same biochemical reaction, these enzymes share no sequence homology, and their relative functions are poorly understood. Gene knockout studies in mice have revealed that DGAT1 contributes to triglyceride synthesis in tissues and plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism but is not essential for life. Here we show that DGAT2 plays a fundamental role in mammalian triglyceride synthesis and is required for survival. DGAT2-deficient (Dgat2-/-) mice are lipopenic and die soon after birth, apparently from profound reductions in substrates for energy metabolism and from impaired permeability barrier function in the skin. DGAT1 was unable to compensate for the absence of DGAT2, supporting the hypothesis that the two enzymes play fundamentally different roles in mammalian triglyceride metabolism.

Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) are the major storage form of energy in eukaryotic organisms. However, excessive deposition of triglycerides in white adipose tissue (WAT) 1The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; DGAT, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; BAT, brown adipose tissue; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; C/EPBα, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; E, embryonic day. leads to obesity and in non-adipose tissues (such as pancreatic β cells, skeletal muscle, and liver) is associated with tissue dysfunction referred to as lipotoxicity (1Unger R.H.

Therefore, an understanding of the processes that mediate triglyceride synthesis is of significant biomedical importance. Triglycerides are synthesized from diacylglycerol and activated forms of fatty acids (fatty acyl-CoAs) in a reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes (3Bell R.M.

Both DGAT1 and DGAT2 are ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels of expression found in tissues that are active in triglyceride synthesis, such as WAT, small intestine, liver, and mammary gland (6Cases S.

Both enzymes are intrinsic membrane proteins, although DGAT1 has 6-12 putative transmembrane domains, whereas DGAT2 has one. Both also have similarly broad fatty acyl-CoA substrate specificities in in vitro assays (7Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol.

However, despite their ability to catalyze similar reactions, DGAT1 and DGAT2 belong to different gene families that share neither DNA nor protein sequence similarity. DGAT1 is homologous to the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase enzymes, ACAT1 and ACAT2, which are involved in cholesterol ester biosynthesis (6Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R.

Insights into the functions of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in triglyceride metabolism have been provided by studies in yeast. Through deletion and overexpression studies, several groups have demonstrated that DGA1, the yeast homologue of DGAT2, is the major DGAT enzyme contributing to triglyceride synthesis and storage in yeast (14Oelkers P. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8877-8881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Sorger D. Daum G. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6478-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In contrast, ARE2, a yeast homologue of DGAT1, plays a minor role in triglyceride synthesis. Interestingly, mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains devoid of DGAT activity and lacking triglycerides are viable and grow normally, indicating that triglycerides are not essential for the survival of this yeast. However, a recent study showed that triglyceride synthesis is essential for viability of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (17Zhang Q. Chieu H.K. Low C.P. Zhang S. Heng C.K. Yang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47145-47155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological functions of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in mammalian triglyceride metabolism, we used gene knockout approaches in mice. Mice lacking DGAT1 (Dgat1-/- mice) are viable and have reduced triglycerides in tissues, including WAT (18Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H.

Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Dgat1-/- mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity through a mechanism involving increased energy expenditure (18Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) and also exhibit increased sensitivity to leptin and insulin (19Chen H.C. Smith S.J. Ladha Z. Jensen D.R. Ferreira L.D. Pulawa L.K. McGuire J.G. Pitas R.E. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 20Chen H.C. Ladha Z. Farese Jr., R.V. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2893-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that DGAT1 plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism. However, the effects of DGAT1 deficiency on triglyceride metabolism in general are not profound. For example, plasma triglyceride levels in Dgat1-/- mice are normal, and significant amounts of triglycerides are present in their tissues, including WAT. These findings suggest that other triglyceride-synthesizing enzymes participate in energy homeostasis. To understand the role of DGAT2 in triglyceride synthesis and energy homeostasis, we generated Dgat2-/- mice. Our results indicate that DGAT2 is the DGAT responsible for the majority of triglyceride synthesis in mice and provide significant insights into the functional differences between DGAT1 and DGAT2. Generation of Stable DGAT1- and DGAT2-expressing Cell Lines—McArdle rat hepatoma (McA-RH7777) cells from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Mouse DGAT1 and DGAT2 with N-terminal FLAG epitopes (MGDYKDDDDG, epitope underlined) were cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For transfections, 1 μg of pcDNA3.1 expression vector containing DGAT1, DGAT2, or LacZ was incubated with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) for 20 min, and the mixture was added to a 60-mm culture dish containing 2 ml of medium and cells at ∼50% confluence. After 48 h, transfected cells were split 1:4 and cultured in growth medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 to generate G418-resistant colonies. Cell lines stably expressing DGAT1 and DGAT2 were identified by immunoblotting of cell lysates with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by detection with SuperSignal West Pico Detection kit (Pierce). Generation of DGAT2-deficient Mice—DGAT2 genomic fragments were amplified by PCR from 129/SvJae mouse genomic DNA with primers derived from the mouse DGAT2 cDNA sequence. A replacement type targeting vector was constructed in pNTKloxP (a gift from Joachim Herz, University of Texas, Dallas, TX) by subcloning a ∼1-kb short arm containing sequences upstream of exon 3 and a ∼5-kb long arm containing sequences downstream of exon 4. This construct was used to produce DGAT2-targeted 129/SvJae embryonic stem cells, which were then used to generate mice carrying the mutation. The disruption of the Dgat2 gene was confirmed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA digested with EcoRI and a probe located upstream of the vector sequences (described in Fig. 2a). Dgat2-/- mice for use in this study were generated by intercrossing Dgat2+/- mice of mixed genetic background (50% C57BL/6J and 129/SvJae). Dgat2+/- mice were also crossed with transgenic mice that constitutively express Cre recombinase (21Meyers E.N. Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) to remove neo from the allele. Dgat2-/- mice lacking the neo gene had the same phenotype as Dgat2-/- mice with neo. Mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility (12 h light/12 h dark cycle) and fed a standard chow diet. All experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Research of the University of California, San Francisco. Gene Expression Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from tissues (RNA STAT, Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX), and samples (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed into cDNA with oligo(dT)12-18 and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Each 30-μl PCR contained 1 μl of cDNA, 15 μl of 2× QuantiTect SYBR green master mixture (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 10 pmol each of forward and reverse primer, and 0.5 μl of 1 μm fluorescein. Real-time PCR was performed and analyzed with the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Expression levels were normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA.

The skin was then chilled on ice and the epidermis was quickly peeled away from the dermis. Both tissues were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until RNA was extracted. DGAT Activity Assays—Liver and brown adipose tissue from newborn mice were separately homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 250 mm sucrose by 10 strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem tissue homogenizer. Cell debris and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (10-50 μg of protein) was used for in vitro DGAT activity assays, performed as described (7Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), with either 20 or 100 mm MgCl2 in the assay buffer. Blood Chemistries—Plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations were measured with colorimetric kit assays (Triglycerides GPO and Free Fatty Half-Micro Test, Roche Diagnostics). Plasma glucose levels were determined with a glucometer (Accu-chek, Roche Diagnostics). Lipid Analyses—Lipids were extracted from total carcass or tissue homogenates in ClCH3:MeOH (2:1) and separated by thin-layer chromatography with the solvent system hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1) on Silica Gel G-60 TLC plates. Lipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor or charred by dipping the plate into a solution of 10% cupric sulfate and 8% phosphoric acid and heating to 180 °C. Triglyceride mass was quantified by the method of Snyder and Stephens (22Snyder F. Stephens N.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) with triolein as a standard. To visualize neutral lipid droplets in intact cells, cells were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min and then stained with 0.1 μg/ml Nile Red in acetone for 5 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, and coverslips were mounted with a drop of PBS. Fluorescence was visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate optics. For compositional analyses, lipids were extracted from newborn mouse carcasses, plasma, and skin and from milk produced by DGAT2-heterzygote females. Methyl esters of milk and carcass triglycerides and plasma lipids were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as described (19Chen H.C. Smith S.J. Ladha Z. Jensen D.R. Ferreira L.D. Pulawa L.K. McGuire J.G. Pitas R.E. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In other experiments, the composition of lipids in the plasma and liver was determined by high-throughput methods developed by Lipomics. The lipids from plasma (200 μl) and liver (25 mg) were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) in the presence of authentic internal standards by the method of Folch et al. (23Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual lipid classes within the extract were separated by preparative TLC as described by Watkins et al. (24Watkins S.M. Lin T.Y. Davis R.M. Ching J.R. DePeters E.J. Halpern G.M. Walzem R.L. German J.B. Lipids. 2001; 36: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Isolated lipid classes were trans-esterified in 3 n methanolic HCl in a sealed vial under a nitrogen atmosphere at 100 °C for 45 min. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane containing 0.05% butylated hydroxytoluene and prepared for gas chromatography by sealing the hexane extracts under nitrogen. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated and quantified by capillary gas chromatography using a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard model 6890, Wilmington, DE) equipped with a 30-m DB-225MS capillary column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) and a flame-ionization detector as described (24Watkins S.M.

Acylceramide levels in skin lipids were measured by TLC after lipid extraction (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The following one-dimensional, high-performance TLC systems provided optimal separation and quantification of ceramide and glucosylceramide species for subsequent scanning densitometry: (i) chloroform:methanol:water (40:10:1, v/v) to 2 and 5 cm, successively; (ii) chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (94:4:1.5, v/v) to the top; and (iii) n-hexane:diethyether:acetic acid (65:35:1, v/v). After final development, the plates were dried, cooled, dipped in charring solution (1.5% cupric sulfate in acetic acid:sulfuric acid:orthophosphoric acid:water (50:10:10:30, v/v)), and charred at 160 °C for 15 min. Lipids were quantified with a CAMAG scanning densitometer (CAMAG Scientific, Wilmington, NC) (26Holleran W.M. Man M.Q. Gao W.N. Menon G.K. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Triglyceride Synthesis in Intact Liver Cells—Livers were removed from newborn mice, cut into small pieces, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in 5 ml of 2% collagenase (Sigma) and 1% bovine serum albumin in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. Cells were washed twice with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, resuspended in 5 ml of medium, and plated in a 60-mm culture dish. Cell viability was 80-90% as assessed by staining with trypan blue. After 2 h, 1 ml of fresh medium containing 10 μCi of [3H]glycerol ± 0.5 mm oleate, 0.5% bovine serum albumin was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight. Lipids were then extracted from cells and separated by TLC, and the incorporation of radiolabel into triglyceride and phospholipid was determined. Histological Analyses—Newborn mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldeyde in PBS overnight, embedded in paraffin, cut into sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To visualize neutral lipids in liver and brown adipose tissue (BAT), tissues were snap-frozen in OCT and isopentane, sectioned, and stained with Oil Red O. For ultrastructural studies, skin biopsy and scale samples were minced into 1-mm3 pieces and fixed overnight (16 h) at 4 °C in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde with 0.06% calcium chloride in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). Specimens were then placed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer at 4 °C until further processing. Portions of each tissue sample were then placed in either 0.2% ruthenium tetroxide or 1.5% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) with 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4), at room temperature in the dark for 45 min (27Madison K.C.

After rinsing with buffer, tissue samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and subsequently embedded in a low viscosity, epoxy resin containing DER 736 and Epon 812. Thin sections were stained with lead citrate and/or uranyl acetate and examined with a Zeiss 10A electron microscope (Zeiss, Thornville, NY) operating at 60 kV. Liver Glycogen—Livers were digested with 5 n KOH and treated with saturated sodium sulfate and ethanol to isolate glycogen granules. Samples were boiled in 2 n HCl and neutralized with 4 n KOH and 0.1 m triethylamine to release glucose. Glycogen-derived glucose was measured with a plasma glucose assay kit (Sigma 115-A). Skin Barrier Function Assays—Newborn mice were rinsed in PBS and successively dehydrated in 25, 50, 75, and 100% methanol for 1 min each. Mice were then rehydrated with PBS and stained in 0.1% toluidine blue in PBS for 10 min, destained with PBS for 20 min, and then photographed. All steps were at room temperature. Transepidermal water loss was measured with an electrolytic water analyzer (MEECO, Warrington, PA) (29Grubauer G. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 323-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because mice were housed in different locations, two different instruments were used to measure water loss from newborn mice and mice that received skin grafts. These instruments had different sensitivities, providing different ranges of absolute transepidermal water loss measurements. Skin surface temperature was measured with a digital thermometer (model 4600; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). Mouse Skin Grafts—Full-thickness skin pieces (∼1 cm2) were obtained from newborn wild-type and Dgat2-/- pups and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Wild-type and Dgat2-/- skin was grafted onto the left and right sides of athymic nude mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), respectively, onto a wound created by removing a similar-sized piece of full-thickness skin. Wound edges were sutured and mice were allowed to recover. Mouse chow was supplemented with tablets (SCID's MD, Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) containing sulfamethoxazole (60 mg/tablet) and trimethoprim (10 mg/tablet). Three weeks after transplantation, fur was removed from the grafts and transepidermal water loss was measured as described above. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. For parametric data, means were compared by t test or by analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. For nonparametric data, the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Overexpression of DGAT2 Promotes Triglyceride Storage in Cultured Cells—To examine the roles of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in cellular triglyceride metabolism, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged mouse DGAT1 (∼50-kDa) and DGAT2 (∼42-kDa) in McA-RH7777 cells. In these stably transfected cell lines, DGAT1 protein levels were considerably higher than DGAT2 levels (Fig. 1a). This was reflected by DGAT activity levels, as measured by in vitro assays, which were 11- and 3-fold higher in DGAT1- and DGAT2-overexpressing cells, respectively, than in LacZ-transfected control cells (Fig. 1b). However, triglyceride synthesis measured by the incorporation of [3H]glycerol into triglyceride in cells was 2-fold higher in DGAT2- than in DGAT1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1c). Additionally, the intracellular triglyceride mass was 4-fold higher in DGAT2- than in DGAT1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1d). In DGAT2-transfected cells, the intracellular triglyceride accumulated in large cytosolic lipid droplets (Fig. 1e). In DGAT1-transfected cells, lipid droplets were also present but considerably smaller. These results suggested that DGAT2 activity potently contributes to the synthesis and storage of intracellular triglycerides. Generation of DGAT2-deficient Mice—To test the role of DGAT2 in triglyceride synthesis and storage in vivo, we generated Dgat2-/- mice. A gene-targeting vector was designed to replace exons 3 and 4 of murine Dgat2, regions that are highly conserved in DGAT2 gene family members, with neo (Fig. 2a). This vector was used to generate embryonic stem cells and, subsequently, mice carrying the targeted allele. Homozygous disruption of Dgat2 in mice was demonstrated by Southern blotting of mouse genomic DNA (Fig. 2b). DGAT2 mRNA expression in BAT and livers of newborn Dgat2-/- mice was reduced by 80-90% (Fig. 2c). The residual Dgat2 mRNA in Dgat2-/- tissues was nonfunctional. Amplification and sequencing of the transcript showed that exons 3 and 4 were deleted, resulting in the introduction of a premature stop codon. A protein produced from this allele would be severely truncated (112 amino acids instead of 387) with 29 novel amino acids. DGAT activity was reduced by 53 and 35% in Dgat2-/- liver and BAT homogenates, respectively, when the in vitro assay mixture contained 20 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 2d). The lesser reduction in DGAT activity in BAT may reflect higher expression of murine Dgat1 in BAT than in liver. 2S. Stone, unpublished results. No reduction in DGAT activity was found in Dgat2-/- liver and BAT when the assay mixture contained 100 mm MgCl2, a condition that selectively measures DGAT1 activity (7Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P.

DGAT activity levels in tissues of wild-type and Dgat2+/- mice were similar in assays using 20 mm MgCl2. Triglyceride Synthesis by DGAT2 Is Essential for Energy Homeostasis—Offspring from heterozygote intercrosses were found in the expected Mendelian distribution (wild-type, n = 14; Dgat2+/-, n = 29; Dgat2-/-, n = 14; p = 0.999 by χ2 test). Although Dgat2+/- mice were healthy and indistinguishable from wild-type mice, Dgat2-/- mice were smaller (Fig. 2e), rarely suckled, and died 2-24 h after birth. Necrosis of the tail developed in Dgat2-/- mice that survived for 8-24 h. Newborn Dgat2-/- mice weighed 20% less (1.13 ± 0.12 versus 1.41 ± 0.14 g, n = 16-18, p < 0.001) and were 15% shorter (2.5 ± 0.11 versus 2.9 ± 0.09 mm, n = 3-5, p < 0.001) than wild-type littermates, suggesting intrauterine growth retardation. Fetal Dgat2-/- mice had a 14% reduction in body weight at embryonic day (E) 18.5 (0.97 ± 0.09 versus 1.13 ± 0.08 g for wild-type embryos, n = 4, p = 0.04). At E12.5, there was no difference in the size of wild-type and Dgat2-/- embryos, indicating that growth retardation occurred later in development. Levels of mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1, a marker of intrauterine fetal nutrition whose levels are inversely correlated with birth weight (30Holt R.I.

Open table in a new tab To explore the role of DGAT enzymes in mouse embryonic development, we examined the expression levels of DGAT2 and DGAT1 in yolk sac, placenta, and embryos at E9.5, E13.5, and E18.5. Whereas DGAT1 expression was highest in the placenta, DGAT2 was expressed at the highest level in the yolk sac (Fig. 3, a and b). At E12.5, Dgat2-/- embryos had an 86% reduction in tissue triglycerides (not shown), suggesting that DGAT2 deficiency results in a defect in the ability of embryos to synthesize and store triglycerides at or before this stage of fetal development. To investigate the early postnatal lethality of Dgat2-/- mice, we examined their substrates for energy metabolism. The plasma levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids, and glucose were 70-90% lower in newborn Dgat2-/- mice (Fig. 4, a-c) than in Dgat2+/- and wild-type mice. Plasma glucose levels were also reduced by 68% in E18.5 Dgat2-/- embryos (Fig. 4c). Hepatic glycogen levels were similar in wild-type and Dgat2-/- em"

https://openalex.org/W1986992441,"It is unclear when, where and how novel pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), monkeypox and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will cross the barriers that separate their natural reservoirs from human populations and ignite the epidemic spread of novel infectious diseases. New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population and to generate subsequent human-to-human transmission. Effective human-to-human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R(0), should exceed one, where R(0) is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population. However, an increase in R(0), even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution to R(0) > 1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly."

https://openalex.org/W2063522637,"Past studies of tectonically active mountain ranges have suggested strong coupling and feedbacks between climate, tectonics and topography1,2,3,4,5. For example, rock uplift generates topographic relief, thereby enhancing precipitation, which focuses erosion and in turn influences rates and spatial patterns of further rock uplift. Although theoretical links between climate, erosion and uplift have received much attention2,6,7,8,9,10, few studies have shown convincing correlations between observable indices of these processes on mountain-range scales11,12. Here we show that strongly varying long-term (>106–107 yr) erosion rates inferred from apatite (U–Th)/He cooling ages across the Cascades mountains of Washington state closely track modern mean annual precipitation rates. Erosion and precipitation rates vary over an order of magnitude across the range with maxima of 0.33 mm yr-1 and 3.5 m yr-1, respectively, with both maxima located 50 km west (windward) of the topographic crest of the range. These data demonstrate a strong coupling between precipitation and long-term erosion rates on the mountain-range scale. If the range is currently in topographic steady state, rock uplift on the west flank is three to ten times faster than elsewhere in the range, possibly in response to climatically focused erosion."

https://openalex.org/W2076982249,"In the context of materials science, texture describes the statistical distribution of grain orientations. It is an important characteristic of the microstructure of polycrystalline films, determining various electrical, magnetic and mechanical properties. Three types of texture component are usually distinguished in thin films: random texture, when grains have no preferred orientation; fibre texture, for which one crystallographic axis of the film is parallel to the substrate normal, while there is a rotational degree of freedom around the fibre axis; and epitaxial alignment (or in-plane texture) on single-crystal substrates, where an in-plane alignment fixes all three axes of the grain with respect to the substrate. Here we report a fourth type of texture--which we call axiotaxy--identified from complex but symmetrical patterns of lines on diffraction pole figures for thin films formed by solid-state reactions. The texture is characterized by the alignment of planes in the film and substrate that share the same d-spacing. This preferred alignment of planes across the interface manifests itself as a fibre texture lying off-normal to the sample surface, with the fibre axis perpendicular to certain planes in the substrate. This texture forms because it results in an interface, which is periodic in one dimension, preserved independently of interfacial curvature. This new type of preferred orientation may be the dominant type of texture for a wide class of materials and crystal structures."

https://openalex.org/W2047482683,"Two general pathways for cell death have been defined, apoptosis and necrosis. Previous studies in Jurkat cells have demonstrated that the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) is required for Fas-mediated signaling to apoptosis and necrosis. Here we developed L929rTA cell lines that allow Tet-on inducible expression and FK506-binding protein (FKBP)-mediated dimerization of FADD, FADD-death effector domain (FADD-DED), or FADD-death domain (FADD-DD). We show that expression and dimerization of FADD leads to necrosis. However, pretreatment of the cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), reverts FKBP-FADD-induced necrosis to apoptosis. Expression and dimerization of FADD-DD mediates necrotic cell death. We found that FADD-DD is able to bind RIP1, another protein necessary for Fas-mediated necrosis. Expression and dimerization of FADD-DED initiates apoptosis. Remarkably, in the presence of caspase inhibitors, FADD-DED mediates necrotic cell death. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that FADD-DED in the absence procaspase-8 C/A is also capable of recruiting RIP1.

Depending on the cell type, cellular context, or stimulus, a cell may die by apoptosis or necrosis (1Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is characterized by membrane blebbing, shrinking and condensing of the cell and its organelles, and internucleosomal DNA degradation. Finally, the cell disintegrates, and apoptotic bodies are phagocytosed by professional phagocytes or neighboring cells, in most cases without any detrimental effect on the surrounding tissue (2Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12826) Google Scholar, 3Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6721) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is generally considered a process that depends on a family of cysteine proteases called caspases (4Lamkanfi M. Declercq W. Depuydt B. Kalai M. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Los M. Walczak H. Caspases: Their Role in Cell Death and Cell Survival. Landes Bioscience, Kluwer Academic Press, Georgetown, TX2003: 1-40Google Scholar). Necrosis is characterized by swelling of the cell and its organelles and results in disruption of the cell membrane and cell lysis, often accompanied by inflammation due to release of the cellular contents (1Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 5Denecker G. Vercammen D. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 356-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although apoptosis and necrosis have clearly distinguished morphological and biochemical features, they can be initiated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR1, 55-kDa TNF receptor; CrmA, cytokine response modifier A; DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; PI, propidium iodide; RIP1, receptor-interacting protein 1; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; FS, forward scatter; SS, side scatter; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR1, 55-kDa TNF receptor; CrmA, cytokine response modifier A; DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; PI, propidium iodide; RIP1, receptor-interacting protein 1; zVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; FS, forward scatter; SS, side scatter; HA, hemagglutinin. or by Fas, depending on the cellular context. In L929sAhFas cells, TNF signals to necrotic cell death, whereas anti-Fas treatment of the same cells leads to apoptosis (6Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Although pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) inhibits anti-Fas-induced apoptosis, the cells nevertheless die necrotically (6Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that TNFR1-induced necrosis is reverted to apoptosis by pretreatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which leads to the proteasome-dependent degradation of Hsp90 client proteins such as receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) (7Vanden Berghe T. Kalai M. van Loo G. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, both death domain-containing receptors, TNFR1 and Fas, can initiate apoptotic and necrotic cell death depending on the cellular context. The Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), which is recruited to the receptor through its carboxy-terminal “death domain” (DD), is a key adaptor protein in death receptor-induced apoptosis (8Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar, 9Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

The amino-terminal “death effector domain” (DED) of FADD interacts with a homologous DED within the prodomain of caspase-8 (10Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar), providing a platform for caspase-8 activation and consecutive downstream caspase activation either directly or through the cleavage of Bid and mitochondrial cytochrome c release (12Li H.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). The role of FADD in TNFR1- and Fas-induced necrosis is still not defined. In FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, TNFR1-induced apoptosis is blocked, and the cells die via a necrotic pathway. However, both cell death pathways are blocked when these cells are exposed to Fas ligand (14Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J.

This suggests that TNFR1-induced necrosis can occur independently of FADD, whereas Fas-induced necrosis cannot. In a previous study we showed by transient transfection experiments that overexpression of FADD-DN (amino acids 79-208) lacking the intact DED (8Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar) is cytotoxic to L929sA cells in a CrmA-insensitive way, whereas overexpression of FADD-DED (amino acids 1-111) containing the DED is toxic in a CrmA inhibitory way (16Boone E.

In another study using a caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cell line, it was shown that FADD is involved in signaling to necrotic cell death (17Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J.

Stably transfected cells were selected for 3 weeks in medium containing 350 units/ml hygromycin. Individual colonies were analyzed for FKBP2-link-FADD, FKBP2-link-FADD-DED, and FKBP2-link-FADD-DD expression by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. All hygromycin-resistant cell clones showed considerable expression of transfected FADD constructs after induction with doxycycline for at least 6 h. Cell Death Assay and Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cells were seeded at 2 × 105/well in uncoated 24-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified air incubator. The next day cells were treated with doxycycline, AP1510, and inhibitors as indicated. Generally, cells were treated with doxycycline for 4-24 h in combination with AP1510 (1 μm, 4-8 h after doxycycline administration). zVAD-fmk was added 2 h before AP1510 administration, whereas geldanamycin was added 18 h before AP1510 administration. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Loss of cell membrane integrity was determined using the PI exclusion method (excitation at 488 nm and detection at 610 nm) as reported previously (7Vanden Berghe T. Kalai M. van Loo G. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells containing hypoploid DNA was determined by PI-staining of cells after one freeze-thaw cycle to permeabilize cells, as described (25Vercammen D. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were seeded at 2 × 105/well in 6-well plates. The next day, doxycycline and AP1510 were added to the cells as described above. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in caspase lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm leupeptin). For cytosolic cytochrome c detection cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized in 0.02% digitonin dissolved in cell-free system buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mml-glutamine, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (Roche Applied Science) and left on ice for 1 min. This treatment allows selective lysis of the outer cell membrane without affecting the organelle membranes. All lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min and stored at 4 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Proteins were visualized with the chemiluminescence Renaissance reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after incubation of the membranes with primary and secondary antibodies. Fluorometric Assay for Caspase-3-like Activity—Caspase activity was measured by incubating 25 μg of cell lysate with 50 μm fluorogenic substrate acetyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-aminomethylcoumarin (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) in 150 μl of CFS buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 5 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The release of fluorescent 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was monitored for 1 h at 37 °C at 2-min time intervals in a fluorometer (CytoFluor, PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Data are expressed as the increase in fluorescence as a function of time (ΔF/min). Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments—293T cells were seeded in 9-cm plates at 1.2 × 106 cells/plate 1 day before transfection with the indicated expression vectors, viz. HA-tagged FADD, FADD-DED, and FADD-DD in FKBP-containing pCMF2E plasmid, E-tagged mouse procaspase-8 C347A in pCAGGS, and His/V5-tagged RIP1 in pEF1. To avoid secondary effects resulting from cytotoxicity we used a catalytically inactive form of procaspase-8 (C347A) called procaspase-8 C/A. 18 h after transfection cells were treated for 15 min with the dimerizer AP1510, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet-P40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates (500 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-HA antibody and then exposed to protein G-Sepharose beads prewashed with lysis buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin. After overnight rotation at 4 °C, immune complexes were eluted by boiling in 1× Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by Western blotting using HRP-conjugated anti-E tag and anti-V5 antibodies. Generation of L929rTA-inducible Cells Sensitive to FADD Oligomerization—To study the role of FADD in apoptotic and necrotic cell death we established stably transfected FADD-inducible L929rTA cell lines. L929rTA cells expressing a mutant tetracycline repressor protein (22Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 23Vanhoenacker P. Gommeren W. Luyten W.H.M.L. Leysen J.E. Haegeman G. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1999; 3: 301-310Google Scholar) were transfected with cDNA coding for human FADD, FADD-DED (amino acids 1-111), or FADD-DD (amino acids 79-208) under the control of a minimal cytomegalovirus promotor and the tetracycline operator sequences. The addition of doxycycline, a potent tetracycline derivative, results in the binding of the transactivator to the tetracycline operator sequence, allowing transcriptional activation of the FADD constructs. In the constructs used the cDNAs of the FADD variants were fused to two copies of FKBP (FK506-binding protein), analogous to the approach used by Kawahara et al. (17Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), allowing conditional oligomerization using a synthetic dimerizer AP1510 (19Amara J.F. Clackson T. Rivera V.M. Guo T. Keenan T. Natesan S. Pollock R. Yang W. Courage N.L. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10618-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To ensure flexibility of the FADD constructs, we added a six-amino acid linker/spacer (GS-GGGS) between the cognate FKBP modules and the FADD cDNAs (26Fan L. Freeman K.W. Khan T. Pham E. Spencer D.M. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2273-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The addition of doxycycline and AP1510 induced the expression and oligomerization of the respective FADD-constructs (Fig. 1B), leading to cell death (Fig. 1C). TNF treatment demonstrated that the different cell lines retained a comparable sensitivity to TNFR1-induced necrosis (Fig. 1D). FADD-DED-mediated Apoptosis versus FADD-DD-mediated Necrosis in L929rTA—To examine which type of cell death is induced through the oligomerization of full-length FADD and FADD deletion mutants, the corresponding L929rTA cells were treated with doxycycline and AP1510, and morphology was examined by light microscopy. FADD and FADD-DD oligomerization induced the cytoplasmic swelling typical of necrosis, whereas FADD-DED oligomerization induced a typical apoptotic morphology characterized by membrane blebbing and the formation of apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2A). Next, we analyzed the enzymatic activity and proteolytic processing of caspase-3. When treated with doxycycline and AP1510, caspase-3 enzymatic activity was detected in L929rTA cells expressing FKBP-FADD-DED but not in cells expressing full-length FKBP-FADD or the FKBP-FADD-DD mutant (Fig. 2B). Moreover, proteolysis of the 32-kDa procaspase-3 and generation of the 17-kDa fragment typical of the active caspase were observed in FKBP-FADD-DED cells but not in FKBP-FADD and FKBP-FADD-DD cells (Fig. 2C), although massive cell death occurred in all of these cell lines (Fig. 1C). This proteolytic activation of caspase-3 in cells expressing FKBP-FADD-DED was accompanied by the cleavage of the 23-kDa Bcl-2-family protein Bid to its truncated 15-kDa form and the cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, as demonstrated by the loss of the 110-kDa full-length protein (Fig. 2C). Moreover, appearance of hypoploid nuclei, a parameter for apoptotic cell death (27Denecker G. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Vanden Berghe T. Brouckaert G. Van Loo G. Zhivotovsky B. Fiers W. Grooten J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), was only observed after FKBP-FADD-DED induction and oligomerization (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that induction and oligomerization of FKBP-FADD-DED induce a caspase-dependent apoptosis, whereas induction and oligomerization of FKBP-FADD and FKBP-FADD-DD result in a caspase-independent necrotic cell death. Blocking of Caspases by zVAD-fmk Shifts FADD-DED-mediated Apoptosis to Necrosis—Changes in cellular morphology and granularity of dying cells were also evaluated by flow fluorocytometry (Fig. 3A). Necrosis correlates with a small decrease in the forward-scatter (FS) and an increase in the side-scatter (SS) of the PI-positive population (red dots) compared with control cells. Apoptosis is associated with a decrease in both parameters (7Vanden Berghe T. Kalai M. van Loo G. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28Kalai M. Van Loo G. Vanden Berghe T. Meeus A. Burm W. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The FS/SS profile of PI-positive FKBP-FADD and FKBP-FADD-DD cells after doxycycline and AP1510 treatment was reminiscent of necrotic cell death, whereas induction and oligomerization of FKBP-FADD-DED resulted in decreased FS and SS, typical for apoptosis (Fig. 3A). These flow fluorocytometric analyses are in accord with the light microscopic morphology of the cells. L929sAhFas cells die by necrosis when Fas-induced apoptotic death was blocked using caspase inhibitors (6Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Interestingly, induction and oligomerization of FKBP-FADD-DED in the presence of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk also resulted in a switch from apoptosis to necrosis, as demonstrated by the forward-scatter and side-scatter pattern of the PI-positive population (red dots) (Fig. 3A) and by the absence of a hypoploid DNA pattern (Fig. 3B). Thus, FADD-DED kills cells via an apoptotic pathway, but if caspases are blocked the cells respond by a caspase-independent necrotic pathway. FADD-induced Necrosis Reverts to Apoptosis by Blocking Hsp90 Function—Recently, we showed that pretreatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin leads to degradation of Hsp90 client proteins such as RIP1 and reverts TNFR1-induced necrosis to apoptosis (7Vanden Berghe T. Kalai M. van Loo G. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A similar switch was observed after induction and oligomerization of FKBP-FADD in the presence of geldanamycin, illustrated by the appearance of a hypoploid DNA pattern (Fig. 4A). Necrosis induced by FKBP-FADD-DD oligomerization was moderately delayed by geldanamycin, but no shift to apoptosis was observed (Fig. 4B). These results clearly demonstrate that depending on the cellular context, FADD can induce necrotic or apoptotic cell death, whereas FADD-DD only signals to necrosis. FADD-DED Preferentially Recruits Procaspase-8 C/A, whereas FADD-DD Only Recruits RIP1—To identify the initiator molecules recruited to the dimerized FKBP-FADD-DED and FKBP-FADD-DD complexes, we immunoprecipitated these artificial complexes from 293T cells transfected with the respective constructs. As expected, in cells co-expressing the catalytically inactive mutant form of procaspase-8 and FKBP-FADD-DED, dimerization of FKBP-FADD-DED led to efficient recruitment of procaspase-8 C/A (Fig. 5, lane 2), whereas FKBP-FADD-DD was incapable of recruiting procaspase-8 C/A (Fig. 5, lane 9). Conversely, we detected strong recruitment of RIP1 by dimerized FKBP-FADD-DD in cells co-expressing RIP1 and FKBP-FADD-DD (Fig. 5, lane 8). Remarkably, FKBP-FADD-DED was also capable of binding RIP1 (Fig. 5, lane 3). However, co-transfection of procaspase-8 C/A reduced the levels of FADD-DED-mediated recruitment of RIP1 to background levels (Fig. 5, lane 1). In contrast, the recruitment of RIP1 to FKBP-FADD-DD was not affected by co-transfection of procaspase-8 C/A (Fig. 5, lane 10). These results demonstrate that FKBP-FADD-DED can recruit both procaspase-8 C/A and RIP1, but binding to procaspase-8 C/A is more efficient. In contrast, FKBP-FADD-DD can recruit RIP1 but fails to bind to procaspase-8 C/A. The role of FADD in TNFR1- and Fas-induced necrosis is controversial. In FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, TNFR1-induced apoptosis is blocked, whereas necrosis still occurs. In the same cells, both Fas-induced apoptosis and necrosis are prohibited (14Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar, 15Harper N. Hughes M. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25534-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This suggests that TNFR1-induced necrosis can occur independently of FADD, whereas Fas-induced necrosis requires FADD. In Fas-induced signaling, FADD seems to function as a platform to initiate both apoptosis and necrosis. In favor of a role for FADD in necrotic signaling is the finding that inducible and dimerizable FADD-DED could initiate apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the presence or absence of procaspase-8, respectively (18Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the same report, enforced dimerization of FADD-DD was not cytotoxic. However, we found that transient overexpression of FADD-DD was able to initiate necrotic cell death (16Boone E. Vanden Berghe T. Van Loo G. De Wilde G. De Wael N. Vercammen D. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37596-37603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To clarify this controversy, we used stably transfected L929rTA-inducible cell lines expressing chimeric FKBP-FADD, FKBP-FADD-DED, and FKBP-FADD-DD constructs and examined the type of cell death initiated after doxycycline induction and enforced FKBP-dependent dimerization. The different types of cell death induced by FADD, FADD-DED, and FADD-DD are illustrated in a schematic overview (Fig. 6). Induction and dimerization of FKBP-FADD gave rise to a necrotic cell death phenotype. One could expect that overexpression and dimerization of FADD would lead to apoptosis, since FADD is thought to transmit the apoptotic signal from Fas to the caspases. Indeed, enforced dimerization of FKBP-FADD induces apoptotic cell death in HEK 293T cells (data not shown). Similarly, enforced dimerization of FADD in Jurkat cells leads to apoptotic cell death. However, in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells (JB6) enforced dimerization of FADD gives rise to a necrotic cell death (17Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In L929 cells overexpression of TNFR1, TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD), or FADD leads to necrosis, suggesting that these cells have a pro-necrotic cellular context (16Boone E. Vanden Berghe T. Van Loo G. De Wilde G. De Wael N. Vercammen D. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25939-25945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, like TNFR1-mediated necrosis, FKBP-FADD-induced necrosis can revert to apoptosis by pretreating the cells with geldanamycin, a Hsp90 inhibitor (7Vanden Berghe T. Kalai M. van Loo G. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5622-5629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This suggests that depending on the cellular context, for example the presence or absence of Hsp90-binding client proteins such as RIP1, enforced dimerization of FADD can induce necrotic or apoptotic cell death. Of note, triggering of Fas in L929 cells followed by FADD recruitment clearly induces apoptotic cell death. These findings enforce the suggestion that recruitment of FADD to Fas induces a modification or conformational change in FADD, which is crucial for the apoptotic outcome (11Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

Biol. 2000; 302: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Induction and dimerization of FKBP-FADD-DD also led to a necrotic cell phenotype (Fig. 6A). This is in agreement with observations that overexpression of a FADD dominant negative mutant, lacking the DED and, thus, incapable of recruiting procaspase-8, induces TNF-mediated necrosis in U937 and NIH3T3 cells (33Khwaja A. Tatton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36817-36823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, as mentioned above, Matsumura et al. (18Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) observed no cytotoxicity in Jurkat cells after enforced dimerization of FADD-DD. This could be due to the fact that they used an incomplete DD in their FADD-DD construct. The DD of FADD starts at amino acid position 93 (31Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas the protein used by Matsumura started at amino acid 108, resulting in the absence of the first helix. It is conceivable that this first helix of the FADD-DD is required for recruiting RIP1 and inducing necrosis (31Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, a detailed analysis of the Fas/FADD-DD interaction demonstrated that an expansive surface on one side of the domain is comprised of elements in α helices 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 (34Hill J.M. Morisawa G. Kim T. Huang T. Wei Y. Werner M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the FKBP-FADD-DD cells with geldanamycin delayed but did not shift the cell death response from necrosis to apoptosis, since procaspase-8 could not be recruited. This observation also suggests that the artificially activated FADD-DD complex does not recruit endogenous FADD, which would initiate an apoptotic response in the presence of geldanamycin. Recently, the receptor-interacting protein RIP1 was identified as a crucial component in the signal transduction to necrotic cell death (14Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Unlike its role in the activation of NF-κB through recruitment of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex to the TNF receptor, it was shown that in Jurkat cells the kinase activity of RIP1 is required for necrotic cell death, suggesting that a RIP1 substrate may propagate the necrotic cell death pathway (14Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Yeast two hybrid screening using FADD as bait demonstrated that RIP1 is able to bind FADD (35Varfolomeev E.E. Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Wallach D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). 2M. van Gurp, unpublished results. The recruitment of RIP1 by FADD-DD in coimmunoprecipitation studies suggests that FADD-DD-mediated necrotic signaling in L929sA cells occurs through RIP1. FKBP-FADD-DED-induced cytotoxicity showed the typical morphological and biochemical features of apoptotic cell death (Fig. 6B). When caspase activation was prevented using the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, apoptotic cell death induced by oligomerization of FKBP-FADD-DED was blocked but nevertheless cells died by necrosis. This suggests that the DED can also initiate necrotic cell death in the absence of active caspases. Similarly, in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells (JB6 cells) transfected with a chimeric FKBP-FADD construct, FKBP-FADD-DED was shown to mediate a necrotic cell death signal (17Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The observation that FKBP-FADD-DED was also capable of binding RIP1 confirms the pronecrotic role of FADD-DED in the presence of caspase inhibitors. However, simultaneous expression of both procaspase-8-C/A and RIP1 reduced the levels of FADD-DED-mediated recruitment of RIP1 to background levels but did not affect the extent of FADD-DD-mediated recruitment of RIP1. These results demonstrate that although FKBP-FADD-DED can recruit both procaspase-8-C/A and RIP1, the binding to procaspase-8-C/A seems to be more efficient. Moreover, in normal cellular conditions an additional level of interplay exists between caspase-8 and RIP-1. Indeed, caspase-8 is able to proteolyze and inactivate RIP1 signaling toward NF-κB activation (36Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Joe C.O. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4491-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 38Martinon F. Holler N. Richard C. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results may explain why FADD-DED mediates apoptosis by recruiting and activating procaspase-8 and by preventing the NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling induced by RIP1. However, in the absence of caspase-8, as exemplified in caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells (17Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), or if caspase activity is blocked by zVAD-fmk RIP1 is not cleaved and may, thus, propagate necrotic cell death. In conclusion, the present results show that apoptotic and necrotic cell death pathways can initiate at the level of the signal adapter FADD. FADD-DD very efficiently recruits RIP1, an important kinase in necrotic signaling, whereas FADD-DED preferentially recruits procaspase-8 and initiates apoptosis. However, in the presence of caspase inhibitors FADD-DED will mediate necrotic cell death by its capacity to recruit RIP1. We thank ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cambridge, MA) for providing AP1510."

The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus genome contains a cluster of open reading frames encoding proteins (vIRFs) with homology to the cellular transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor family. vIRF-3, also called LANA2, is a latently expressed nuclear protein. Here we demonstrate that vIRF-3 directly interacts with cellular interferon regulatory factor (IRF) IRF-3, IRF-7, and the transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300. The mapping of the vIRF-3 binding domain revealed that vIRF-3 associates with both IRF-3 and IRF-7 through its C-terminal region. The p300 domain, which interacts with vIRF-3, is distinct from the previously identified IBiD domain, to which both vIRF-1 and IRF-3 bind. Thus, in contrast to vIRF-1, vIRF-3 neither blocks the interaction between IRF-3 and p300 nor inhibits the histone acetylation. Although vIRF-3 is not a DNA-binding protein, it is recruited to the IFNA promoters via its interaction with IRF-3 and IRF-7. The presence of vIRF-3 in the enhanceosome assembled on the IFNA promoters increases binding of IRF-3, IRF-7, and acetylated histone H3 to this promoter region. Consequently, vIRF-3 stimulates the IRF-3- and IRF-7-mediated activation of type I interferon (IFNA and IFNB) genes and the synthesis of biologically active type I interferons in infected B cells. These studies illustrate that vIRF-3 and vIRF-1 have clearly distinct functions.

Three of these repeats contact DNA with specific recognition of the GAAA and AANNNGAA sequence (3Escalante C.R. Yie J. Thanos D. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, the unique function of a particular IRF is accounted for by a cell type-specific expression, its intrinsic trans-activation potential, and an ability to interact with the other members of IRF family or transcription factors and co-factors (4Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Three IRFs (IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7) function as direct transducers of virus-mediated signaling and play a crucial role in the expression of type I interferon (IFN) genes and some chemokine genes, including RANTES (5Au W.C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41629-41637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 6Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Whereas IRF-3 is constitutively expressed in all cell types (8Au W.-C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.-T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), constitutive expression of IRF-7 can be detected predominantly in cells of lymphoid origin and can be further stimulated by type I IFN. The expression of IRF-5 seems to be restricted to dendritic cells and B cells (9Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In monocytes, and particularly in the precursors of dendritic cells (PDC2), which are high producers of IFNα, both IRF-5 and IRF-7 are expressed constitutively (11Izaguirre A. Barnes B.J. Amrute S. Yeow W.S. Megjugorac N. Dai J. Feng D. Chung E. Pitha P.M. Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In uninfected cells, IRF-3 and IRF-7 reside predominantly in the cytoplasm, but upon virus-induced phosphorylation of C-terminal serine residues, mediated by IKKϵ and TBK1 (12Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref Scopus (2099) Google Scholar, 13Sharma S. ten Oever B.R. Grandvaux N.

S. A. 2002; 99: 6322-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), IRF-7 has a critical role in the induction of IFNα. Reconstitution of IRF-7 expression in human cells that can express only IFNB gene resulted in virus-mediated induction of IFNA genes (18Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate both the essential and distinct roles of IRF-3 and IRF-7, which together control the transcriptional activation of diverse IFNα/β genes in the antiviral response. The importance of IRFs in the innate antiviral response is further supported by the findings that an increasing number of viruses have been found to encode proteins that target the function of these factors to overcome the antiviral immune response (19Katze M.G. He Y. Gale Jr., M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8) (20Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.-C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14862-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar) contains a cluster of four genes (vIRFs) that encode proteins with homology to the cellular transcription factors of the IRF family. Three of these vIRFs (vIRF-1, vIRF-2, and vIRF-3/LANA2) have been cloned and characterized. They all show homology in the N-terminal region to the DNA-binding domain of cellular IRFs; however, the vIRFs lack several of the tryptophan residues that are essential for the DNA binding and thus, in contrast to cellular IRFs, vIRFs are not able to directly bind to DNA. The expression of vIRFs in the KSHV life cycle is distinct. vIRF-1 (ORF K9) is expressed during the KSHV replication cycle (21Jenner R.G. Alba M.M. Boshoff C. Kellam P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and its expression is activated by the KSHV-encoded trans-activator, ORF50, and by an auto-activation of its promoter (22Wang X.P. Gao S.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast, vIRF-2 and vIRF-3 are expressed during KSHV latency (23Burysek L. Yeow W.S. Pitha P.M. J. Hum. Virol. 1999; 2: 19-32PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rivas C. Thlick A.E. Parravicini C. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Several groups have extensively studied vIRF-1. In a transient transfection assay, vIRF-1 was shown to inhibit both the virus-mediated induction of type I IFN genes and IFN-induced genes (ISGs) (25Burysek L. Yeow W.S. Lubyova B. Kellum M.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, vIRF-1 overexpression in NIH/3T3 cells confers tumorigenicity when injected into nude mice (28Flowers C.C. Flowers S.P. Nabel G.J. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 402-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gao S.J. Boshoff C. Jayachandra S. Weiss R.A. Chang Y. Moore P.S.

Virol. 1998; 72: 5433-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data, together with the observation that vIRF-1 binds to p53 and inhibits apoptosis, suggested that vIRF-1 might have an oncogenic potential (25Burysek L. Yeow W.S. Lubyova B. Kellum M.

Moreover, it was shown that vIRF-1 binds not only to cellular IRFs but also to CBP/p300 and inhibits its acetyltransferase activity (25Burysek L. Yeow W.S. Lubyova B. Kellum M. Schafer S.L.

Ogryzko V. Ozato K. Jung J.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8254-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). vIRF-2 (ORF K11.1) encodes a small nuclear protein (163 aa) that is constitutively expressed in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells and specifically associates with several cellular IRFs and p300 (23Burysek L. Yeow W.S. Pitha P.M. J. Hum. Virol. 1999; 2: 19-32PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, vIRF-2 also binds double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, PKR, inhibits its kinase activity, and blocks the phosphorylation of the PKR substrate, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (36Burysek L. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2345-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). An additional transcript, encompassing vIRF-2 spliced to the ORF K11, has been identified by gene array analysis (21Jenner R.G. Alba M.M. Boshoff C. Kellam P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This transcript can be detected only in TPA-treated PEL cells, and the function of this protein has not yet been characterized (21Jenner R.G. Alba M.M. Boshoff C. Kellam P. J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 4843-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). vIRF-3/LANA2 is a constitutively expressed nuclear protein encoded by ORFs K10.5 and K10.6 (21Jenner R.G. Alba M.M. Boshoff C. Kellam P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 24Rivas C. Thlick A.E. Parravicini C. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 8194-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). vIRF-3/LANA2 was also shown to bind to p53 (24Rivas C. Thlick A.E. Parravicini C. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and inhibit p53-mediated transcriptional activation. A recent report (39Esteban M. Garcia M.A. Domingo-Gil E. Arroyo J. Nombela C. Rivas C. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) has shown that vIRF-3 also inhibits PKR-mediated apoptosis. In a transient transfection assay in NIH/3T3 cells, vIRF-3 was shown to inhibit the IFN-mediated induction of ISG15 promoter, and it was suggested that both vIRF-1 and vIRF-3 function as dominant negative mutants of cellular IRFs (25Burysek L. Yeow W.S. Lubyova B. Kellum M. Schafer S.L. Huang Y.Q. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7334-7342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8194-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to further characterize the function of vIRF-3. Here we show that vIRF-3 interacts with both IRF-3 and IRF-7 as well as with transcriptional co-activator CBP/p300. However, in contrast to vIRF-1, vIRF-3 neither competes with IRF-3 for binding to p300 nor inhibits histone acetylation. For the first time, we report that although vIRF-3 does not bind DNA, in virus-infected cells, vIRF-3 is tethered to the IFNA promoter by its association with IRF-3 and IRF-7. Finally, we provide evidence that the overexpression of vIRF-3 stimulates IRF-3 and IRF-7 transcriptional activity of IFNA and IFNB promoters and thus enhances virus-mediated induction of type I interferons in B cells. Our study reveals that in addition to its co-repressor function, vIRF-3 can also act as a transcriptional activator. Cells and Virus—2fTGH and p2.1 (kindly provided by Dr. G. Stark), HeLa, and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. BJAB, BCBL-1, and BC-3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 or 20% fetal bovine serum (for BC-3 cells). BJAB cells constitutively expressing vIRF-3 or vIRF-1 (BJAB/vIRF-3, BJAB/vIRF-1) were generated by transfection of BJAB cells with Myc-tagged vIRF-3- or vIRF-1-expressing plasmids, and transfected cells were selected by growth in G418.

GST-vIRF-3-FL, GST-vIRF-3-N′, and GST-vIRF-3-C′ were cloned by amplification of the vIRF-3 cDNA (aa 1–566, 1–254, and 254–566, respectively) from the vIRF-3-myc expression plasmid and sub-cloned into pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The IRF-3 (aa 145–231)-T7 was cloned by amplification of the IRF-3 region (aa 145–231) using the IRF-3 expression plasmid as a template. The 5′ primer carried a T7 tag sequence that was in-frame with IRF-3 open reading frame. The PCR product was sub-cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The vIRF-3 antibodies were raised in rabbits against two peptides (n-VRLEKHRRRPRPFVGEC-c and n-CWDDGPRRHERPTTRR-c) and purified by protein A chromatography. Polyclonal IRF-3, IRF-7, p300, CBP, Myc, actin, and Sp1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma; T7 antibodies were from Novagen, and acetyl-H3 and acetyl-H4 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Transfections and SAP Assays—In transient transfection assays, 2 × 106 cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA by using Superfect (Qiagen). For SAP assays, equal amounts (2 μg) of reporter plasmid and IRF- or vIRF-expressing plasmids were co-transfected with β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid. The transfected cells were divided 24 h later and infected with Sendai virus for 16 h or were left uninfected. The SAP assay was performed as described previously (42Dent C.L. Macbride S.J. Sharp N.A. Gewert D.R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 43Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated three times. The β-galactosidase expression levels were used to normalize the difference in transfection efficiency. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—293 cells co-transfected with various vIRF-3, IRF-3, and IRF-7 expression plasmids were lysed in co-precipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The protein extracts (400 μg) were then incubated with the respective antibodies. After extensive washing with co-precipitation buffer, precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Oligonucleotide Pull-down Assay—The DNA pull-down assay was done as described previously (5Au W.C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41629-41637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded oligomers corresponding to the huIFNA1 VRE region (bp–110 to–53) were synthesized and biotin-labeled at the 5′ end of the antisense strand and coupled with streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.). Whole cell lysates were then incubated with the DNA bound to magnetic beads for 3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. GST Pull-down Assay—35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized in vitro by using the coupled TnT T7 transcription-translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-vIRF-3 fusion proteins (0.5 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 10 μl of 35S-labeled proteins in 250 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 8% glycerol, 0.2 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) at 4 °C for 90 min. After three 10-min washes with binding buffer, the proteins bound to the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. For GST pull-down assay with IRF-3 (aa 145–231)-T7 deletion mutant, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with T7 antibodies (Novagen). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The assay was performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for the exogenous IFNA promoter studies, HeLa cells (5 × 105 cells) were co-transfected with 1 μg of IFNA1-SAP reporter and 2 μg of vIRF-3 or vIRF-1 expressing plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with NDV for 6 h. For the endogenous IFNA promoter studies, BJAB/vIRF-3 and BJAB/vector cells (107 cells) were infected with NDV for 6 h. The proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked in the presence of 1% formaldehyde; cells were resuspended in the SDS lysis buffer, followed by sonication. After pre-clearing with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (50% slurry), the protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against IRF-3, IRF-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), acetyl-H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and vIRF-3. Immunoprecipitation with p65 antibodies was used as a negative control. Immunocomplexes were extensively washed, and the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction. For exogenous IFNA1 promoter analysis, the PCR amplification was performed with IFNA1-SAP-specific primers described previously (5Au W.C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41629-41637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For endogenous IFNA promoter studies, the DNA template was amplified with universal primers corresponding to the regions of human endogenous IFNA genes that are conserved in all subtypes (18Yeow W.S.

Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis and Antiviral Assay—1 μg of total RNA isolated by the Trizol method (Invitrogen) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) primers in a 30-μl reaction volume. From this mixture of cDNAs, IFNA, IFNB, RANTES, and β-actin were amplified by PCR as described previously (18Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For the amplification of studied genes, the following primer sets were used: (i) huIFNA sense 5′-GTACTGCAGAATCTCTCCTTTCTCCTG-3′, antisense 5′-GTGTCTAGATCTGACAACCTCCCAGGCACA-3′; (ii) huIFNB sense 5′-TTGTGCTTCTCCACTACAGC-3′, antisense 5′-CTGTAAGTCTGTTAATGAAG-3′; (iii) huRANTES sense 5′-AGGTCTCCGCGGCACGCCTCGC-3′, antisense 5′-CCAAAGAGTTGATGTACTCCCG-3′; and (iv) huβ-actin sense 5′-ACAATGAGCTGCTGGTGGCT-3′, antisense 5′-GATGGGCACAGTGTGGGTGA-3′. The levels of biologically active interferons in the medium were determined by the antiviral assay on human fibroblast cells (for IFNα/β) using vesicular stomatitis virus as challenging virus or on bovine tracheal cells that detect only IFNα but not IFNβ (44Cheung S.C.

Virol. 2001; 75: 891-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), have shown the presence of vIRF-3 transcripts in the KSHV-latently infected primary effusion lymphoma cells, BCBL-1, that could be moderately increased upon TPA treatment that stimulates productive KSHV infection (38Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8194-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast to our data, Rivas et al. (24Rivas C. Thlick A.E. Parravicini C. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and Fakhari and Dittmer (45Fakhari F.D. Dittmer D.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6213-6223Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) characterized vIRF-3 as a constitutively expressed nuclear antigen. By using polyclonal vIRF-3 antiserum, which specifically recognizes vIRF-3 but not vIRF-1, we now show that vIRF-3 is expressed both in untreated and TPA-treated BCBL-1 and BC-3 cells (Fig. 1A). The vIRF-3 detected in PEL cells has the mobility of ∼70 kDa that is identical to the mobility of vIRF-3 encoded by the ectopic vIRF-3 cDNA in the permanently transfected BJAB cells. No increase in the relative levels of the vIRF-3 protein was observed upon TPA treatment, which correlates with the published data of Moore and co-workers (24Rivas C. Thlick A.E. Parravicini C. Moore P.S. Chang Y. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) that detected the expression of vIRF-3 in the nucleus of PEL cells and therefore named it latency-associated nuclear antigen 2 (LANA2). The analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts isolated from BCBL-1 cells has shown that vIRF-3 is present both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B), whereas in BC-3 cells the majority of vIRF-3 can be detected in the nucleus. To examine the function of vIRF-3 in B cells, we established a human B lymphoma cell line, BJAB, stably expressing vIRF-3 tagged with Myc epitope. Expression of vIRF-3 in these cells, as detected with polyclonal vIRF-3 antibodies, has shown that the ectopic vIRF-3 is present both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Expression of vIRF-3 in BJAB cells results in neither morphologic changes nor the alteration of the growth rate. In addition, the vIRF-3 expression in BJAB cells did not modulate their ability to grow in soft agar (data not shown). Interaction of vIRF-3 with Cellular IRFs—To address the potential role of vIRF-3 in the antiviral innate response, we have examined the interactions between vIRF-3 and the transcription factors of the IRF family, namely IRF-3 and IRF-7, that play a critical role in the induction of the type I IFN genes, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and chemokines (6Barnes B.J.

https://openalex.org/W2065640711,"The most unorthodox feature of the prion disease is the existence of an abnormal infectious isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc. According to the “protein-only” hypothesis, PrPSc propagates its abnormal conformation in an autocatalytic manner using the normal isoform, PrPC, as a substrate. Because autocatalytic conversion is considered a key element of prion replication, in this study I tested whether in vitro conversion of recombinant PrP into abnormal isoform displays specific features of an autocatalytic process. I found that recombinant human PrP formed two distinct β-sheet rich isoforms, the β-oligomer and the amyloid fibrils. The kinetics of the fibrils formation measured at different pH values were consistent with a model in which the β-oligomer was not on the kinetic pathway to the fibrillar form. As judged by electron microscopy, an acidic pH favored to the long fibrils, whereas short fibrils morphologically similar to “prion rods” were formed at neutral pH. At neutral pH the conversion to the fibrils can be seeded with small aliquots of preformed fibrils. As small as 0.001% aliquot displayed seeding activity. The conversion of human PrP was seeded with high efficacy only with the preformed fibrils of human but not mouse PrP and vice versa. These studies illustrate that in vitro conversion of recombinant PrP displays specific features of an autocatalytic process and mimics the transmission barrier of prion propagation observed in vivo.

Spontaneous conversion of the normal cellular isoform of the prion protein, PrPC, into the abnormal pathological isoform, PrPSc, underlies sporadic forms of prion disease, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans (1Prusiner S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The occurrence of the sporadic forms of prion maladies is very rare, about one person/million/year (2Masters C.L.

Such a low occurrence is believed to be because of the extremely slow spontaneous conversion of PrPC into PrPSc (3Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, the conversion can be substantially accelerated by administration of an exogenous PrPSc. The “protein-only” hypothesis of prion propagation postulates that the abnormal isoform, PrPSc, acts as a transmissible agent of the disease and self-propagates its pathological conformation using PrPC as a substrate (4Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar).

Despite substantial differences between PrPC and PrPSc, it is still unclear which physical property can be used as a valid probe to monitor formation of infectious PrPSc in a cell-free system. According to the protein-only hypothesis, an autocatalytic conversion from PrPC into PrPSc is a key feature that underlies the molecular basis of the transmissible form of prion diseases (16Gajdusek D.C. J. Neuroimmunol. 1988; 20: 95-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Strong support for the idea that certain proteins are capable of self-propagating their abnormal conformations was provided by the prion biology of yeast and fungi (17Wickner R.B.

In vitro made fibrils of Sup35 and HET-s, the prion proteins of yeast and fungi, respectively, cause prion propagation in vivo and change the phenotype of cells (19Maddelein M.L. Dos Reis S.

Science. 2000; 289: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The yeast model displays one of the key features that illustrate an autocatalytic mechanism of conversion, a seeding phenomenon in which abnormal isoforms produced during conversion are able to initiate and facilitate conversion in a fresh reaction. Furthermore, seeding of fibril formation of Sup35 in vitro mimics two other peculiar features of in vivo prion propagation, strain phenomenon and species barrier (21Chien P. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Santoso A. Chien P. Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), offering a powerful system to study the propagation of yeast prions. Development of similar in vitro models for conversion of mammalian PrPs would be beneficial to our understanding of the mechanisms of prion diseases. Using C-terminal fragments of recombinant human and mouse PrPs that encompassed residues 90–231 and 89–230, respectively (designated Hu recPrP and Mo recPrP), I have developed an in vitro conversion system that displays attributes of an autocatalytic process. Thus, the conversion of monomeric recPrP into the amyloid fibrils can be seeded with small aliquots of preformed fibrils. I found that cross-seeding with preformed fibrils of heterologous recPrP was not as efficient as seeding with fibrils of homologous recPrP. The low efficiency of cross-seeding illustrated a high selectivity of the autocatalytic conversion in vitro in the absence of cellular environment. This phenomenon mimicked species barrier of prion transmission observed in vivo. I speculate that this model system can be used for assessing an intrinsic propensity of prion transmission between different species. Protein Expression and Purification—The genes coding for Hu PrP-(90–231) and Mo PrP-(89–231) were amplified by PCR from pcDNA3 plasmids containing the full-length Hu PrP and the full-length Mo PrP genes, correspondingly. The amplified genes were cloned into the pET101/d-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into Top10 cells (Invitrogen). The transformants were tested by PCR amplification, and the plasmids isolated from the proper clones were retransformed into BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen). The insertion of the correct gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Biopolymer Laboratory, University of Maryland, Baltimore). For the expression of Hu rec PrP-(90–231) and Mo recPrP-(89–230), 2% of an overnight culture was inoculated in fresh LB medium that contained 50 μg/ml carbenicillin (Sigma) and was grown at 37 °C until the A600 nm reached 0.7. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma) was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were grown for an additional 16 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole), and lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and then immediate thawing at 42 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and both proteins were purified as described by Mehlhorn et al. (23Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Stöckel J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Yansura D. Willett W.S. Baldwin M. Fletterick R. Cohen F.E. Vandlen R. Henner D. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5528-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry to be single pure species with an intact disulfide bond. Formation of Amyloid Fibrils in Vitro—The oxidized form of both Hu recPrP and Mo recPrP spontaneously converted into the fibrillar isoform upon continuous shaking at 600 rpm in conical plastic tubes (Eppendorf) in a reaction volume > 0.4 ml at 37 °C (24Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). When the reaction was carried out under the same experimental conditions but in a reaction volume < 0.3 ml, the conversion did not occur spontaneously. However, it was possible to induce the conversion by seeding. The conversion in reaction volume < 0.3 ml is considered to be at sub-threshold conditions. The detailed mechanism of these volume-regulated sub-threshold effects will be described elsewhere. To monitor the kinetics of fibril formation, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn and diluted 30–80-fold into 5 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) to a final concentration of recPrP 10 μg/ml. After the addition of thioflavin T (ThT) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to a final concentration of 5 μm, fluorescence spectra were recorded in 0.4-cm rectangular cuvettes with excitation at 445 nm on a FluoroMax-3 fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ); both excitation and emission slits were 4 nm. ThT bound to the fibrils showed typical fluorescence spectra with the emission maximum at 482 nm. Size-exclusion Chromatography—All of the separations were performed at 23 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a 300× 7.8 mm Toyopearl TSK3000SWxl HPLC gel filtration column (Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) in a running buffer consisting of 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.7), 0.2 m NaCl, and 1 m urea. The column was operated with mechanical injection within a fully automated high pressure liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). Negative Staining and Electron Microscopy—Negative staining was performed on carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids that were glow-discharged prior to staining. The samples were adsorbed for 30 s, stained with freshly filtered 2% ammonium molybdate, dried, and then viewed in a Zeiss EM 10 CA electron microscope. Circular Dichroism and Thermal Denaturation—CD spectra of recPrP (0.25 mg/ml) were recorded in an 0.1-cm cuvette with a J-810 CD spectrometer (Jasco, Easton, MD) scanning at 20 nm/min, with a bandwidth of 1 nm and data spacing of 0.5 nm. Each spectrum represents the average of three individual scans after subtracting the background spectra. Formation of the β-Oligomer versus the Amyloid Fibrils— Typical kinetics of spontaneous in vitro fibril formation of Hu recPrP at 37 °C showed a substantial lag-phase followed by a rapid increase of amyloid fibrils accumulation as measured by ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1a). The length of the lag-phase was a function of the pH value, ranging from 2 h at pH 6.1 and 7.2 to 26 h at pH 3.7 (Fig. 1c). In a previous study, using mouse and Syrian hamster recPrPs, we showed that acidic pH favored formation of the β-oligomer, which is off the kinetic pathway to the amyloid fibrils (24Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Competition between two misfolding pathways, one of which leads to the β-oligomer and another to the fibrillar form, may explain the substantial differences in the length of the lag-phase. To test whether the conversion of Hu recPrP to the β-oligomer interfered with the formation of the fibrils, I analyzed the composition of the reaction mixture using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 1b). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, Hu recPrP was found predominantly in the β-oligomeric form at pH 3.7, whereas only 10% of the protein converted into the β-oligomer at pH 7.2. The length of the lag-phase of the fibril formation was a function of the relative amount of the monomeric recPrP: the larger the amount of the monomer presented at the initial stage of fibril formation, the shorter was the lag-phase (Fig. 1c). The result of our experiments on the pH dependence of fibril formation was consistent with a model proposed earlier for the conversion of mouse and hamster recPrP (24Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This model considers that the α-monomer exists in a slow equilibrium with the β-oligomer, and the β-oligomer is not on the kinetic pathway of the fibril formation (Fig. 1e). The equilibrium is shifted toward the β-oligomer at acidic pH, whereas the incubation of Hu recPrP at neutral pH leads to the formation of fibrils. Because both misfolding pathways may co-exist, a simple experimental procedure for distinguishing between the two abnormal isoforms is needed. It is easy to confuse the β-oligomer with the amyloid fibrils using only CD spectroscopy because both abnormal isoforms have similar CD spectra and almost identical molar ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, a ThT binding assay provided more definitive detection of the amyloid fibrils versus the β-oligomer (Fig. 2b). Even though both abnormal isoforms bind ThT, the binding capacity of the amyloid form is ∼30-fold higher than the binding capacity of the β-oligomer. The Elongation of Fibrils—Low abundance of the monomer at pH 3.7 and 4.2 determines the low rate of the initiation of fibril formation and explains the long lag-phase (see above). I also observed that the rate of conversion at pH 3.7 and 4.2 was much slower than the rate at pH 6.0 and 7.2 as judged from the increase in ThT fluorescence (Fig. 1a). For example, the change in fluorescence was 100 relative units/h at pH 6.0 and only 14 relative units/h at pH 3.7. The slow rate of conversion at acidic pH was consistent with the low population of the monomer observed throughout the time course of fibril formation (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, at acidic pH the concentration of the α-monomer remained relatively constant despite its ongoing recruitment into the fibrils. By decreasing the total population of soluble non-fibrillar forms (the α-monomer and the β-oligomer), the equilibrium between the α-monomer and the β-oligomer shifted back to the α-monomer, thereby maintaining its population (data not shown). On the other hand, the substantially higher level of the α-monomer at pH 6.0 and 7.2 explains the fast rate of elongation at these pH values. As judged from electron microscopy the fibrils formed at pH 6.0 and 7.2 were substantially shorter than the fibrils formed at pH 3.7 (Fig. 3). Formation of long fibrils occurred under experimental conditions in which the initiation step was very inefficient, whereas the constant low level of the α-monomer provided the substrate for fibril elongation. In contrast to acidic pH, the high population of the α-monomer at neutral pH accelerated the step of nucleation. The formation of numerous centers of nucleation was followed by rapid elongation of fibrils and fast consumption of the α-monomer. The fast drop of the concentration of the α-monomer resulted in quick termination of elongation, which explains the short length of fibrils formed at neutral pH. The fibrils formed at different pH values also had a distinct morphology. The fibrils prepared at pH 6.0 and 7.2 resembled PrPSc “prion rod” and were lacking the distinct coil morphology, which was a characteristic of fibrils formed at pH 3.7. Seeding of Fibril Formation—Because an autocatalytic conversion is a key hallmark of prion propagation, I tested whether in vitro formation of fibrils shows features of the autocatalytic process. When small aliquots of preformed fibrils (seeds) of Hu recPrP were transferred from a mature reaction into fresh reactions, I observed a significant reduction in the lag-phase (Fig. 4a). The extent to which the lag-phase was reduced depended on the amount of seed added to the fresh reaction mixture. Under the experimental conditions employed, as little as an 0.001% aliquot of preformed fibrils displayed a seeding effect in fresh reactions. I also observed a seeding effect when the preformed fibrils of Mo recPrP were used to seed the conversion in a fresh reaction of Mo recPrP (Fig. 4d). These data illustrate that in contrast to the formation of the β-oligomer, the conversion of recPrP into fibrils exhibits specific features of an autocatalytic process. As judged from the length of the lag-phase, the efficacy of cross-seeding of Mo recPrP with the fibrillar form of Hu recPrP was much lower than the efficacy of seeding of Mo recPrP with the fibrillar Mo recPrP (Fig. 4d). Similarly, preformed fibrils of Mo recPrP displayed low seeding activity toward Hu recPrP (Fig. 4b). Thus, 1% of preformed fibrils of Mo recPrP exhibited apparent seeding activity, which was an equivalent of the seeding activity that would be displayed by 0.004% of preformed fibrils of Hu recPrP (Fig. 4c). This experiment illustrates that the differences in the amino acid sequence of recPrP from different species may substantially affect the ability of cross-seeding. Autocatalytic Conversion under Sub-threshold Conditions—At sub-threshold conditions the process of amyloid formation did not occur spontaneously but was initiated only upon addition of seeds (Fig. 5a; the detailed mechanism of the conversion at sub-threshold conditions will be published elsewhere). Furthermore, the process of seeded conversion at sub-threshold conditions also displayed strong selectivity with respect to the primary structures of seeds and a substrate. Thus, the conversion of Hu recPrP was induced only upon the addition of Hu but not Mo seeds (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the presence of monomeric Mo polypeptides in a mixture with Hu polypeptides substantially reduced the rate of conversion seeded with fibrils of Hu recPrP (Fig. 5b). I observed this inhibition of the conversion rate despite high concentrations of total recPrP in the mixtures. Seeded conversion at sub-threshold conditions demonstrated an autocatalytic mechanism for in vitro amyloid formation and displayed strong species selectivity of this process. In a previous study (24Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) we established an experimental protocol for the refolding of α-helical monomeric recPrP (Mo recPrP-(89–231) and Syrian hamster recPrP-(90–231)) into two distinct β-sheet rich isoforms, the β-oligomer and amyloid fibrils. The amyloid fibrils of recPrP share several important physical properties with PrP-(27–30). Using a panel of specific Fabs, we showed that the amyloid of recPrP has an epitope presentation similar to that of PrP-(27–30), indicating their common overall architecture (24Baskakov I.V.

To the extent that these biochemical tests capture important conformational properties of PrPSc, in vitro fibril formation can provide insight into the events underlying prion conversion. Current work demonstrated that the oxidized α-monomeric Hu recPrP can also be converted to the β-oligomer form and to amyloid fibrils. These data indicate that the folding behavior of Hu recPrP is similar to that of Mo recPrP and Syrian hamster recPrP (9Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although the earlier studies of oxidized Hu recPrP reported that the protein can be refolded to a β-sheet-rich isoform, they failed to distinguish between the β-oligomeric and fibrillar forms (10Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The failure to distinguish two different misfolding pathways led to further confusion when the transition of the wild type was compared with transition of the disease-associated variant F198S of Hu recPrP. Thus, Vanik and Surewicz (25Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49065-49070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported that wild type Hu recPrP-(90–231) converts into amyloid fibrils at pH 5.0 without any lag-phase as monitored by CD. According to our data, the two misfolding pathways co-exist at pH 5.0, at which the formation of the amyloid fibrils requires shaking and displays the lag-phase, whereas the formation of the β-oligomer occurs without any lag-phase regardless of shaking. Because both the β-oligomeric and fibrillar forms have similar CD spectra (Fig. 2a), CD cannot be used as a valid probe to monitor the kinetics of amyloid formation. The ThT binding assay provides a better way for selective measurements of amyloid formation. The binding capacity of the amyloid fibrils is ∼30-fold higher than the capacity of the equivalent amount of β-oligomer (Fig. 2b). However, because ThT also binds to the β-oligomers, special precautions need to be taken for presentation of data. It is more informative to present the ThT binding as a change in absolute values rather then as a normalized percentage. Because a normalized percentage was used for the comparison of the wild type and the F198S variant (25Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49065-49070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), uncertainty remained as to whether the formation of the β-oligomer or the amyloid fibrils was measured by ThT. According to our studies, incubation of wild type Hu recPrP-(90–231) under the experimental conditions described by Vanik and Surewicz (25Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49065-49070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (1 m GdnHCl, pH 5.0, at 37 °C without shaking) resulted in the formation of the β-oligomer but not amyloid fibrils. Without GdnHCl, the authors observed polymerization only with the F198S variant but not with the wild type Hu recPrP (Ref. 25Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49065-49070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Fig. 5 therein). These data are consistent with our earlier studies that demonstrated the conformational transition from the α-monomer to the β-oligomer was separated by a large energetic barrier associated with partial unfolding and oligomerization (9Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Partially denaturing conditions destabilize the α-monomer and facilitate the conversion to the β-oligomer. Because the F198S variant is thermodynamically less stable than the wild type, the transition of the F198S variant to the β-oligomeric form may occur even without denaturants, as described by Vanik and Surewicz (25Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49065-49070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the current study I have shown that in vitro conversion of Hu recPrP to the fibrillar form involves an autocatalytic mechanism, i.e. the ability of preformed fibrils of recPrP to initiate the process of conversion. The process of seeded conversion is consistent with the protein-only hypothesis, which postulates that PrPSc propagates its pathological conformation in an autocatalytic manner and acts as a transmissible agent of the prion diseases. Seeded conversion of the reduced form of recombinant prion protein was recently described by Lee and Eisenberg (26Lee S. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The conversion was achieved through reduction of the disulfide bond in the presence of dithiothreitol and GdnHCl at alkaline pH followed by removal of dithiothreitol and GdnHCl at acidic pH, which resulted in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds accompanied by polymerization into fibrils. The seeding led to linear elongation of preformed fibrils. Because the polypeptides assembled in the amyloid fibrils are linked to each other by intermolecular disulfide bonds, it is unlikely that multiplication of the catalytic centers can be achieved in the time course of polymerization using this protocol unless repetitive cycles of reduction-oxidation are applied. Although the reduced form of recPrP has been shown to form a fibrillar structure (14Jackson G.S. Hosszu L.L.P. Power A. Hill A.F. Kenney J. Saibil H. Craven C.J. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Science. 1999; 283: 1935-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 26Lee S. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), it is the oxidized form that causes the prion disease (27Turk E. Teplow D.B. Hood L.E. Prusiner S.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28Welker E. Raymond L.D. Scheraga H.A. Caughey B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33477-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The seeding phenomenon has never been observed before using the oxidized form of recPrP-(90–231) folded into an abnormal conformation. The seeding of in vitro conversion reaction with preformed fibrils described in current protocol was highly efficient. I observed the seeding effect even when the molar ratio of Hu recPrP polypeptides assembled to fibrils to the monomeric Hu recPrP was 1:100,000 (Fig. 4a). Our studies of the oligomerization states demonstrated that the multimeric isoforms of recPrP with a molecular mass >1 MDa possessed seeding activity. 2I. V. Baskakov, unpublished data. If one assumes that every seed consists of, on average, 100 polypeptides, the actual molar ratio of active centers of propagation to the substrate might be as high as 1:10,000,000. These data show that the autocatalytic conversion is highly efficient when the reaction is seeded with fibrils of homologous recPrP. Furthermore, I found that the autocatalytic conversion displayed species specificity. Preformed fibrils of Hu recPrP were capable of seeding the conversion of Hu recPrP, whereas the conversion of Mo recPrP with the same amount of fibrillar Hu recPrP was delayed and vice versa. This experiment illustrates the high selectivity of the autocatalytic conversion with respect to the amino acid sequences of seeds and substrates. Using PrP-derived fragments, Kundu et al. (29Kundu B. Maiti N.R. Jones E.M. Surewicz K.A. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12069-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) found that the residues within the 138–141 region of PrP are important for the formation of amyloid structure. Interestingly, one of the mismatches between Hu and Mo PrP is located at position 139 (methionine in Hu PrP and isoleucine in Mo PrP). Whether this or other positions within the region 90–231 influences the species selectivity of autocatalytic conversion remains to be determined. The high selectivity of autocatalytic conversion was also confirmed using sub-threshold conditions (Fig. 5). Strong species selectivity of seeded conversion in vitro recapitulated the species barrier of prion propagation observed in vivo. Moreover, our data were in agreement with an earlier observation made on transgenic mice, which co-expressed both Hu and Mo PrPC (30Telling G.C. Scott M. Mastrianni J. Gabizon R. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 79-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Mice with high level of Hu PrPC expression were resistant to Hu PrPSc but became susceptible to human prions upon ablation of the Mo PrP gene (30Telling G.C. Scott M. Mastrianni J. Gabizon R. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 79-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mixing of Mo and Hu polypeptides inhibited in vitro conversion induced by Hu seeds (Fig. 5b). Such inhibition can be caused by competition between Hu and Mo polypeptides for binding to the active centers of Hu seeds. It has yet to be determined whether the binding of Mo polypeptides to Hu seeds totally blocks the binding of Hu polypeptides to seeds or just slows down the rate of the binding and the conversion of Hu recPrP. The species barrier limits transmission of prions across species (31Pattison I.H. Jones K.M. Res. Vet. Sci. 1968; 9: 408-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is considered as one of the most peculiar feature of prion propagation. From studies in transgenic animals, two factors have been identified that contribute to the species barrier: (i) the difference in PrP sequences between the donor species and the recipient species and (ii) the conformational properties of individual strains of PrPSc (32Prusiner S.B. Scott M. Foster D. Pan K.-M. Groth D. Mirenda C. Torchia M. Yang S.-L. Serban D. Carlson G.A. Hoppe P.C. Westaway D. DeArmond S.J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6358-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). When the sequence of the PrPC of a recipient animal is identical to the sequence of PrPSc of a donor animal, the disease has the shortest incubation time. In contrast, if PrPSc is transmitted from one species to another, the incubation time is longer in the first passage, and the newly infected animals develop atypical clinical signs and unusual histopathology (31Pattison I.H. Jones K.M. Res. Vet. Sci. 1968; 9: 408-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Scott M.R. Groth D. Tatzelt J. Torchia M. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9032-9044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both features, the species barrier and the strain phenomenon, were studied extensively using an in vitro conversion system of the prion protein of yeast Sub35 (21Chien P. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35DePace A.H. Santoso A. Hillner P. Weissman J.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 1241-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Preformed amyloid fibrils of Sup35 were capable of seeding the formation of new fibrils in fresh solution and also provided templates that determined the conformation of the new fibrils. As a result, the strain and species-specific conformational properties of the seeds were conferred to the newly formed fibrils (21Chien P. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For a variety of technical reasons a cell-free system has never been developed using mammalian recombinant PrP. Our in vitro system displayed high efficiency and species selectivity of the conversion in the absence of cellular environment. In addition to the differences between the amino acid sequences of PrPC and PrPSc, the conformational diversity of PrPSc strains seem to affect the ability to cross the species barrier in vivo (33Scott M.R. Groth D. Tatzelt J. Torchia M. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9032-9044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hill A.F. Desbruslais M. Joiner S. Sidle K.C.L. Gowland I. Collinge J. Doey L.J. Lantos P. Nature. 1997; 389: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Some strains of PrPSc overcome the species barrier more easily than others when transmitted to different species. Considering the conformational diversity of existing strains and the possibility of the emergence of new strains with novel conformational properties in the future (37Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Legname G. Matsunaga Y. Vergara J. Burton D. DeArmond S. Prusiner S. Scott M.R. Neuron. 2002; 34: 921-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it would be difficult to predict the risk of transmission of different PrPSc strains from domestic and wild animals to human. Because no cellular factors and no strain-dependent templating are required for the in vitro conversion system presented in our study, the selectivity of seeding primarily reflects the differences in the amino acid sequences of a seed and a substrate. This system might be used perhaps as a rapid assay for assessing the intrinsic propensities of prion transmission between different species.

https://openalex.org/W2040557078,"Observations of carbon monoxide emission in high-redshift (zeta > 2) galaxies indicate the presence of large amounts of molecular gas. Many of these galaxies contain an active galactic nucleus powered by accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole, and a key question is whether their extremely high infrared luminosities result from the active galactic nucleus, from bursts of massive star formation (associated with the molecular gas), or both. In the Milky Way, high-mass stars form in the dense cores of interstellar molecular clouds, where gas densities are n(H2) > 10(5) cm(-3) (refs 1, 2). Recent surveys show that virtually all galactic sites of high-mass star formation have similarly high densities. The bulk of the cloud material traced by CO observations, however, is at a much lower density. For galaxies in the local Universe, the HCN molecule is an effective tracer of high-density molecular gas. Here we report observations of HCN emission from the infrared-luminous 'Cloverleaf' quasar (at a redshift zeta = 2.5579). The HCN line luminosity indicates the presence of 10 billion solar masses of very dense gas, an essential feature of an immense starburst, which contributes, together with the active galactic nucleus it harbours, to its high infrared luminosity."

During the last years, our knowledge of bacterial pattern recognition has increased dramatically and the importance of the absence of contaminations in both muropeptide preparations and other bacterial stimuli has become clear. We investigated a panel of 15 synthetic Limulus-negative muropeptides, four of them synthesized for the first time, as to their potency to synergize with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in cytokine induction in human whole blood. No muropeptide was capable of stimulating cytokine release from human blood. However, as little as 20 nm of the muropeptides N-acetyl-muramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (muramyl dipeptide, M(AdiQ)), N-acetyl-glucosamine-muramyl dipeptide GM(AdiQ), or C18M(AdiQ), which carries a non-natural additional fatty acid, sufficed to induce an up to 3 log-order shift in tumor necrosis factor α-release in response to 100 pg/ml LPS. The release of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 was also significantly enhanced although to a lesser extent. The synergistic effect was stereoselective with M(AdiQ) being the minimal active principle. Synergy was also observed on the transcriptional level by means of real-time PCR. Smaller molecules like N-acetylmuramic acid (M), aM, carrying a naturally occurring 1,6-anhydro-bound in M or M(A), containing only the amino acid l-alanine neither synergized with LPS nor influenced the synergy of other muropeptides with LPS. In conclusion, these data show that nanomolar quantities of muropeptides dramatically potentiate LPS-induced monocyte activation.

This has implications for pyrogenicity testing and endotoxemia in patients. The adjuvant activities of degradation products of peptidoglycan, a major constituent of the Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell wall, are well known and have been intensively characterized for decades (1O'Reilly T. Zak O. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 1100-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1974, muramyl dipeptide (MDP) 1The abbreviations used are: MDP, muramyl dipeptide; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LAL, Limulus amebocyte lysate; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; m-DAP, meso-diaminopimelic acid; Dpm, diaminopimelic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. was found to represent the minimal active principle of peptidoglycan (2Ellouz F. Adam A. Ciorbaru R. Lederer E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Besides its capacity to potentiate the immunogenicity of vaccines, MDP contributes to stimulation of host defense as well as resistance to cancer (3Adam A. Lederer E. ISI Atlas Sci.: Immunol. 1988; : 205-214Google Scholar). Furthermore, MDP has been shown to prime for increased responsiveness toward LPS in vitro and in vivo (4Wolfert M.A. Murray T.F. Boons G.J.

This priming effect is of great importance because our understanding of pattern recognition by the innate immune system so far was primarily based on studies of effects of single components such as LPS. A major obstacle in studying interactions between different bacterial cell wall components like LPS, peptidoglycan, or lipopeptides is the difficulty of purifying these components free of LPS or lipopeptide contaminations. Such purity is difficult to achieve with conventional isolation procedures: the microheterogeneity of these structures adds to the problem. For example, macrophages are activated by picogram/ml concentrations of LPS, whereas microgram/ml concentrations of most muropeptides are required to induce cytokine release. This problem has been overcome by chemical synthesis of defined structures. Such investigations started three decades ago in the case of muropeptides with the focus on adjuvant activity (12Dinarello C.A. Krueger J.M. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2545-2548PubMed Google Scholar, 13Azuma I. Vaccine. 1992; 10: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Bahr G.M. Chedid L.A. Behbehani K. Cell.

Tarumi Y. Ikenaka K. Shibam T. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1976; 49: 533-539Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). At this time, pyrogen exclusion by the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay was in its infancy. More recent work addresses the anti-tumor activity of synthesized conjugates of MDP (17Dzierzbicka K. Kolodziejczyk A.M. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or the ability of glycoside derivatives of MDP to release IL-1β or TNFα from murine macrophages (18Kalyuzhin O.V. Nelyubov M.V. Kalyuzhina E.V. Kuzovlev F.N. Shkalev M.V. Bull. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 134: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, no pyrogen exclusion was performed in these studies. It thus appeared timely to readdress the structure-function relationship of muropeptide activity in the light of the emerging knowledge on bacterial pattern recognition. We therefore complemented a panel of commercially available muropeptide derivatives with nine structures that we synthesized ourselves. Four of these structures were synthesized for the first time. The new structures included typical peptidoglycan breakdown products of the Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell wall, like M(AdiQ) (usually ill-defined as MDP), M(A), which carries only one amino acid, and aM, which consists of muramic acid (M) in an anhydro form, which are released during bacterial growth during infection or by bacteriolysis resulting from host defense mechanisms or administration of antibiotics (19Höltje J.-V.

Schwarz U. 18th Workshop Conference Hoechst, Schloss Ringberg, October 20–23, 1987. Wiley-VCH Verlag, GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1987Google Scholar). Furthermore, we synthesized derivatives containing diaminopimelic acid for the first time. These substances underwent a thorough chemical analysis by NMR and MS as well as LAL testing. These highly defined muropeptide structures representing natural breakdown products of peptidoglycan of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as some variants that are not found in nature, were tested as to their ability to synergize with LPS in inducing cytokine release. Muropeptides—Our strategy to synthesize several natural and non-natural muropeptides (Table I, compounds 2–4 and 8–13) was partly based on the previously published synthesis of differentially protected meso-diaminopimelic acid (m-DAP) (21Holcomb R.C. Schow S. Ayral-Kaloustian S. Powell D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 7005-7008Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Kubasch N. Schmidt R.R. Eur. J. Organic Chem. 2002; 2002: 2710-2726Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To this end bifunctional DAP (Table II, a) was synthesized from benzyloxycarbonyl-protected l-glutamate and a known glycine phosphonate (23Zoller U. Ben-Ishai D. Tetrahedron. 1975; 31: 863-866Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Schmidt U. Lieberknecht A. Wild J. Synthesis. 1984; : 53-60Crossref Google Scholar) via a Wittig-Horner reaction to get the 2,3-dehydro-DAP. Catalytic hydrogenation using Wilkinson’s catalyst gave a 3:2 d:l ratio of the newly created stereogenic center. Final separation by medium pressure liquid chromatography yielded both l,l- and l, d-(meso)-diastereomers. The assignment of the stereogenic centers of the DAP dimethylesters was accomplished by conversion of each single diastereomer to the bis-N-camphanic acid amide derivative and NMR analysis (600 MHz) of the methyl ester region (25Gao Y. Lane-Bell P. Vederas J.C. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 2133-2143Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The muramic acid moiety (Table II, b) was synthesized according to our previously published method (26Kinzy W. Schmidt R.R. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1985; : 1537-1545Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Kinzy W. Schmidt R.R. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1987; : 407-415Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) from 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-azido-2-deoxyglucopyranose (28Alper P.B. Hung S.-C. Wong C.-H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 6029-6032Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Saponification of the methyl ester of two and attachment of the first amino acid (l-alanine methyl ester) prevented the often observed formation of muramic acid 1′,2-lactam during azide reduction (29Termin A. Schmidt R.R. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1989; : 789-795Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Termin A. Schmidt R.R. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1992; : 527-533Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The resulting sugar building block (Table II, c) was used for the synthesis of larger muropeptides. For 1,6-anhydromuramic acid, a new and efficient synthetic route was established: 4-O-benzyl-d-glucal (31Kinzy W. Schmidt R.R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 1981-1984Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was transformed to the 1,6-anhydro-4-O-benzyl-2-iodo-β-d-glucopyranose via an in situ generated 4,6-di-O-dibutyltin ether and iodine (32Czernecki S. Leteux C. Veyrières A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 211-224Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Tailler D. Jacquinet J.-C. Noirot A.-M. Beau J.-M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans.

Chem. 1987; : 407-415Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Paulsen H. Himpkamp P. Peters T. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1986; : 664-674Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) yielded the protected anhydromuramic acid (Table II, d) in seven steps with overall yield >41%. The peptide side chains were built from commercially available, suitably protected amino acids and m-DAP, in solution phase using the well known system PyBOP/NMM/CH2Cl2 (35Coste J. Le-Nguyen D. Castro B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 205-208Crossref Scopus (647) Google Scholar), which generally provided yields >95%. The same system was used to couple these oligopeptides to the free acids of c and d in Table II after alkaline cleavage of their methyl esters. Deprotection of the resulting muramylpeptides was accomplished in two to three steps: hydrogenolysis and N-acetylation transformed azide groups in acetamido groups and concomitantly β-benzyl protecting groups were removed; all ester groups were removed by alkaline saponification; and acid-labile protecting groups were removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in water/dioxane/methanol. The deprotection for the anhydromuropeptides had to be performed particularly carefully; acid-labile protecting groups were cleaved by treatment of the protected starting material with 50% trifluoroacetic acid/CH2Cl2 to prevent opening of the anhydro cycle. Afterward, the ester groups were cleaved by aqueous alkali. Gel chromatography was used in most cases to purify the crude products from salts and impurities. Additional chromatographic methods, including ion exchange, high performance liquid chromatography, or reversed-phase chromatography were applied in some cases to obtain the pure products.Table IAbbreviations, nomenclature, and source of muropeptidesNo.AbbreviationNomenclatureSource1MMurNAcSigmaaRepresent structural compounds of peptidoglycan.2aM1,6-Anhydro-MurNAcNKaRepresent structural compounds of peptidoglycan.,bNK, synthesized by N.

To abbreviate the different muropeptides, the following nomenclature was developed. The carbohydrate portion was abbreviated with M (N-acetylmuramic acid) and with aM indicating an 1,6-anhydro form of muramic acid. GM (G = N-acetylglucosamine) and C18M indicateds an additional substituent of a further sugar residue or a steric acid ester at the C-6 position. The peptide sequence was attached in parentheses using the one letter code for amino acids and using the prefixes d, l, and m (meso) for the stereochemical occurrence as well as i (iso) for structural variants. Diaminopimelic acid has not been assigned a one letter code; thus Dpm was used as the abbreviation. γ and E indicate the linkage of the amino acids. Table I gives the abbreviations, chemical nomenclature as well as the source (NK = synthesized by Niels Kubasch, Konstanz, Germany; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany; Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland; Calzyme, San Luis Obispo, CA) of the different compounds employed in this study. Compounds marked by an a are structurally identical to known fragments of peptidoglycan and can be released during bacterial growth or bacteriolysis (19Höltje J.-V. Schwarz U. Bushell M.E. Gräfe U. Bioactive Metabolites from Microorganisms. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1989: 101-112Google Scholar, 20Höltje J.-V. Schrinner E. Richmond M.H. Seibert G. Schwarz U. 18th Workshop Conference Hoechst, Schloss Ringberg, October 20–23, 1987. Wiley-VCH Verlag, GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1987Google Scholar). All muropeptides were free of endotoxin contaminations as indicated by a negative LAL test (QCL-1000, BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) in the final concentration employed in this study, i.e. all preparations contained endotoxin units <0.05 enzyme units/ml, and 0.5 enzyme units/ml endotoxin spikes of the sample were fully recovered showing neither interference nor synergy of LPS and muropeptides in the LAL assay. Whole Blood Incubations—Incubation of human whole blood in the presence of the bacterial stimuli was performed essentially as described (36Hartung T. Docke W.D. Gantner F. Krieger G. Sauer A. Stevens P. Volk H.D. Wendel A. Blood. 1995; 85: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparinized blood freshly taken from healthy volunteers was diluted 5-fold with RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker). The different stimuli were prepared as stock solutions in aqua ad injectabile (Braun, Melsungen, Germany). LPS from Salmonella abortus equi was purchased from Sigma and either used directly or after a further purification to eliminate putative lipopeptide contaminations by a phenol re-extraction according to Hirschfeld et al. (37Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out in open polypropylene reaction tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cell-free supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 400 × g for 2 min (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) and stored at –80 °C until measurement. Monocytes—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers were prepared with CPT™ Cell Preparation Tubes (BD Biosciences). Negative isolation of monocytes was done with the Monocyte Isolation kit (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in RPMI in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and stimulated for 24 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Supernatants were stored at –80 °C until measurement. Isolated Liver Perfusion—C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany, bred in the internal animal facility of the University of Konstanz) were pretreated (intraperitoneally) for 1 h with 2.5 μg/kg LPS, 700 μg/kg galactosamine (GalN, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), and 250 μg/kg M(AdiQ). After 1 h mice were put to sleep intravenously with 150 mg/kg pentobarbital (Narcoren®, Merial, Halbergmoos, Germany) and 0.8 mg/kg heparin (Sigma). The vena portae and vena cava inferior of the mouse liver (C57BL/6) were cannulated and the organ was perfused blood free with a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer with a total volume of 25 ml of buffer in closed recirculation under constant pressure conditions and samples were obtained for the times indicated in the graph. The temperature of the perfusate was kept constant at 37 °C and oxygenation with pure oxygen at a pressure of 500 mbar was performed. During perfusion, the perfusate flow-through of the liver as well as the pressure were constantly measured and recorded by special software (Lab View, National Instruments, Austin, TX). Samples for alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase measurements (38Bergmeyer H.U. Clin. Chem. 1972; 18: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were taken from the perfusate at different time points, as indicated in the figure. Cytokine Determination—Cytokines were measured by ELISA based on antibody pairs from Endogen, Biozol, Eching, Germany (TNFα and IL-1), R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN (IL-6), and BD Pharmingen (IL-10 and interferon γ). Recombinant cytokines serving as standards were from National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) (TNFα and IL-1), from Thomae (Biberach, Germany) (interferon γ), and BD Pharmingen (IL-6 and IL-10). Binding of biotinylated antibody was quantified using streptavidin peroxidase (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and the substrate TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, Sigma). Preparation of mRNA and Reverse Transcription—For preparation of mRNA, human whole blood incubations were stimulated with 100 pg/ml LPS and 20 nm M(AdiQ) for 2 or 4 h. After 2 h, 1 μm actinomycin D was added to some incubations and incubation was continued for a further 2 h. mRNA was isolated with the QiAmp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions. Possible contaminating DNA was digested with the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). Reverse transcription for PCR was performed using PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR system 9600 with 5 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 10× PCR-buffer II, 1 mm dNTP (Roche Diagnostics), 2.5 μm oligo(dT)16 (Thermo Hybrid, Ulm, Germany), 20 units/μl RNase inhibitor (Roche), 50 units/μl murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 4.2 μl of RNase-free water. Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler rapid thermal cycler system (Roche). The cDNA for TNFα and GAPDH was amplified using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche) according to the manufacturers protocol. The MgCl2 concentration was adjusted to 3 mm TNFα and 4 mm GAPDH. The thermal cycling was performed (50 cycles) with an annealing temperature of 65 °C and an elongation time of 11 s for TNFα and 18 s for GAPDH. The amplification was followed by a melting program that started at 54 °C for 45 s and then increased to 95 °C at 0.1 °C/s. The specific melting temperatures for TNFα and GAPDH products were 93 and 86.5 °C. All primers (0.5 μm) were from Thermo Hybrid: TNFα, 5′-GAGTGACAAGCCTGTAGCCCATGTTGTAGCA-3′ (forward), 5′-GCAATGATCCCAAAGTAGACCTGCCCAGACT-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ (forward), 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ (reverse). The amplification products had a length of 226 (GAPDH) and 682 bp (TNFα), respectively. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All data are mean ± S.E. Significance of differences was assessed by the Wilcoxon test for two groups and by analysis of variance employing the Bonferroni test for experiments with more than two groups. Non-linear regression was calculated according to the application of the Gompertz equation for the study of Xylem cell development by Rossi et al. (46Rossi S. Deslauriers A. Morin H. Dendrochronologie. 2003; : 33-39Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the figures *, **, and *** represent p values <0.05, <0.01, and <0.001, respectively. Synergistic Effect of LPS and M(AdiQ)—To determine the most pronounced synergistic effect of LPS and M(AdiQ), human whole blood was incubated with 100 pg/ml LPS and increasing amounts of M(AdiQ) (2 pm to 200 nm). LAL-negative muropeptides alone induced essentially no cytokine release (<16 pg of TNFα/ml of blood). A significant synergistic effect between LPS and M(AdiQ) was observed from a concentration of 20 nm M(AdiQ), which corresponds to 10 ng/ml M(AdiQ) (Fig. 1). Because commercially available LPS preparations might contain highly bioactive contaminants that can effect biological read-outs, we further purified the LPS by phenol re-extraction as published by Hirschfeld et al. (37Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 2, the capacity of LPS to induce cytokine release from human whole blood was not significantly altered by the re-purification procedure. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of M(AdiQ) was not dependent on the purity of the LPS preparation.Fig. 2Synergistic effect of M(AdiQ) on TNFα release in blood stimulated with repurified LPS. Human whole blood was stimulated with LPS in commercial quality or re-purified LPS in the concentrations indicated in the presence or absence of 20 nm M(AdiQ). After 24 h of incubation, TNFα was determined in cell-free supernatants by ELISA. Data are mean ± S.E. of 4 donors. ** and *** indicate significance compared with stimulation with 100 pg/ml LPS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the effect of M(AdiQ) preincubation, human whole blood was incubated with 20 nm M(AdiQ) for 4 h and re-stimulated with 100 pg/ml LPS. The results were compared with an incubation in which LPS and M(AdiQ) were added simultaneously. Preincubation of M(AdiQ) led to a 10% increase of TNFα release compared with simultaneous stimulation with LPS (data not shown). Because this difference was not statistically significant, stimuli were added together in all further experiments. As indicated in Fig. 3a, costimulation of human whole blood with different concentrations of LPS and 20 nm M(AdiQ) led to a shift to the left of the concentration-response curve of LPS-induced TNFα release by about 3 log orders. Similarly, in isolated monocytes in the presence of 20 nm M(AdiQ), 100 pg/ml LPS achieved TNFα levels comparable with stimulation with 1 μg/ml LPS (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the synergistic effect of LPS and M(AdiQ), although to a lesser extent, was also observed for the release of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 (Fig. 3, b and c). In extension, M(AdiQ) significantly enhanced the LPS-induced liver injury in galactosamine-sensitized mice, measured in situ as alanine aminotransferase liberation into the perfusate of isolated livers (Fig. 5), indicating that ex vivo a similar synergistic endotoxic liver injury is observed such as in vivo.Fig. 4Synergistic effect of M(AdiQ) on LPS-induced TNFα release from monocytes. Isolated human monocytes were stimulated with LPS in the concentrations indicated or with 20 nm M(AdiQ) ± 100 pg/ml LPS. TNFα release was determined by ELISA after 18 h of incubation.

Mice were injected (intraperitoneal) with 2.5 μg/kg LPS and 700 μg/kg galactosamine with or without 250 μg/kg M(AdiQ). One hour later, livers were excised and subjected to recirculating perfusion. The liberation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) into the perfusate was monitored over time. LPS alone (▴) or in combination with M(AdiQ) (▪), as well as M(AdiQ) alone (▾) are shown as mean ± S.E. of 4 livers. * and ** indicate significance toward stimulation with LPS only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetics of TNFα Release and mRNA Formation in the Presence of M(AdiQ)—TNFα release from human whole blood was determined at different time points after stimulation with 100 pg/ml LPS alone or costimulation with 20 nm M(AdiQ). A synergistic effect was evident after 4 h of incubation. Maximal TNFα release was reached after 8 h in both series of experiments, indicating that M(AdiQ) did not alter the kinetics of TNFα release (Fig. 6). To investigate whether the synergistic effect of M(AdiQ) on LPS-induced TNFα release is because of enhanced transcription of TNFα mRNA, human whole blood was stimulated with 100 pg/ml LPS ± 20 nm M(AdiQ) in the presence or absence of 1 μm actinomycin D. TNFα mRNA was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Samples costimulated with LPS and M(AdiQ) showed an increased expression of TNFα mRNA after 4 h compared with stimulation using LPS only. The presence of 1 μm actinomycin D blunted the effect of M(AdiQ) on TNFα mRNA expression, whereas GAPDH levels remained unchanged. These results indicate that M(AdiQ) increases LPS-induced TNFα mRNA, which seems to be because of increased de novo transcription rather than to an increase in mRNA stability (Fig. 7). Dependence of Synergy on Muropeptide Structure—Fifteen muropeptides with different structures were investigated with regard to their synergistic activity with LPS in monocyte activation. Nine of the different muropeptide derivatives, which were not commercially available, were synthesized, the others were bought in highly pure quality (Table I). Purity and identity was confirmed by LAL, NMR, and MS analysis for all muropeptides. Control experiments con"

This rapid multiplication requires active synthesis of new membranes and is fueled by phospholipid precursors and fatty acids that are scavenged from the human host. Plasmodium membrane biogenesis relies heavily on the expression of parasite enzymes that incorporate these precursors into phospholipids. However, little is known about the genes involved in membrane biogenesis or where this process takes place within the parasite. Here, we describe the analysis in P. falciparum of the first step of phospholipid biosynthesis that controls acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate (GPAT) at the sn-1 position. We show that this activity is of parasite origin and is specific for glycerol 3-phosphate substrate. We have identified the gene, PfGAT, encoding this activity in P. falciparum and reconstituted its codon composition for optimal expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PfGAT complements the lethality of a yeast double mutant gat1Δgat2Δ, lacking GPAT activity. Biochemical analysis revealed that PfGatp is a low affinity GPAT enzyme with a high specificity for C16:0 and C16:1 substrates. PfGatp is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic life cycle of the parasite but induced mainly at the trophozoite stage. This study, which describes the first protozoan GPAT gene, reveals an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the initial step of Plasmodium membrane biogenesis.

This study, which describes the first protozoan GPAT gene, reveals an important role for the endoplasmic reticulum in the initial step of Plasmodium membrane biogenesis. Plasmodium species are obligate intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites that undergo a number of developmental stages in the vertebrate host. In humans, they annually cause clinical illness in 300–500 million people with 1.5–2.7 million deaths, mainly caused by Plasmodium falciparum (1WHO WHO Tech. Rep. Ser. 2000; 892 (i-v): 1-74Google Scholar). Drug resistance is widespread, and the need for more efficacious and less toxic agents that exploit pathways and targets unique to the parasite is acute. In the 48 h after invasion of human red blood cells, P. falciparum grows to many times its original size and then divides to produce 16–32 daughter parasites. This high rate of growth and multiplication requires synthesis of new membranes. Accordingly, the phospholipid content of malaria-infected erythrocytes increases by up to 5-fold during parasite maturation, with 85% of the newly synthesized phospholipids being either phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine (2Holz G.G. Bull. WHO. 1977; 55: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar). Parasite infection is also accompanied by a marked increase in neutral lipid species like fatty acids, diacylglycerol (DAG) 1The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; DHAPAT, dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PfGATCO, codon-optimized PfGAT; TAG, triacylglycerol. and triacylglycerol (TAG) (3Vial H.J. Ancelin M.L. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology Pathogenesis and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 159-175Google Scholar).

Whereas all of the known and predicted enzymes of the type II fatty acid-synthesizing enzyme pathway contain a signal peptide and a targeting sequence for apicoplast (14Foth B.J. Ralph S.A.

Because of their importance for parasite development, the pathways of synthesis of phospholipids have long been considered attractive targets for chemotherapy. Accordingly, quaternary ammonium compounds, analogs of choline, have been shown to interfere with phospholipid metabolism, to inhibit parasite growth in vitro, and to clear malaria infection in mice and monkeys (16Wengelnik K. Vidal V. Ancelin M.L. Cathiard A.M. Morgat J.L. Kocken C.H. Calas M. Herrera S. Thomas A.W. Vial H.J. Science. 2002; 295: 1311-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the initial step of phospholipid synthesis involves acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate at the sn-1 position by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPAT) to form lysophosphatidic acid (17Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 18Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog.

Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases then catalyze the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid at the sn-2 position to generate phosphatidic acid (19Dircks L. Sul H.S. Prog.

Phosphatidate phosphatase and CDP-DAG synthase enzymes convert the phosphatidic acid formed into DAG and CDP-DAG, respectively. DAG subsequently enters the de novo CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathways for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. CDP-DAG enters the CDP-DAG pathway for synthesis of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol (22Kelley M.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Here we describe the identification and characterization in P. falciparum of the gene, PfGAT, encoding GPAT activity. We show that the encoded protein, PfGatp, is a yeast-like GPAT enzyme localized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and exists as a large multimeric protein complex. PfGatp activity is required for survival of yeast cells lacking GPAT activity because of the loss of the two GPAT-encoding genes GAT1 and GAT2 (27Zaremberg V. McMaster C.R. J. Biol.

The identification of PfGAT will set the stage for a better understanding of glycerolipid biosynthesis in P. falciparum and could lead to better therapeutic strategies to inhibit this process and block parasite proliferation.

Plasmid Construction—Codon-optimized PfGATCO was synthesized using the forward and reverse primers shown in Fig. 5 and those described below. PfGATCO was first assembled and amplified as four small fragments that were subsequently used as templates to amplify the whole gene. Assembly reactions were performed using Platinum Taq High Fidelity enzyme (Invitrogen), with 4 μm final concentration for each primer. The program for assembly is the following: 2 min at 94 °C, 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C, and terminated by a final elongation at 68 °C for 3 min. The resulting products were purified and used as templates for amplification using Platinum Taq High Fidelity enzyme and the following PCR program: 2 min at 94 °C, 20–25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, and 45 s at 68 °C, and terminated by a final elongation at 68 °C for 2 min. The full-length PfGATCO was cloned into XmaI and KpnI sites of the pBEVY-L ADH1 LEU2 plasmid thus yielding the vector pBEVY-L ADH1::PfGATCOLEU2. For construction of the plasmid pYES2.1 GAL1::PfGAT URA3, PfGAT was PCR-amplified using genomic DNA from the P. falciparum 3D7 clone and the primers OCHO101 (CGCGGATCCATGCCAGATTTTTACTTTTTAATAAGATGG) and ScPfGat-F′ (TAAGATCTCTTCCTTATATTCTAATTG) and subsequently cloned into the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Similarly the pYES2.1 GAL1::PfGATCOURA3 was generated by PCR amplification of PfGATCO using pBEVY-L ADH1::PfGATCOLEU2 as a template and the primers PfScGat1 primer 1 (CCCCCCGGGATGCCAGATTTCTACTTCCTAATCAGATGGCTGTGTAAGGTTATCGTTAA) and ScPfGat-F′ (TAAGATCTCTTCCTTATATTCTAATTG) followed by cloning into the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO vector. The sequence contiguity of PfGAT and PfGATCO was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table I. Yeast strains were grown in rich medium (2% Bacto-peptone and 1% yeast extract) containing either 2% dextrose (YPD) or 2% galactose (YPG), or in minimal medium (1.7% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose, or 2% galactose). Supplements were added as required to maintain cell growth. ScCHO104 that lacks the pGAL1::GAT1 URA3 plasmid was generated by growing CMY228+(pBEVY-L ADH1::PfGATCOLEU2) (ScCHO88) on glucose-based minimal medium containing 0.1% 5-fluorotic acid and 12 μg/ml uracil. The genotype of this strain was confirmed by PCR analysis using HNM1-, PfGATCO-, and GAT1-specific primers ScHNM1080–1098 (CATTGCTTGTCACACTTGG), XhoI-PstI-HNM1-C (CCGCTCGAGCTGCAGTCACTTCTTTCCCCACGGTAC), PfScGat1 primer 1 (CCCCCCGGGATGCCAGATTTCTACTTCCTAATCAGATGGCTGTGTAAGGTTATCGTTAA), ScPfGat primer 10′ (GACTTCTGTCTGATTGATCTTAGGTATAATCTTGAATGGTACACCGTTCA), ScGAT1–749 (ATACGAAGGGCTGTGTAGG), and ScGAT1–1697 (TCAACACCGATTTCACCG).Table IS. cerevisiae strains analyzed in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceBY4741 (ScCHO1)MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0Research Geneticsgat1Δ (ScCHO113)MATα his3ΔI leu2Δmet15Δ0 ura3Δ0 gat1::KANrResearch GeneticsScCHO99MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 gat1::KANr [pYES2.1 GAL1::PfGAT URA3]This studyScCHO102MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 gat1::KANr [pYES2.1 GAL1::PfGATCOURA3]This studyScCHO93MATα his3ΔI leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 gat1::KANr [pYES2.1 GAL1 URA3]This studyCMY228MATα his3–11,15 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 ade2–1 can1–100 gat1Δ::TRP1 gat2Δ::HIS3 ura3–1[pGAL1::GAT1 URA3]Ref. 27Zaremberg V.

The resulting PCR product was digested with XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes and cloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pET-15b (Novagen), thus creating pET-15b-PfGAT-His6-78 plasmid. This plasmid was expressed in BL21-CodonPlus-RIL Escherichia coli strain (Stratagene). A 200-ml culture of E. coli was grown to an A600 of 0.6 in Luria broth at 37 °C. The cells were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and incubated for an additional 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and lysed. Histidine-tagged protein was purified by Ni2+ chromatography at 4 °C (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions. Purified recombinant Ct-PfGatp was used to immunize rabbits, which was performed by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. To generate an antigen for screening and purification of PfGatp-specific antibodies, the pET-15b-PfGAT-His6-78 plasmid was digested with XhoI and HindIII restriction enzymes, and the 0.6-kb fragment containing the 3′-end of PfGAT was cloned into the SalI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pMalC2-X (New England Biolabs), thus creating pMalC-PfGat-MBP-78 plasmid. This plasmid synthesizes the PfGatp C-terminal fragment as a fusion protein to the N-terminal portion of the E. coli maltose-binding protein. pET-15b-PfGat-MBP-78 plasmid was expressed in BL21-CodonPlus-RIL E. coli strain. The purification of the PfGatp-MBP-78 fusion protein was performed using maltose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs). The crude serum obtained from Cocalico Biologicals was affinity-purified over an Affi-15 gel (Bio-Rad) matrix to which PfGatp-MBP-78 fusion protein was bound covalently. For immunoblots, parasite lysates were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Preincubation, antibody incubations, and washes were conducted in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 0.05% Tween 20 with 5% skim milk. Preimmune and purified antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution. A chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect the immunological reaction. For expression and purification of His6-tagged PfGatp in S. cerevisiae, transformants expressing pYES2.1 GAL1 URA3, pYES2.1 GAL1:: PfGAT URA3 or pYES2.1 GAL1::PfGATCO URA3 (ScCHO93, ScCHO99, and ScCHO102, respectively) were grown on minimal medium containing galactose to mid-log phase. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (28Zheng Z. Zou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41710-41716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) except that protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and 1% Triton X-100 were added. Six mg of cell extract was mixed with 4 volumes of buffer A (50 mm NaH2P04, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 8). Histidine-tagged proteins were purified by Ni2+ chromatography, washed with 20 volumes of buffer A, and eluted in the presence of 50 mm NaH2P04, 200 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 8. GPAT and Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate Acyltransferase (DHAPAT) Assays—Parasites from 3D7 asynchronous and synchronous cultures (2% hematocrit, 10% parasitemia) were isolated from infected erythrocytes by treatment with 0.07–0.1% saponin for 15 min at 0 °C followed by centrifugation at 2,061 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed in PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. After sonication followed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g, the supernatant was recovered and used for GPAT and DHAPAT assays. Yeast extracts were obtained as described previously (28Zheng Z. Zou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41710-41716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For the GPAT assay, 200 μg of protein extracts was added to 200 μl of GPAT buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 45 μm fatty acyl-CoA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.4 mm [14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (2.5 μCi/μmol) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h except as otherwise mentioned. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 600 μl of 1% HClO4. The DHAPAT assay was performed as described by Athenstaedt et al. (30Athenstaedt K. Weys S. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1458-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For both activities, lipid extraction was performed by adding 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) to the mixture followed by adding 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of 1% HClO4. After centrifugation at 1,250 × g for 5 min, the organic phase was recovered and washed with 2 ml of 1% HClO4 followed by centrifugation at 1250 × g for 5 min. The chloroform phase was transferred to a scintillation vial, dried, and counted. Aqueous and organic phases were also analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel plates (Whatman). The hydrophilic phase of the first extraction was dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in choroform for loading on TLC. A solvent made of chloroform:methanol:water:acetic acid (70:30:4:2) was used to separate radiolabeled products and to confirm their identity. The main product detected in the organic phase of the GPAT assay was phosphatidic acid. No phosphatidic acid or lysophosphatidic acid could be detected in the aqueous phase. For the DHAPAT assay, low counts could be measured from the organic phase, and no radiolabeled acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate could be measured in the water phase after TLC separation. Standards used were 1-oleoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (Sigma). Gel Filtration Assay—Infected red blood cells from 84 ml of P. falciparum asynchronous culture (2% hematocrit, 10% parasitemia) were treated with 0.15% saponin for 15 min at 0 °C. After centrifugation at 1,875 × g for 10 min the pellet was washed in PBS, resuspended in PBS containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, sonicated, incubated in 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 0 °C, and centrifuged at 16,300 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was concentrated and separated on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and tricholoroacetic acid precipitated. The precipitates were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, neutralized and separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by Western blotting, using affinity-purified anti-PfGatp antibodies. Analysis of PfGatp Membrane Association—Infected red blood cells from a 36-ml asynchronous culture (2% hematocrit, 10% parasitemia) were treated with 0.07% saponin for 15 min at 0 °C. After centrifugation at 1,875 × g for 10 min, the pellet was washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS. After sonication, the extract was subjected to various treatments followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Treatments included a 30-min incubation at 0 °C with buffer alone, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Triton X-114, 1% n-decyl-β-d-maltoside (Anatrace), 0.5 m potassium acetate or 0.1 m Na2CO3 at pH 11. Supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with affinity-purified anti-PfGatp and anti-PfNT1 antibodies (31Rager N. Mamoun C.B. Carter N.S. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41095-41099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were visualized by ECL. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Synchronous cultures of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were washed twice in PBS, placed onto coverslips, and dried at room temperature. Fixation, washes, and mounting were performed as described by Rager et al. (31Rager N. Mamoun C.B. Carter N.S. Goldberg D.E. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41095-41099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Coverslips were incubated simultaneously with affinity-purified anti-PfGatp antibodies (diluted 1:10) and either mouse monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) to the red blood cell Band 3 protein (diluted 1:500) or rat polyclonal antibodies (MR4) to the P. falciparum endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP (32Kumar N. Koski G. Harada M. Aikawa M. Zheng H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 48: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 1 h. The coverslips were washed and then incubated with anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate and anti-mouse conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes) or anti-rabbit rhodamine and anti-rat FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained by incubating the coverslips in PBS containing 3 μg/ml Hoechst stain (Molecular Probes) for 5 min at room temperature. Mitochondrial staining was performed by incubating infected red blood cells with 250 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 5 min prior to fixation and incubation with affinity-purified PfGatp antibodies (diluted 1:10). The coverslips were washed and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit conjugated to FITC (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Images were analyzed by high resolution fluorescence and confocal microscopy. GPAT and DHAPAT Activities in P. falciparum—To examine the presence of GPAT and/or DHAPAT activities in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and to determine their origin (i.e. red blood cell or parasite), hemolysate and parasite fractions were prepared from red blood cells infected with an asynchronous culture of the 3D7 clone of P. falciparum and analyzed for their GPAT and DHAPAT activities using glycerol 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate substrates, respectively. Parasite extracts were able to catalyze the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate substrate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate substrates (Fig. 1, A and B). However, the P. falciparum DHAPAT represented less than 1% of the GPAT activity (Fig. 1B). No GPAT or DHAPAT activities could be detected in red blood cell hemolysates from infected as well as control uninfected red blood cells (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine the GPAT activity during P. falciparum intraerythrocytic development, extracts were prepared from a highly synchronous culture of 3D7-infected erythrocytes and analyzed for GPAT activity. Equal amounts of proteins from each developmental stage resulted in relatively similar acylation activities (not shown). However, determination of the total activity per developmental stage indicated a 1.4- and 2.3-fold increase in the acylation activity during trophozoite and schizont stages (1.267 nmol of glycerol 3-phosphate/108 trophozoites and 2.052 nmol of glycerol 3-phosphate/108 schizonts), respectively, compared with the ring stage (0.88 nmol of glycerol 3-phosphate/108 rings) (Fig. 1C). Consistent with data from asynchronous parasites, only residual DHAPAT activity (∼0.15% of the cellular GPAT activity) could be detected from ring, trophozoite, and schizont extracts (data not shown). These results indicate that in P. falciparum the first step of glycerolipid biosynthesis is directed mostly toward the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate substrate. As a control, yeast extracts were used, and both activities were detected (Fig. 1, A and B) in agreement with data published previously (20Christiansen K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Zheng Z. Zou J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9144-9149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PfGatp Is a Yeast-like GPAT Protein—To identify the enzyme(s) responsible for the malarial GPAT activity, we searched for GPAT-like proteins in the P. falciparum genome data bases using known GPAT proteins as query. A gene that we named PfGAT was identified based on its homology with yeast GPAT enzymes. PfGAT was cloned from the P. falciparum 3D7 clone (The Netherlands) and was found to encode a polypeptide of 583 amino acids which exhibits ∼28% identity and 49% similarity to S. cerevisiae Gat1p and Gat2p (Fig. 2A) and other putative GPAT enzymes from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the filamentous yeast Candida albicans (not shown). In contrast, PfGatp shares little or no homology with bacterial, mammalian, and plant known and putative GPAT proteins. The four motifs known to play a crucial role in GPAT activity are present in PfGatp and are highly homologous to those found in yeast GPAT proteins (34Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these motifs are different from the previously characterized or predicted human, mouse, bacterial, and plant GPAT enzymes (Table II). Furthermore, whereas PfGatp and its yeast homologs Gat1p and Gat2p have a long stretch of 102, 120, and 109 amino acid residues between motifs II and III, respectively, this linker is much shorter in the human, mouse, bacterial, and plant known and putative GPAT enzymes with, respectively, 35, 35, 29, and 57 amino acid residues only (Table II). The derived amino acid sequence of PfGatp was analyzed to determine the hydrophobic character of the protein, using the TMHHM program (35Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). PfGatp is predicted to possess three hydrophobic membrane spanning domains with a long N-terminal stretch (1–382) exposed outside the membrane (Fig. 2B). This topology is similar to that predicted for the yeast Gat1p and Gat2p proteins (28Zheng Z. Zou J. J. Biol.

Post-heparin lipoprotein lipase activity was reduced by 61% in the dko mice. Hepatic TG production rate, determined after intravenous Triton WR1339 injection, was increased 8-fold in the dko mice. Hepatic mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (srebp-1) and its target genes acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (acc-1), fatty acid synthase (fas), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (scd-1) were significantly elevated in the dko mice compared with the ko control. The hepatic mRNA levels of LXRα (lxrα) and its target genes including angiopoietin-like protein 3 (angptl-3) in the dko mice were unchanged.

On the other hand, it is not known whether primary low HDL-C states may contribute to HTG. Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) plays a central role in reverse cholesterol transport. The primary lipoprotein defect in LCAT deficiency is severe HDL deficiency, and many such subjects are frequently moderately hypertriglyceridemic (4Gjone E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab.

These observations suggest that LCAT may play an important role in modulating plasma TG levels, but the underlying mechanisms have not been explored. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a critical role in the lipolysis of TG in both very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons. Complete low density lipoprotein (LDL) deficiencies caused by genetic mutations of the LPL gene or its cofactor apoC-II are associated with severe chylomicronemia. Partial LPL deficiency in patients heterozygous for LPL mutations is variably associated with HTG, low HDL-C, and accelerated atherosclerosis (10Merkel M. Eckel R.H. Goldberg I.J. J.

The lpl+/– mice developed relative hypoglycemia in conjunction with an elevated fasting insulin, the latter attributable to an increased secretion of insulin by the pancreatic β-cells without any associated peripheral insulin resistance (11Marshall B.A. Tordjman K.

The mechanism for the insulin oversecretion in the lpl+/– mice remains obscure. Hepatic overproduction of TG predisposes to HTG in mammals. Common causes of increased hepatic TG synthesis include increased free fatty acid flux into the hepatocytes, as seen in obesity, and increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, as seen in alcohol or carbohydrate-induced HTG. Recent studies suggest that enzymes participating in hepatic fatty acid synthesis are coordinately regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) at the transcriptional level, predominantly by the two isoforms of the SREBP1 gene, SREBP1a and SREBP1c, with the latter being considerably more abundant in the liver (12Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). Both insulin and liver X receptor α (LXRα) have been shown to be potent inducers of SREBP1 gene transcription (13Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H.

Insulin may induce SREBP1 gene transcription directly even in insulin-resistant states, which may account for the common occurrence of the strong association between insulin resistance and HTG. LXRα ligands, both endogenous and exogenous, have been shown to cause up-regulation of the SREBP1 gene by targeting directly through the LXR response element. SREBP1 activity may also be suppressed by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) at both the transcriptional (14Ou J. Tu H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc.

More intriguingly, a number of genes known to modulate hepatic gluconeogenesis, including the rate-limiting enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), have been shown to be directly and negatively regulated by LXRα (17Laffitte B.A. Chao L.C.

We investigated the possible mechanism of LCAT deficiency-associated HTG in the LDL receptor knock-out (ldlr–/–) mouse background. We also explored the possible association of HTG with altered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in this mouse model. Animals—Breeding pairs of the ldlr–/–× lcat–/– double knock-out (dko) and their littermate ldlr–/– × lcat+/+ single knock-out (ko) mice were a kind gift from Dr. John Parks (19Furbee Jr., J.W.

Housing and all brothersister matings were carried out at the Vivarium, St. Michael's Hospital. All animals were 4 months or older and fed a chow diet as described previously (20Ng D.S. Maguire G.F.

Age- and gender-matched littermates were used for all experiments. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee at St. Michael's Hospital. Plasma Lipid Analyses—Plasma lipid analyses were performed on mice 6–8 months of age. Plasma was obtained as described previously (21Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Knoff L. Frei B. Suh J. Harmony J.A. Stuart W.D. Rubin E.M. Ng D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) fractionation on total plasma was performed on a Superose 6HR column (10 mm × 30 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) (22Ha Y.C. Barter P.J. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 341: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Plasma and Superose fractions were analyzed on an RA-1000 (Bayer Diagnostics) using enzymatic assays for total cholesterol, TG, glycerol blank, free cholesterol, and phospholipid. In Vitro Lipolysis Assay—The lipolysis assay was adapted from the published method by Jong et al. (24Jong M.C. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). VLDL plus intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) was isolated from pooled (n = 7) mouse plasma by ultracentrifugation at d < 1.019 g/ml (23Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). The VLDL plus IDL fraction was incubated with 0.2 unit of bovine lipoprotein lipase (Sigma) at 37 °C in the presence of FFA-free 3% bovine serum albumin. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 in KH2PO4 at pH 6.9. FFA released from the reaction was measured using a commercially available enzymatic colorimetric kit (NEFA Wako Chemicals USA, Inc.). Four different concentrations of VLDL-TG in the range of 0.1–0.6 mm were used. FFA released/min/liter against blank (reaction stopped without addition of LPL) were obtained, and all data points were means of duplicates. Post-heparin Lipase Activities (PHLA)—The assay of post-heparin total lipase and hepatic lipase activities was adapted from a previously published method (25Wang C.S. Bass H.B. Downs D. Whitmer R.K. Clin. Chem. 1981; 27: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for mouse samples. Briefly, after an overnight fast, mice 6–8 months of age were injected individually with heparin (LEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ontario) intraperitoneally at 100 IU/kg. Blood was drawn 30 min postinjection, and the plasma samples from three or four gender-mixed animals were pooled and grouped by genotypes. Analyses were done on three pools of animals for each genotype. Aliquots of 5, 10, and 25 μl of pooled plasma were used for total lipase and 10, 30, and 50 μl for hepatic lipase determinations. Protamine sulfate was used as LPL inhibitor for the hepatic lipase assay. Frozen normal human sera were used as activator. FFA were then extracted and analyzed as described above. TG Production Rate—In vivo determination of the TG production rate was carried out in 8–10-month-old, gender-matched mice. Serial measurements of plasma TG over 90 min were determined after a single dose tail vein injection of Triton WR1339 at 500 mg/kg body weight at 15% w/v in saline. mRNA Quantitation of Hepatic Genes in Lipid and Glucose Metabolism—Study mice were fasted overnight before sacrifice. Hepatic mRNA levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (acc-1), fatty acid synthase (fas), SREBP1 (srebp-1), angiopoietin-like protein 3 (angptl3), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (scd-1), acyl-CoA oxidase (axo), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (cpt-1), and peroxisomal proliferator activator receptor α (pparα) were measured using semiquantitative RT-PCR with GAPDH (gapdh) as internal standard. Total RNA was extracted using TriZol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's suggested protocol, and the purified mRNA product was snap frozen at –86 °C until use. RT-PCR was performed using the Superscript One-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The number of cycles for RT-PCR was optimized for each gene by selecting the cycle number within the exponential phase. The RT-PCR program was initiated by heating the sample at 50 °C for 30 min, 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 24–28 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR finished with heating at 72 °C for 5 min. Intensity of the PCR product for each gene of interest was determined using the Bio-Rad GS800 densitometer normalized to that of gadph under identical conditions. Primers for the genes are: ACC-1 (5′-gggacttcatgaatttgctg; 3′-gtcattaccatcttcattacctca), FAS (NM017332) (5′-ggctttggcctggaactg; 3′-gaaggctacacaagctccaaa), SREBP1 (NM004176) (5′-tcaacaaccaagacagtgacttcc; 3′-gttctcctgcttgagtttctggtt), SCD-1 (NM_009127) (5′-ttcttacacgaccaccacca; 3′-gcgttgagcaccagagtgta), Angptl3 (XM_131498) (5′-attcaacaccggaaagatgg; 3′-tggagcatcattttggatga), CPT-1 (NM_013495) (5′-tccatgcataccaaagtgga; 3′-tcatcagtggcctcacagac), AXO (AF006688) (5′-ccgtctgcagcatcataaca; 3′-taaggcgccagtctgaaatc); GAPDH (NM008084) (5′-caaattcaacggcacagtca; 3′-ttgaagtcgcaggagacaac), PPARα (NM01144) (5′-ccagtactgccgttttcaca; 3′-cctctgcctctttgtcttcg), LXRα (AJ132601) (5′-ggatagggttggagtcagca; 3′-cttgccgcttcagtttcttc); PEPCK-1 (NM_011044) (5′-aagttgcccaagatcttcca; 3′-taagggaggtcggtgttggac). Fasting Plasma Insulin and Glucose Tolerance Test—Study mice (n = 9 for both dko and age- and gender-matched ko control) at 4–6 months old were fasted overnight before we obtained plasma samples for the assay. Insulin level was determined using the Linco rat/mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Cedarlane Laboratories, Inc., Ontario). The glucose tolerance test was performed by an intraperitoneal injection of glucose at 1.125 g/kg and blood glucose monitored every 20 min for 2 h. The blood glucose level was determined using an Accu-Chek Compact glucometer (Roche Applied Science) from tail bleed samples. Statistical Analyses—Comparison of group mean ± S.D. was by Student's t test. Pearson statistics were used to evaluate correlation among data sets using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego), and a two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Lipid and Lipoprotein Analyses—As seen in Table I, we observed a significant 1.75-fold increase in fasting plasma TG levels in the dko mice compared with its ko controls. As expected, the total plasma free cholesterol:CE ratio is significantly higher in the dko mice as described previously (19Furbee Jr., J.W. Francone O. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 428-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon separation by FPLC, the cholesterol level was significantly higher in the VLDL fractions and moderately reduced in the LDL/IDL fractions in the dko mice (Fig. 1). Not surprisingly, cholesterol levels of the HDL fractions are extremely low in these mice. Analysis of fasting TG after separation by FPLC revealed that most of the excess TG seen in the dko mice was concentrated in the VLDL fractions, and the LDL and IDL particles in the dko mice were also moderately enriched in TG (Fig. 1). The TG content in HDL fractions was extremely low in both genotypes. The distribution of phospholipids was comparable with that of cholesterol for both genotypes.Table IFasting plasma lipids and lipoproteins in ldlr-/- × lcat+/+ and ldlr-/- × lcat -/- miceT CholTGFCPLFC/CEmmldlr-/- × lcat -/- (n = 6)8.23 ± 1.08ap < 0.002.1.91 ± 0.59bp < 0.025.3.72 ± 0.52bp < 0.025.4.33 ± 0.59bp < 0.025.0.84 ± 0.18ap < 0.002.ldlr-/- × lcat+/+ (n = 4)11.65 ± 1.031.09 ± 0.182.81 ± 0.455.29 ± 0.470.32 ± 0.05a p < 0.002.b p < 0.025. Open table in a new tab In Vitro Lipolysis Assays—To assess the possibility that VLDL in the LCAT-deficient mice might be a poor substrate for lipolysis, we incubated the VLDL (d < 1.019 g/ml) fraction with bovine LPL and measured the rate of FFA release. Although the limited TG concentration range did not permit an accurate estimate of Vmax and Km, as seen in Fig. 2, the kinetic data suggest that VLDL-TG in the dko mice were more efficiently lipolyzed by exogenous LPL. PHLA—PHLA were determined in three pooled plasma samples (n = 3 animals/pool) each for both the dko mice and their ko controls (Fig. 3). Mean post-heparin LPL activity was reduced by 60.8% (15.87 ± 5.34 versus 40.42 ± 4.76 μm/ml/hr; p = 0.004) in the dko mice, whereas the PHLA were not significantly different (10.23 ± 0.61 versus 9.39 ± 2.41, μm/ml/h; p = 0.61). In Vivo TG Production Rate—Mean rates of plasma TG accumulation after Triton WR1339 injection are shown in Fig. 4. There was an 8.0-fold increase in the TG production rate seen in the dko mice compared with the ko control (p = 0.04). Hepatic mRNA Level Determinations—The hepatic mRNA levels for srebp-1, lipogenic enzymes acc-1, fas, and scd-1, as determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR, are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with their controls, the dko mice had a 1.9-fold increase (0.63 ± 0.05 versus 0.33 ± 0.05) in the mRNA level of the acc-1 gene (p = 0.00007). In case of the fas gene, the mRNA level of the ko control mice was essentially undetectable (0.02 ± 0.02), and that of the dko mice was 0.73 ± 0.43, leading to a 36-fold change (p = 0.026). The mRNA levels for the scd-1 gene were elevated 1.2-fold in the dko mice versus control (1.10 ± 0.04 versus 0.91 ± 0.09, respectively; p = 0.003). We also observed a significant 2.16-fold increase in the srebp-1 mRNA level in the dko mice versus control (0.26 ± 0.10 versus 0.12 ± 0.03, respectively; p = 0.039). The mRNA levels of the angptl3 gene were not significantly different between the two genotypes (0.67 ± 0.06 versus 0.69 ± 0.27; p = 0.88). The mRNA levels of lxrα were 1.13-fold elevated in the dko mice compared with control (1.04 ± 0.116 versus 0.92 ± 0.017, respectively; p = 0.050). The mRNA levels of the two pparα target genes, axo-1 and cpt-1, were minimally different between the two groups (1.17 ± 0.35 versus 1.06 ± 0.55; p = 0.01) and (0.87 ± 0.09 versus 0.85 ± 0.03; p = 0.54), respectively, whereas the pparα mRNA levels were 0.84-fold lower than the control (1.06 ± 0.12 versus 1.26 ± 0.08; respectively, p = 0.01). The hepatic expression of pepck-1 gene was found to be reduced 48.7% in the dko mice compared with the control (0.61 ± 0.15 versus 1.19 ± 0.39; p = 0.013). Fasting Insulin and Glucose Levels—The fasting insulin levels of the dko mice were found to be 42% lower than their ko controls (0.92 ± 0.41 versus 1.59 ± 0.55 ng/ml; p = 0.007). The mean fasting blood glucose levels in the dko mice were reduced 31% compared with the ko control (6.0 ± 1.12 mmol/liter versus 8.7 ± 1.02 mmol/liter, p = 0.01) (Fig. 6). The incremental glucose excursions (postchallenge glucose levels minus fasting glucose level in individual animals) over the course of 2 h after the glucose challenge were not significantly different between the two groups (data not shown). In this paper, we report that the LDLR/LCAT dko mice, compared with its LDLR ko controls, are hypertriglyceridemic and are associated with a combination of hepatic TG overproduction and selective impairment in post-heparin LPL activity. This represents the first report of hepatic TG overproduction in association with a monogenic low HDL syndrome. We also observed a concomitant up-regulation of the hepatic expression of the srebp-1 gene and a number of its target lipogenic genes in these dko mice compared with the ko control. In addition, we are also the first to report that the dko mice are more insulin-sensitive than the control mice, on the basis of a concomitant reduction in fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels. These changes in glucose homeostasis were further found to be associated with a significant down-regulation of hepatic pepck-1, the gene for the rate-limiting enzyme for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Although the pepck-1 gene has been shown to be a target gene to both SREBP-1c and its upstream transactivator LXRα (17Laffitte B.A. Chao L.C. Li J. Walczak R. Hummasti S. Joseph S.B. Castrillo A.

Furthermore, transgenic mouse and rabbit models with overexpression of the human LCAT gene have been found to have a modest reduction in fasting TG (8Francone O.L. Gong E.L. Ng D.S. Fielding C.J.

The mechanism by which LCAT modulates TG metabolism has not been fully addressed. Decreased PHLA were found in some but not all subjects with LCAT deficiency (5Frohlich J. McLeod R. Pritchard P.H.

Based on existing published data on LCAT-deficient mice, fasting HTG is most consistently seen in the LDLR/LCAT dko mice. Unlike the apoE knock-out mouse model, the LDLR ko mice develop significant hyperlipidemia without the confounding effect of the absence of apoE on hepatic TG production (27Maugeais C. Tietge U.J.

In the absence of the LDL receptors, the hepatic uptake and endocytosis of circulating apoB-48-enriched VLDL particles via the LDL receptor related protein are significantly attenuated but are sufficient to avoid their accumulation in the circulation (29Herz J. Qiu S.Q. Oesterle A. DeSilva H.V. Shafi S. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4611-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recent studies in mice examining the metabolic effect of exogenous LXR agonists suggest that an increased hepatic TG production alone is inadequate to achieve a sustained HTG without the simultaneous presence of a lipoprotein clearance defect (30Grefhorst A. Elzinga B.M. Voshol P.J. Plosch T. Kok T. Bloks V.W. van der Sluijs F.H. Havekes L.M. Romijn J.A. Verkade H.J. Kuipers F. J. Biol.

These aforementioned considerations make the LDLR/LCAT dko mouse an attractive in vivo model for studying the altered TG metabolism in LCAT deficiency. Our first observation was the excess plasma TG in the dko mice being distributed throughout all non-HDL FPLC fractions, but disproportionately so in the VLDL subfractions (Fig. 1). Although previous theoretical considerations (31Schumaker V.N. Adams G.H. J. Theor. Biol. 1970; 26: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggest that LCAT may participate in the lipolytic process, our in vitro lipolysis assay findings do not support this notion. The data, rather, suggest that the dko mouse VLDL appear to be more effective substrates for lipoprotein lipase. The increase in the in vitro lipolytic efficiency in the dko mouse VLDL could therefore be a reflection of the relative TG enrichment of these lipoprotein particles. On the other hand, our finding of a significant reduction in PHLA in the dko mice suggests that a lipolytic clearance defect may at least in part contribute to the observed fasting HTG seen in these mice. Modest HTG has been reported in a number of severe low HDL syndromes including complete LCAT deficiency, Tangier disease, and apoA-I deficiency (5Frohlich J. McLeod R. Pritchard P.H. Fesmire J.

At this site molecular chaperones and their associated enzymes promote the folding and assembly of newly synthesized polypeptides (1Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Semin. Cell Dev.

Misfolded or aberrant proteins are transported back to the cytosol, then transferred to the 26 S proteasome in a process termed ER-associated protein degradation (3Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L.

The molecular chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP)/GRP78, a member of the Hsp70 family resident of the ER, is involved in many cellular processes that include the translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides across the ER membrane, participation in their folding and maturation, assisting in refolding and renaturation, targeting misfolded proteins to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation, maintaining selectivity of the ER membrane by closing the translocon pore, as well as regulating calcium homeostasis (7Lievremont J.P.

The NH2-terminal of MTJ1 that carries the J-domain is followed by one transmembrane helix and a cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain composed of a spacer region that possesses homology with Sec63p flanked by two tryptophan-mediated repeats or SANT domains for which no function has been attributed (23Chevalier M.

In the present study, we have cloned the human homologue of MTJ1, which we call HTJ1, and used its COOH-terminal domain as bait in a two-hybrid screening of a human liver cDNA library. We have identified α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), a member of the serpin family, as a potential interacting candidate. Targeted mutagenesis indicates that the second SANT domain of HTJ1 (SANT2) mediates the interaction with ACT and that this interaction can be totally disrupted by a tryptophan to alanine single mutation (W520A). SANT2-ACT interaction was confirmed in vitro using purified proteins. ACT once bound to SANT2 was found to have no inhibitory activity toward chymotrypsin. SANT2 significantly slows down the kinetic of formation of the ACT-chymotrypsin acyl complex with no significant effect on the catalytic efficiency of the proteinase. This report documents for the first time that the human homologue of MTJ1/ERdj1 can mediate high affinity protein-protein interactions through its cytosolic domain. In another report, we describe that HTJ1 also interacts with a member of the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor and protects it from being processed by its natural protease. 2B. Kroczynska, L. Yang, H.

Our data suggests that HTJ1/ERdj1 may play a role in the secretion of protease inhibitors in mammalian cells. Materials, Antibodies, Proteins, and Strains—All components of the two-hybrid system, including cloning vectors pGBKT7 and pACT2, human liver cDNA library, S. cerevisiae strain AH109, anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody, anti-HA tag polyclonal antibody, X-α-gal, dropout supplements, and cobalt-chelating resin Talon were obtained from Clontech. Bacterial vector pUC19 was from New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA. pET15b plasmid and the BL21(DE3) codon+ strain were from Novagen, Madison, WI. Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from MBI Fermentas, Amherst, NY. The ECL kit was from Amersham Biosciences. Human plasma ACT was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA. Bovine pancreas chymotrypsin, and its substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Succ-AAPF-pNA) were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-α1-antichymotrypsin antibody was obtained from Fitzgerald Industries International, Inc. Concord, MA. Cloning of HTJ1 cDNA—A nucleotidic sequence from a 10-week-old human embryo (AK027263, GI: 14041830) coding for a putative MTJ1 homologue was used as a template to design the set of primers for the amplification of a human liver cDNA library. The forward primer (5′-ATGACGGCTCCTTGCTCCCAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCAGCTTTTAGCTTGTTTTTTCTTTTGGACC-3′) were used in PCR with Pfu polymerase. The PCR product (1700 bp) was then subcloned into the SmaI site of pUC19. The construct (pUCHTJ1) was sequenced on both strands and sequence analysis was carried out using BLAST sequence analysis software. Yeast and Bacterial Plasmids—cDNA coding for HTJ1, full-length ACT, and fragments were amplified by PCR using the forward and reverse primers listed in Table I. PCR products were subcloned in the yeast pGBKT7 plasmid, in-frame with the NH2-terminal GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the c-Myc epitope tag (pGBKT7 constructs, Table I). A number of PCR products containing varying lengths of HTJ1 and full-length ACT cDNA were cloned in pET15b Escherichia coli expression vector in-frame with a NH2-terminal hexahistidine tag (p(His)6 constructs, Table I). Finally two PCR products of ACT coding the ACT344–400 and ACT35–343 fragments were fused to the NH2-terminal GAL4 activation domain and the HA epitope tag of the yeast pACT2 plasmid (pACT2 constructs, Table I). The clone pGBKT7/HTJ1242–493 was generated by digestion of pGBKT7/HTJ1242–554 with PstI and religation. The HTJ1493–554:W497A mutant was engineered using PCR and a forward mutagenic primer (Table I). The HTJ1493–554:W520A mutant was created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and two overlapping mutagenic primers (Table I). The construct pGBKT7/HTJ1493–554:W497A was used as a template to generate the double mutant pGBKT7/HTJ1493–554:W497A,W520A. The constructs pGBKT7/HTJ1493–554, pGBKT7/HTJ1493–554:W497A, pGBKT7/HTJ1493–554:W520A, and pGBKT7/HTJ1493–554:W497A,W520A were digested with NdeI and XhoI and the inserts were ligated into pET15b to generate p(His)6HTJ1493–554, p(His)6HTJ1493–554:W497A, p(His)6HTJ1493–554:W520A, and p(His)6HTJ1493–554:W497A,W520A, respectively.

The bait pGBKT7/HTJ1242–554 and the library-containing target pACT2 vector were sequentially transformed into the two-hybrid yeast strain AH109 as described (38Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). As strain AH109 possesses three reporter genes (ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1) that are under the control of the Gal4 upstream activating sequences and TATA boxes, transformants were grown on minimal synthetic dropout four medium lacking tryptophan (Trp), leucine (Leu), histidine (His), and adenine (Ade) (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade) to select for potential interactors. Approximately 2 × 106 clones, representing 1/3 library equivalents, were screened against the pGBKT7/HTJ1242–554 bait. Transformants with the ability to grow on SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade that turned blue in the presence of X-α-gal were analyzed further as described under “Results.” Western Blot Analysis of Protein Expression in Yeast Protein Extracts—The yeast strain AH109 was transformed separately with pGBKT7 or pACT2-derived constructs (Table I) and grown overnight on selective SD medium at 30 °C. The yeast protein extracts were prepared according to the manufacturer's procedure (Clontech, protocol number PT3024-1, version PR91200). Following electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 380 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol (transfer buffer). The recombinant proteins expressed from pGBKT7-derived constructs were detected using an anti-c-Myc monoclonal primary antibody and an anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. The expression of the pACT2-derived fusion proteins was detected by using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to HA. Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant histidine-tagged proteins were expressed from pET15-derived constructs (Table I). The E. coli BL21(DE3) codon+ cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth (LB) supplemented with carbenicillin at 100 μg/ml final concentration. Synthesis of recombinant proteins was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.4 mm final concentration at mig-log exponential phase (A600 ∼ 0.5–0.6). Cells were harvested after a 16-h induction, lysed using a French press at 10,000 p.s.i., and the histidine-tagged protein was purified on cobalt-chelating resin as described by the manufacturer (Talon resin, Clontech). All recombinant proteins were expressed in the soluble fraction except for His6-ACT1–400, which accumulates in inclusion bodies and was purified from lysate pellets resolubilized in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl and purified in denaturing conditions. Fractions eluted from the resin were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl to promote renaturation. The renatured soluble recombinant ACT was further purified by fast pressure liquid chromatography using gel filtration on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211571) Google Scholar). Protein purity and homogeneity were analyzed by PAGE performed in both denaturing and native conditions (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205416) Google Scholar). Dot Blot Protein Analysis—Dot blots were performed as described (41Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 272: 9950-9955Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Various amounts of recombinant His6-HTJ1 proteins were applied onto a nitrocellulose membrane, dried, then incubated overnight with a solution of soluble renatured His6-ACT1–400 (5 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, bound ACT was detected with an anti-human ACT monoclonal antibody (1:20,000). In control experiments, purified His6-J-MTJ1 and His6-J-MTJ1:H89Q prepared as described (23Chevalier M. Rhee H. Elguindi E.C. Blond S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19620-19627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were applied to the nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with a solution of recombinant His6-BiP (5 μg/ml) in Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl. Bound BiP was detected by chemiluminescence using a commercially available anti-BiP antibody (PAI-014, Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO). In all experiments, immunoreactivity was visualized by ECL. Native PAGE and Immunodetection of ACT-HTJ1 Interaction—Human plasma ACT (0.64 μm) was incubated at 25 °C with increasing concentrations of purified His6-HTJ1493–554 wild-type or mutant (His6-HTJ1493–554:W497A) in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl prior to electrophoresis in non-denaturing conditions (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205416) Google Scholar). ACT was detected by Western blotting using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching Measurements—All measurements were carried out on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer at a temperature of 25 °C regulated by a thermostatted cell holder and a Cary PCB15 Water peltier system (Varian Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA). All data were analyzed using the Cary Eclipse software (Varian Instruments). The emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 450 nm at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. The excitation and emission slits were set to 10 nm. The emission wavelength increment was 4 nm and the acquisition time 3 s. Tryptophan fluorescence intensities were corrected for the contribution of ACT alone analyzed in the same conditions of temperature, buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl), and concentrations. In titration experiments, the fraction of ACT bound to SANT2 (4 nm) at every serpin concentration (0–16 nm) was calculated relative to the fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength = 280 nm; emission wavelength = 350 nm) at saturating concentrations of ACT (100% bound) minus the intensity of SANT2 alone (0% bound). The intrinsic dissociation equilibrium constant, Kdiss, was determined using the Scatchard representation corresponding to the equation, [ACT]b/[ACT]f=-1/Kdiss[ACT]b+n[SANT2]Tot/Kdiss(Eq. 1) where [ACT]b represents the concentration of bound ACT; [ACT]f is the concentration of free ACT; n is the number of SANT2 binding site(s) per ACT molecule. Plot of [ACT]b/[ACT]f = f([ACT]b) gives a straight line with a negative slope that equals -1/Kdiss[ACT]b and extrapolation on the x axis gives the maximum concentration of bound ACT and is used to deduce the stoichiometry of the complex. As SANT2 and ACT contain two and three tryptophans, respectively, we used Lehrer representation to determine the fraction of tryptophan residues quenched upon SANT2-ACT interactions as described (42Zargarian L. Le Tilly V. Jamin N. Chaffotte A. Gabrielsen O.S. Toma F. Alpert B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using the equation, F0/F0-F=1/faK[ACT]+1/fa(Eq. 2) where F0 is the tryptophan fluorescence of SANT2 alone; F is the tryptophan fluorescence of the SANT2-ACT complex at a given ACT concentration [ACT]; fa is the maximum fraction of accessible fluorophore; K is the Lehrer quenching constant of an individual tryptophan. The Lehrer representation F0/F0 - F = f(1/[ACT]) gives a straight line whose extrapolation on the y axis ([ACT] = 0) corresponds to the value of 1/fa (42Zargarian L. Le Tilly V. Jamin N. Chaffotte A. Gabrielsen O.S. Toma F. Alpert B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Chymotrypsin Activity—All steady state experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl with the chromogenic substrate Succ-AAPF-pNA. Absorbance was recorded spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Km and Vmax were determined using the Lineweaver-Burk representation and the Michaelis-Menten equation at 4 nm chymotrypsin, substrate ranged from 0 to 0.1 mm, in the absence or presence of 4 nm SANT2. The catalytic constant, kcat, was determined for 0.2–5.0 nm chymotrypsin in the presence of 0.1 mm Succ-AAPF-pNA. To determine the residual activity of chymotrypsin in the presence of the preformed ACT-SANT2 complex, human plasma ACT (4.0 nm) was preincubated for 20 min at 25 °C in the presence of 0–640 nm His6-HTJ1493–554, His6-HTJ1493–554:W497A, or His6-HTJ1493–554:W497A, W520A and 0.1 mm Succ-AAPF-pNA prior to the addition of chymotrypsin (4.0 nm final concentration). The residual chymotrypsin activity was measured for 5–10 min at 15-s intervals. The percentage of inhibition was normalized to the activity of chymotrypsin alone (100%). Kinetic analysis of ACT inhibition of chymotrypsin in the presence or absence of SANT2 was performed as described (43Hwang S.R. Steineckert B. Toneff T. Bundey R. Logvinova A.V. Goldsmith P. Hook V.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10397-10405Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Equimolar concentrations of chymotrypsin and ACT (4 nm) were incubated 0–10 min and the residual chymotrypsin activity was measured at timed intervals after additio"
https://openalex.org/W2037484129,"Retinoids modulate growth and differentiation of cancer cells through activation of gene transcription via the nuclear retinoic-acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid-X receptors (RXR). Their use in differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) represents a model concept for reprogramming cancer cells. However, they also regulate antiproliferative genes whose functions do not mechanistically concur to this program. Recently, we have shown that, independently of maturation, a long-term all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment of the maturation-resistant APL cell line (NB4-LR1) represses telomerase (hTERT), leading to telomere shortening and death. Using retinoid-receptor-specific agonists, we demonstrate herein that cross-talk between RARalpha and RXR dual-liganded to their respective agonists resulted in strong synergistic downregulation of hTERT and subsequent cell death. Importantly, unlike ATRA, this synergy was obtained at very low agonist concentrations and occurred in other ATRA maturation-resistant APL cells. These findings provide the first demonstration that dual-liganded RXR and RARalpha signaling should allow efficient targeting of telomerase in differentiation-resistant tumor cells. Such a combination therapy might hold promise in clinic to avoid side effects of ATRA whose administration can indiscriminately activate all RARs. Given the tissue-specific expression of RARs, a tissue-selective therapy targeting telomerase in tumor cells by synthetic agonists can be envisioned."
https://openalex.org/W2055571119,"Chinese hamster embryonic fibroblasts (IIC9 cells) express the Gα subunits Gα<sub>s</sub>, Gα<sub>i2</sub>, Gα<sub>i3</sub>, Gα<sub>o</sub>, Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, and Gα<sub>13</sub>. Consistent with reports in other cell types, α-thrombin stimulates a subset of the expressed G proteins in IIC9 cells, namely G<sub>i2</sub>, G<sub>13</sub>, and G<sub>q</sub> as measured by an <i>in vitro</i> membrane [<sup>35</sup>S]guanosine 5′-<i>O</i>-(3-thio)triphosphate binding assay. Using specific Gα peptides, which block coupling of G-protein receptors to selective G proteins, as well as dominant negative xanthine nucleotide-binding Gα mutants, we show that activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is dependent on G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>i2</sub>. To examine the role of the two G proteins, we examined the events upstream of PI 3-kinase. The activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway by α-thrombin in IIC9 cells is blocked by the expression of dominant negative Ras and β-arrestin1 (Phillips-Mason, P. J., Raben, D. M., and Baldassare, J. J. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 275, 18046–18053, and Goel, R., Phillips-Mason, P. J., Raben, D. M., and Baldassare, J. J. (2002) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 277, 18640–18648), indicating a role for Ras and β-arrestin1. Interestingly, inhibition of G<sub>i2</sub> and G<sub>q</sub> activation blocks Ras activation and β-arrestin1 membrane translocation, respectively. Furthermore, expression of the Gβγ sequestrant, α-transducin, inhibits both Ras activation and membrane translocation of β-arrestin1, suggesting that Gβγ dimers from Gα<sub>i2</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> activate different effectors to coordinately regulate the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2068898427,"Mammalian heteromeric amino acid transporters (HATs) are composed of a multi-transmembrane spanning catalytic protein covalently associated with a type II glycoprotein (e.g. 4F2hc, rBAT) through a disulfide bond. Caenorhabditis elegans has nine genes encoding close homologues of the HAT catalytic proteins. Three of these genes (designated AAT-1 to AAT-3) have a much higher degree of similarity to the mammalian homologues than the other six, including the presence of a cysteine residue at the position known to form a disulfide bridge to the glycoprotein partner in mammalian HATs. C. elegans also has two genes encoding homologues of the heteromeric amino acid transporter type II glycoprotein subunits (designated ATG-1 and ATG-2). Both ATG, and/or AAT-1, -2, -3 proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and tested for amino acid transport function. This screen revealed that AAT-1 and AAT-3 facilitate amino acid transport when expressed together with ATG-2 but not with ATG-1 or the mammalian type II glycoproteins 4F2hc and rBAT. AAT-1 and AAT-3 covalently bind to both C. elegans ATG glycoproteins, but only the pairs with ATG-2 traffic to the oocyte surface. Both of these functional, surface-expressed C. elegans HATs transport most neutral amino acids and display the highest transport rate for l-Ala and l-Ser (apparent K(m) 100 microm range). Similar to their mammalian counterparts, the C. elegans HATs function as (near) obligatory amino acid exchangers. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the heteromeric structure and the amino acid exchange function of HATs have been conserved throughout the evolution of nematodes to mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2034281669,"Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family is thought to play an important role in mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. The potent transforming activity of the EGFR family is due to their ability to heterodimerize with each other in response to a number of mitogenic ligands. The formation of EGFR and ErbB-2 heterodimers has been recently implicated as an important factor in the induction of sporadic human breast cancers. To directly assess whether the catalytic activity of EGFR is required for ErbB-2 induction of mammary tumors, we have interbred transgenic mice expressing ErbB-2 oncogene under the transcriptional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter/enhancer to a naturally occurring mouse mutant carrying a catalytically impaired EGFR (waved-2 mice). Although the female transgenic mice possessing mutant EGFR developed mammary tumors, the tumors occurred only after a delayed latency period, and were fewer in number. The impaired tumor phenotype was further correlated with debilitated phosphorylation of the Gab1 multisubstrate adapter. These observations provide evidence that efficient ErbB-2-induced mammary tumor progression requires EGFR-dependent activation of Gab1."
https://openalex.org/W2084111445,"We have identified the mouse exon VII splice variant of the Ets-1 transcription factor. The variant is expressed in all cell lines which express ets-1, at lower levels, it is also expressed in the mouse embryo in vivo. The corresponding protein, p42Ets-1, is a transcription factor as it is able to bind to specific DNA sequences and to transactivate a bona fide ETS reporter vector. A comparison of optimal DNA-binding sites shows that p42Ets-1 binds to more various DNA sequences than p51Ets-1; p42Ets-1 recognizes the same optimal consensus sequence as p51Ets-1, but also many variations of it, mainly at base -1, which is located just prior to the GGAA/T core sequence. The binding differences were quantified by surface plasmon resonance analyses and the protein region responsible for the differences in DNA sequence recognition located in the Val280-Glu302 fragment, which is encoded by exon VII. The specific DNA-binding properties of each isoform translates into clear differences in activity, p42Ets-1 transactivates the natural VE-cadherin gene promoter through both ETS-binding site (EBS)2 and EBS4 whereas p51Ets-1 is mainly active on EBS4. Altogether, our data suggest that p42Ets-1 acts as a distinct transcription factor from p51Ets-1."
