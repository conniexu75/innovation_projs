Filamentous α-synuclein is the major component of these deposits and its aggregation is believed to play an important role in Parkinson's disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases. Two homologous proteins, β- and γ-synucleins, are also abundant in the brain. The synucleins are natively unfolded proteins. β-Synuclein, which lacks 11 central hydrophobic residues compared with its homologs, exhibited the properties of a random coil, whereas α- and γ-synucleins were slightly more compact and structured. γ-Synuclein, unlike its homologs, formed a soluble oligomer at relatively low concentrations, which appears to be an off-fibrillation pathway species. Here we show that, although they have similar biophysical properties to α-synuclein, β- And γ-synucleins inhibit α-synuclein fibril formation. Complete inhibition of α-synuclein fibrillation was observed at 4:1 molar excess of β- and γ-synucleins. No significant incorporation of β-synuclein into the fibrils was detected. The lack of fibrils formed by β-synuclein is most readily explained by the absence of a stretch of hydrophobic residues from the middle region of the protein. A model for the inhibition is proposed.

Synucleins belong to a family of closely related presynaptic proteins that are encoded by three distinct genes, described only in vertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 1.Goedert M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). They are soluble, relatively small, intracellular and especially abundant in neural tissues. Synucleins are characterized by the presence of acidic stretches within the COOH-terminal region and a repetitive, degenerative amino acid motif KTKEGV throughout the first 87 residues, causing a variation in hydrophobicity with a strictly conserved periodicity of 11 amino acids (2.George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Such a periodicity is characteristic of the amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins (2.George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The name “synuclein” was first given to a protein that was isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo californica, where it was found in both nerve terminals and the nuclear envelope (3.Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The family of synuclein proteins includes: α-synuclein, which was also called non-amyloid component precursor protein, or synelfin (2.George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 3.Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J.

Liu Y.E. Jia T. Wang M. Liu J. Xiao G. Joseph B.K. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 759-764PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Ninkina N.N. Alimova-Kost M.V. Paterson J.W. Delaney L. Cohen B.B. Imreh S.

Davies A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9335-9341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human α-synuclein is an abundant 140-residue brain protein. It has been estimated to account for as much as 1% of the total protein in soluble cytosolic brain fractions (11.Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is located in close vicinity to, and is loosely associated with, synaptic vesicles and thus may play a role in the release of neurotransmitters (5.Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 11.Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). It belongs to the rapidly growing family of natively unfolded proteins, which have little or no ordered structure under physiological conditions (12.Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 13.Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Natively unfolded proteins are characterized by a unique combination of low overall hydrophobicity and large net charge (14.Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Human β-synuclein is a 134-amino acid neuronal protein showing 78% identity to α-synuclein. α- And β-synucleins share a conserved COOH terminus, with three identically placed tyrosine residues. However, β-synuclein lacks 11 residues within the middle region (residues 73–83) (1.Goedert M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Like α-synuclein, it is expressed predominantly in the brain (5.Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 15.Shibayama-Imazu T. Okahashi I. Omata K. Nakajo S. Ochiai H. Nakai Y. Hama T. Nakamura Y. Nakaya K. Brain Res. 1993; 622: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The third member of the human synuclein family is the 127-amino acid γ-synuclein, which shares 60% similarity with α-synuclein at the amino acid sequence level (1.Goedert M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). It lacks the tyrosine-rich COOH-terminal signature of α- and β-synucleins. γ-Synuclein is abundant in spinal cord and sensory ganglia (10.Buchman V.L. Hunter H.J. Pinon L.G. Thompson J. Privalova E.M. Ninkina N.N. Davies A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9335-9341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is more widely distributed within the neuronal cytoplasm than α-and β-synucleins, being present throughout cell bodies and axons (10.Buchman V.L. Hunter H.J. Pinon L.G. Thompson J. Privalova E.M. Ninkina N.N. Davies A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9335-9341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of synucleins has also been established in other cell types: thus, α-synuclein was found in platelets (16.Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Sisk A. Hsu L.J. Sundsmo M. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Miller A. Masliah E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), β-synuclein in Sertoli cells of the testis (17.Nakajo S. Tsukada K. Kameyama H. Furuyama Y. Nakaya K. Brain Res. 1996; 741: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and γ-synuclein in the epidermis (18.Ninkina N.N. Privalova E.M. Pinon L.G. Davies A.M. Buchman V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and in metastatic breast cancer tissue (8.Ji H. Liu Y.E. Jia T. Wang M. Liu J. Xiao G. Joseph B.K. Rosen C. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 759-764PubMed Google Scholar). Several observations have implicated α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) 1The abbreviations used are: PDParkinson's diseaseLBLewy bodiesLNLewy neuritesThTthioflavin TFTIRFourier transform infraredSAXSsmall angle x-ray scatteringRSStokes radius and several other neurodegenerative disorders. Clinically, PD is a movement disorder characterized by tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. These symptoms are attributed to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra. Surviving neurons contain cytosolic filamentous inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) (19.Lewy F.H. Lewandowski M. Handbuch der Neurologie. Springer, Berlin1912: 920-933Google Scholar, 20.Forno L.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). In addition to the substantia nigra, LBs and LNs are also found in other brain regions, such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and the locus coeruleus (20.Forno L.S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein has been shown to be a major fibrillar component of LBs and LNs (21.Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6267) Google Scholar, 22.Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). Moreover, two different missense mutations in the α-synuclein gene, resulting in the A53T and A30P substitutions, have been identified in a small number of kindreds with autosomal dominantly inherited, early onset PD (23.Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M.

Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of wild type (WT) α-synuclein in transgenic mice (25.Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar) or of WT, A30P, and A53T α-synuclein in transgenic flies (26.Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar) leads to motor deficits and neuronal inclusions reminiscent of PD. Abundant α-synuclein-positive LBs and LNs in the cerebral cortex are also neurophathological hallmarks of dementia with Lewy bodies, a common late-life dementia that is clinically similar to Alzheimer's disease (21.Spillantini M.G.

Pathology. 1998; 152: 879-884PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, LBs and aggregated α-synuclein have been detected in diffuse Lewy body disease (28.Iseki E. Marui W. Kosaka K. Akiyama H. Ueda K. Iwatsubo T. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 258: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29.Takeda A. Mallory M. Sundsmo M. Honer W. Hansen L. Masliah E. Am. J.

Differ. 1998; 5: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and Down's syndrome (31.Lippa C.F. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), as well as some cases of Hallervorden-Spatz disease (32.Arawaka S. Saito Y. Murayama S. Mori H. Neurology. 1998; 51: 887-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Finally, α-synuclein is the major component of the filamentous neuronal and glial inclusions of multiple system atrophy (33.Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Cairns N.J. Lantos P.L. Goedert M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 251: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Parkinson's disease Lewy bodies Lewy neurites thioflavin T Fourier transform infrared small angle x-ray scattering Stokes radius It has recently been reported that in addition to α-synuclein-containing LBs and LNs, the development of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies is accompanied by the appearance of non-filamentous α-, β-, and γ-synuclein-positive accumulations in axon terminals of the hippocampus (34.Galvin J.E. Uryu K. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13450-13455Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This implicates β- and γ-synucleins, in addition to α-synuclein, in the progression of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies. The aggregation of recombinant α-synuclein and its A30P and A53T mutants has been studied in vitro. It has been established that all three proteins, as well as carboxyl-terminal truncated forms thereof, readily assemble into filaments, with morphologies and staining characteristics similar to those of filaments extracted from disease-affected brain (13.Uversky V.N.

Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, β- and γ-synucleins failed to assemble into filaments (41.Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The question of reciprocal effects of individual family members on the aggregation of other synucleins has not been considered as yet. Here, we compare the structural properties of α-synuclein and its propensity to form fibrils with those of β- and γ-synucleins. Data on the in vitro fibrillation of α-synuclein in the presence of β- or γ-synuclein are also presented. Thioflavin T (ThT) and porcine intestinal heparin (Grade I-A, molecular weight 18,000) were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade from Fisher Chemicals. Human recombinant α-, β-, and γ-synucleins were expressed and purified as described (5.Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 22.Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Assay solutions contained proteins at a concentration of 70–280 μm (1–4.0 mg/ml) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, buffer, containing 10 μm ThT. A volume of 100 μl of the mixture was pipetted into a well of a 96-well plate (white plastic, clear bottom) and a 1/8 th-inch diameter Teflon sphere (McMaster-Carr, Los Angeles, CA) was added. Each sample was run in triplicate or quadruplicate. The plate was loaded into a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 600–900 rpm with a shaking diameter of 1 mm. The fluorescence was measured at 30-min intervals with excitation at 444 nm and emission at 485 nm, with a sampling time of 40 ms. Data from replicate wells were averaged before plotting fluorescence versus time. The kinetics of α-synuclein fibrillation are sigmoidal, defined by an initial lag phase, a subsequent growth phase in which ThT fluorescence increased, and a final equilibrium phase, where ThT fluorescence reached a plateau indicating the end of fibril formation. ThT fluorescence measurements were plotted as a function of time and fitted to a sigmoidal curve using the empirical approach described in Ref. 48.Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar. CD spectra were obtained with an AVIV 60DS spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ) using protein concentrations of ∼35 μm. Spectra were recorded in a 0.01-cm path length cell from 250 to 190 nm with a step size of 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1.5 nm, and an averaging time of 10 s. For all spectra, an average of 5 scans was obtained. CD spectra of the appropriate buffers were recorded and subtracted from the protein spectra. Attenuated total reflectance data were collected on a Nicolet 800SX FTIR spectrometer equipped with an MCT (mercury-cadmium-telluride) detector. The IRE (72 × 10 × 6 mm, 45° germanium trapezoid) was held in a modified SPECAC out-of-compartment attenuated total reflectance apparatus. The hydrated thin films were prepared as described previously (49.Oberg K. Chrunyk B.A. Wetzel R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2628-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 50.Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previous investigations have shown that comparable secondary structure analyses are obtained for native proteins from thin film attenuated total reflectance-FTIR as from transmission mode FTIR and x-ray crystallography (50.Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 51.Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Typically 1024 interferograms were co-added at 4 cm−1 resolution. Data analysis was performed with GRAMS32 (Galactic Industries). Secondary structure content was determined from curve fitting to spectra deconvoluted using second derivatives and Fourier self-deconvolution to identify component band positions. Hydrated thin film samples were prepared by drying 50 μl of 70 μm α-synuclein solution on a ZnSe crystal with dry N2. The IR spectra were collected, followed by Fourier transformation using the spectrum of the clean crystal as a background. Water (liquid and vapor) components were subtracted from the protein spectrum. Fluorescence measurements were performed in semimicro quartz cuvettes (Hellma) with a 1-cm excitation light path using a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer (Instruments S.A., Inc., Jobin Yvon-Spex). The light source was a 150-W xenon lamp. Transmission electron micrographs were collected using a JEOL JEM-100B microscope operating with an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Typical nominal magnifications ranged from ×20,000 to 50,000. Samples were deposited on Formvar-coated 300-mesh copper grids and negatively stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were made using Beam Line 4-2 at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (52.Wakatsuki S. Hodgson K.O. Eliezer D. Rice M. Hubbard S. Gillis N. Doniach S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1992; 63: 1736-1740Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). X-ray energy was selected at 8980 eV (Cu edge) by a pair of Mo/B4C multilayer monochromator crystals (53.Tsuruta H. Brennan S. Rek Z.U. Irving T.C. Tompkins W.H. Hodgson K.O. J. Appl. Cryst. 1998; 31: 672-682Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Scattering patterns were recorded by a linear position-sensitive proportional counter, which was filled with an 80% Xe, 20% CO2 gas mixture. Scattering patterns were normalized by incident x-ray fluctuations, which were measured with a short length ion chamber before the sample. The sample-to-detector distance was calibrated to be 230 cm, using a cholesterol myristate sample. To avoid radiation damage of the sample in SAXS measurements, the protein solution was continuously passed through a 1.3-mm path length observation flow cell with 25-μm mica windows. Background measurements were performed before and after each protein measurement and then averaged before being used for background subtraction. All SAXS measurements were performed at 23 ± 1 °C. The radius of gyration (Rg) was calculated according to the Guinier approximation (54.Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar), lnI(Q)=lnI(0)−Rg2Q23Equation 1 where I(0) is the forward scattering amplitude, Q is the scattering vector given by Q = (4π sin θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of x-ray. The hydrodynamic dimensions (Stokes radii, RS) of synucleins were measured by size-exclusion chromatography. Size-exclusion measurements were performed on a Superose-12 column using a Amersham Bioscience FPLC chromatographic system. A set of globular proteins (Gel Filtration Chromatography Standards from Bio-Rad Laboratories) with known RS values was used to create a calibration curve, 1000/Vel versus RS(55.Ackers G.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1970; 24: 343-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 56.Corbett R.J. Roche R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1888-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 57.Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic dimensions of native and completely unfolded globular protein with known molecular mass, M, were calculated from empirical equations (57.Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), log(RSN)=0.369·log(M)−0.254Equation 2 log(RSU)=0.533·log(M)−0.687Equation 3 based on the intrinsic viscosity data (58.Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Here RSN and RSU are the Stokes radii of native (N) and unfolded (U) protein. α-Synuclein fibrils were grown for 1 week in a 2-fold molar excess of β-synuclein at pH 7.5, 37 °C. Fibrillar material was spun down using a Beckman Microfuge 18. The pellet was washed twice with distilled water then dissolved in alkaline solution, and the resulting solution was analyzed by MS using a MicroMass Quattro-2 instrument. Fig. 1A represents the far-UV CD spectra of human recombinant α-, β-, and γ-synucleins measured at pH 7.5 and 3.0 at 20 °C. At neutral pH, all three proteins show far-UV CD spectra typical of an essentially unfolded polypeptide chain. This includes the characteristic minimum in the vicinity of 196 nm and the absence of bands in the 210–230-nm region. Interestingly, α- and γ-synucleins possess almost indistinguishable spectra, whereas the far UV-CD spectrum of β-synuclein shows a slightly increased degree of disorder, manifested by a small increase in negative ellipticity in the vicinity of 196 nm and somewhat lower intensity in the vicinity of 222 nm (see Table I). This suggestion was further confirmed by hydrodynamic studies (see below). As the pH is decreased changes were observed in the spectral shape for all three proteins. Fig. 1 shows that the decrease in the minimum at 196 nm is accompanied by an increase in negative intensity around 222 nm, reflecting pH-induced formation of secondary structure. All three proteins possess almost identical far-UV CD spectra at acidic pH (see also Table I). Importantly, the pH-induced changes in the far-UV CD spectra of the synucleins were completely reversible. Previously we have shown that the pH-induced increase in the structure of WT α-synuclein represents an intramolecular process involving the formation of a partially folded intermediate, and not self-association (13.Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Thus, this also appears to be the situation for the β- and γ-synucleins.Table IMajor structural characteristics of the human recombinant α-, β-, and γ-synucleinsProtein, conditionsMRNS (E)aRS values were calculated for a native globular protein with a given molecular mass, M, from the equation (57): log (RS)N = 0.369 log M − 0.254.RUS (E)bRS values were calculated for an unfolded protein with a given molecular mass, M, from the equation (57): log (RS)U = 0.533 log M − 0.682.RS(E)cMeasured by calibrated SEC column.

Glucose-grown cultures were used as a reference. At the 95% confidence level, 354 genes were up-regulated in acetate, while 370 genes were down-regulated compared with the glucose-grown culture. Generally, more metabolic genes were up-regulated in acetate than other gene groups, while genes involved in cell replication, transcription, and translation machinery tended to be down-regulated. It appears that E. coli commits more resources to metabolism at the expense of growth when cultured in the poor carbon source. The expression profile confirms many known features in acetate metabolism such as the induction of the glyoxylate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconeogenic genes. It also provided many previously unknown features, including induction of malic enzymes, ppsA, and the glycolate pathway and repression of glycolytic and glucose phosphotransferase genes in acetate. The carbon flux delivered from the malic enzymes and PpsA in acetate was further confirmed by deletion mutations. In general, the gene expression profiles qualitatively agree with the metabolic flux changes and may serve as a predictor for gene function and metabolic flux distribution.

Briefly, E. coli uptakes glucose using the phosphotransferase system that converts extracellular glucose into intracellular glucose 6-phosphate, which can be further metabolized by the glycolytic pathway to produce energy and biosynthetic precursors. In the presence of glucose, the adenylate cyclase is inactive, and the cAMP level is low. In the absence of glucose, the adenylate cyclase is activated to produce cAMP, which when binding to the cAMP receptor protein activates the expression of a large set of catabolite derepression genes (2.Saier M.H.J.

On the other hand, acetate is transported into the cell and converted to acetyl-CoA, which is further metabolized through the glyoxylate shunt and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The acetate-metabolizing genes are typically repressed in the presence of glucose. The induction and regulation of acetate-metabolizing genes have been studied extensively (4.Cozzone A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 127-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Since the two carbon sources, glucose and acetate, are utilized by distinct metabolic pathways, the metabolic flux distribution differs significantly in these two carbon sources (5.Holms H. FEMS Micobiol. Rev. 1996; 19: 85-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding global gene expression profiles in different carbon sources is important to the investigation of E. coli growth in natural environment, where the availability of carbon sources changes dynamically. Acetate-metabolizing culture is particularly relevant to the biotechnology industry, since the accumulation of acetate in bioreactor is commonly observed and often poses as an obstacle to high cell density cultivation (6.Luli G.W. Strohl W.R. Appl. Environ.

In this approach, individual DNA probes are arrayed on a small glass surface, and labeled first strand cDNA from specific tissue or cell sources is hybridized onto the array. The amount of fluorescence at each DNA probe spot correlates with the abundance of specific mRNA transcript in the cell.

We employed the fluorescence-based microarray system by spotting 96% E. coli open reading frames on glass slides. The expression levels of each gene were monitored by fluorescence-labeled cDNA using the printed DNA microarray. A rigorous statistical method was used to access the confidence interval of expression ratio of each gene by taking into account slide-to-slide and culture-to-culture variations.

The biochemical mechanisms of generation of endogenous ceramide were investigated using A549 cells treated with selectively labeled C6-ceramides, [sphingosine-3-3H]d-erythro-, and N-[N-hexanoyl-1-14C]d-erythro-C6-ceramide. The results demonstrated that 3H label was incorporated into newly synthesized long chain ceramides, which was inhibited by FB1 and not by MYR. Interestingly, the 14C label was not incorporated into long chain ceramides. Taken together, these results show that generation of endogenous ceramide in response to C6-ceramide is due to recycling of the sphingosine backbone of C6-ceramide via deacylation/reacylation and not due to the elongation of its fatty acid moiety. Moreover, the generation of endogenous long chain ceramide in response to C6-ceramide was completely blocked by brefeldin A, which causes Golgi disassembly, suggesting a role for the Golgi in the metabolism of ceramide. In addition, the generation of endogenous ceramide in response to short chain exogenous ceramide was induced byd-erythro- but notl-erythro-C6-ceramide, demonstrating the stereospecificity of this process. Interestingly, several key downstream biological activities of ceramide, such as growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and modulation of telomerase activity were induced byd-erythro-C6-ceramide, and notl-erythro-C6-ceramide (and inhibited by FB1) in A549 cells, suggesting a role for endogenous long chain ceramide in the regulation of these responses.

Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Ceramide is generated in response to various agents including Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor-α, ionizing radiation, and chemotherapeutic agents (2.Kolesnick R. Fuks Z. J. Exp.

Although some of these agents cause early and reversible generation of ceramide, they can also cause a delayed and sustained generation of ceramide, which, in most cases, is associated with its downstream biological activities. Ceramide generation occurs via agonist activation of either sphingomyelinase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine (4.Kim M.Y. Linardic C. Obeid L.M.

Ceramide has been shown to activate proteases of the ICE family (caspases), especially caspase-3, a PARP1-cleaving protease (14.Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M.

It has been reported also that the treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with a specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, which results in the accumulation of ceramide, causes a G2/M cell cycle arrest, possibly mediated by ceramide-induced inhibition of the cyclin-dependent p34cdc2 and Cdk2 kinases (18.Rani C.S.

More recent studies have shown that ceramide specifically inactivates the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2, but not Cdk4, through activation of a phosphatase (19.Lee J.Y. Bielawska A.E. Obeid L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that both exogenous (with C6-ceramide treatment) and endogenous ceramides (generated in response to bacterial sphingomyelinase overexpression or daunorubicin treatment) inhibit mRNA synthesis of telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomerase activity via inactivation of c-Myc transcription factor in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (20.Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 63506-63514Google Scholar). Moreover, this inhibition of telomerase activity mediated by ceramide has been shown to be independent of apoptosis but correlated with cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 (20.Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These results add to a growing body of literature implicating ceramide in senescence of human cells and aging yeast (22.Venable M.E. Obeid L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23.Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that the addition of short chain C2- and C6-ceramides to cells mimics many of the biological responses of agonists in mammalian and yeast cells, and this approach has been employed to suggest possible roles for endogenous ceramide in these processes (24.Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In addition, there are results suggesting a mere direct relationship between exogenous and endogenous ceramides. It has been shown that treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with N-octanoyl-sphingosine liposomes caused about 10-fold increase in the total ceramide levels (25.Abe A. Wu D. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Treatment of U937 human myeloid leukemia cells with 25 μm cell-permeable C6-ceramide triggered a sustained endogenous ceramide generation at 24 h, which was inhibited by fumonisin B1 (26.Jaffrezou J-P. Maestre N. De Mas-Mansat C.B. Levade T. Laurent G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Also, it has been demonstrated that C6-ceramide triggers neutral sphingomyelinase activation, sphingomyelin hydrolysis, and total ceramide accumulation in HL-60 and U937 cells at 10–30 min (26.Jaffrezou J-P. Maestre N. De Mas-Mansat C.B. Levade T. Laurent G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown recently that treatment of human skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells with C6-ceramide induces acid sphingomyelinase expression at the mRNA level that correlated with apoptotic cell death (27.Deigner H-P. Claus R. Bonaterra G.A. Gehrke C. Bibak N. Blaess M. Cantz M. Metz J. Kinscherf R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, there appear to be multiple mechanisms by which exogenous ceramide influences ceramide metabolism. These observations also raise the important question of whether downstream biological effects are mediated by short chain ceramide per se or if they are dependent on the generation of endogenous ceramide. Therefore, in this study, we determined if exogenous short chain ceramide induces the generation of endogenous long chain ceramide in the A549 human adenocarcinoma cell line. We focused on identifying the mechanisms of this effect and its possible role in mediating cell responses. We show here, for the first time, that the sustained generation of long chain endogenous ceramide requires the biochemical recycling of the sphingosine backbone of C6-ceramide, which involves deacylation and reacylation of ceramide for the generation of endogenous long chain ceramide (mainly C16:0- and C24:1-ceramides), most likely by CoA-dependent ceramide synthase, which is inhibited by fumonisin B1. Moreover, the generation of long chain endogenous ceramide in response to C6-ceramide treatment is stereospecific, as shown by increased long chain ceramide generation byd-erythro-C6-ceramide but notl-erythro-C6-ceramide. In addition, evidence is provided that in A549 cells the generation of long chain endogenous ceramide mediates the effects of exogenous C6-ceramide on growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and the modulation of telomerase activity. Therefore, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of generation of endogenous ceramide and its downstream biological roles in response to exogenous short chain ceramide. The A549 human lung carcinoma cells were obtained from Dr. Alice Boylan (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). The HL-60 human acute myeloid leukemia and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 ng/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell-permeable and biologically active short chain ceramides and their radioactively labeled analogs were obtained from the Synthetic Lipid Core at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Medical University of South Carolina). Fumonisin B1 (FB1) was obtained from Alexis. Myriocin (MYR) was obtained from Sigma. Exogenous short chain ceramides were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 100 mm and then directly added to the medium containing 10% fetal calf serum to obtain final concentration of 1–20 μm. The final volume of ethanol in the medium was 0.02%, which had no effect on cell growth and/or survival. Total endogenous ceramide levels were measured using the diacylglycerol phosphate kinase (DGK) method as described previously (28.Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, after total cellular lipids were extracted using the standard Bligh and Dyer protocol, they were dried under N2. The dried lipids were then resuspended and used for phosphate measurements and the Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase assay as modified for ceramide. This assay depends on the phosphorylation of ceramide and diacylglycerol, generating ceramide phosphate and phosphatidic acid, respectively, by diacylglycerol kinase in the presence of radiolabeled ATP. The radiolabeled products were visualized by thin layer chromatography, and the phosphorylated products of ceramide and diacylglycerol were identified by comparison with known standards run on the same plate. In addition, the amounts of products that were scraped from the plates were quantitated by scintillation counting and normalized to internal phosphate levels. The radiolabeled sphingolipids after treatments with [3-3H]d-erythro-C6-ceramide or N-[1-14C]d-erythro-C6-ceramide were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method and separated by thin layer chromatography using a solvent system containing chloroform, methanol, and 15 mm CaCl2 (7.5:4.4:1). The levels of endogenous ceramide species were analyzed by MS utilizing normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. Separations were performed using a ThermoFinnigan (Foster City, CA) LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. 2B. J. Pettus, M. Busman, P. D. R. Moeller, B. J. Kroesen, Z. M. Szulc, A. Bielawska, and Y. A. Hannun, unpublished data. Cells (1 × 105), grown in six-well plates, were treated in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate (Amersham Biosciences) with or without 20 μm short chain ceramides at various time points. The lipids were extracted using Bligh and Dyer protocol and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a solvent system containing chloroform, methanol, and 2 nNH4OH (40:10:1), as described (29.Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8574-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of total ceramide obtained from rat brain were used as controls. The effects of the inhibition of endocytosis on the generation of endogenous long chain ceramide in response to C6-ceramide were determined by palmitate labeling and the diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) assays as described above. Cells (1 × 105) grown in six-well plates were pretreated with known inhibitors of endocytosis such as nystatin (25 μg/ml), genistein (200 μm), and chlorpromazine (6 μg/ml) (30.Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and also with brefeldin A (10 μg/ml), which causes the disassembly of the Golgi (31.Fukunaga T. Furuno A. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32.Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), for 30–60 min as described previously. Then cells were treated with 20 μmC6-ceramide for 60 min in the presence (for palmitate labeling) or absence (for the DGK assay) of 1 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate as described above. Ceramide measurements were performed as described above. The concentrations ofd-erythro-C6-ceramide or its stereoisomers that inhibited cell growth by 50% (IC50) were determined from cell survival plots obtained by MTT or trypan blue exclusion assays as described (20.Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In short, cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were plated into 96-well plates containing 100 μl of the growth medium in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of C6-ceramide or its streioisomers at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 72 h. They were then treated with 25 μl of MTT for 4–5 h. After lysing the cells in 100 μl of the lysis buffer, the plates were read in a microplate reader (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) at 570 nm. After that, the IC50 concentrations of the compounds were determined from cell survival plots as described (20.Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Triplicate wells were used for each treatment. The final concentration of ethanol (a solvent for ceramide analogs) in the growth medium was less than 0.1% (v/v), which had no effect on cell growth and survival. For trypan blue exclusion analysis (20.Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), cells (100 × 103 cells/well) were grown in six-well plates with 4 ml of media in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of C6-ceramide or its stereoisomers for 24 h. Then cells were trypsinized and then diluted in PBS. The floating dead cells in the medium and cells attached to the plates were then counted using a hematocytometer in the presence of trypan blue solution at a 1:1 ratio (v/v) (Sigma) as described by the manufacturer. The degradation of PARP protein levels in cells was detected by Western blot analysis. In short, total proteins (50 μg/lane) were separated by 4–15% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto an Immobilon membrane, and PARP protein was detected using 1 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-PARP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:2500) as described (20.Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The effects of 20 μm C6-ceramide on the cell cycle profiles of A549 cells at 24 h were analyzed in the presence of DNase-free RNase and propidium iodine by flow cytometry as described (20.Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Untreated cells were used as controls. Telomerase activity in cell extracts was measured by the PCR-based telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) using the TRAPeze kit (Intergen, Gaithersburg, MD), which includes a 36-bp internal control to allow quantification of activity as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells, grown in six-well plates, were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 1× CHAPS lysing buffer for 30 min on ice. Then 50–100 ng of protein from each cell extract was analyzed in the TRAP reaction, as described (20.Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 63506-63514Google Scholar). The cell extracts were added directly to the TRAP reaction mixture containing dNTPs, TS primer (6 × 105 cpm), reverse primer mix, and Taqpolymerase. Then the extended telomerase products were amplified by two-step PCR (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s) for 27 cycles. The telomerase activity in each sample was quantitated by measuring the ratio of the 36-bp internal standard to the extended telomerase products as described by the manufacturer using ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). In order to examine the generation of endogenous long chain ceramide in response to exogenous C6-ceramide, A549 cells were grown in the absence or presence of 20 μm C6-ceramide for 24 h, and then total ceramide levels were measured by the DGK assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Interestingly, as seen in Fig. 1A, total endogenous long chain ceramide levels were significantly increased (about 6-fold) in cells treated with C6-ceramide (lane 2) compared with that of untreated controls (lane 1). In order to determine the biochemical pathway(s) that are involved in the generation of endogenous long chain ceramide in response to C6-ceramide, A549 cells were treated with C6-ceramide (20 μm) in the presence or absence of 50 μm FB1, an inhibitor of CoA-dependent dihydroceramide/ceramide synthase, or 50 nm MYR, a specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, and total ceramide levels were measured by the DGK assay. The results showed that FB1 prevented the generation of long chain endogenous ceramide levels in response to C6-ceramide, whereas MYR did not have any effect (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). The levels of C6-ceramide and diacylglycerol (DAG) were equal in these samples (Fig. 1A,lanes 2–4, lower and upper bands, respectively). The activity of MYR (50 nm) was confirmed in independent experiments in which it blocked the generation of endogenous ceramide in A549 cells after exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitibine. 3B. Ogretmen, M. J. Rossi, and R. Wood, unpublished data. Also, measurement of the activity of neutral sphingomyelinase in response to C6-ceramide (20 μm) at 10 min to 24 h showed no significant changes in these cells (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when total endogenous ceramide levels were measured by HPLC/MS in response to C6-ceramide treatment, in which long chain ceramide levels were significantly elevated (around 5-fold) in the presence of C6-ceramide (20 μm for 24 h) compared with that of untreated controls (Fig. 1B). This elevation was blocked completely by 50 μm FB1 but not by MYR (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the analysis of subspecies of endogenous ceramide levels generated in response to C6-ceramide by HPLC/MS revealed that C6-ceramide treatment resulted in increased levels of mainly C16:0-ceramide and to a lesser extent C24:1-ceramide in these cells (Fig. 1C). Importantly, there were no significant differences in the levels of dihydroceramide species in the absence or presence of C6-ceramide (Fig. 1D). The absolute mass of endogenous ceramide was about 0.8 and 5.1 pmol/nmol Pi in the absence and presence of 20 μm C6-ceramide at 24 h, respectively, in A549 cells as measured using the DGK method. Therefore, these results show that the measurement of the levels of endogenous ceramide by the HPLC/MS method is highly comparable with the DGK assay. Taken together, these results also show that treatment of A549 cells with C6-ceramide results in a significant increase in the generation of endogenous long chain ceramide, via a pathway that is distinct from the de novosynthesis (resistance to myriocin) or hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (no change in the activity of neutral sphingomyelinase and sphingomyelin levels). To examine the kinetics of the generation of long chain endogenous ceramide in response to C6-ceramide, A549 cells were grown in the presence of 1 μm[sphingosine-3-3H]d-erythro-C6-ceramide (1 μCi/ml) at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h, and then the labeled lipids were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results showed that the incorporation of the 3H label into the long chain endogenous ceramide started to be detected slightly at 1 h and reached its maximum levels at 6 h, and this increased ceramide generation was sustained at 24 h (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5). There was also a marked increase in the levels of labeled short chain glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and sphingomyelin. The 3H label was also detected in long chain glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and sphingomyelin at 24 h (Fig. 2A, lane 5). These results show that the 3H label in the sphingosine backbone was initially incorporated into long chain ceramides followed by incorporation into complex sphingolipids. The results also show that C6-ceramide served as a direct substrate for SM synthase and glucosylceramide synthase. Total endogenous long chain ceramide levels in response to 20 μm unlabeled ceramide at various time points were also measured by HPLC/MS. The accumulation of total long chain endogenous ceramides (mainly C16:0 and C24:1) in response to C6-ceramide was observed at 1 h, reached its maximum levels at 6 h, and was still detectable at 24 h (Fig. 2B). These results were highly comparable with the results obtained using 1 μm[sphingosine-3-3H]d-erythro-C6-ceramide as shown in Fig. 2A. To determine the biochemical mechanisms by which C6-ceramide caused increased generation of endogenous long chain ceramide, A549 cells were grown in the presence of 1 μm[sphingosine-3-3H]-d-erythro-C6-ceramide (1 μCi/ml) for 24 h, and then labeled lipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography following Bligh and Dyer extraction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As Fig. 3A shows, 3H label was incorporated into the newly synthesized long chain ceramides (lane 1). Interestingly, the presence of FB1 caused a significant decrease in the incorporation of the3H label into the long chain ceramide and caused some inhibitory effect on the incorporation of the label into the long chain glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and sphingomyelin (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The pretreatment of cells with MYR, however, did not have any significant effect on the generation of ceramide (Fig. 3A, lane 3). As seen in Fig. 3A, the majority (about 86%) of the [sphingosine-3-3H]d-erythro-C6-ceramide was metabolized to long chain derivatives after 24 h (lane 1). The major derivatives were long chain sphingomyelin, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and ceramide (35, 32, 9.8, and 9.2%, respectively). More importantly, when these cells were treated with 1 μmN-[N-hexanoyl-1-14C]d-erythro-C6-ceramide (1 μCi/ml) with the label on the fatty acid chain, the14C label was not incorporated into the long chain endogenous ceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, or sphingomyelin at 24 h, whereas it was readily detectable in their short chain forms in the absence or presence of FB1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). Taken together, these results show that the generation of long chain endogenous ceramide in response to C6-ceramide treatment is due to bioche"
https://openalex.org/W2169789071,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a membrane lipid found in all eukaryotic cells, which regulates many important cellular processes, including ion channel activity. In this study, we used inside-out patch clamp technique, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis to investigate the effect of PIP2 on epithelial sodium channel activity in A6 cells. A6 cells were cultured in media supplemented with 1.5 μm aldosterone. Single sodium channel activity in excised, inside-out patches was increased by perfusion of the bath solution with 30 μm PIP2 plus 100 μm GTP (NPo = 1.34 ± 0.14) compared with the paired control (NPo = 0.09 ± 0.02). However, neither 30 μmPIP2 (NPo = 0.11 ± 0.02) nor 100 μm GTP (NPo = 0.10 ± 0.02) alone stimulated the sodium channels. The PIP2-stimulated channel activity was abolished by application of 10 nm G protein βγ subunits (NPo = 0.14 ± 0.05). However, 10 nm Gαi-3 + 30 μmPIP2 increased both NPo and Po. The stimulating effect of 10 nmGαi-3 + 30 μm PIP2 is similar to that of 30 μm PIP2 plus 100 μm GTP. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis show that both Giα-3 and PIP2 bind β and γ epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC), but not α ENaC.

In the traditional pathway of phosphoinositide metabolism, phosphatidylinositol is phosphorylated to produce phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase. PIP2 can be further phosphorylated to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) by phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (3.Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Or alternatively, PIP2 can be hydrolyzed by phospholipase C to produce 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). For a long time, it was assumed that the sole purpose of PIP2 was to act as precursor of the two intracellular second messengers, IP3 and DAG, in response to phospholipase C activation. IP3 and DAG are known to mobilize calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and to activate protein kinase C, respectively. However, recent evidence has suggested that this lipid has additional functions including regulation of ion channels. For example, PIP2 can modify inwardly rectified K+ channels, G protein-gated inwardly rectified K+ channels (4.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), and ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) (5.Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol.

Besides various types of K+channels, a Na+-gated nonselective cation channel in lobster olfactory receptor neurons is also activated by PIP2 (8.Zhainazarov A.B. Ache B.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2929-2937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since a growing number of ion channels appear to be regulated by PIP2, it is possible that PIP2is generally important in maintaining ion channel activity (8.Zhainazarov A.B. Ache B.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2929-2937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies using short circuit measurements demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is present in A6 cells and that this enzyme is required for regulation of ENaC by insulin (6.Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), aldosterone, and vasopressin (9.Paunescu T.G. Blazer-Yost B.L. Vlahos C.J. Helman S.I. Am. J.

Rokaw M.D. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F575-F579PubMed Google Scholar). The products of PI 3-kinase include phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (13.Zhang X. Majerus P.W. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that phosphoinositides are involved in the regulation of ENaC activity, and these membrane lipids may be common effector molecules for hormonal regulation. Nevertheless, the short circuit current measurements in these studies could not answer the following questions. 1) Do phosphoinositides regulate ENaC or other membrane transporters? 2) If phosphoinositides regulate ENaC, do they directly interact with ENaC or interact through some other closely associated intermediate signaling molecule? 3) Which of the phosphoinositides alter ENaC activity? 4) How do the lipids modify single channel activity? In the present work, we examined the PIP2 regulation of single ENaC activity in A6 cells with the patch clamp technique and identified PIP2 binding to ENaC subunits by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. A6 cells were purchased from American type Culture collection (Manassas, VA) in the 68th passage. All experiments were performed on passages 71–80 with no discernable variation among different passages. The cells were maintained in plastic tissue flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) at 27 °C in a humidified incubator with 4% CO2 in air. The culture medium was a mixture of Coon's medium F-12 (3 parts) and Leibovitz's medium l-15 (7 parts) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μmaldosterone for amphibian cells with 103 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4. For patch clamp experiments, the cells were subcultured on permeable, collagen-coated aluminosilicate supports (Nunc Corp.) attached to the bottoms of plastic rings. A plastic ring containing an A6 cell monolayer was mounted in a recording chamber on an inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Both the apical side and basolateral side of the monolayer were bathed in amphibian saline solution containing (in mm): 96 NaCl, 3.4 KCl, 0.8 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES at pH 7.4 (titrated with 1 n NaOH). A perfusion setup was used to exchange the apical bath solution to expose A6 cells to PIP2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), GTP (Sigma), G protein α subunit (Giα3) (Calbiochem), or G protein βγ subunit (a generous gift from Dr. David Clapham, Harvard University). For these experiments, we used inside-out patch clamp methods following standard procedure. Patch pipettes were fabricated from TW 150 glass (World Precision, New Haven, CT) and fire-polished to produce tip resistance of 5–10 mΩ when filled with amphibian saline solution. Inside-out patches were obtained from cell-attached patches following exchange of the apical bath solution from amphibian saline to high potassium solution containing (in mm): 3 NaCl, 85.4 KCl, 4 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 5 EGTA at pH 7.4 (titrated with 1 n KOH). Experiments were performed at room temperature (22–23 °C). Single channel events from inside-out patches were measured with an Axopatch 200 amplifier, low pass filtered at 5 KHz, recorded on a digital video recorder (Sony, Tokyo, Japan), and then digitized at 500 Hz using a scientific Solutions A/D converter and pentium computer equipped with Axotape software (Axon Inc., Foster City, CA). The convention for applied voltage to the apical membrane patch (Vpipette) represents the voltage deflection from the patch potential (i.e. the resting membrane potential for cell-attached patches and 0 mV for inside-out excised patches). Inward Na+ current (pipette to cell) is represented as downward transitions in single channel records. The channel events were analyzed using pClamp 6.02 (Axon Inc.). This program is designed to determine valid channel openings and closings based on 50% threshold crossing method. When multiple channel events are observed in each patch, the total number of functional channels (N) in the patch was determined by observing the number of peaks detected on all point amplitude histograms. NPo, the product of the number of channels and the open probability, or the open probability (Po), itself was used to measure the channel activity within a patch. The NPo was calculated by the relative area under all points amplitude histograms and expressed as follows. NPo=∑i=1Ni·Ai/∑i=1NAiEquation 1 In the above equation, A is the area under Gaussian curve, N is the total number of functional channels in a patch, i is the number of channels, Po is the open probability of an individual channel in a patch. The assumptions made are that the channels within a patch are identical and open and close independently. Lysates of A6 cells are incubated with PIP2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min in the presence of Gαi-3 and then immunoprecipitated using an anti-PIP2 antibody (Assay Designs) coupled to protein A/G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates are resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon paper, and immunoblotted with anti-α, anti-β ENaC, anti-γ ENaC, or anti-Giαi-3 (Calbiochem) antibodies, respectively. The xENaC subunit specific antibodies were developed by our research center and have been extensively characterized in previous reports (14.Kleyman T.R. Zuckerman J.B. Middleton P. Mcnulty K.A. Hu B.

The rationale for this experimental design is that all of the PIP2 binding proteins, including ENaC, are immunoprecipitated by anti-PIP2 antibody. If ENaC and Gαi-3 co-immunoprecipitate with PIP2, they could be detected with anti-ENaC or anti-Gαi-3antibody, respectively. To examine the expression of PI 5-kinase in A6 cells, the A6 cell lysates were resolved in SDS-PAGE and detected with antibody against α subunit of PI 5-kinase. After analysis using pClamp, the data are presented as mean ± S.D. Paired t tests or repeated measures ANOVA were used as appropriate to compare experimental groups. Results are considered significant when p < 0.05. Fig. 1 (upper panel) illustrates representative single channel records from a cell-free, inside-out patch. The control group has a low level of activity which resulted from the general loss of activity after the switch from cell-attached patch mode to inside-out, excised patch mode. Neither PIP2 nor GTP alone altered the channel activity, but the combination of these two agents dramatically increased the number of active channels and open probability. Fig. 1 (lower panel) is a summary of single channel activity expressed as NPo (left) and Po (right). This figure shows that PIP2 or GTP alone did not change NPoor Po, while PIP2 + GTP increased both the apparent number of active channels (N) and open probability (Po). The requirement for GTP suggests that a G protein is involved in the PIP2-mediated regulation of Na+ channel activity. This idea is supported by the observation that stimulation of ENaC activity by PIP2 + GTP was abolished by addition of G protein βγ subunit protein in the bath solution (cytoplasmic side of membrane) (Table I). The G protein, which has been previously described as associated with the apical membranes of A6 cells, is Gi-3 (21.Cantiello H.F. Patenaude C.R. Ausiello D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20867-20870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Application of the activated α subunit of Gi-3 protein (Gαi-3) by itself to the cytosolic surface of excised patches does not increase single Na+ channel activity expressed as NPo or Po; however, application of Gαi-3 + PIP2 strongly activated Na+ channels (Table II). The stimulatiing effect of Gαi-3 + PIP2 is comparable with that of PIP2 + GTP (as shown in Fig. 1). The results in Tables I and II imply that the presence of G protein α subunit (Gαi-3), but not βγ subunit, is required for the effect of PIP2 on Na+ channel activity. On the other hand, the presence of βγ subunit may prevent the effect of PIP2 by binding the endogenous α subunit in the excised patches. Unlike PIP2, PIP3 + GTP did not change Na+ channel activity (data not shown), suggesting that PIP2-induced Na+ channel activity is not mediated by one of its metabolic products, PIP3. In addition, application of the PIP2 isomer, phosphatidylinositol 3,4 bisphosphate, also had no effect on channel activity (data not shown).Table IG protein βγ subunit protein inhibits PIP2/GTP-induced channel activityTreatmentNPoPoUntreated0.0860 ± 0.04620.0860 ± 0.046230 μm PIP2 + 100 μmGTP1.42 ± 0.4611aSignificantly different from other treatments (p < 0.05 by repeated measures ANOVA).0.380 ± 0.0962aSignificantly different from other treatments (p < 0.05 by repeated measures ANOVA).30 μmPIP2 + 100 μm GTP + 10 nm βγ subunit0.100 ± 0.04640.100 ± 0.0464Patches were excised from A6 cells (see “Materials and Methods”) and the initial activity measured for 10 min after which 30 μm PIP2 + 100 μm GTP was perfused onto the cytosolic surface of the patch.

Three homologous subunits of ENaC have been isolated from A6 cells (α xENaC, β xENaC, and γ xENaC). We examined the PIP2binding subunits using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Fig. 2 shows that anti-PIP2antibody was unable to precipitate αENaC, but was able to precipitate β and γ subunits. This result suggested that β xENaC, and γ xENaC, but not α xENaC, are the PIP2 binding ENaC subunits in A6 cells. Since PIP2 is only about 1100 daltons and does not stay associated with ENaC under the high detergent conditions of the gels, we could not perform the reverse experiment in which we immunoprecipitated with anti-ENaC antibodies and detected PIP2. The Western blots in Fig. 2 suggest that β xENaC and γ xENaC, but not α xENaC, are responsible for PIP2 binding. Yu et al. (22.Yu F.X. Sun H.Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) compared the putative PIP2 binding sites in gelsolin with that of other PIP2 binding proteins. They found two consensus sequences associated with PIP2binding in gelsolin. Each of the two contains a stretch of basic amino acid sequence. One of the consensus sequences, K XXXK XKK, is also found in the N-terminal domain of γ xENaC and is highly conserved among γ rENaC, γ hENaC, and γ mENaC (Fig. 3, lower panel). The other consensus sequence is K(R) XXXXK XKK(RR). A similar sequence, R XXXXXXRR, is present in all the N-terminal regions of β xENaC, β rENaC, β hENaC, and β mENaC (Fig. 3, upper panel). Interestingly, a similar consensus sequence, K XXXXKKR, was identified in the PIP2 binding domain of several types of inwardly rectified K+ channels (4.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Since both β and γ subunits contain potential PIP2binding sequences, while α ENaC does not, it is not surprising that PIP2 precipitated β xENaC and γ xENaC. Therefore, PIP2 may bind the N-terminal domains of β xENaC and γ xENaC and, thereby, modulate the Na+ channel activity in A6 cells. We also wondered whether Gαi-3 would co-immunoprecipitate with anti-PIP2, since there are indications in the literature that Gαi-3 is associated with ENaC subunits (23.Ausiello D.A. Stow J.L. Cantiello H.F. De Almeida J.B. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this experiment we used a commercially available antibody (Calbiochem), which is purportedly specific for Gαi-3. Fig. 3 shows that the antibody is not as specific as advertised; however, to determine specificity, we used the original antigenic decameric peptide (KNNLKECGLY) to determine which bands were effectively competed. In fact, there is a band at the correct molecular weight for Gαi-3, suggesting that the G protein subunit also co-immunoprecipitated with PIP2. There was, however, another higher molecular weight band that was also competed by the antigenic peptide. A BLAST search for the antigenic peptide revealed, as expected, mostly Gαi-3; however, one protein, Nedd4 (neural precursor cell-expresseddevelopmentally down-regulated-protein) contained an epitope with seven amino acids identical to the antigenic sequence. The size of the higher molecular weight protein is consistent with Nedd4; and in other work, we and others have demonstrated that Nedd4 is present in A6 cells and that it does co-immunoprecipitate with β or γ ENaC (19.Malik B. Schlanger L. Al Khalili O. Bao H.F. Yue G. Price S.R. Mitch W.E. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12903-12910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24.Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspect that the higher molecular weight band is Nedd4. If PIP2 were actually a physiological regulator of ENaC, then the enzyme responsible for the production of PIP2, PIP 5-kinase, would necessarily have to be present in A6 cells. Fig. 5 demonstrates that PIP 5-kinase is, indeed, present in A6 cells, and therefore, regulation of PIP 5-kinase could alter ENaC activity. Our single channel recordings using inside-out patch clamp methods demonstrated that PIP2, a trace membrane lipid, could dramatically alter the activity of ENaC in A6 cells. PIP2activated ENaC by increasing the single channel open probability and the apparent number of active channels. However, since ENaC open probability is extremely low under untreated conditions, we might have been unable to observe two or more channels opening simultaneously, a necessary criterion to determine the number of channels within a patch. That we failed to observe simultaneous openings does not mean that there was only one active channel under untreated conditions, since when open probability is very low, different open events may be due to different channel proteins with a very low probability of simultaneous openings. Therefore, it is hard to determine the true number of active channels under untreated conditions. Therefore, we cannot be sure PIP2 increased the true number of active channels, although it certainly increased the single channel open probability. The metabolic products of 4,5-PIP2 include IP3, DAG, and PIP3. IP3 stimulates calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum, but it is apparently not responsible for PIP2 stimulation of ENaC activity, since endoplasmic reticulum is not present in inside-out patches. DAG also cannot be responsible for the activation, since DAG activates protein kinase C that inhibits ENaC (25.Ling B.N. Kokko K.E. Eaton D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1328-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26.Ling B.N. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1094-F1103PubMed Google Scholar). 3,4,5-PIP3 is also not responsible, since direct addition of PIP3 did not alter ENaC activity in A6 cells. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, a membrane lipid structurally similar to 4,5-PIP2, did not activate ENaC activity (data not shown). These results suggest that only 4,5-PIP2 and not its metabolic products, stimulate ENaC activity. This conclusion is different from the reports that activation of PI 3-kinase and production of PIP3 can stimulate Na+ transport in Ussing chambers (9.Paunescu T.G. Blazer-Yost B.L. Vlahos C.J. Helman S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C236-C247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Record R.D. Froelich L.L. Vlahos C.J. Blazer-Yost B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E611-E617PubMed Google Scholar). There are three possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy. First, PIP3 stimulates membrane transporters other than Na+ channels, since short circuit current could reflect not only Na+ transport but also K+ or Cl− transport. Second, PIP3might stimulate Na+ channel activity through an intermediate intracellular signaling molecule, which would be missing in inside-out patch clamp experiments. Third, PIP3 is increased, but is broken down by a lipid 3-phosphatase to 4,5-PIP2 at the apical membrane where its increase is difficult to measure against a large cellular background of other inositol lipids. Western blot analysis suggests that β xENaC and γ xENaC, but not α xENaC, are responsible for PIP2 binding (Fig. 2). In fact, both β and γ subunits contain consensus PIP2binding sequences that are conserved across subunits from several species (Fig. 3). Therefore, PIP2 may bind the N-terminal domains of β xENaC and γ xENaC and thereby modulate the Na+ channel activity in A6 cells. Further investigation with mutagensis and PIP2 binding assay will identify the PIP2 sites in xENaC subunits. Since the crystal structure of ENaC is still unknown, the molecular interaction between PIP2 and xENaC and subsequent regulation of ENaC activity is not clear, but allosteric regulation is always a possible explanation. Despite the questionable quality of the commercial antibody, Fig. 4 shows that, besides β and γ ENaC, anti-PIP2 antibody can also co-immunoprecipitate Gαi-3. However, it is unlikely that PIP2directly binds Gαi-3, because unlike β and γ ENaC, Gαi-3 has no obvious PIP2 binding sites. A reasonable explanation for the result in Fig. 4 is that both PIP2 and Gαi-3 bind β or γ ENaC (and are consequently all immunoprecipitated together). This is consistent with the previous finding that Gαi-3 is associated with the ENaC channel protein complex (23.Ausiello D.A. Stow J.L. Cantiello H.F. De Almeida J.B. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Since our patch clamp studies indicate that the presence of Gαi-3 is indispensable for PIP2 activation of ENaC activity, PIP2 and Gαi-3 must cooperate to interact and regulate ENaC. Recent reports regarding K+channels show that PIP2 is responsible for the gating of the channels (4.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 28.Sui J.L. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), while βγ subunits of G protein activate G protein-gated inwardly rectified K+ channels by stabilizing the interaction of PIP2 and C-terminal region (4.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). We will examine the roles of PIP2 and Gαi-3 in regulation of ENaC activity. PIP 5-kinase is a key enzyme for production of PIP2. The presence of PIP 5-kinase in A6 cells (Fig. 5) suggests that PIP2 is produced in A6 cells. While the present excised patch clamp study has shown that the exogenously applied PIP2 activated ENaC activity, further investigation will clarify whether PIP 5-kinase is responsible for the endogenous PIP2 production and subsequent ENaC activation in intact A6 cells. In summary, the present patch clamp study suggested that PIP2 increases Na+ channel activity in A6 cells by direct interaction with ENaC protein in the presence of G protein. The PIP2-induced Na+ channel activity is not mediated by one of its metabolic products, PIP3, or other intracellular lipid metabolites. PIP2 regulated ENaC activity possibly by interaction between PIP2 and N-terminal domains of β xENaC and γ xENaC. We thank B. J. Duke for excellent technical support and preparation of cells."

One of the best known examples of reversible acetylation occurs within the amino-terminal end of core histone proteins (1.Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Histones are DNA-binding proteins that form the basic building blocks (nucleosomes) of chromatin. These histone amino-terminal “tails” are also the sites of other post-translational modifications that include phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (2.Marmorstein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3.Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P.

Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Acetylation of lysine residues on histones tails, catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases, generally correlates with transcriptional activation, whereas deacetylation of histone tails, by histone/protein deacetylases, correlates with transcriptional silencing (reviewed in Ref. 1.Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). There are three known classes of histone/protein deacetylases, which are classified by their similarity to yeast proteins. These classes include the Rpd3-like (class I), the Hda1-like (class II), and the Sir21-like (class III) deacetylases (reviewed in Ref. 5.Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Class I and class II deacetylases are commonly referred to as histone deacetylases. Unique among the deacetylases, Sir2-like (class III) deacetylases, or sirtuins, are NAD+-dependent and are insensitive to trichostastin-A, a potent inhibitor of the histone deacetylases (reviewed in Ref. 5.Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In yeast, Sir2 is required for silencing at telomeres (6.Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E.

Cell. 1999; 97: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). At the telomeres and mating-type loci, Sir2 is found in a multiprotein SIR complex with SIR3 and SIR4 (6.Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 7.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M.

The SIR complex contributes to the stability and maintenance of the telomeric repeats (18.Palladino F. Laroche T. Gilson E. Axelrod A. Pillus L. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 543-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). At the rDNA, Sir2 is associated with Net1 and Cdc14, termed the RENT (regulator of nucleolar silencing andtelophase exit) complex (14.Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 19.Straight A.F. Shou W. Dowd G.J. Turck C.W. Deshaies R.J. Johnson A.D. Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 97: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The Sir2-mediated silencing at the rDNA appears to prevent or delay the formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles, which have been shown to segregate to yeast mother cells and promote senescence (Ref. 20.Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar and reviewed in Refs. 21.Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 22.Guarente L. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 391-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sir2 at the silenced rDNA is linked to its function in promoting longevity. Increased dosage of the Sir2 gene resulted in increased lifespan in yeast (23.Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (24.Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). Besides silencing and lifespan extension, Sir2 has been implicated in other cellular processes including the repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks through nonhomologous end-joining (25.Tsukamoto Y. Kato J. Ikeda H. Nature. 1997; 388: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), cell cycle progression, and chromosome stability (26.Brachmann C.B. Sherman J.M. Devine S.E. Cameron E.E. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2888-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). However, despite the many biological processes implicating the involvement of Sir2, its molecular function has only recently been explored (reviewed in Refs. 21.Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and27.Moazed D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28.Shore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14030-14032Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29.Gottschling D.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R708-R711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The first indication of Sir2 function came from the studies of cobalamin biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium (30.Tsang A.W. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31788-31794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this organism, CobB, a distant Sir2 homologue, was shown to compensate for the loss of the phosphoribosyltransferase CobT, suggesting a ribosyltransferase activity for Sir2. Initial examinations of Sir2 molecular function reported a weak ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (31.Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar,32.Tanny J.C. Dowd G.J. Huang J. Hilz H. Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 99: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Further examination, however, provided strong support for an NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity (33.Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2817) Google Scholar, 34.Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The observation that histones at yeast silenced loci are hypoacetylated (39.Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 40.Braunstein M. Sobel R.E. Allis C.D. Turner B.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) has provided a satisfying link from Sir2 function to heterochromatin structure. However, that Sir2 homologues are found in bacteria and that the cellular localization differs among the various homologues would suggest that Sir2 enzymes have additional functions. Recent advances toward understanding the biological functions of the Sir2 family of enzymes included exploration of other potential substrates. These studies have focused on examination of known acetylated proteins as potential targets. For instance, it was recently demonstrated that Sir2 could negatively regulate the tumor suppressor p53 function in vitro and in vivo (41.Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar, 42.Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Eaton E.N. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar) by deacetylating a known acetylation regulatory site (43.Abraham J. Kelly J. Thibault P. Benchimol S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 853-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 44.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Similarly, others have shown (45.Muth V. Nadaud S. Grummt I. Voit R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) that mouse Sir2a is capable of deacetylating the TAFI68 component of the TATA box binding protein-containing factor, repressing RNA polymerase I transcription in vitro. In the current study, we have taken a distinct approach to probe the function of Sir2 enzymes. As has been shown for class I and class II deacetylases, acetate is the direct product of this simple hydrolytic reaction (5.Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 46.Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the yeast Sir2 and HST2 enzymes (class III) couple protein deacetylation to the formation of a novel product O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, using NAD+and liberating nicotinamide in the process (37.Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 38.Tanny J.C. Moazed D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus acetate is not the product of this unique NAD+-dependent reaction. This finding raises important biological questions concerning the function of sirtuins and the role of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. It is not clear whether this tightly coupled reaction is conserved among higher eukaryotes such as human nor is it known whether endogenous yeast complexes can produce O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. If they can, does generating O-acetyl-ADP-ribose in the cell serve a biological purpose? Here we examine these important questions using detailed enzymatic analyses and a quantitative cell microinjection assay designed to evaluate effects on the cell cycle. We demonstrate that indeed the endogenous yeast telomeric Sir2 complex, the human homologue, SIRT2, and the Drosophila homologue, dSir2 generate O-acetyl-ADP-ribose via a conserved enzymatic reaction. By using the microinjection assay, we show that both O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and Sir2 enzymes, in a dose-dependent fashion, cause a delay/block in oocyte maturation and caused a cell cycle delay/block in embryo development. The plasmid containing the full-length, carboxyl-terminally histidine-tagged DrosophilaSir2 (dSir2) gene was obtained from J. Lundblad, B. Newman, and S. Smolik, Oregon Health and Sciences University. Unacetylated and monoacetylated H3 peptide, ARTKQTARKSTGGK(Ac)APRKQL (AcH3), corresponding to the 20 amino-terminal residues of histones H3 was purchased from the Protein Chemistry Core Lab at Baylor College of Medicine. [3H]Acetyl-Coenzyme A (1.88 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of highest quality available. The H187A SIRT2 mutant was generated using QuikChange (Stratagene), and the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. The transformation of BL21DE3-competent cells with the plasmid containing HST2 as well as the expression and purification of HST2 were as described previously (37.Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the dSir2 was transformed in BL21DE3 and were grown on a 2× YT media containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 20 mg/liter of chloramphenicol until an A600 nm of 0.6 was obtained prior to induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 6 h. Protein purification was performed using the same protocol as reported for the purification of HST2 (37.Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In short, the plasmid containing hSIRT2 or the H187A mutant was transformed into BL21DE3-competent cells. Cells were grown on 2× YT media with 100 mg/liter ampicillin until an A600of 0.6 was obtained prior to induction with IPTG for 3 h. Cell lysis was accomplished using a French pressure cell with buffer consisting of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Clarified extract was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was loaded into a small column, washed with 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. SIRT2 was eluted using a linear gradient of 20–250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed to confirm the presence and purity of SIRT2 in the fractions. Pooled samples were dialyzed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT and stored at −20 °C until use. The deacetylase assay employed takes advantage of the different elution profiles between substrates and products through reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Reactions were carried out with [3H]AcH3 or chicken core histones and NAD+ in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 37 °C) containing 1 mm DTT. HPLC-based assays were performed as described by Tanner et al. (37.Tanner K.G. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Denu J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14178-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Samples were individually injected into a Beckman System Gold HPLC using a Vydac Preparative C18 (1 × 25 cm) or a Beckman (0.46 × 15 cm) analytical C18 reverse-phase HPLC column. Upon injection, the system was run isocratically using solvent A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O) for 1 min. The isocratic step was followed by a linear gradient of 0–20% solvent B (0.02% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) over 20 min to resolve the substrate and product peaks. Deacetylated and acetylated H3 peptides were eluted at ∼13 and 16% acetonitrile, respectively. O-Acetyl-ADP-ribose eluted at ∼5% acetonitrile. Elution of substrates and products was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 214 nm. Radioactivity of collected fractions was determined by scintillation counting. To determine the stoichiometry of the SIRT2 reaction, unacetylated H3 peptide was3H-acetylated specifically at Lys-14 using p300/CBP-associated factor. A total of 30 μm[2-3H3]acetyl-CoA (specific activity ∼4500–5000 cpm/pmol) and 200 μm H3 peptide were reacted in the presence of 14.5 μm of PCAF in 5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at 25 °C, for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with 1% trifluoroacetic acid and was purified by reversed phase chromatography using a Beckman Biosystem 510 with a Vydac C18 Small Pore preparative (1 × 25 cm) column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The HPLC was run with 100% solvent A for 1 min followed by a 0–40% gradient of solvent B over 40 min. Lyophilized [3H]AcH3 was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the concentration was determined using a standard curve generated by obtaining the absorbance of known concentrations of AcH3 at 220 nm. The specific activity of the [3H]AcH3 peptide stock was determined as cpm/μl and cpm/pmol using a liquid scintillation counter. A Beckman Biosys 510 HPLC system and a Vydac C18 (1.0 × 25 mm) small pore preparative column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) were used for the purification of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Compounds from the enzymatic reaction were separated using a gradient system comprising of solvent A and solvent B using a constant flow rate of 4 ml/min. All mobile phases were filtered through a Millipore 0.20-μm nylon filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) prior to use. Upon injection of the sample (up to 1 ml), the HPLC was run isocratic in solvent A for 5.0 min followed by a linear gradient of 0–8% B over a 20-min period with the detector set at 260 nm. The gradient was then increased to 40% solvent B over a 20-min period. At 21 min into the run, the detector was switched to 214 nm to detect acetylated and deacetylated H3 peptide. The product derived from NAD+ had a retention time (Rt) of 15.5 min, while the acetylated and deacetylated H3 peptide had retention times of 28.1 and 28.8 min, respectively.O-Acetyl-ADP-ribose was collected directly from the HPLC after passage through the detector, frozen at −80 °C, and lyophilized. Samples were stored in a desiccator under argon prior to use. Chicken core histones and the yeast telomeric complex were purified according to the protocol described previously (47.Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4522-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A yeast strain carrying a His6-HA3 epitope tag at the amino terminus of the SIR2 gene under its own promoter, at its endogenous locus, was generated previously (yeast strain ROY 1515; see Ref.47.Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4522-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The epitope-tagged Sir2p was functionally active in silencing assays (47.Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4522-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extract was loaded into an SP-Sepharose cation exchange column, and proteins were eluted with varying KCl concentrations. The Sir2-containing complex, which eluted with 350 mm KCl, was then loaded into a cobalt-TALON affinity column and eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole. The Sir2-containing fraction was then subjected to an anion-exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose column and eluted with increasing KCl concentrations. Fractions containing the telomeric complex were identified by the presence of Sir4, but not Net1, in a Western blot analysis. The fractions containing the telomeric complex were then subjected to gel filtration chromatography using Superose 6B column. The size of the telomeric complex was determined to be ∼800 kDa. For the final step in the purification, sample was loaded into a heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15 to 1.0 m KCl. Asterina miniata gametes were collected, and microinjections were performed as described previously (48.Carroll D.J. Albay D.T. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, quantitative microinjection of A. miniata oocytes was performed at 16 °C, using mercury-filled micropipets (49.Hiramoto Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1962; 27: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 50.Kiehart D.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 25: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (see the on-line information available at www/egg/uchc.edu/injection), allowing injection of precisely calibrated picoliter volumes into the oocytes and blastomeres. Injection volumes were 3% of the total cellular volume (for oocytes 93 pl, and for blastomeres 47 pl). Buffer alone, purified O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, ADP-ribose (Sigma), or purified recombinant enzyme (prepared as described above) was injected into immature oocytes or one blastomere of a two-cell stage embryo to a final concentration in the cytoplasm as indicated in the figure legends and tables. 1-Methyladenine was from Sigma and was used at 10 μm. Oocyte suspensions were centrifuged (280 × g) briefly, and the seawater was removed. Oocytes were resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 15 mm disodium EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μmeach of aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine, 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by passage through a 27.5-gauge needle on ice. The sample was centrifuged at 18,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min and the soluble fraction was collected and kept on ice. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA assay using BSA as a standard. Aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Yeast Sir2 (ySir2) has been found associated with Sir3 and Sir4 in multiprotein complexes at the telomeres and the mating type loci (6.Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E.

By using recombinant bacterially expressed enzymes, analyses with ySir2 and an additional homologue in yeast, HST2, have shown that the enzymes utilize NAD+ and an acetylated substrate to carry out deacetylation and the coupled production of the novel compound, O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (37.Tanner K.G.

The unique and unanticipated production of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose raises important questions about this conserved and relatively large family of proteins. Is the catalytic mechanism requiring NAD+ consumption and the production of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose evolutionarily conserved? Also it is not known whether Sir2 endogenous complexes catalyze this reaction (i.e. generation of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose), as only bacterially expressed recombinant proteins have been characterized to date. To address whether endogenous Sir2-containing complexes produce O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, yeast Sir2 telomeric complex was purified from yeast (47.Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4522-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and utilized in an in vitrodeacetylation assay. Purification of Sir2-containing telomeric complex involved five chromatographic steps (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 47.Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4522-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), resulting in an ∼800-kDa complex containing ∼4 major polypeptides as described previously (47.Ghidelli S. Donze D. Dhillon N.

Fractions containing the telomeric complex were identified by the presence of Sir4, but not Net1, using Western blot analysis. By using an HPLC-based (reversed phase) deacetylase assay, we have shown that recombinant yeast HST2 generates O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, which can be resolved from the various reactant/products and quantified (37.Tanner K.G.

Based on studies described here, we propose that aberrant vacuolar proton ATPase (V-ATPase)-mediated proton transport in melanoma cells disrupts tyrosinase trafficking through the secretory pathway. Amelanotic but not melanotic melanoma cells or normal melanocytes display elevated proton export as observed by the acidification of the extracellular medium and their ability to maintain neutral intracellular pH. Tyrosinase activity and transit through the Golgi were restored by either maintaining the melanoma cells in alkaline medium (pH 7.4–7.7) or by restricting glucose uptake. The translocation of tyrosinase out of the endoplasmic reticulum and the induction of cell pigmentation in the presence of the ionophore monensin or the specific V-ATPase inhibitors concanamycin A and bafilomycin A1 supported a role for V-ATPases in this process. Because it was previously shown that V-ATPase activity is increased in solid tumors in response to an acidified environment, the appearance of hypopigmented cells in tyrosinase-positive melanoma tumors may indicate the onset of enhanced glycolysis and extracellular acidification, conditions known to favor metastatic spread and resistance to weak base chemotherapeutic drugs.

Tyrosinase (monophenol monooxygenase, EC 1.14.18.1) is a copper-binding enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of monohydric and dihydric phenols (catechols) to their corresponding quinones, the rate-limiting reaction in melanin synthesis (1.Lerner A.B.

Peptides derived from tyrosinase are frequently presented on melanoma cells by major histocompatibility molecules (3.Kang X.Q. Kawakami Y. Elgamil M. Wang R.F. Sakaguchi K. Yannelli J.R. Appella E.

The development of immunotherapies for patients with melanoma is based in part on employing cytotoxic T-cell recognizing tyrosinase peptides as the immunogen (5.Cormier J.N. Abati A. Fetsch P.

The production of these peptides is contingent on the presence of tyrosinase and its proteolytic degradation products. However, tyrosinase peptide presentation is an aberrant phenotype of melanoma cells, because tyrosinase in normal melanocytes is a stable enzyme that is localized to the melanosomes, the site of melanin synthesis. The production of antigenic peptides involves an accumulation of tyrosinase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumEndo Hendoglycosidase HBCECF-AM2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl esterERGICER-Golgi intermediate compartmentmAbmonoclonal antibodypHeextracellular pHpHiintracellular pHCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidWGAwheat germ agglutininV-ATPasevacuolar proton ATPasePBSphosphate-buffered salineDOPAdihydroxyphenylalanine1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumEndo Hendoglycosidase HBCECF-AM2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl esterERGICER-Golgi intermediate compartmentmAbmonoclonal antibodypHeextracellular pHpHiintracellular pHCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidWGAwheat germ agglutininV-ATPasevacuolar proton ATPasePBSphosphate-buffered salineDOPAdihydroxyphenylalanine as a 70-kDa high mannose glycoform and its subsequent routing to the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome (6.Halaban R.

The observations that incubating melanoma cells with the cofactor DOPA or high concentrations of the substrate tyrosine enhanced the exit of tyrosinase from the ER, its carbohydrate modification in the Golgi, and transport to the melanosomes and melanin production suggested that tyrosinase inactivation is associated with aberrant misfolding and ER retention (11.Halaban R.

In fact, increased glucose uptake is currently the basis for melanoma tumor staging by PET (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) (21.Rinne D. Baum R.P. Hor G. Kaufmann R. Cancer. 1998; 82: 1664-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These metabolic changes are likely to contribute to the drug-resistance phenotype, because the extent of multidrug resistance in advanced melanoma lesions does not correlate with the expression of P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-1, even after chemotherapeutic treatment (13.Levine E.A.

An alternative mechanism shared by drug-resistant cells is sequestration of weak base chemotherapeutics in acidic organelles away from their sites of action in the cytosol and nucleus (22.Altan N. Chen Y. Schindler M. Simon S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1583-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 23.Schindler M. Grabski S. Hoff E. Simon S.M.

Increased V-ATPase activity has been implicated in the acidification of endosomes, trans-Golgi network, and lysosomes in solid tumors to accommodate the acidic environment (25.Martinez-Zaguilan R. Lynch R.M. Martinez G.M. Gillies R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1015-C1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Martinez-Zaguilan R. Raghunand N. Lynch R.M. Bellamy W. Martinez G.M. Rojas B. Smith D.

Cancer. 1998; 77: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Substances that cause alkalinization of vesicular compartments such as the Na+/K+ and proton ionophore monensin or the V-ATPase-specific inhibitors concanamycin A or bafilomycin A1 also induce the release of chemotherapeutic drugs and enhance their accumulation in the nucleus (28.Simon S. Roy D. Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Because tyrosinase activity can be suppressed by acidified conditions (2.Riley P.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1999; 45: 951-960PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Naish-Byfield S. Riley P.A. Pigment Cell Res. 1998; 11: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that increased proton pump activity also affects tyrosinase activity and processing in melanoma cells. We show here that tyrosinase trafficking and activity in amelanotic melanoma cells were restored after alkaline treatment or inhibition of V-ATPase activity. The data support the hypothesis that protonation, possibly in the ER-Golgi interface, disrupts tyrosinase maturation in melanoma cells resulting in the amelanotic phenotype, tyrosinase degradation, and antigen production. Normal human melanocytes were cultured from newborn foreskins in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml), and 7% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen) termed basal medium, which was further enriched with several ingredients required for normal melanocyte proliferation. These ingredients included 85 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, 0.1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 2.5 nm cholera toxin, 1 μm Na3VO4, and 0.1 mm N 6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine-3-AMP (β2AMP) (TICVA, Sigma) (30.Halaban R.

When needed, the extracellular pH (pHe) of the medium was monitored daily and adjusted to pH 7.7 with 1 n NaOH. Cells were incubated in the basal medium, unmodified OptiMEM (Invitrogen) plus 2% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's glucose-free medium, or RPMI 1640 medium select®-amine (Invitrogen) reconstituted with sodium pyruvate, tyrosine, and glucose or galactose as indicated. In some experiments, the medium was supplemented with 50 μm freshly prepared DOPA (1 mm stock solution in PBS, Sigma), monensin (10 mm stock solution in Me2SO, Sigma), concanamycin A or bafilomycin A1 (20 μm stock solutions dissolved in Me2SO, both from Calbiochem), pepstatin (10 mg/ml stock solution), or leupeptin (20 mg/ml stock solution, Sigma) using Me2SO as a control when needed. CHAPS lysis buffer (2% CHAPS in 50 mm HEPES and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to lyse cells and wash bead-bound precipitated material as described previously (6.Halaban R.

Reactions were stopped with 200-μl solution of 10% activated charcoal in 0.1m citric acid (w/v), the charcoal slurries passed through Dowex columns (350 μl), and radioactivity of the eluate in scintillation fluid was measured with a scintillation counter. One unit of tyrosinase was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the oxidation of 1 mmol tyrosine in 1 min. All reactions were performed in triplicates or duplicates, and the standard errors were in the range of 15% total counts. Normal and malignant melanocytes were grown on 18-mm glass coverslips precoated with a 1:1 mixture of collagen I and fibronectin-like RGD fragments at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for 48–72 h. Cells were then incubated with the pH-sensitive dye BCECF AM at a final concentration of 5 μm for 4 min at pH 7.3 at room temperature and 5% CO2 as described previously (37.Owen C.S. Pooler P.M.

Following a medium change to pH 7.3 or 7.0, the cells were maintained for an additional 20 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow complete hydrolysis of the dye ester. The plates were then mounted on the microscope stage, and pH was monitored at 37 °C under humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cellular pHi values were calculated based on data from whole excitation spectra (37.Owen C.S. Pooler P.M. Wahl M.L. Coss R.A. Leeper D.B. J. Cell.

Cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]Met/Cys (0.7 mCi/ml, EasyTag, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in methionine/cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) and either collected immediately or after chase incubation with non-radioactive medium (Ham's F-10 medium) for the indicated period of time. Experiments were performed in medium supplemented with tyrosine as indicated and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-tyrosinase antibodies. Following extensive washing with radioimmune precipitation buffer, half of the precipitated products were digested with Endo H overnight. Eluted proteins were fractionated in SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Densities of radioactive tyrosinase bands on the x-ray films were determined using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Melanoma cells were grown on chamber slides in unmodified Ham's F-10 medium at pH 7.4. Treated and untreated cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. The permeabilized and fixed cells were then incubated with antibodies against tyrosinase (C-19 goat), ERGIC-53 (mAb, a gift from Dr. H.-P. Hauri, Geneva, Switzerland; a marker of ER-ER Golgi intermediate compartment), COPI (rabbit polyclonal anti-β-COPI antibodies, a gift from Dr. G. Warren, Department of Cell Biology, Yale University, New Haven, CT; a marker for ER-ERGIC-Golgi compartments), or calnexin (mAb, StressGen Biotechnologies Corporation, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada; an ER marker). The primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein anti-goat conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rhodamine anti-mouse or anti-rabbit conjugates (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). All dilutions were in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Indirect immunofluorescence was visualized with an inverted Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal microscope system. Images were processed with Bio-Rad confocal assistant software. Under normal conditions, the medium from amelanotic melanoma cells becomes rapidly acidified within a day of medium change (pH 7.0–7.2), whereas that of normal melanocytes or the pigmented metastatic melanoma Heik178 remain basic (pH 7.4–7.5). Therefore, we evaluated pigmentation and tyrosinase processing in YUGEN8 melanoma cells subcultured in Ham's F-10 medium, adjusted daily to pH 7.7, and compared it to cells that were continuously grown in unmodified Ham's F-10 medium. Alkalinization of the pHe had a marked effect as the cells became pigmented during 2 weeks of culture (Fig. 1 A). An analysis of steady-state tyrosinase levels demonstrated an increase in the abundance of tyrosinase protein (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1and 2, normalized to actin and total protein concentration). Most striking was the increase in the level of the higher molecular weight mature tyrosinase (Fig. 1 B, compare lane 1with 2, arrow) (6.Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The identification of the higher molecular weight tyrosinase glycoform as a protein that had been modified by Golgi enzymes was verified by Endo H digestion. Endo H cleaves N-linked oligosaccharides between the two N-acetylglucosamine residues in the core region of the oligosaccharide chain of high mannose but not complex carbohydrates. Because the addition of complex sugars occurs in the medial Golgi, the limited substrate specificity of this enzyme provides a useful tool for monitoring the subcellular location of glycoproteins. Endo H treatment had only a slight effect on the electrophoretic mobility of mature tyrosinase (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4and 6, solid arrow) indicating that the majority of the seven tyrosinase N-linked glycans had been modified with complex sugars in the Golgi (39.Újvári A.

In contrast, the faster migrating immature glycoform (Fig. 1 B, bandsmarked with empty arrow) was digested to its 58-kDa polypeptide indicative of complete sensitivity of all of seven glycans in tyrosinase, a characteristic of ER or cis-Golgi residency (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 6,band marked DG). Species of low molecular mass of ∼58 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 2 marked with spearhead) also accumulated after incubation in alkaline pHe. This protein band represents the non-glycosylated tyrosinase as shown by its inability to bind WGA (Fig. 1 B,lanes 5) as reported previously (6.Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11933-11938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Further evidence that alkaline pHe promoted tyrosinase maturation and activation was obtained by analyzing the effect of DOPA on this process. We have previously shown that the addition of the cofactor DOPA to the growth medium in the presence of catalytic amounts of the substrate tyrosine promoted tyrosinase activation and maturation in melanoma cells within hours (11.Halaban R. Cheng E. Svedine S. Aron R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11933-11938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because DOPA activation of tyrosinase is dependent on pH (2.Riley P.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1999; 45: 951-960PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Naish-Byfield S. Riley P.A. Pigment Cell Res. 1998; 11: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we tested whether low pHe could suppress the DOPA effect. Indeed maintaining the cells at low pHe hampered the DOPA/tyrosine-induced maturation (Fig. 1 C, comparelanes 1–3 with 4–7), suggesting that long term growth in acidified pH suppresses DOPA activation, tyrosinase maturation, and pigmentation. Because increased glucose consumption can increase acidity as a result of the accumulation of lactic acid in the cell environment (17.Stubbs M. McSheehy P.M. Griffiths J.R. Bashford C.L. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), we tested whether eliminating glucose in the medium could affect pigmentation, tyrosinase activity, and maturation. Toward this end, melanoma cells (YUGEN8 and YUSIT1) were grown for 3 days in glucose-free medium with 1 mm pyruvate supplemented with 25 mm glucose (+) or 2 mm galactose (−) (Fig. 2). The source of energy affected the pH of the external medium because at the end of 3 days of incubation, the pHe was 7.1 and 7.5–7.7, in the glucose-containing and glucose-free (galactose-supplemented) medium, respectively. The levels of pigmentation were also dramatically increased in YUGEN8 and YUSIT1 melanoma cells grown in the glucose-free medium compared with glucose-supplemented medium (Fig. 2 A, compare +to −). Time-course analysis revealed the accumulation of the 80-kDa tyrosinase glycoform in melanoma cells after 28 h in glucose-free medium (Fig. 2 B, TYR) accompanied by a large increase in tyrosinase activity (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrated that glucose metabolism has an impact on tyrosinase activity and processing, probably because of acidification of the extracellular milieu and endomembraneous compartments. Because tyrosinase maturation has been shown previously to be induced by its activation (11.Halaban R. Cheng E. Svedine S. Aron R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11933-11938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we further investigated whether the restoration of tyrosinase processing obtained with direct alkalinization of the pHe (Fig. 1) or by restricting glucose consumption (Fig. 2) could be modulated by the concentrations of tyrosine in the medium. As the glucose-free medium used above contained a high tyrosine concentration (400 μm), we incubated three melanoma cell lines, YUGEN8, 501 mel, and YUSIT1, in RPMI 1640 select®-amine medium supplemented with glucose or galactose in the presence of low (10 μm) or high (100 μm) tyrosine for 3 days. Tyrosinase was processed to the 80-kDa form in cells grown in glucose-free medium at both low and high tyrosine concentrations in melanoma cells exhibiting relatively modest levels of tyrosinase (Fig. 2 D, YUGEN8, compare lane 1 with 2 andlane 3 with 4, solid andempty arrows). Melanoma cells with lower levels of tyrosinase displayed different thresholds of activation. The 501 mel cells required at least 100 μm tyrosine for stabilization (Fig. 2 D, compare lane 6 with 8), whereas the enzyme remained as the ER 70-kDa glycoform in YUSIT1 melanoma cells even at 100 μm tyrosine (Fig. 2 D, lanes 9–12, empty arrow). Therefore, in agreement with previous observations (11.Halaban R. Cheng E. Svedine S. Aron R. Hebert D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11933-11938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the effectiveness of glucose restriction and alkaline extracellular pH was dependent on the concentration of tyrosine in the medium and the levels of endogenous tyrosinase, suggesting that the maturation process was dependent on tyrosinase activity. The enhanced extracellular acidification observed for amelanotic melanoma cells indicated an increased proton pump activity at their plasma membrane. In addition, the surface proton pumps, Na+/H+ antiporters and Cl−/HCO3 exchangers are known to be activated in tumor cells to maintain pHi and protect the cells from the acidic extracellular environment (reviewed in Ref. 24.Simon S.M.

Its down-regulation is associated with several neoplasms, and serine phosphorylation of its N terminus modulates DOC-2/DAB2's inhibitory effect on AP-1 transcriptional activity. We describe the cloning of DIP1/2, a novel gene that interacts with the N-terminal domain of DOC-2/DAB2. DIP1/2 is a novel GTPase-activating protein containing a Ras GTPase-activating protein homology domain (N terminus) and two other unique domains (i.e. 10 proline repeats and leucine zipper). Interaction between DOC-2/DAB2 and DIP1/2 is detected in normal tissues such as the brain and prostate. Altered expression of these two proteins is often detected in prostate cancer cells. Indeed, the presence of DIP1/2 effectively blocks mitogen-induced gene expression and inhibits the growth of prostate cancer.

Increased expression of DOC-2/DAB2 inhibits the growth of several cancer cells (4.Tseng C-P. Brent D.E. Li Y.-M. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which suggests that it functions as a tumor suppressor. DOC-2/DAB2 also appears to be a phosphoprotein, and its phosphorylation can be regulated by several stimuli (4.Tseng C-P. Brent D.E. Li Y.-M. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6.Xu X.-X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that DOC-2/DAB2 expression is significantly increased in the enriched basal cell population with stem cell potential of the degenerated rat prostate (4.Tseng C-P. Brent D.E. Li Y.-M. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that DOC-2/DAB2 may play an important role in regulating the homeostasis of epithelial differentiation. Amino acid sequence analysis predicts that DOC-2/DAB2 is a potential signaling molecule. Its N terminus shares 54% homology with mouse DAB1 protein that can be phosphorylated by Src, and the disruption of the DAB1 gene can cause developmental defects in central neurons (7.Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 8.Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others also show that the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 containing proline-rich domains can bind to Grb2 proteins (9.Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10.Zhou J. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 278: 27793-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that DOC-2/DAB2 is involved in modulating the Ras signaling pathway. To understand biochemical function of DOC-2/DAB2, we identified a key amino acid residue (Ser24) in its N terminus. The phosphorylation of this residue by protein kinase C (PKC)1 activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) can modulate its inhibitory activity on TPA-induced gene transcription (11.Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the DOC-2/DAB2 protein, particularly its N terminus, is a potent negative regulator for the PKC-elicited signal pathway. However, little is known about the downstream effector(s) mediated by DOC-2/DAB2. In this study, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system to identify DIP1/2 as an immediate DOC-2/DAB2-interactive protein. DIP1/2, a novel Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), interacts with the N-terminal domain of DOC-2/DAB2. We cloned DIP1/2, characterized it as an immediate downstream effector of DOC-2/DAB2, and delineated its functional role in mitogen-induced gene expression and growth inhibition of prostate cancer. Three human prostate cancer cell lines (TSU-Pr1, LNCaP, and C4-2) and COS cells were maintained in T medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (4.Tseng C-P. Brent D.E. Li Y.-M. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PrEC, a primary prostatic epithelial cell derived from a 17-year-old juvenile prostate, was maintained in a chemically defined medium purchased from Clonetics. PZ-HPV-7, a cell line derived from the peripheral zone of a normal prostate (12.Weijerman P.C. Konig J.J. Wong S.T. Niesters H.G. Peehl D.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5579-5583PubMed Google Scholar), was maintained in T medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. MDAPCa2a and MDAPCa2b cell lines were derived from patients with bony metastasis (13.Navone N. Olive M. Ozen M. Davis R. Troncoso P. Tu S-M. Johnston D. Pollack A. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Logothetis C.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2493-2500PubMed Google Scholar). Three additional primary prostatic epithelial cells, derived from either cancer lesions (SWPC1, SWPC2) or adjacent normal tissue (SWNPC2), were obtained from patients with prostate cancer who had had radical prostatectomy. All these cells were maintained in the same medium as PrEC. Corresponding antibody staining indicated that all primary cells were cytokeratin-positive and vimentin-negative. Using primers 5′-GAATTCCCCGTCATGTCTAACGAA-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTAACTGAGGCTTTGGTCGAGG-3′ and using DOC-2/DAB2 cDNA as a template we generated an 823-bp fragment corresponding to the 5′-end of the cDNA. The PCR-amplified fragment was sequenced before it was subcloned in-frame into pVJL11 vector as a bait construct. Equal amounts of constructed bait vector and pVP16 rat brain cDNA library vector were co-transformed into the yeast strain of L40, and the transformed yeasts were plated on SD-L-T-H (synthetic medium lacking amino acids of leucine, tryptophan, and histidine) plates with 5 mm3-aminotrizol. Only those colonies that had β-galactosidase activities were further analyzed. Plasmids from those positive clones were rescued and transformed into Escherichia coli HB101 strain for further amplification. Four rounds of phage library screening were performed with a rat brain λ ZAP phage library (Stratagene) to clone the full-length cDNA of DIP1/2. After DNA sequencing for each positive clone, the full-length cDNA of DIP1/2 was assembled with the appropriate restriction enzyme digestion. Total RNA from various organs of the male rat was isolated with RNAzol (TEL-TEST). Twenty micrograms of total RNA/lane were separated on 1% formaldehyde agarose gel, transformed onto Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad), and then hybridized with32P-labeled DIP1/2 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. A peptide sequence (CTNPTKLQITENGEFRNSSNC) corresponding to DIP1/2 amino acid residues 976–996, with an extra cysteine at the N terminus as a linker, was synthesized and used as the antigen to immunize rabbits for generating polyclonal antibody by Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratory. After 7 weeks, rabbits were sacrificed to collect antiserum after the fourth boosting injection of antigen. SulfoLink gel (Pierce) was coupled with the synthetic peptide and then blocked with 50 mm cysteine in 50 mmTris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5; it was then washed with 1m NaCl. Antibodies against DIP1/2 were first purified by slowly passing the antiserum to the coupled SulfoLink gel. After washing with five column volumes of 1 m NaCl, they were eluted with elution buffer from the Sulfolink kit (Pierce). Purified antibodies were dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of deionized water at 4 °C. COS cells were co-transfected with a series of T7-tagged DOC-2/DAB2 vectors (wild type (p82), slicing form (p59), N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN), and C-terminal deletion mutant (ΔB)) and HA-tagged DIP1/2 vector. Cells were lysed with a buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) and a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The supernatant was collected and incubated overnight with either 60 μl of T7-antibody-conjugated agarose bead solution (50% actual volume) or 60 μl of protein A-agarose beads with 10 μg of HA-antibody at 4 °C. After incubation, pellets were washed eight times and subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The minimal GAP domain of DIP1/2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GGGATCCCAGAACGCAACAGC-3′ and 5′-AGAATTCTTAGCTTGAGCTGCGGGCAGG-3′. The amplified fragment was subcloned in-frame into the pGEX-5X vector and transformed into the E. coli strain of BL21. The bacteria culture was induced with 2.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. The bacterial pellet was washed once with cold PBS. After spin, the pellet was resuspended in PBS and subjected, five times, to 30-s sonication. The GST-GAP fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's manual (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the purified protein was analyzed using 10% SDS-PAGE analysis and followed by GELCODE Blue staining (Pierce). Assay of Ras GAP activity in vitro was performed according to Kim et al. (14.Kim J.H. Liao D. Lau L-F. Huganir R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). To prepare GTP-bound Ras protein, 0.25 μm human recombinant Ha-Ras protein (Calbiochem) was incubated with 20 nm[γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 5 min at room temperature. Up to 1 μg of either GST-GAP or GST protein alone was added into a buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The loaded Ras was then incubated with either GST-DIP1/2 or GST for the indicated time, and the reaction was stopped by adding 5 volumes of ice-cold 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 1 mm MgCl2. The reaction mixture was then filtered through 0.45-μm HA membrane (Millipore Corp.). Filters were air-dried and then subjected to scintillation counting. C4-2 cells were transfected with either HA-tagged Ras alone or HA-tagged Ras and DIP1/2. Two days after transfection, cells were treated overnight with T medium without serum, and 100 ng/ml EGF was added for 20 min. Then cells were lysed with lysis buffer (PBS with 5 mm MgCl2 and 1% Triton X-100). The whole lysate was spun down, and the supernatants were added with 10 μl of Raf-conjugated agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Pellets were spun down and washed four times with the same lysis buffer, and 20 ml of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the pellets and incubated at 100 °C for 3 min. Treated samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel, and Ras-Raf binding was detected using Western blot. To make mutants of DIP1/2 and the GST fusion DIP, the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was employed. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR according to the manufacturer (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide used for each mutant was 5′-GGACAATGAGCACCTCATCTTTCTGGAGAACACATTGGCCACCAAGG-3′. Briefly, after denaturing the wild type plasmids, the oligonucleotide primer was annealed with template DNA and then extended with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. After PCR, the methylated and nonmutated parental DNA template was digested with DpnI. The XL-1 Blue cells were then transformed with DpnI-treated DNA for selecting the mutated DNA. Mutants were verified by sequencing. To determine the effect of DIP1/2 on prostate cancer cells, we studied 1) gene transcription using either serum response element (SRE) or TPA response element (TRE) reporter gene assays and 2) cell growth using both crystal violet and colony formation assays. For reporter gene assay, C4-2 cells were transiently transfected with either SRE or TRE reporter plasmids in the combination of DIP1/2, ΔB, and ΔB-S24A expression vectors. Two days after transfection, T medium with 0.5% FBS was changed for another 24 h, and then either 50 ng/ml EGF or 100 ng/ml TPA was added to the cells for an additional 14 h. Luciferase activity assays were performed as described previously (11.Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), C4-2 cells (2 × 105) were transfected with 2 μg of pCI-DIP1/2 or 2 μg of pCI-neo (control). Two days after transfection, cells were selected with G418 (800 μg/ml), and an individual colony was cloned by ring isolation (4.Tseng C-P. Brent D.E. Li Y.-M. Pong R.-C. Hsieh J.-T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3542-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The in vitro growth rate of each clone was determined by plating cells in a 24-well plate at a density of 5000 cells/well with T medium containing 2% TCM™ (Celox) and 0.5% FBS. At the indicated days, cell numbers were determined by crystal violet assay (15.Gillies R.J. Didier N. Denton M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). For the colony formation assay, C4-2 cells (3 × 104) were pleated on a 35-mm dish with T-medium containing 5% FBS and co-transfected with 0.2 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector with 0.8 μg of cDNAs as indicated. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were changed to T-medium containing 0.2% FBS. At the indicated time, cells were washed with cold PBS twice and fixed. The number of blue cells was counted by β-galactosidase staining according to Yeung et al. (16.Yeung K. Seitz T. Li S. Janosh P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). DOC-2/DAB2's first 260 amino acids were used as a “bait” sequence in the yeast two-hybrid system to search for protein(s) that interacts with the N-terminal domain of DOC-2/DAB2 (17.Fields S. Song O-K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Of 10,000 transformants screened, 36 positive clones were selected, and two positive clones (DIP1, DIP2) were further analyzed. These two clones shared overlapping sequence and were identical. However, since neither alone contained a full-length sequence, we designated the full-length sequence “DIP1/2.” To obtain the full-length cDNA of DIP1/2, a λ ZAP cDNA library from a rat brain was screened. Eleven clones spanned about 6.3 kb and represented two different sizes of DIP1/2 mRNA transcripts with different 5′ upstream sequences (Fig. 1A). The DIP1/2 was predicted to have an open reading frame of 996 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 110 kDa. According to the deduced protein sequence, DIP1/2 appears to be a novel protein with several potential functional domains (Fig. 1B). Its key feature is the Ras GAP homology domain, which spans from residues 177 to 409 and is present in all members of the Ras GAP family (18.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Also, DIP1/2 had a stretch of 10 proline repeats (residues 727–736) with the capacity to bind to proteins containing an Src homology 3 domain (19.Feller S.F. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and a leucine zipper dimerization domain (residues 842–861) for protein dimerization (20.Struhl K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 137-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence alignment of DIP1/2's GAP domain with other Ras GAP proteins (Fig. 1C), including p120GAP, Homo sapiens neurofibromine (hNF1), Rattus norvegicus Ras GAP (rnGAP), a novel human Ras GAP (nGAP), and synaptic Ras GAP (SynGAP), shows that DIP1/2 contains all of the critical consensus amino acids for Ras GAP activity (21.Schheffzek K. Lautwein A. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This suggests that DIP1/2 can function as a Ras GAP. Northern blot analysis indicated that steady-state levels of DIP1/2 mRNA (about 6.9 kb) are detected in brain, lung, thymus, bladder, and skeletal muscle tissue (Fig. 2A). In both brain and kidney, a different size of RNA transcript with 9.6 kb was found that may represent DIP1/2a with an additional 5′-upstream sequence. Nevertheless, steady-state levels of DIP1/2 mRNA were not detected in several urogenital organs including the ventral prostate, dorsal lateral prostate, seminal vesicle, and coagulating gland. However, detectable DIP1/2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A) were detected in Noble rat prostate epithelia (NbE) and Sprague-Dawley rat prostate epithelia (VPE) from basal cells of the ventral prostate. Increased levels were not detected in stromal cells (i.e. NbF and VPF) from the same animals. This indicates that DIP1/2 preferentially expresses in the prostatic basal epithelial cells. Further Northern analysis (Fig. 2B) indicated that expression of DIP1/2 mRNA increased in degenerated prostates in a time-dependent manner, and the expression patterns of DIP1/2 and DOC-2/DAB2 mRNA concur. These findings suggest that both genes co-express in the enriched basal cell population during prostate degeneration (Fig. 2B). A polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the C terminus of DIP1/2. With this antibody, a major band of 110 kDa was detected from the in vitrotranscription and translation of DIP1/2 cDNA (Fig. 3A). To further test the specificity of this antibody, serum was incubated with increasing concentrations of synthetic peptide of DIP1/2, ranging from 20 to 200 μg/ml, prior to probing with the blotted membrane. Results (Fig. 3A) indicated that the synthetic peptide effectively competes with the antibody in ability to bind to the DIP1/2 protein. The increased protein expression of DIP1/2 was seen in degenerated prostate tissue (Fig. 3B), consistent with elevated DIP1/2 mRNA levels detected in degenerated prostate (Fig. 2B). Since they were parallel with DOC-2/DAB2 levels, these results (Fig. 3B) suggest that both DIP1/2 and DOC-2/DAB2 proteins coexist in degenerated prostate. To further understand the profile of DIP1/2 and DOC-2/DAB2 expression in human prostate cancer, we screened a variety of prostate cancer cell lines. In Western blot analysis, only a 110-kDa protein band was detected in cell lysate of human prostate cells, indicating that the antibody also recognizes the homologue of human DIP1/2 (hDIP1/2). The sequence of hDIP1/2 is very similar to that of rDIP1/2. 2Hong, C., Pong, R-C., Wang, Z., and Hsieh, J. T., Genomics, in press. As shown in Fig. 3C, we found that DIP1/2 and DOC-2/DAB2 proteins were present in both normal primary epithelial cells (PZ-HPV-7, PrEC, and SWNPC2) and primary tumors (SWPC1 and SWPC2). However, a significant decreased expression of DIP1/2 was detected in several metastatic cell lines such as TSU-Pr1, LNCaP, C4-2, MDAPCa2a, and MDAPCa2b, cancer cell lines. We believe this indicates that DIP1/2 is involved in the progression of prostate cancer. Because data from the yeast two-hybrid screening indicated that DIP1/2 and DOC-2/DAB2 directly interact, we further examined whether these two native proteins interact with each other using brain and prostate as tissue sources. Using antibodies against either DOC-2/DAB2 (transfection) or DIP1/2 in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment, we demonstrated that endogenous DIP1/2 and DOC-2/DAB2 proteins were present in the same immune complex (Fig. 3D). Noticeably, there were two sizes of DIP1/2 protein in the rat brain (molecular masses of 110 and 135 kDa, respectively) (Fig. 3D), and the predominant protein appears to be 135 kDa, which may correspond to the 9.6 kb of DIP1/2 mRNA detected in brain tissue (Fig. 2A). To confirm whether DIP1/2 only interacts with the N-terminal domain of DOC-2/DAB2, we used a series of T7-tagged DOC-2/DAB2 wild type (p82), slicing form (p59), N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN), and C-terminal deletion mutant (ΔB)) as described previously (11.Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and an HA-tagged DIP1/2 construct. Cells were co-transfected with both vectors for 24 h, and then cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with T7-antibody (for DOC-2/DAB2) and then probed with HA-antibody (for DIP1/2). The presence of DIP1/2 was only detected in the cells co-transfected with DIP1/2 and DOC-2/DAB2 containing the N terminus, such as p59, p82, and ΔB, but not in the cells co-transfected with DIP1/2 and the C terminus of DOC-2/DAB2 (ΔN) (Fig. 4A). Conversely, using HA-antibody for immunoprecipitation and then probing with T7-antibody, we demonstrated that DIP1/2 protein can be co-precipitated with p59, p82, and ΔB protein but not with ΔN protein (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, to rule out the possible experimental artifact that is due to differential protein expression in each transfection, levels of each recombinant protein were determined by Western analysis and appeared to be identical (Fig. 4, Cand D). Taken together, these data indicate that DIP1/2 protein only interacts with the N-terminal, not the C-terminal, domain of DOC-2/DAB2 protein. Since DAB1 and DOC-2/DAB2 share a high degree of homology at the PTB domain, we also examined whether mouse DAB1 can interact with DIP1/2. Two mouse DAB1 cDNA clones (PTB, B3) were used (22.Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and we found that DIP1/2 interacts with DAB-PTB (amino acids 29–197) but not DAB-B3 (amino acids 107–243), since DAB-B3 contains partial PTB sequences (22.Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Due to the high sequence homology between DIP1/2 and other Ras GAPs, we thought it likely that DIP1/2 facilitates Ras GTPase activity. To test this, we prepared a GST-DIP1/2 fusion protein containing the minimal Ras GAP domain (23.Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and either this fusion protein or GST protein was incubated with human recombinant [γ-32P]GTP-bound Ha-Ras protein. The increasing amounts of GST-DIP1/2 (ranging from 0.2 to 1 μg) stimulated Ras GTPase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Conversely, control GST protein (1 μg) had no effect on Ras GTPase activity. To further compare the Ras GAP activity of DIP1/2 with a known Ras GAP protein (GAP120), we created a DIP1/2 cDNA construct (DIP1/2m) as a control with a point mutation (R220L) that may disrupt GAP activity. As shown in Fig. 5B, the overall GAP activity between p120GAP and DIP1/2 is very similar, and the DIP1/2m did not have any GAP activity toward Ha-Ras. These data clearly demonstrate that DIP1/2 can stimulate GTPase activity of Ha-Ras in vitro. To examine the specificity of DIP1/2 to other small G-proteins such as K-Ras, R-Ras, TC21, and Rap1A, we found that DIP1/2 has a similar GAP activity as p120GAP by stimulating GTPase activity of K-Ras, R-Ras, and TC21 but not Rap1A (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that DIP1/2 is a typical Ras GAP. Early study of Ras signal transduction indicates that Raf is an immediate downstream effector for Ras signaling (24.Morrison D. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 8855-8859Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Because Raf binds tightly to the GTP-bound form of Ras but not to the GDP-bound form, such differential affinity can be used to determine the GTP-bound status of Ras. To analyze the GAP activity of DIP1/2 in vivo, C4-2 cells (25.Wu T.T. Sikes R.A. Cui O. Thalmann G.N. Kao C. Murphy C.F. Yang H. Zhau H.E. Balian G. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 877-894Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar) were transfected with vectors expressing HA-tagged Ras, DIP1/2, or DIP1/2m. After activating Ras using EGF, the GTP-bound form of Ras was precipitated with GST-RBD (GST-Raf containing Ras binding domain). Precipitated Ras was detected using the HA-antibody. As shown in Fig. 5D, in the presence of EGF, the amount of GTP-bound Ras increased over that of the control. Levels of the GTP-bound Ras significantly decreased in cells expressing DIP1/2; however, DIP1/2m failed to stimulate Ras GTPase in cells treated with EGF. The whole cell lysates were examined for expression of DIP1/2 and Ras proteins, and results demonstrated that expressions of DIP1/2 and Ras were identical between each transfection. These results indicate that DIP1/2 can function as a Ras GTPase-activating protein in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that DIP1/2 functions as a Ras GAP in vivo and in vitro. The Ras protein functions as an essential component in many intracellular signaling pathways responsible for differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (26.McCormick F. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is a key signal transduction pathway modulated by Ras protein (27.Porter A.C. Vaillancourt R.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The downstream components of this pathway, including AP-1, which binds to TRE, and EIK-1, which binds to SRE, subsequently activate gene expression (28.Abate C. Curran T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6953-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30.Hata A. Akita Y. Suzuki K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9122-9129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKC is able to activate the Raf/MEK/ERK axis (31.Sozeri O. Vollmer K. Liyanage M. Firth D. Kour G. Mark G.E. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), we investigated the impact of DIP1/2 on this cascade. As shown in Fig. 6A, in the absence of EGF, increased expression of DIP1/2 could inhibit the basal levels of SRE reporter gene activity in prostate cancer cells. The presence of EGF increased the reporter gene activity at least 5-fold. However, DIP1/2 could inhibit the reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner. Using the same reporter gene assay, we found that DIP1/2 or ΔB, a DOC-2/DAB2 cDNA containing the N-terminal domain (11.Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), alone can suppress SRE activity (Fig. 6B), but co-expression of ΔB and DIP1/2 had an additive effect on the inhibition of SRE activity in the presence of TPA. These data indicate that physical interaction between DIP1/2 and DOC-2/DAB2 has functional impact on Ras-mediated signal transduction. Previously, we demonstrated that PKC-elicited DOC-2/DAB2 phosphorylation can block TPA-induced gene activity (11.Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.-C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2063641892,"Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is known to involve the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In addition, an ATP-independent proteolytic system has been suggested to operate in parallel with this pathway and become up-regulated when proteasomes are inhibited (Jensen, T. J., Loo, M.

In this study, we use two independent techniques, pulse-chase labeling and a noninvasive fluorescence cell-based assay, to investigate the proteolytic pathways underlying the degradation of misfolded CFTR. Here we report that only inhibitors of the proteasome have a significant effect on preventing the degradation of CFTR, whereas cell-permeable inhibitors of lysosomal degradation, autophagy, and several classes of protease had no measurable effect on CFTR degradation, when used either alone or in combination with the specific proteasome inhibitor carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG132). Our results suggest that ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation is the dominant pathway for disposal of misfolded CFTR in mammalian cells and provide new mechanistic insight into endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Nascent proteins that fail to fold or assemble in the ER are degraded by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (3.Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Studies in mammalian cells and in yeast have led to the formulation of a general model for ERAD in which substrates are degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes following retrotranslocation (i.e. “dislocation”) across the ER membrane by a process that requires the Sec61 translocon and functional ubiquitylation machinery at the cytosolic face of the ER membrane (4.Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 5.Plemper R.K. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 125-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Johnson A.E. Haigh N.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dislocation of ERAD substrates across the ER membrane is kinetically coupled to their degradation by proteasomes, and in many cases, cytosolic intermediates of degradation are hard to detect (7.Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8.O'Hare T. Wiens G.D. Whitcomb E.A. Enns C.A. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 11-14PubMed Google Scholar). Although a central role for proteasomes in ERAD is widely accepted, a number of studies have suggested that other, nonproteasomal, proteolytic systems may also contribute to the elimination of misfolded proteins from the ER (9.Jensen T.J.

Although nearly 1000 mutations have been linked to cystic fibrosis, the majority of Caucasian cystic fibrosis patients have at least one copy of the ΔF508 mutation, a temperature-sensitive allele that is unable to fold correctly at physiological temperature. As a consequence, ΔF508 CFTR (ΔF508) is not deployed to the plasma membrane and is instead rapidly degraded without being processed in the Golgi apparatus (14.Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 15.Bannykh S.I. Bannykh G.I. Fish K.N. Moyer B.D. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 852-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support a role for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in ΔF508 turnover. First, CFTR undergoes both co-translational and posttranslational ubiquitylation when expressed in a cell-free system (16.Sato S. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17.Xiong X. Chong E. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2616-2624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Second, inhibition of proteasome function with chemical inhibitors or with a dominant negative form of ubiquitin leads to accumulation of multiubiquitylated, undegraded forms of CFTR and ΔF508 (13.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Third, degradation of ΔF508 in a cell-free system is sensitive to inhibitors of both the 19 S and 20 S subunits of the proteasome (17.Xiong X. Chong E. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2616-2624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18.Oberdorf J. Carlson E.J. Skach W.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13397-13405Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Curiously, despite this compelling evidence in support of a role for proteasomes in the degradation of misfolded CFTR, the effect of proteasome inhibition on the disappearance of ΔF508 from pulse-chase studies is minimal (9.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 13.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). This observation has led some investigators to conclude that other proteolytic systems are primarily responsible for the ERAD of misfolded CFTR molecules (9.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). However, no other proteases or proteolytic systems have been convincingly demonstrated to contribute to the degradation of CFTR or other ERAD substrates. Therefore, the intracellular fate of ΔF508 and the identity of the proteases that participate in its degradation remain unresolved. In this study, we used a reporter (GFP-ΔF508) consisting of a fusion of GFP with ΔF508 (19.Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I. Guggino W.B. Langford G.M. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21759-21768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to assess the participation of proteasomes and other proteolytic systems in ΔF508 degradation. Our data establish that proteolytic activities of the proteasome are responsible for vast majority of intracellular degradation of misfolded CFTR molecules. Most chemicals (with the exception of some proteasome inhibitors) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Epoxomicin and carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-leucyl-l-leucinal (MG132) were obtained from Calbiochem. YU102 was generously provided by Dr. Graig Crews (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Michael Rexach (Stanford University). pGFP-CFTR in a pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) was obtained from Dr. B. Stanton (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH) and subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) using NheI and EcoRV. ΔF508 mutation was introduced by replacing the [Pml1-Blp1] cassette within the CFTR sequence. For selection of stable CHO cell lines, GFP-ΔF508/pcDNA3 plasmid was linearized and transfected into CHO cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were subjected to selection in G418-containing medium. Stable transfectants were expanded in culture and enriched for GFP-ΔF508-expressing cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of highly fluorescent cells after overnight incubation of these cells with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal. Cells were then cloned into 96-well dishes at a density of 1 cell/well. Clonal cell lines were expanded and analyzed for full-length GFP-ΔF508 expression by immunoblotting, and a single clone (clone 2) was selected for this study. Generation of human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells stably expressing GFPu was described elsewhere (20.Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). CHO clone 2 cells were plated on 10 × 10-cm dishes and treated with 5 mm butyrate overnight to increase GFP-ΔF508 expression. The next day, cells were starved in cysteine/methionine-free media for 30 min and then labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine (specific activity, 1 mCi/ml) for 30 min in the presence of 5 mm butyrate. Two 10-cm dishes were harvested immediately after the pulse (t = 0 h), whereas the remaining dishes were chased in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine (75 μm) or emetine and MG132 (25 μm) together. At specified time intervals, cells were solubilized in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.05% deoxycholate) containing a CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) for 30 min. Cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated with anti-GFP antibody and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with buffer A and fractionated by 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). Quantitation of radioactive bands was done using PhosphorImager SI and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Analysis of GFP-ΔF508 CFTR fluorescence by flow cytometry was performed using Coulter® Epics® XL-MCL Flow Cytometer and EXPO v.2 cytometer software. Cells were typically incubated with 5 mm butyrate overnight to increase GFP-ΔF508 CFTR expression or with 10 μg/ml N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal for 3 h to increase GFPu steady-state level. After the addition of emetine with or without protease inhibitors, cultures were incubated for different time intervals before analysis. Data from 10,000 cells were collected, and the mean fluorescence of the cell population was used as a measure of GFP-ΔF508 levels after each treatment. CHO cl.2 cells expressing GFP-ΔF508 and HEK293 cells expressing GFPu were ATP-depleted by incubating the cells in glucose-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Invitrogen) containing the metabolic inhibitors cyanide (5 mm) and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (5 mm) as described previously (21.Wang Y.H. Li F. Schwartz J.H. Flint P.J. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1667-C1675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure reduces ATP content below 10% of the baseline value within 10 min and sustains this low level of ATP content (22.Wang Y.H. Borkan S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F1057-F1065PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this determination, the initial fluorescence measurement in ATP-depleted cells (t = 0 h) was taken at 10 min after exposure of cells to metabolic inhibitors. To validate the use of GFP-ΔF508 as a model of ΔF508 degradation, we performed pulse-chase analysis in a clonal CHO cell line (cl.2) stably expressing this fusion protein. cl.2 cells were selected for low basal expression levels to avoid accumulation of GFP-ΔF508 in detergent-insoluble aggresomes, which are highly refractory to degradation (23.Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Before use, the cells were treated with the transcriptional activator sodium butyrate to increase GFP-ΔF508 expression. Under these conditions, aggregation of GFP-ΔF508 was undetectable by either immunoblot or fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cell lysates with anti-GFP antibody revealed a major Mr ∼170,000 band corresponding to core-glycosylated GFP-ΔF508 and high molecular weight (HMW) species migrating near the top of the gel (Fig. 1A). During the chase, the Mr 170,000 band disappeared with first-order kinetics (t½ = 50 min), consistent with previous determinations of ΔF508 (9.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L.

Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar), the half-life of this species was only modestly extended (t½ = 1.5 h) (Fig. 1B, top left panel). A minor band migrating at Mr∼50,000 probably corresponds to an amino-terminal fragment of the GFP-Δ508 fusion protein comprising Mr∼20,000 of CFTR in addition to the GFP moiety because it reacted with antibody to GFP, but not with an antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of CFTR (data not shown). Disappearance of the Mr 50,000 fragment paralleled that of the Mr 170,000 band (t½ = 1.1 h) and was also only modestly inhibited by MG132 (t½ = 1.5 h) (Fig. 1B, bottom left panel). HMW forms of GFP-ΔF508 were detected immediately after the pulse (top band in Fig. 1A). These complexes disappeared rapidly when the chase was conducted in the absence of proteasome inhibitor (t½ = 0.9 h), but in contrast to the core-glycosylated protein and the Mr 50,000 fragment, they were strongly stabilized by the presence of MG132 (t½ = 6.6 h) (Fig. 1B, top right panel). The HMW complexes could represent either polyubiquitylated forms of monomeric GFP-ΔF508 (16.Sato S. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17.Xiong X. Chong E. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2616-2624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or detergent-insoluble aggregates of CFTR (23.Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we sought to determine whether the HMW material that accumulated during the chase in the presence of MG132 could be degraded after washout of the inhibitor. Our results (data not shown) indicate that the HMW material was soluble in nonionic detergent and competent for degradation, strongly suggesting that the increase in molecular weight was due to covalent modification with Ub, as observed previously for CFTR in cell-free extracts (17.Xiong X. Chong E. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2616-2624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Quantification of the pulse-chase data indicates that MG132 was only marginally effective at stabilizing the Mr170,000 ΔF508 band. Even when the total amount of GFP-immunoreactive material is considered (the sum of all electrophoretic species, Fig. 1B, bottom right panel), only 40% of the initial amount of GFP-ΔF508 was stable at the end of a 4-h chase, despite proteasome inhibition. This observation suggests several plausible explanations. First, as suggested by Jensen et al. (9.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), in addition to proteasomes, other proteolytic systems could also contribute to ΔF508 ERAD. Alternatively, it is possible that some proteolytic activities within the proteasome remain uninhibited in the presence of MG132 and continue to degrade the substrate. Finally, immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled material from detergent extracts of pulse-labeled cells may underestimate the amount of stable ΔF508 if some of the protein becomes insoluble, if the epitope used for immunoprecipitation becomes inaccessible, or if the increased molecular weight (due to polyubiquitylation and/or aggregation) of the protein prevents it from being well resolved by SDS-PAGE. We reasoned that a noninvasive method of monitoring the fluorescence of GFP-ΔF508 in intact cells using fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis may be a more accurate way to measure protein stability because it does not rely upon efficient recovery of radiolabeled protein from cells or upon the detection of a resolvable electrophoretic species. This would in turn allow us to better evaluate the effect of protease inhibitors on prevention of CFTR degradation. To circumvent the limitations of the pulse-chase approach, we developed a fluorescence-based assay to measure degradation of GFP-ΔF508. Inhibition of GFP-ΔF508 synthesis in butyrate-treated cells with emetine, an inhibitor of translational elongation, caused a rapid decrease in mean fluorescence, as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with other translation inhibitors including cycloheximide and puromycin (data not shown). Emetine does not affect the degradation kinetics of CFTR or ΔF508 (13.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The decrease in GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence fitted a first-order exponential with a t½ = 60 min, in good agreement with the GFP-ΔF508 half-life measured in pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 2). In a control experiment, CHO cells expressing GFP alone were incubated with emetine for up to 10 h without any loss of total fluorescence (data not shown), consistent with GFP being a stable protein (20.Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar) and indicating that emetine treatment does not cause detectable cell lysis during the course of the experiment. Together, these results suggest that the decline in the fluorescence of cl.2 cells upon exposure to protein synthesis inhibitor faithfully reflects the degradation of ΔF508 and constitutes a valid and convenient method for characterization of this degradation process. To assess the effect of inhibition of different proteolytic systems on the degradation of mutant CFTR using the fluorescence assay, we evaluated the effect of a panel of protease inhibitors on the decline in GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence in butyrate-treated cl.2 cells in the presence of emetine (Fig. 3A). Among the inhibitors tested, only those that are known to inhibit the proteasome (N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, and MG132) significantly slowed the degradation of GFP-ΔF508. In contrast, inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteases (TPCK, Nα-tosyl-Lys-chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), calpains (EDTA), lysosomal cathepsins ((2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester, chloroquine, and NH4Cl), and autophagy (3-methyladenine and wortmannin) had no measurable effect on the degradation process, either alone (Fig. 3A) or in combination with MG132 (25 μm) (data not shown). These data confirm a central role for proteasomes in the degradation of ΔF508 and suggest that other major proteolytic systems do not contribute significantly to this process. In the presence of MG132 (25 μm), the fluorescence of GFP-ΔF508 first increased, reaching almost 120% of the initial fluorescence after 1 h of emetine chase (Fig. 3B). This increase probably reflects slow fluorogenesis of the GFP moiety (t½ = 30–90 min; 27.Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 28.Waldo G.S. Standish B.M. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) in the absence of CFTR degradation. Indeed, this transient increase in fluorescence is also observed with GFPu, a GFP molecule that is targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome system for degradation via a short carboxyl-terminal degron (20.Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). However, in contrast to GFPu, which was completely stabilized by 25 μm MG132, the fluorescence of GFP-ΔF508 started to decline after the first hour and dropped to about 70% of initial fluorescence after 4 h of emetine chase. The half-time of the decline of GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence in the presence of MG132 (25 μm) was 6.8 h, indicating that proteasome inhibition results in substantial stabilization of GFP-ΔF508. To determine whether the continued decline in GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence in the presence of MG132 was due to degradation by the proteasome, we examined the effect of increased inhibitor concentration on the fluorescence remaining at the 4 h chase point (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that GFP-ΔF508 degradation is inhibited by MG132 biphasically with a high-affinity component (IC50 ≤ 10 μm) and a low-affinity component that we were not able to saturate, even at concentrations as high as 300 μm. To further investigate the role of proteasomes in GFP-ΔF508 degradation, we performed a titration of epoxomicin, a highly specific and potent proteasome inhibitor (29.Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Like MG132, epoxomicin inhibited GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence decay biphasically with a high-affinity component (IC50 < 1 μm) and a low-affinity component (Fig. 4B). Although epoxomicin can inhibit all three of the characterized activities of the proteasomes, it is 66- and 500- fold more effective at inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity than the trypsin-like or peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activities, respectively (30.Myung J. Kim K.B. Lindsten K. Dantuma N.P. Crews C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 411-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the low-affinity component of the MG132 and epoxomicin titrations was due to non-CT-L activities, we performed a titration of epoxomicin in the presence of 500 μm YU102, an α′,β′-epoxyketone inhibitor that is selective for the peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activity of the proteasome (30.Myung J. Kim K.B. Lindsten K. Dantuma N.P. Crews C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 411-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in a small (10–15%) but significant increase in the degree of inhibition of GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence decay at all epoxomicin concentrations (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that the CT-L and peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing activities of the proteasome may contribute independently to the degradation of GFP-ΔF508. A hallmark of proteolysis by the Ub-proteasome system is its dependence on ATP hydrolysis. ATP is required for at least two steps in Ub-dependent degradation: activation of Ub, and substrate unfolding (31.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 32.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). However, previous studies suggested that the fraction of CFTR degradation that is insensitive to proteasome inhibitors is independent of ATP (9.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). To assess the dependence of GFP-ΔF508 degradation on ATP, we assayed GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence in ATP-depleted cl.2 cells (Fig. 5A). These data demonstrate that GFP-ΔF508 degradation is absolutely dependent on the presence of cellular ATP. The degradation of GFPu was similarly dependent upon ATP (Fig. 5B). ER-associated degradation is a central element of the quality control pathways that ensure that only correctly folded and assembled proteins are deployed in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. Although many studies have confirmed a primary role of the Ub-proteasome system in ERAD, the apparently minimal effect of highly potent proteasome inhibitors on the degradation of CFTR has remained an enigma and has suggested that other ATP-independent proteolytic systems also contribute to ERAD. In this study, we have used a fluorescent substrate to re-evaluate the role of the UPS in ERAD. Our data establish the primacy of the UPS in the degradation of ER-associated misfolded CFTR and suggest that the different proteolytic functionalities of the proteasome, associated with the three active β-subunits, may operate independently in the degradation of an ERAD substrate (GFP-ΔF508), but apparently not in the degradation of a cytoplasmic substrate (GFPu). Three lines of evidence support our conclusion that the UPS is the principal pathway for degradation of misfolded CFTR. First, proteasome inhibitors, but not inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteases or inhibitors of lysosomal or autophagic pathways, strongly stabilize GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence. Second, GFP-ΔF508 degradation was inhibited by MG132 and epoxomicin in a dose-dependent fashion, with biphasic apparent IC50 values in the expected range for CT-L and non-CT-L activities (30.Myung J. Kim K.B. Lindsten K. Dantuma N.P. Crews C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 411-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Third, GFP-ΔF508 degradation was strictly dependent on ATP, a hallmark of UPS-mediated proteolysis (31.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 32.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The possibility that other proteases initiate the clipping of the CFTR molecule while it is situated in the ER membrane, followed by proteasome-mediated proteolysis, is also unlikely because simultaneous addition of protease and proteasome inhibitors did not protect CFTR from degradation. Although our results do not rule out participation in CFTR degradation of protease classes for which cell-permeable inhibitors are not available (i.e. aspartic proteases, aminopeptidases, and so forth) or of substrate-specific proteases (e.g. colligin is a specific inhibitor of procollagen degradation (33.Jain N. Brickenden A. Ball E.H. Sanwal B.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 314: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), these data establish that inhibition of proteolytic activities of the proteasome alone is sufficient to prevent the degradation of the majority of ΔF508 molecules in living cells. In previous studies using metabolic pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation, proteasome inhibitors including MG132 and lactacystin had a very modest effect at inhibiting the decay of the electrophoretic species corresponding to core-glycosylated ΔF508 degradation (9.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 13.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that at least part of radiolabel lost from core-glycosylated GFP-ΔF508 could be recovered as high molecular weight material. Because this HMW material remains competent for degradation, our data suggest that in the absence of proteasome function, a significant fraction of radiolabeled GFP-ΔF508 molecules are converted to multiubiquitylated forms. Accumulation of HMW forms in the presence of proteasome inhibition is not observed for most other ERAD substrates such as the α-subunit of the T-cell receptor (7.Yu H. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36852-36858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34.Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and soluble proteins such as IgG light chains (8.O'Hare T. Wiens G.D. Whitcomb E.A. Enns C.A. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 11-14PubMed Google Scholar), which tend to accumulate as core-glycosylated detergent-soluble monomers in the ER after proteasome inhibition. It is likely that this difference is a consequence of the topology of CFTR, in which most of the mass of the protein is accessible to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and hence to components of the ubiquitin conjugation system. A recent study reported that inhibition of proteasome function leads to accumulation of a substantial fraction of CFTR in reconstituted cell-free extracts as high molecular weight multiubiquitylated protein (17.Xiong X. Chong E. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2616-2624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In our studies, no proteasome inhibitor or combination thereof was able to completely suppress the decay of GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence. It is unlikely that this apparent degradation (a ∼20–30% decrease of fluorescence after a 4-h chase in the presence of proteasome inhibitors) is the result of cell death due to toxic effects of simultaneous exposure to emetine and proteasome inhibitor because >98% of cells were able to exclude propidium iodide staining at the end of a 4-h chase. Alternatively, the decrease in GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence could, in principle, be due to self-quenching of GFP fluorescence in closely packed aggregates of GFP-ΔF508, which are known to form upon chronic exposure to proteasome inhibitors (23.Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Such self-quenching is a form of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fluorescence resonance energy transfer homotransfer). Because we do not observe heterotransfer between the compatible fluorescence resonance energy transfer heterotransfer pair CFP-ΔF508 and YFP-ΔF508, even under conditions designed to maximize aggregation, 2R. Rajan and R. R. Kopito, unpublished data. it is unlikely that homotransfer between adjacent GFP-ΔF508 molecules could account for the observed decrease in fluorescence. It is also formally possible that the small decrease in GFP-ΔF508 fluorescence could be due to partial unfolding of the GFP moiety by the ATPase activity of the 19 S proteasome cap, without actual degradation of CFTR itself. However, the simplest explanation may be that none of the proteasome inhibitors used, alone or in combination, are able to fully inhibit all of the three proteasomal β-subunits. This explanation is consistent with conversion of a similar fraction (∼30%) of labeled GFP-ΔF508 as high molecular weight multiubiquitin conjugates in the presence of MG132 in both our pulse-labeling experiments (Fig. 1) and in the cell-free experiments of Oberdorf et al. (18.Oberdorf J. Carlson E.J. Skach W.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13397-13405Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that the proteolytic activities of the proteasome associated with individual β-subunits do not act in a strictly cooperative fashion in ERAD. Our findings with GFP-ΔF508 in vivo are consistent with those of Oberdorf et al. (18.Oberdorf J. Carlson E.J. Skach W.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13397-13405Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), who found that complete inhibition of the β5-subunit (associated with CT-L activity) led to only a 40% reduction in cell-free CFTR degradation, and with those of Myung et al. (30.Myung J. Kim K.B. Lindsten K. Dantuma N.P. Crews C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 411-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), who reported recently that selective peptidyl-glutamyl hydrolyzing inhibition is insufficient to inhibit protein degradation in vivo. These data all strongly indicate that the catalytic sites of the proteasome function independently. It is not clear why, in our studies, the degradation of GFPu, a small soluble substrate of the UPS, is completely inhibited by MG132, whereas degradation of GFP-ΔF508 is not. Perhaps this discrepancy is a reflection of functional differences in the mechanisms by which proteasomes engage substrates delivered from the cytosol and those that are dislocated across the ER membrane. We thank Neil Bence for providing HEK293 cells expressing GFPu and Karim Helmy for help with epoxomicin and ATP depletion experiments. We are grateful to Dr. Craig Crews for a kind gift of YU102. We also thank members of the Kopito laboratory for helpful comments."

In the present study, the central subdomain (PILB-MsrA), the C terminus subdomain (PILB-MsrB), and the fused subdomain (PILB-MsrA/MsrB) of N. meningitidis were produced as folded entities. The central subdomain shows a methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) activity, whereas PILB-MsrB displays a methionine sulfoxide reductase B (MsrB) activity. The catalytic mechanism of PILB-MsrB can be divided into two steps: 1) an attack of the Cys-494 on the sulfur atom of the sulfoxide substrate, leading to formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate and release of 1 mol of methionine/mol of enzyme and 2) a regeneration of Cys-494 via formation of an intradisulfide bond with Cys-439 followed by reduction with thioredoxin. The study also shows that 1) MsrA and MsrB display opposite stereoselectivities toward the sulfoxide function; 2) the active sites of both Msrs, particularly MsrB, are rather adapted for binding protein-bound MetSO more efficiently than free MetSO; 3) the carbon Cα is not a determining factor for efficient binding to both Msrs; and 4) the presence of the sulfoxide function is a prerequisite for binding to Msrs. The fact that the two Msrs exhibit opposite stereoselectivities argues for a structure of the active site of MsrBs different from that of MsrAs. This is further supported by the absence of sequence homology between the two Msrs in particular around the cysteine that is involved in formation of the sulfenic acid derivative. The fact that the catalytic mechanism takes place through formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate for both Msrs supports the idea that sulfenic acid chemistry is a general feature in the reduction of sulfoxides by thiols.

In particular, a sulfenic acid intermediate has been shown to be formed on Cys-51 of E. coli MsrA during the reduction of the sulfoxide function of methionine sulfoxide (MetSO). The active site can be represented as an open basin in which Cys-51, located at the N terminus of an α-helix, is accessible. Compared with the E. coli MsrA, the MsrAs from S. pneumoniae and from N. meningitidis or N. gonorrhoeae (called PILB) contain, in addition, an extension at the C terminus and at the C and N termini, respectively. This raised the question of the role of these extensions, in particular of the C-terminal extension. Sequence comparisons of the C-extension of PILB show amino acid identities with open reading frames of which no function has been assigned until recently. These sequences are detected in all kingdoms. Recently, the functions of the E. coli ortholog YeaA and an open reading frame downstream from the msrA gene from Staphylococcus aureus, which both have at least 50% amino acid identities with the C-subdomain of PILB, has been determined and shown to display a new Msr activity, called MsrB (8.Grimaud R.

Inspection of the amino acid sequences shows that two Cys are often conserved in putative MsrBs (see Fig. 1). One Cys, Cys-439, which is located in a CGWP(S/A)F motif is at least 50% conserved. The second one, Cys-494, which is included in an RYC(I/V/M)N motif is almost conserved. In the present study, we show that in addition to an MsrA activity that is displayed by the central subdomain, called PILB-MsrA, the C terminus of PILB, called PILB-MsrB, possesses a thioredoxin-dependent MsrB activity. The catalytic mechanism of PILB-MsrB is shown to proceed via the sulfenic acid chemistry. The role of Cys-439 and Cys-494 has been demonstrated. The stereoselectivity in the reduction of the sulfoxide function and the catalytic parameters of the two subdomains have also been determined. The results are in favor of a structure of the active site of MsrBs different from that of the MsrAs. Plasmids pSKPILBMsrA, pSKPILBMsrB, and pSKPILBMsrAMsrB, designed for PILB-MsrA, PILB-MsrB, and PILB-MsrA/MsrB production, respectively, were obtained by cloning internal fragments of the PILB open reading frame synthesized by PCR (sequences of oligonucleotides not shown) using N. meningitidis Z2491 genomic DNA, kindly provided by Dr. M. K. Taha, into the plasmid pDB125KSNN 2S. Marchal, personal communication. between the NdeI and SacI sites. Site-directed mutageneses were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The E. coli strain used for all Msr productions was HB101 (supE44, hsdS20 (r −, m −), recA13, ara-14, proA2, lacY1, galK2, rpsL20, xyl-5, mtl-1) transformed with the plasmidic construction containing the coding sequence under the lac promoter. For PILB-Msrs purification, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing 20 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) and sonicated. The Msrs were then precipitated at 40, 50, and 60% ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) saturation for PILB-MsrA/MsrB, PILB-MsrA, and PILB-MsrB, respectively. The contaminating proteins were removed by applying the enzymatic solutions onto exclusion size chromatography on ACA 54 resin at pH 8 (buffer A). Purified fractions were then pooled and applied onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A, followed by a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.4 m) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The PILB-MsrA/MsrB was eluted at 100 mm KCl, whereas the PILB-MsrA and PILB-MsrB passed through. PILB-MsrA and PILB-MsrB were further purified on phenyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A, containing 1m (NH4)2SO4. PILB-Msrs were eluted with a linear gradient from 1 to 0 m in buffer A. At this stage, wild-type PILB-MsrA/MsrB and wild-type and mutant PILB-MsrAs and PILB-MsrBs were pure as checked by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining and by electrospray mass spectrometry analyses. Purified enzymes were stored at −20 °C in the presence of 50 mm DTT and 60% (NH4)2SO4. Under these conditions, the enzymes were stable for several weeks. Their molecular concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, using theoretical extinction coefficients at 280 nm deduced from the method of Scopes (11.Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) (i.e. 26,200m−1·cm−1 for wild-type and mutant PILB-MsrAs, 17,330m−1·cm−1 for wild-type and mutant PILB-MsrBs, and 42,300m−1·cm−1 for wild-type PILB-MsrA/ MsrB. Thel-Met-S-SO and d-Met-R-SO enantiomers were prepared according to Holland et al. (12.Holland H.L. Andreana P.R. Brown F.M. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry. 1999; 10: 1833-1843Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar).l- and d-methionine were treated with phthalic (Pht) anhydride using the method of Bose (13.Bose A.K. Org. Synthesis. 1960; 40: 82-85Crossref Google Scholar) to give Pht-l-Met-OH and Pht-d-Met-OH in 90–95% yields, respectively. Oxidation of Pht-l-Met-OH and Pht-d-Met-OH was carried out in methanol with H2O2 and afforded the sulfoxide in a nearly equimolar (S/R)-composition as revealed by the split CεH3 proton singlet in CDCl3/Me2SO-d64:1 (2.487 ppm for the heterochiral and 2.483 ppm for the homochiral diastereomers). Both Pht-l-Met-S-SO and Pht-d-Met-R-SO enantiomers were obtained by crystallization from methanol. The absolute configuration of the isomer R was confirmed by x-ray diffraction on single crystals. 3C. Didierjean, unpublished results. The phthalic protecting group was eliminated with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol, and the l-Met-S-SO and d-Met-R-SO enantiomers were recovered by precipitation from water with acetone. On the other hand, it was not possible by crystallization to obtain Pht-l-Met-R-SO and Pht-d-Met-S-SO enantiomers in a pure form. In both cases, the resulting sulfoxides were found to contain about 25% of the other isomer. Therefore, l-Met-R-SO and d-Met-S-SO were isolated from thel-Met-R,S-SO and d-Met-R,S-SO diastereomers by consuming the other isomer by enzymatic reduction with PILB-MsrA and PILB-MsrB, respectively. The experimental conditions were 100 mm DTT, 500 μm Msr, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8, and the reaction mixtures were incubated overnight at 25 °C. Each MetSO isomer was then separated from Met on a 25-cm sephasil C18 reverse phase column on an ÄKTA explorer system (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with H2O/trifluoroacetic acid 0.1% buffer in the presence of 10% acetonitrile. Met was eluted isocratically after MetSO. The fractions corresponding to each sulfoxide isomer were pooled and concentrated in order to eliminate acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid. l-Met-R, S-SO-NHMe and Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe were classically prepared (14.Bodanszky M. Bodanszky A. The Practice of Peptide Synthesis. Springer-Verlag, New York1984: 103-112Google Scholar) from N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-l-Met-OH via the mixed anhydride with Me2CHCH2OCOCl/NEt(CHMe2)2 and MeNH2. Treatment of the resulting N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-l-Met-NHMe with 3 n HCl in EtOAc gave l-Met-NHMe, which was acetylated with AcCl/CHMe2 into Ac-l-Met-NHMe. Oxidation of l-Met-NHMe and Ac-l-Met-NHMe with H2O2 in methanol (12.Holland H.L. Andreana P.R. Brown F.M. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry. 1999; 10: 1833-1843Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) resulted in l-Met-R, S-SO-NHMe and Ac-l-Met-R, S-SO-NHMe. Ac-l-Met-R, S-SO was purchased from Bachem. Cysteine content was determined using DTNB under nondenaturing (buffer A) and denaturing conditions (final concentration of 1% SDS in buffer A), either in the absence or in the presence of 150 mmdl-Met-R,S-SO without the addition of any exogenous reducing system as previously described by Boschi-Muller et al. (7.Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture also contained 10 mm DTT and 5 μmwild-type PILB-MsrA/MsrB or wild-type or mutant PILB-MsrA or PILB-MsrB in buffer A. Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C by following the appearance of free methionine measured by HPLC. To do so, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at different times of incubation up to 2.5 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. In each aliquot, the quantity of Met formed was measured as previously described by Boschi-Muller et al. (7.Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A.

The ability of wild-type and mutant PILB-MsrAs and PILB-MsrBs and of wild-type PILB-MsrA/MsrB to reduce substrates was assayed in the presence of 1.28 μm E. coli thioredoxin reductase, 0.3 mm NADPH, and various concentrations of E. coli thioredoxin in buffer A. Thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase from E. coli were prepared following experimental procedures already published (15.Mössner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,16.Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a Kontron Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer by following the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm. The initial rate data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten relationship using least squares analysis to determine kcat and Km. All Km values were determined at saturating concentrations of the other substrate. The reaction mixture, containing 150 mmdl-Met-R, S-SO and a 100–500 μm concentration of wild-type or mutant PILB-MsrA or PILB-MsrB or wild-type PILB-MsrA/MsrB, was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in buffer A. Then the Met formed was quantified as previously described by Boschi-Muller et al. (7.Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Talfournier F. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35908-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The sulfenic acid intermediate was characterized spectrophotometrically by using thionitrobenzoate (TNB−) under nondenaturing conditions and by mass spectrometry analyses after modification (or no modification) with 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (dimedone). For spectrophotometric characterization, TNB− was prepared by reducing the corresponding disulfide using the procedure of Silver (17.Silver M. Methods Snzymol. 1979; 62: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Progress curves of TNB− disappearance for wild-type and mutant PILB-MsrAs and PILB-MsrBs were recorded at 412 nm in buffer A. Enzyme concentrations were 7.35 and 14.7 μm, and the TNB− concentration was 60 μm. The amount of TNB− consumed was calculated using an extinction coefficient at 412 nm of 13,600m−1·cm−1. For spectrometric characterization, analyses were performed for wild-type and mutant PILB-MsrAs and PILB-MsrBs, either after modification or not byd,l-Met-R,S-SO and dimedone. All of the modification reactions were performed in buffer A in the presence of 20 μm enzyme.d,l-Met-R,S-SO was added at a concentration of 150 mm, and the mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 °C. Then dimedone at a concentration of 20 mmwas added, and the mixture was incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature. Mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a LCT electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). For mass analysis in denaturing conditions, Msr samples were diluted to 10 μm in a 1:1 water/acetonitrile mixture (v/v) containing 1% formic acid. Samples were continuously infused into the ion source at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode in the mass range 400–4000m/z, after calibration of the instrument with a solution of horse heart myoglobin (Sigma) diluted to 2 μmin the 1:1 water/acetonitrile (1% formic acid) mixture. PILB contains 522 amino acids and is composed of three subdomains. The N-subdomain is suggested to encode a disulfide oxidoreductase. The central subdomain is an ortholog to E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae MsrAs, whereas the C-subdomain displays high sequence similarities to E. coli and S. aureus MsrBs (Fig. 1). Sequence comparisons show that at least two MsrAs from S. pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis (Pedant code gi_14972133 and gi_2634588) and one recently produced by truncation of the N terminus of E. coli MsrA (18.Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have an N terminus starting from the position corresponding to amino acid 196 of PILB. All three MsrAs were shown to be active (1.Wizemann T.M. Moskovitz J. Pearce B.J. Cundell D. Arvidson C.G. So M. Weissbach H. Brot N. Masure H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7985-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18.Boschi-Muller S. Azza S. Branlant G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19.Hayes C.S. Illades-Aguiar B. Casillas-Martinez L. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2694-2700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, truncation was done after position 194 of PILB. The PILB-MsrA/MsrB protein (amino acids 195–521) was produced in a soluble form. Two plasmidic constructs were used to produce soluble MsrA and MsrB subdomains. In the first construct, the truncation was done after position 388 of PILB which corresponds to the N terminus of putative MsrB from Klebsiella pneumoniae(Pedant code b_kpn.contig523 orf8). In this case, the PILB-MsrA (amino acids 195–388) was produced in a soluble form, whereas the truncated form corresponding to the MsrB subdomain (amino acids 390–521) was not soluble. Thus, to obtain a soluble form of the MsrB subdomain, another construct was used, where truncation was done after position 375 of PILB, which corresponds to the N terminus of the putative Sinorhizobium meliloti MsrB (NCBI accession numberAE007290.1) and of the E. coli MsrB (8.Grimaud R. Ezraty B. Mitchell J.K. Lafitte D. Briand C. Derrick P.J. Barras F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48915-48920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In this case, PILB-MsrB was produced in a soluble form (amino acids 376–521). Such a result suggests that both Msrs fold independently within PILB. This is also consistent with the fact that the two genes are often located at different positions on chromosomal DNAs. Truncated PILB variants and their mutants were overexpressed in an E. coli strain using the corresponding DNA sequences under the lac promoter. All forms of PILB variants were obtained pure as judged by SDS-PAGE gels and mass spectrometry analyses. DTNB reagent revealed four Cys for PILB-MsrA/MsrB and two Cys for both PILB-MsrA and PILB-MsrB under denaturating conditions (Table I). These results are in agreement with the PILB DNA sequence that indicates four Cys at positions 206 and 348 in PILB-MsrA and at positions 439 and 494 in PILB-MsrB. Under native conditions, all of the Cys were also reactive regardless of the subdomains. This shows that 1) both Cys of the MsrA subdomain are easily accessible, similar to what is described for E. coli MsrA; 2) both Cys of the MsrB subdomain are also accessible; and 3) the accessibility in PILB-MsrA/MsrB of each couple of Cys within each domain is not significantly altered by the presence of the second subdomain. This again supports an independent folding of each subdomain.Table IFree sulfhydryl content of wild-type and Cys to Ser mutants of N. meningitidis PILB-MsrA and PILB-MsrB and PILB-MsrA/MsrB wild typeEnzymeNo. of CysNo. of Cys measuredWithout dl-Met-R, S-SOWithdl-Met- R, S-SODecrease in free thiolsaThe difference in the number of free cysteine thiols upon treatment withdl-Met-R, S-SO versus no treatment.CalculatedTheoreticalmol Cys/mol enzymePILB-MsrA21.90.11.82C206S PILB-MsrA11.01.000C348S PILB-MsrA10.900.91PILB-MsrB22.00.11.92C439S PILB-MsrB11.00.10.91C494S PILB-MsrB11.01.000PILB-MsrA/MsrB44.00.43.64The values indicated represent the average of two independent measurements of at least two enzyme concentrations (S.D. range 10%).

Data presented in the table are those obtained under nondenaturing conditions. Data obtained under denaturing conditions are identical but are not presented for reasons of clarity of the table. Stoichiometry of methionine formation was determined in the absence of reductant (Table II). One mol of methionine was formed with a loss of two thiols, which is in agreement with formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-206 and Cys-348. One mol of methionine was also formed with mutant C348S with a loss of one thiol, whereas no methionine was formed with mutant C206S. In the presence of thioredoxin, a recycling activity was observed with PILB-MsrA wild type but not with the mutants (Table II). Together, these results are in agreement with formation of a sulfenic acid on Cys-206 and regeneration of Cys-206 via formation of an internal disulfide bond with Cys-348 followed by its reduction by thioredoxin. This is a situation similar to that described for E. coli MsrA except that the Cys-206–Cys-348 bond (equivalent to the Cys-51–Cys-198 bond in E. coli MsrA) is reducible by thioredoxin in PILB-MsrA, whereas only the Cys-198–Cys-206 bond is reducible in E. coli MsrA. Such a difference remains to be explained. Further evidence of the formation of a sulfenic acid comes from the use of TNB− and dimedone, which are specific reagents for sulfenic acid. In the case of mutant C348S, in which no disulfide bond can be formed, a decrease of the absorbance at 410 nm by 1 eq of TNB−/mol was observed when the mutant was first incubated with MetSO and then treated with an excess of TNB− (Table III). Incubation of mutant C348S with MetSO and a subsequent addition of dimedone led to an increased mass of 138 Da. This increase is that expected if a covalent adduct is formed with dimedone.Table IIStoichiometry of Met formed in the absence of regenerating system and enzymatic activity with DTT or thioredoxin as reductantEnzymeStoichiometryActivity with DTTActivity with thioredoxinmol Met formed/mol enzymeμmol Met formed/min/μmol enzymeμmol Met formed/min/μmol enzymePILB-MsrA0.93220C206S PILB-MsrA0NANAC348S PILB-MsrA0.937NAPILB-MsrB1.0312C439S PILB-MsrB1.036NAC494S PILB-MsrB0NANAPILB-MsrA/MsrB1.84.2170The values indicated represent the average of three independent measurements of at least two enzyme concentrations (S.D. range 10%).

Chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation are the classic nuclear features but remain poorly characterized. It is highly probable that nucleosomal structure must be altered to allow these features to become apparent, but data to support this construct are lacking. We report here that in response to apoptotic signals from a death receptor (CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-α) or mitochondrial (staurosporine) apoptotic stimulus, the core nucleosomal histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 become separated from DNA during apoptosis in Jurkat and HeLa cells and are consequently detectable in the cell lysate prepared using a non-ionic detergent. The timing of this histone release from DNA correlates well with the progression of apoptosis. We also show expression of a caspase cleavage-resistant form of ICAD (ICAD-DM) in Jurkat and HeLa cells abolished DNA fragmentation and also dramatically reduced histone release in apoptotic cells. However, we demonstrate that apoptotic histone release is not an inevitable consequence of CAD/DFF-40-mediated DNA destruction as DNA fragmentation but not histone release occurs efficiently in tumor necrosis factor-α- and etoposide-treated NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, in an in vitro apoptotic assay, incubation of apoptotic Jurkat cellular extract with non-apoptotic Jurkat nuclei led to nuclear DNA fragmentation without obvious histone release. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CAD/DFF-40 functions indirectly in mediating nucleosomal destruction during apoptosis.

The change from life to death is the single most momentous event for any living thing, from single cells upwards. Consequently, it is not surprising that dramatic biochemical and morphological changes occur in apoptotic cells, both outside and inside of the nucleus. In the nucleus, the classic apoptotic features are chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. With few exceptions, apoptotic cell death is executed by a group of cysteine proteases called caspases. By cleavage of key cellular protein substrates, caspase activity ultimately induces the typical apoptotic features, such as membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation.

Proteolytic processing of two sites on ICAD/DFF-45 by caspase-7 and caspase-3 in vivo results in the release of ICAD/DFF-45 from the CAD/DFF-40 subunit (9.Tang D. Kidd V.J. J. Biol.

Wagner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6051-6055Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which cleaves chromatin DNA into typical apoptotic fragments. In addition to acting as an inhibitory subunit, ICAD/DFF-45 also functions in stabilization of the CAD/DFF-40 subunit, and CAD/DFF-40 has been shown to be unstable in its absence (11.Zhou P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence indicates that CAD/DFF-40 is the major apoptotic nuclease (6.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 13.Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In support of this construct, in vitro depletion of CAD activity abolished DNA fragmentation (3.Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2001; 412: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas expression of ICAD/DFF-45 or a non-cleavable form of ICAD (ICAD-DM) prevented DNA fragmentation in apoptotic Jurkat and HeLa cells (4.Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 6.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Conversely, reintroduction of caspase-3 into caspase-3 mutant MCF-7 cells activated CAD/DFF-40 and led to DNA fragmentation in apoptotic MCF-7 cells (14.Tang D. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9303-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Finally, inactivation of ICAD/DFF-45 by gene targeting in transgenic mice significantly, if not completely, inhibited DNA fragmentation in mouse thymocytes (15.Zhang J. Liu X.

Nature. 2001; 412: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Histone modification can influence chromatin structures to facilitate transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair (16.Green G.R. Biochem.

It has been reported that CAD/DFF-40 activity prefers chromosomal DNA as the substrate because the presence of histones increases CAD/DFF-40 activity severalfold (12.Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,20.Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J.

In this regard, it has been postulated that apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation might also be a consequence of histone modification. Phosphorylations of histone H2A, H2B, and H3 and also dephosphorylation of histone H1 have been observed under some circumstances in apoptosis (21.Ajiro K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22.Rogakou E.P. Nieves-Neira W. Boon C. Pommier Y. Bonner W.M. J. Biol.

However, how histone phosphorylation, essential for mitotic chromatin condensation, might function in promoting apoptotic chromatin conformations and DNA fragmentation is unclear. On the other hand, it has been suggested recently that apoptotic chromatin changes might be completely different from mitotic changes (25.Hendzel M.J. Nishioka W.K. Raymond Y. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24470-24478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and mitotic-style histone modifications may have no role in apoptotic chromatin changes. In this study, we have found that core nucleosomal histones separate from chromatin in apoptotic cells, but that this is not simply a by-product of DNA fragmentation. This event is indirectly related to CAD/DFF-40 in the sense that CAD/DFF-40 is required but is insufficient for the apoptotic histone release. HeLa, MCF-7, WEHI-3, and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. WEHI-3 cell cultures were supplemented with 2 mmglutamine and 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The retroviral packaging line was AmphoPack-293 (CLONTECH). ICAD and ICAD-DM were kindly provided by Dr. Shigekazu Nagata (Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan) and subcloned into pBabe retroviral vector. Caspase-3 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using Jurkat RNA and inserted into pBabe, and the DNA sequence was confirmed as described previously (14.Tang D. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9303-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (ZVAD), a pan-caspase inhibitor was from Enzyme System Products. Staurosporine (STS), etoposide (ETOP), and cycloheximide (CHX) were from Sigma, whereas tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) was from Invitrogen. Jurkat cells were treated with an anti-FAS antibody, CH-11 (either 50 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml, Kamiya Biomedical), or with STS at 1 μm for times specified in the relevant figure legends. Apoptotic cell death of HeLa, MCF-7, WEHI-3, and NIH3T3 lines was initiated by 1 μm STS or 100 ng/ml TNFα plus CHX at 10 μg/ml for the times specified in the relevant figure legends. Cells were also treated with ETOP at 10 μm for 26 h to initiate apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP end nick labeling (TUNEL) assay or WST-1 cell viability assay. TUNEL assays were performed using a commercial kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as previously published (26.Tang D. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The WST-1 reagent was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 10 μl of the WST-1 reagent was added to 100 μl of cultured medium in 96-well plates and incubated in a tissue culture incubator for 2 h. Viable cells were then determined by a microplate reader at 450 nm with 630 nm as a reference wavelength. After induction of apoptosis, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin on ice for 20 min. Cell lysate was harvested after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. 50 μg of total cell lysate was separated on a SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated with 5% skim milk (1 h at 37 °C) followed by primary and secondary antibodies (each for 1 h at 37 °C). Signals were developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-caspase-3 (1 μg/ml, Transduction Laboratories), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (1 μg/ml, Upstate Biochemical), anti-FLAG (4 μg/ml, Sigma, M2), anti-actin (0.3 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), polyclonal anti-ICAD (1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz, C-19), and anti-histone H1 (AE-4, Santa Cruz). All other anti-histone antibodies (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. To aid in the process of identification of unknown proteins on Coomassie Blue-stained gels, histones were isolated from nuclei according to a published procedure (27.Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed using the lysate buffer described above. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, extracted with 0.4 n sulfuric acid on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. Histones in the supernatant were precipitated by 20% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min, centrifuged for 10 min, washed once with ice-cold acetone, and dissolved in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm PMSF. Purified histones were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. High titer retrovirus was generated by transfection of a retrovirus packaging line, AmphoPack-293, with pBabe-based constructs as we have described previously (28.Tang D. Okada H. Ruland J. Liu L. Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30461-30466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 AmphoPack-293 cells were seeded 1 day before transfection with 20 μg of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method. The virus-containing medium was harvested every 12 h until 72 h post-transfection. The medium was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. After addition of 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), the medium was used to infect NIH3T3, Jurkat, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells for 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared as described by Liu et al. (29.Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat cells were treated with 1 μm STS for 1 h and then pelleted at 200 × g. Cells were washed twice with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, followed by a single wash with 5 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF), suspended in 1 volume of buffer A, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cells were then lysed with 40 strokes using a B-type pestle in a 2-ml glass Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, the clear cytosolic fraction was carefully harvested without disturbing the nuclear pellet and adjusted to 50 mm NaCl. Aliquots of this were frozen at −80 °C for later use. Nuclei were prepared from normal Jurkat cells. Cells were harvested and suspended in buffer A, followed by swelling on ice for 20 min. Cells were disrupted by gentle homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer. Liberated nuclei were then layered over a cushion of 30% sucrose in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mmKCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 250 mmsucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min and resuspended in nuclei storage buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 250 mmsucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 50% glycerol) at 2 × 108 nuclei/ml. An in vitro apoptotic assay was carried out by incubating different amounts of cell extract with 6 × 105 nuclei for 2 h at 37 °C. Nuclei were then recovered by a low speed centrifugation. Nuclear DNA was subsequently isolated and analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel for DNA fragmentation as we have published previously (28.Tang D. Okada H. Ruland J. Liu L. Stambolic V. Mak T.W. Ingram A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30461-30466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In vitro apoptotic histone release was carried out by analyzing both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions after the in vitro apoptotic assay. Harvested nuclei were lysed in a 1% Triton X-100 lysate buffer. The cytosolic and Triton X-100-soluble nuclear fractions were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue-stained for histone release. Initially, we were interested in the fact that apoptosis is accompanied by dramatic changes in both lipid membranes (such as the loss of membrane asymmetry) and in nucleic acids (such as DNA fragmentation) but not in proteins, although this is consistent with the fact that caspases only selectively proteolyze limited numbers of key proteins. In the course of pursuing this, we treated Jurkat cells with STS at 1 μm for an 8-h time course, and cell lysate prepared in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 was analyzed on Coomassie Blue-stained 15% SDS-PAGE. Surprisingly, four small polypeptides ranging from 10 to 15 kDa molecular mass were specifically stained in apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B). Kinetically, production of these peptides matched well with the progression of STS-induced apoptosis, beginning at 2 h and progressing through to 8 h of treatment, as indicated by caspase-mediated PARP cleavage and by WST-1 assay (Fig. 1, A and C). A broad range caspase inhibitor, ZVAD, at 50 μm inhibited caspase activity (Fig. 1A) and apoptosis (Fig. 1C) as well as preventing the production of Coomassie Blue-stained apoptotic proteins (Fig. 1B), confirming that generation of these polypeptides is apoptosis-specific and requires caspase activity. Similar results were observed in a death receptor-initiated apoptosis (Fig. 2). An anti-FAS antibody, CH-11, at 50 ng/ml for 6 h induced caspase-3 activation, apoptosis, and appearance of the four apoptotic proteins (Fig. 2B), which were again prevented in the presence of ZVAD (Fig. 2B). Besides STS, other mitochondrial apoptotic stimuli, like CHX (data not shown) and ETOP (Fig. 3B) were also able to induce the appearance of these apoptotic proteins in Jurkat cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that appearance of these proteins might be a general feature of apoptosis, at least in Jurkat cells.Figure 2Appearance of four small apoptotic proteins in FAS signal-triggered apoptotic Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells (1.5 × 105) were incubated with ZVAD at 50 μm as indicated for 30 min prior to addition of an anti-FAS antibody, CH-11, at 50 ng/ml for 6 h. Cell lysate was prepared as described in the Fig. 1 legend. Caspase-3 activation (A) and the generation of the four apoptotic proteins (B) were determined by Western blot and Coomassie Blue staining, respectively. Cell viability was also determined by WST-1 assay as described (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Identification of the four apoptotic proteins as histones. The four apoptotic peptides were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane, and amino acid sequences were determined by Edman degradation. The peptide sequence for the largest peptide matches to a region in histone H3 (A). Histones were purified from normal nuclei using sulfuric acid (27.Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D.

Jurkat cells were treated by CH-11 at 50 ng/ml for 8 h, ETOP at 10 μm for 26 h, or STS at 1 μm for 6 h. Cell lysate was prepared in the 1% Triton X-100 lysate buffer (as in the legend for Fig. 1) and analyzed with purified histones side by side (B). Both normal and apoptotic Jurkat cell lysates prepared in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (as in the legend for Fig. 1) were immunoblotted with antibodies to histones H3, H2A, H2B, H4, and H1 as indicated (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the appearance of these apoptotic proteins is limited to Jurkat cells, apoptosis was induced in HeLa, MCF-7, WEHI-3, and NIH3T3 cells using STS, TNFα, and ETOP, and the appearance of these proteins was examined by Coomassie Blue staining of a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Results are summarized in Table I. The proteins appeared in apoptotic HeLa and murine WEHI-3 but not apoptotic MCF-7 and NIH3T3 cells, indicating that although this event takes place in lines other than Jurkat, it does not occur in all cells. This is consistent with the notion that not all apoptotic features occur in every apoptotic cell line.Table IAppearance of four small apoptotic proteins in different cell lines treated by various agentsCell lineApoptotic inducersSTSAnti-FASTNFαETOPJurkat+a+, appearance of small apoptotic proteins.+NDbND, not studied.+HeLa+ND++MCF-7−c−, no appearance of small apoptotic proteins.ND−−NIH3T3−ND−−WEHI-3+NDNDNDa +, appearance of small apoptotic proteins.b ND, not studied.c −, no appearance of small apoptotic proteins. Open table in a new tab To identify these apoptotic proteins, the largest protein (15 kDa) was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and protein sequences were determined by Edman degradation. GenBankTMsearching found that an amino acid sequence of 15 residues of this protein matched to a region in histone H3 (Fig. 3A), indicating that this protein is histone H3. Comparison of the Coomassie Blue staining profile of the four apoptotic proteins (Fig. 1B) with the published histone profile on SDS-PAGE immediately suggested that the other three apoptotic proteins might be histones H2A, H2B, and H4. To confirm this, we took two approaches. First, histone proteins were purified using sulfuric acid (27.Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and separated side by side with the total lysate from control and treated Jurkat cells on 15% SDS-PAGE. The four apoptotic proteins in CH-11-, ETOP-, and STS-Jurkat cell lysate matched exactly with the purified histones H3, H2A, H2B, and H4 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that they are indeed histones. Secondly, to further confirm the identities of these proteins, apoptotic Jurkat cell lysate prepared from STS-treated cells was immunoblotted with antibodies against histones H3, H2A, H2B, and H4. These proteins were recognized by the respective specific antibodies in the apoptotic lysate only (Fig. 3C). The same results were obtained when apoptosis was induced by ETOP or an anti-FAS antibody (data not shown). Taken together, the above results demonstrate that these small apoptotic proteins are histones. Because these histones form the core structure of the nucleosome, they are normally insoluble in non-ionic detergents like Triton X-100. Consequently, their detection in apoptotic Jurkat cell lysate prepared in 1% Triton X-100 indicates that they have been released or separated from chromatin. Histone H1 sits outside of the nucleosome and is also released into apoptotic cell lysate in this setting (Fig. 3C). The lower band recognized by the anti-histone H1 antibody may be due to cross-reaction with histone H3. Because DNA is wrapped around a histone structure, these data suggest a relationship between DNA fragmentation and histone separation from chromatin in the apoptotic process. Kinetically, histone release matched well with STS-induced CAD activation and DNA fragmentation in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4). STS-induced CAD activation (as judged from ICAD cleavage), DNA fragmentation, and histone release started at 1.25 h and progressed through to 6 h (Fig. 4). To further explore the link between DNA fragmentation and histone release, we expressed ICAD-DM using the pBabe retrovirus system into Jurkat cells (Fig. 5A). ICAD-DM was generated by substitution of both Asp (117, 224) residues in the caspase cleavage sites with Glu residues (6.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). This mutant protein is therefore resistant to caspase cleavage. Because activation of CAD requires cleavage of ICAD by caspases and CAD is the major apoptotic nuclease, expression of ICAD-DM in Jurkat cells should inhibit DNA fragmentation (6.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). As expected, expression of ICAD-DM completely blocked STS-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, ICAD-DM also substantially reduced histone release in apoptotic Jurkat cells (Fig. 5C). Expression of ICAD-DM did not affect STS-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B), consistent with previous observations (6.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained from CH-11-treated Jurkat (parental, infected with pBabe or ICAD-DM) cells and TNFα- or ETOP-treated HeLa cells infected with pBabe or ICAD-DM (data not shown), indicating an essential role of CAD in dismantling chromatin in these apoptotic cells. This result is consistent with the observation that histones do not separate from chromatin in apoptotic MCF-7 cells (Table I) because of the inability to activate CAD in this line due to a lack of functional caspase-3 (30.Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). To further consolidate a role for CAD in apoptotic histone release, caspase-3 (CPP32) was reintroduced into MCF-7 cells using the pBabe retrovirus system (Fig. 6A). STS, as expected, induced caspase-3 activation and ICAD cleavage (Fig. 6, A and B). Histone release could be detected, although at low levels, in MCF-7/CPP32 but not MCF-7/pBabe cells (Fig. 6C). Because histone release was at low levels, we also performed immunoblotting for histone H4 under these conditions to confirm that histone release was indeed occurring. Indeed, histone H4 was detected only in apoptotic lysate from capase-3 infected MCF-7 cells (CPP32) (Fig. 6D). No DNA fragmentation could be detected in either pBabe or caspase-3-infected cells (Fig. 6E) for up to 24 h of STS treatment, despite the fact that under such conditions more than 70% of the cells were apoptotic (data not shown). Lack of DNA fragmentation in STS-treated MCF-7/caspase-3 cells might be due to the low level of caspase-3 expression and is consistent with our observation that MCF-7 cells do not fragment DNA effectively even in the presence of caspase-3 (9.Tang D. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28549-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate a role for CAD in releasing histones from chromatin during apoptosis.Figure 5Expression of ICAD-DM dramatically reduces apoptotic histone release. Jurkat cells were infected with either empty pBabe or ICAD-DM retrovirus. The ICAD expression was examined by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody (A). Parental, pBabe, and pBabe/ICAD-DM-infected Jurkat cells were treated with STS at 1 μm for the time indicated and then lysed in the 1% Triton X-100 lysate buffer (as in the legend for Fig. 1).

In this case, histone separation will be an inevitable consequence of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. We have generated two lines of evidence that indicate that this is not the case. First, DNA fragmentation was readily induced in NIH3T3 cells by either TNFα (Fig. 7B) or ETOP (Fig. 8B), compatible in magnitude with the DNA fragmentation observed in STS-treated Jurkat cells (Fig. 7B). However, histones were detectable only in apoptotic Jurkat cell lysate and could not be detected in apoptotic NIH3T3 cell lysate (Fig. 7A), even at conditions under which more than 65% of the DNA was fragmented in NIH3T3 cells compared with 45% fragmentation in Jurkat cells (Fig. 7C). Because endonuclease G and other nucleases also contribute to DNA fragmentation, it is possible that failure to release histones is due to a relatively minor contribution of CAD to DNA fragmentation in NIH3T3 cells. To exclude this possibility, ICAD-DM was expressed in NIH3T3 cells using the retroviral system. Expression of ICAD-DM substantially reduced apoptotic DNA fragmentation (Fig. 8), confirming a major role of CAD in DNA fragmentation in these cells.Figure 8Expression of ICAD-DM dramatically reduces apoptotic DNA fragmentation in NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were infected by pBabe, pBabe/ICAD, or pBabe/ICAD-DM, and the protein expression was confirmed (A).

In an in vitro assay, incubation of Jurkat cytosolic extract derived from 1-h STS-treated cells with nuclei from normal Jurkat cells resulted in DNA fragmentation but not dissociation of histones from chromatin (Fig. 9A), whereas histones were readily released from chromatin in vivo (Fig. 9B). In pursuing this, we observed that a DNA smear is converted to clear fragmentation as the CAD activity provided is increased. Increasing the amount of the STS-treated Jurkat cellular extract in the assay converted a DNA smear into fragmentation (Fig. 9A, upper panel) in vitro. Similarly, whereas 100 ng/ml CH-11 for 2 h led to a DNA smear, a 4-h incubation led to clear DNA fragmentation (Fig. 9B, upper panel). Consequently, failure to observe histone separation from chromatin in the in vitro assay is not due to inadequate CAD-mediated DNA cleavage. Taken together, it appears that, unlike DNA fragmentation, CAD is indirectly involved in the dissociation of histone from chromatin in apoptotic cells. This might also provide an explanation of why Jurkat/ICAD-DM and MCF-7/caspase-3 cells displayed some histone release but not DNA fragmentation under apoptotic conditions (Figs. 5 and 6). Historically, apoptosis was defined by the appearance of DNA fragmentation, which accompanied chromatin condensation in dying cells (31.Green D.R. Beere H.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because nuclear DNA is built into a structure termed chromatin, chromatin changes logically should be associated with apoptotic DNA fragmentation. To allow for transcription, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and damage repair, chromatin conformational changes must occur. Similarly, apoptotic chromatin condensation may influence DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells (3.Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2001; 412: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Chromatin condensation occurs in both mitotic and apoptotic cells, and the assumption has therefore been made that the same or similar histone modifications might take place in both events (32.Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). There is some evidence supporting this construct. Deubiquitination of histone H2A has been observed in apoptotic lymphoma cells induced by proteosome inhibitors (33.Marushige Y. Marushige K. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 267-272PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of histones H1, H2A, H2B, and H3 as well as dephosphorylation of histone H1 have also been found to occur in some apoptotic settings (21.Ajiro K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22.Rogakou E.P. Nieves-Neira W. Boon C. Pommier Y. Bonner W.M. J. Biol.

IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 79-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors of histone deacetylases, at high concentration, can induce apoptosis (17.Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). However, the role that these histone modifications may play in apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation is unclear. On the other hand, recent data have indicated that apoptotic chromatin condensation might be totally unrelated to mitotic chromatin condensation (25.Hendzel M.J. Nishioka W.K. Raymond Y. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24470-24478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that events specific to apoptosis may occur and alter chromatin structure. In this study, we provide evidence that apoptotic chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation are accompanied by destruction of the nucleosome. This event, of course, does not occur in condensed mitotic chromatin. We have demonstrated that histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (Fig. 3) are released from apoptotic chromatin. Kinetically, histone release matched well with DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4), indicating a linkage between these two events. Further evidence for this is provided by the fact that both of these events are strongly influenced by expression of ICAD-DM. Expression of ICAD-DM in Jurkat and HeLa cells completely abolished detectable apoptotic DNA fragmentation but not apoptotic cell death (Fig. 5) (15.Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), consistent with a major role of CAD/DFF-40 in fragmenting DNA in apoptotic cells (6.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Interestingly, apoptotic histone release was also significantly reduced by ICAD-DM (Fig. 5), indicating a role for CAD in this apoptotic event. This is further supported by the observation that reintroduction of caspase-3 into MCF-7 cells (which lack caspase-3) resulted in detectable apoptotic histone release (Fig. 6). Because ICAD is not only an inhibitory subunit, but also a chaperone for the CAD catalytic subunit, CAD/DFF-40, ICAD-DM may therefore inhibit CAD activity by preventing the maturation of CAD/DFF-40 (11.Zhou P. Lugovskoy A.A. McCarty J.S. Li P. Wagner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6051-6055Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12.Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In this regard, we cannot definitively distinguish whether CAD nuclease activity or another activity of CAD functions in promoting apoptotic histone release. ICAD/DFF-45 also plays a role in the induction of chromatin conformational changes in some cells derived from knockout mice (15.Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Consequently, further work will be required to determine precisely how CAD mediates histone release. Although it clearly plays an important role in apoptotic histone release, CAD/DFF-40 is not sufficient in and of itself to cause this to occur. The two events, DNA fragmentation and histone release, could be separated both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, DNA fragmentation, significantly reduced by ICAD-DM, occurred efficiently in apoptotic NIH3T3 cells. However, no histone release could be found (Fig. 6). Because other nucleases, including endonuclease G, are able to cleave DNA in apoptotic cells (3.Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2001; 412: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4.Li L.Y. Luo X. Wang X. Nature. 2001; 412: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 5.Parrish J. Li L. Klotz K. Ledwich D. Wang X. Xue D. Nature. 2001; 412: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) but might not function in histone release, lack of histone release in apoptotic NIH3T3 cells might be due to a major contribution of this or other nucleases. Although we cannot exclude this possibility completely, this is very unlikely because ICAD-DM dramatically inhibited apoptotic DNA fragmentation (Fig. 8), indicating a major role of CAD in DNA fragmentation in NIH3T3 cells. This would be consistent with previous data demonstrating that knockout of ICAD prevents DNA fragmentation in apoptotic MEF cells (15.Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In vitro, it has been shown that reconstitution of apoptotic cellular extract with nuclei prepared from Jurkat cells results in CAD-dependent DNA fragmentation because addition of ICAD-DM blocks fragmentation (6.Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) (our data not shown). In such an assay, we could detect DNA fragmentation but not histone release (Fig. 9). Taken together, these data indicate that whereas CAD functions directly in DNA fragmentation, it may play an indirect role in mediating histone release in apoptotic cells. The fact that histones are not released in apoptotic NIH3T3 cells is consistent with the notion that not all apoptotic features occur in every apoptotic setting. Possibly, induction of selective apoptotic features, such as membrane blebbing or DNA fragmentation, would be sufficient to execute cells. By the same logic, inducing histone release might also be able to cause cell death. The observation that CAD plays an important but insufficient role in causing histone release and that histone release is not simply the result of DNA fragmentation offers another layer of apoptotic regulation. It may also open other pathways for exploration in the induction of apoptosis in cancer therapy. Finally, because histone release can be detected in apoptotic cells that were negative for DNA fragmentation (apoptotic Jurkat/ICAD-DM, HeLa/ICAD-DM, and MCF-7/caspase-3), detection of histones in apoptotic cellular lysate prepared in 1% Triton X-100 by simple staining of a 15% SDS-PAGE by Coomassie Blue may provide an excellent way to assay apoptosis under some conditions. We are very grateful to Dr. Shigekazu Nagata (Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan) for ICAD and ICAD-DM expression constructs."
https://openalex.org/W1978555671,"Primary fibroblasts respond to activated H-RAS(V12) by undergoing premature arrest, which resembles replicative senescence. This irreversible 'fail-safe mechanism' requires p19(ARF), p53 and the Retinoblastoma (Rb) family: upon their disruption, RAS(V12)-expressing cells fail to undergo senescence and continue to proliferate. Similarly, co-expression of oncogenes such as c-MYC or E1A rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence. To identify novel genes that allow escape from RAS(V12)-induced senescence, we designed an unbiased, retroviral complementary DNA library screen. We report on the identification of DRIL1, the human orthologue of the mouse Bright and Drosophila dead ringer transcriptional regulators. DRIL1 renders primary murine fibroblasts unresponsive to RAS(V12)-induced anti-proliferative signalling by p19(ARF)/p53/p21(CIP1), as well as by p16(INK4a). In this way, DRIL1 not only rescues RAS(V12)-induced senescence but also causes these fibroblasts to become highly oncogenic. Furthermore, DRIL1 immortalizes mouse fibroblasts, in the presence of high levels of p16(INK4a). Immortalization by DRIL1, whose product binds the pRB-controlled transcription factor E2F1 (ref. 8), is correlated with induction of E2F1 activity. Correspondingly, DRIL1 induces the E2F1 target Cyclin E1, overexpression of which is sufficient to trigger escape from senescence. Thus, DRIL1 disrupts cellular protection against RAS(V12)-induced proliferation downstream of the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway."

Transport of Na+ and Cl− via the NKCC2 comprises a critical component of total renal salt reabsorption (1Greger R. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2000; 319: 51-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is the central element in whole body fluid and electrolyte balance.

Efficient operation of this transport system must overcome the unusual problem that the luminal concentration of Na+ and Cl− decreases about 5-fold over the length of the TAL as salt is reabsorbed. Intriguingly three exons encoding a 96-base pair region of NKCC2 are alternatively expressed, giving rise to three different protein sequences in the second transmembrane domain. Each of the three variants (F, A, and B) of NKCC2 shows a specific distribution along the TAL. The F variant is expressed only in the outer medulla, the A variant is found in the outer medulla and cortex, and the B variant is found only in the region of the macula densa (see below, Fig.1 a; Refs. 7Payne J.A.

Because the membrane-embedded regions of transport proteins are most involved in interactions with the transported ions, we have proposed that the three variants of NKCC2 may act with different affinities in transporting ions (7Payne J.A. Forbush B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been indirectly supported by the finding that the second transmembrane domain plays a major role in determining Na+and K+ affinity in the secretory Na-K-Cl cotransporter NKCC1 (10Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Forbush B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we show that the three alternatively spliced variants of NKCC2, which are known to be axially distributed along the tubule, are individually specialized for optimal transport. We found that, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the three variants differ dramatically in their affinities for Na+, Rb+, and Cl−. In addition the NKCC2B splice variant that is localized in the macula densa region exhibits unique behavior, consistent with an important role in tubuloglomerular feedback (9Yang T. Huang Y.G. Singh I. Schnermann J. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F931-F939PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schnermann J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 274: R263-R279Google Scholar). The current findings present a remarkable example of molecular specialization underlying physiological specificity in the mammalian kidney. An abstract of these findings has been previously presented (12Gimenez I. Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10 (abstr.): 32AGoogle Scholar). To generate three full-length splice variants of rabbit NKCC2, a 280-bp fragment (SphI-BglII) from the rbNKCC2A was replaced by the same fragment from the rbNKCC2B and rbNKCC2F clones; the three cDNAs are thus identical to one another except for the alternatively spliced 96-bp exon. The cDNAs were subcloned into theEcoRI sites of a modified oocyte expression vector between the untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin (13Caron L. Rousseau F. Gagnon E. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the cRNA for each construct was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage-mMachine, Ambion). After lithium chloride precipitation, cRNA was dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water at a concentration of 1.5–2 μg/μl. Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA/oocyte and maintained at ∼17 °C in medium containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.9 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm furosemide, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at room temperature). Three days after injection, NKCC2 activity was determined in 86Rb influx assays. Oocytes were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature in a low chloride (3 mm) hypotonic (160 mosm) solution to inhibit the activity of theXenopus NKCC1 (14Suvitayavat W. Palfrey H.C. Haas M. Dunham P.B. Kalmar F. Rao M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C284-C292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated for 40 min in an influx medium containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm RbCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mmNa2SO4, 0.1 mm ouabain, 3 μCi/ml86RbCl, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at room temperature), and optionally 0.25 mm bumetanide in 0.1% Me2SO. The dependence of 86Rb influx on cotransported ions was determined by substitution ofN-methyl glucamine for Na+ or K+ and of gluconate for Cl−.

All solution transfers were executed by transferring oocytes from one well to another in a 48-well plate. 86Rb in individual oocytes was determined by Cerenkov radiation in a scintillation counter.

Results are presented as mean ± S.E. of three to seven experiments with four to six oocytes per experimental condition. For Western blot analysis, oocytes (five to eight per group) were solubilized in 100 μl of homogenization buffer (1% Triton X-100), and samples containing 50 μg of protein were run on SDS gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Here we report the functional characterization of the three splice variants of NKCC2 in X. laevis oocytes. cRNAs for rabbit NKCC2 were prepared, differing only in the sequence of the 96-bp region encoding the second transmembrane domain (Fig. 1 b). Injection of each NKCC2 cRNA led to appropriate synthesis of the transporter protein (Fig.2 b), and the transport activity of each variant, measured as bumetanide-sensitive86Rb influx, was at least 6–7-fold higher than endogenous activity (Fig. 2 a). In comparing the behavior of the three variants we found large differences in affinities for the transported ions (Fig. 3 a–c); these differences can be seen to provide a functional rationale for alternative splicing.Figure 3Dependence of 86Rb influx on cotransported ions. The effect of varying extracellular ion concentrations is shown for Na+ (a), Rb+ (b), and Cl− (c). Normalized 86Rb uptake by oocytes injected with NKCC2B (red circles), NKCC2A (green triangles), or NKCC2F (blue squares) is presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least six experiments per curve. Horizontal bars at the bottom of the graphs represent the approximate range of ion concentrations in the tubule lumen in the portion of the mammalian TAL in which each variant is present using the same color code. Kinetic constants were calculated from these data (mm):K m(Na+): B = 20.65 ± 2.4, A = 16.45 ± 1.9, F = 66.72 ± 5.8*;K m(K+): B = 0.89 ± 0.17, A = 0.78 ± 0.08, F = 2.93 ± 0.48*;K m(Cl−): B = 8.95 ± 1.3, A = 44.65 ± 3.87†, F = 111.3 ± 13.4*. †, statistically different from B (p < 0.01). *, statistically different from B and A (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Variant F of NKCC2 exhibits the lowest affinity for each of the cotransported ions (Fig. 3, data in blue). This variant is found in the initial segment of the TAL where it is the only form expressed in abundance. In this region of the renal tubule, the inner stripe of the outer medulla, electrolyte concentrations are very much elevated compared with plasma as a result of passive water reabsorption in the thin descending limb (blue bars at thebottom of graphs in Fig. 3). Importantly theK m values for the transported ions are all within the observed range of tubular concentrations, consistent with efficient operation of NKCC2F in this region. It may be noted, however, that if NKCC2F were deployed along the full length of the TAL, it would perform very poorly in removing ions from the dilute tubular fluid present in the cortical regions. The A variant of NKCC2 was found to have 4-fold higher affinity for Na+ and Rb+ and 2-fold higher affinity for Cl− in comparison with NKCC2F (Fig. 3, data ingreen). NKCC2A is found in the outer stripe of the outer medulla and in the renal cortex. Due to NKCC2 action in reabsorbing Na+, K+, and Cl−, electrolyte concentrations are reduced 2–10-fold by the time the fluid has reached this region of the tubule (Fig. 3, green bars). Thus the reduction of ion concentrations is matched by an increase in ion affinities; the structure of the cotransporter appears to have evolved to optimize transport along the diluting segment. Why is the higher affinity isoform, NKCC2A, not deployed throughout the TAL? One possibility is that the transporter with higher affinity transport has a lower capacity, for example, if NKCC2A were unable to unload ions on the intracellular side as efficiently as NKCC2F. This idea is analogous to a proposal of “dynamic matching” of substrate- and product-containing complexes in evolutionary optimization of the catalytic effectiveness of enzymes (16Burbaum J.J. Raines R.T. Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9293-9305Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this present case, however, the flux determined for NKCC2F under control conditions in oocytes is lower than that of NKCC2A (Fig. 2 a), and from the measured K m values we estimate that at the high salt concentrations of the tubule lumen the two isoforms would exhibit similar transport rates. Thus transport efficiency does not appear to be at the heart of the issue. An alternative hypothesis is that with a reduced affinity for Na+ and Cl−, the F isoform serves to buffer the luminal concentration of ions in the medullary segment, thus more equally partitioning salt transport between medulla and cortex (17Burg M. Kidney Int. 1982; 22: 454-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,18Reeves W.B. Molony D.A. Andreoli T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1145-F1154PubMed Google Scholar). A medullary/cortical distribution of reabsorption can be expected to enhance several features of renal function. 1) NaCl uptake in the medulla takes place against a large gradient; salt recycling and oxygen consumption are minimized by limiting reabsorption in this region. 2) Reduction of medullary diluting power ensures flow-dependent salt delivery to the macula densa and thus enables tubuloglomerular feedback. 3) Medullary/cortical partitioning provides a basis for regional control of regulation of salt reabsorption; as a result, antidiuretic hormone (or vasopressin) is able to enhance the concentration gradient for water reabsorption by altering the ratio of medullary to cortical salt reabsorption in the mouse TAL without substantially changing net salt reabsorption (19Hebert S.C. Andreoli T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F745-F756PubMed Google Scholar). Variant B is seen to have the highest Cl− affinity of the variants, ∼3-fold higher than variant A and 10-fold higher than variant F. The Na+ and Rb+ affinities are similar to NKCC2A (Fig. 3). Since the distribution of NKCC2B is restricted to the distal-most portion of the TAL (Fig. 1), the splicing phenomenon results again in an apparent adaptation of an NKCC2 variant to the decreasing luminal salt concentrations. On the other hand, the Na+ and Rb+ affinities are not significantly different between A and B variants except for an anomalous inhibition of Rb+ influx seen at higher Na+concentrations. The punctate distribution of NKCC2B seen in Fig. 1 a and in Ref. 8Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418PubMed Google Scholar underscores the specific localization of the B variant to the macula densa cells of the TAL (9Yang T. Huang Y.G. Singh I. Schnermann J. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F931-F939PubMed Google Scholar). Two important regulatory mechanisms are initiated in these specialized salt-sensing cells, tubuloglomerular feedback and regulation of renin secretion; an increase in luminal salt concentration is transduced by macula densa cells to decrease the glomerular filtration rate and to inhibit renin secretion by the juxtaglomerular apparatus (11Schnermann J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 274: R263-R279Google Scholar). NKCC2 plays a central role in the feedback loop by providing the mechanism for the macula densa cells to take up chloride (11Schnermann J. Am. J.

Interestingly the shark kidney appears to express only the A and F variants of NKCC2 (21Gagnon E. Caron L. Forbush B. Batchvarov R. Isenring P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10 (abstr.): 32AGoogle Scholar); in conjunction with the fact that the macula densa is absent in lower vertebrates this further suggests a specific relationship between NKCC2B and the macula densa. It is not immediately obvious why variant B is particularly well suited to a luminal Cl−-sensing role in the macula densa since its high ion affinities would ensure operation near kinetic saturation, a situation that would decrease its fidelity as a signaling mechanism. We propose that the unique aspect of transport at the level of the macula densa is that net cotransporter ionic distributions are at or near equilibrium across the apical membrane due to the very low luminal ion concentrations (22Lapointe J.Y. Laamarti A. Bell P.D. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: S58-S64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, net apical salt transport may be determined by gradient rather than kinetic parameters with the overall transcellular transport limited primarily by Na+ pump performance at limiting intracellular [Na+]. In this circumstance, variant A could perform as well as variant B, and we suggest that variant B significantly differs in another, as yet unidentified, property. One possibility, suggested by the inhibition of Rb+ influx at high Na+concentration (Fig. 3 a), is that the B variant has a different transport stoichiometry, perhaps allowing Na+ to occupy the K+ site under some conditions; this would allow uptake of Cl− against a larger gradient. A second possibility is that NKCC2B varies in some aspect of its regulation, perhaps through a Cl−-sensing role of the transporter itself. In this work, we have reported the functional properties of NKCC2 along the TAL. These properties vary with the axial distribution of NKCC2 splice variants in successive regions of that tubule segment. Indeed the variants are shown to have very distinct sets of ion affinities, mirroring the decrease in luminal concentrations of Na+, K+, and Cl− in the corresponding regions. A similar pattern of axial specialization of the renal Na+pump has been recently reported based on functional differences conferred by four structurally different γ subunits of Na,K-ATPase (23Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The functional arrangement of renal splice variants is similar to the tonotopic distribution of Ca2+-activated K+channel splice isoforms in hair cells of the vertebrate cochlea where variants that are more sensitive to Ca2+ have been mapped to the high frequency end of the organ (24Ramanathan K. Michael T.H. Jiang G.J. Hiel H. Fuchs P.A. Science. 1999; 283: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Jones E.M. Gray-Keller M. Art J.J. Fettiplace R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

These are excellent illustrations of the fine tuning that alternative splicing can confer on the utilization of the limited set of genes in the mammalian genome.

It has previously been documented that the C terminus part of ROKα interacts with the N-terminal kinase domain and thereby regulates its catalytic activity. Here we used antibodies against different domains of ROKα and were able to reveal some structural aspects that are essential for the specific functions of ROKα. Antibodies against the kinase domain revealed that this part of the protein is highly complex and inaccessible. Further experiments confirmed that this domain could undergo inter- and intramolecular interactions in a complex manner, which regulates the kinase catalytic activity.

Only the anti-Rho binding domain antibodies could activate the kinase independent of RhoA. The PH antibodies had no apparent effects on the catalytic activity but were effective in blocking actomyosin assembly and cell contractility. Likewise, mutations of the PH domains can abrogate its dominant negative effects on actin morphology. The subsequent disruption of endogenous ROK localization to the actomyosin network by overexpressing the PH domain is supportive of a role of the PH domain of ROK in targeting the kinase to these structures.

In particular, RhoA is responsible for promoting the formation of actin-based stress fibers and focal adhesions, resulting in contractile phenotype in cultured cells treated with lysophosphatidic acid or sphingosine 1-phosphate (4.Ridley A.J.

ROKα belongs to a member of a kinase family that includes myotonic dystrophy kinase, myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase, and citron kinase. In general, they consist of an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain that is followed immediately by an extended coiled-coil region and other functional motifs such as GTPase binding, pleckstrin homology (PH), and cysteine-rich domains. In ROK, the C terminus contains an unconventional PH with an internal cysteine-rich motif (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These multidomain kinases have been reported to be involved in the regulation of some aspects of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement during different cell stages and cytokinesis through their conserved catalytic activities (11.Jin S. Shimizu M. Balasubramanyam A. Epstein H.F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Altruda F. Neuron. 2000; 28: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The regulation of the catalytic activity of serine/threonine protein kinases often involves kinase phosphorylation in the activation loop and the hydrophobic motif C-terminal to the kinase domain by autophosphorylation and/or phosphorylation by a heterologous kinase (15.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 16.Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Our study on myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase-α has revealed the requirement of a trans-autophosphorylation event for kinase activation; the process is facilitated by kinase dimerization (18.Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This dimerization/autophosphorylation may be a special feature of this kinase family, in contrast to some kinases such as the AGC protein kinases (Ser/Thr kinases including protein kinase A, B, C, and G), which often require an upstream kinase for activation. Interestingly, a strong correlation of oligomerization with activity has also been described for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (19.Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether or not this constitutes a fundamental activation mechanism for all members in the family remains to be investigated. Besides sharing sequence homology in the kinase domains, protein kinases of this family also show similarity in their overall domain arrangements as well as regulation. Both native myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase and myotonic dystrophy protein kinase have recently been shown to separately exist in multimeric complexes, possibly through parallel intermolecular interaction of their extended coiled-coil domains (18.Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19.Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that ROK could also potentially oligomerize through its coiled-coil domain in a similar fashion. In addition, the kinase domains of both myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase and myotonic dystrophy protein kinase have been shown to be autoinhibited during a resting state by an autoregulatory region C terminus to the kinase domains (18.Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19.Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A similar observation was also reported for ROKα, in which the C terminus including the PH domain has been mapped to be the autoinhibitory region (20.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Binding of the GTP-bound form of Rho is known to activate ROK; the interaction is believed to disrupt the negative regulatory interaction between the kinase domain and the C-terminal autoinhibitory region to give rise to an active kinase. Although all results have pointed to the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil domain as the Rho-binding site (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the exact sequence of elements involved and nature of the interaction remain largely obscured. In this current work, we further analyzed the structure and function relationship of ROK. In agreement with the related protein kinases, we found that native ROK exists in multimeric complexes, and its catalytic activity is dependent on a dimerization/trans-autophosphorylation event. To understand ROK better, we have raised specific antibodies against the various functional domains of ROK as tools to probe its functions in vivo. We show that the antibody against the Rho-binding site could result in ROK activation independent of RhoA. Conversely, the antibody against the C-terminal PH domain produced an inhibitory effect on ROK activity on cell contractility and actomyosin assembly. Combined evidence from immunoprecipitations and mutagenesis studies strongly suggests that the C-terminal PH domain of ROK has a yet undiscovered role on cytoskeleton rearrangement besides its autoinhibitory regulation on the catalytic domain. HA- and FLAG-tagged full-length wild-type and kinase-dead ROKα constructs in mammalian expression vector pXJ40 were obtained as previously described (Leung et al. (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). ROKα-CAT and ROKα-kinase-dead constructs (encoding amino acids 1–432) were obtained by PCR with primers 5′-GACTCGAGTTCTTCACTTTTCCTTG-3′/T7 using the above constructs as template. ROKα-pCC (amino acids 429–647) were obtained from subcloning a BamHI/XhoI-digested PCR product from primers 5′-CGGGATCCAAAAGTGAAGAAAGTCAG-3′/5′CCGCTCGAGCTTCAAATCTTCTTCCAACCCA-3′. Likewise, the HA- and FLAG-tagged ROKα-dCC constructs (encoding amino acids 639–968) were derived from PCR product with primers 5′-CGGGATCCTCTGGGTTGGAAGAAGAT-3′/5′-CCGCTCGAGTGTTCTATTTGTTTCTTC-3′. The binding domain ROKα-BD constructs (encoding amino acids 809–1056) were derived from a HincII/NdeI-digested DNA fragment of ROKα, and the ROKα-PH constructs (encoding amino acids 1110–1379) were derived from a Xmn1 DNA fragment of ROKα. ROKα-CT constructs (encoding amino acids 971–1379) were obtained as previously described (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For generating the ROKα-PH mutant constructs (W1161A/W1331L), a two-step PCR protocol (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used with primers 5′-CTTCGGCGCCGTTAAGAAGTATGTGATTG-3′ and 5′-CTTCGGCGCCAAACTTTTTAGTGTTGTTC-3′ (for the W1161A mutation) and primers 5′ CGAGAAGCTTGTTAGTCGGTTGGTGAAAAAG-3′ and 5′-CGAGAAGCTTCTGCTGTTCTTCCGTTG-3′ (for the W1331L mutation). The final PCR fragment from these PCR products was subsequently ligated to ROKα-CT (ROKα(ΤΤ)971–1379; Refs. 6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

The HindIII fragment of the kinase domain (encoding amino acid 107–392) was subcloned into pMAL vector. The distal binding domain of ROKα (dBD; encoding amino acids 1008–1139) was obtained by PCR with primers 5′-CCGGGATCCAAAGCACAGTTTGAGAAGCAG-3′ and 5′CCGCTCGAGAAATCCGTCATCAGGCTCAGC-3′ and subcloned into pGEX-4T1. The PH domain (amino acids 1142–1379) in pGEX-4T1 was obtained by PCR using primers 5′-CCGGGATCCCGATTAGAAGGATGGCTGTCG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGCTTGGTTTGTTTGGAGC-3′. The binding domain of ROKβ construct in pGEX-4T1 vector (pBD; encoding amino acids 947–1027) was obtained as previously described (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant maltose-binding protein-ROKα-KIN107–392 (KIN), GST-ROKα-CC639–968 (CC), GST-ROKα1008/1139(dBD), GST-ROKα1142–1379 (PH), and GST-ROKβ1008–1039 (pBD) were obtained as fusion proteins according to standard protocol. For the preparation of polyclonal antibodies, thrombin-cleaved protein from each GST fusion protein or factor X-cleaved protein from maltose-binding protein fusion protein (400 μg) was emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant for injection into rabbits. Rabbits were bled 10 days after the third and subsequent booster injections. Sera were collected and affinity-purified using 2 mg/ml antigen pre-coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma) and eluted with buffer containing 100 mmglycine-HCl (pH 2.5), 0.05% Triton X-100. The first 2 eluates were neutralized with Tris/HCl (pH 8.5) and used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blot analysis. Monoclonal antibody 1A1 against the rat ROKα kinase domain has been described previously (24.Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). For cell injection experiments, Triton-free buffer was used for elution, and the antibody concentrations were adjusted to about 0.5–1 mg/ml before use. Brain tissue extracts were prepared from fresh tissue by using Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer containing 25 mmHepes, pH 7.3, 0.2 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin; Sigma). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Likewise, HeLa cells extracts were obtained from subconfluent cultured cells (90-mm dish) with cells grown either in normal minimum Eagle's medium (MEM) (for direct immunoprecipitation) or methionine-free MEM medium (Sigma) supplemented with [35S]methionine (0.2 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were harvested after a 2-h incubation, and sample preparation in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described before. RhoA binding was carried out as previously described (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with the blotted brain soluble proteins and a GST-Rho binding domain fusion protein were preincubated with anti-ROKα-CC639–968 antibody (CC-Ab), anti-ROKα-BD1008–1139 (dBD-Ab), and anti-ROKα1142–1379 (PH-Ab) for 2 h at 4 °C before incubating with [γ-32P]GTP-RhoA in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Filters were extensively washed in the same buffer before exposing to x-ray film. A-Sepharose CL-6B-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column of 1.8 × 45 cm was equilibrated with lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 0.2 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol) and calibrated with standard molecular weight markers (thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and albumin (66 kDa)). Crude rat brain extract prepared in lysis buffer using a Dounce homogenizer was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble supernatant was applied to the CL-6B-200 column at a flow rate of 0.12 ml/min. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting using 1A1 antibody. The relative amount of ROKα from each fraction was quantified by a Bio-Rad densitometer. Untransfected COS-7 cells or cells overexpressing wild-type ROKα were extracted in lysis buffer. Protein concentrations of clarified extracts were adjusted to 1–3 mg/ml. Cross-linking reactions began with addition of 0.05 to 0.5 mm bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cross-linked products were detected by immunoblotting with either anti-ROKα antibody (1A1) for detecting the endogenous ROKα or anti-FLAG antibody for overexpressed FLAG-tagged ROKα proteins. COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were transfected with different ROKα constructs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 16 h after transfection, cell extracts were obtained with lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.15 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm glycerol phosphate, 5% glycerol, and 0.2% Triton X-100). Clarified cell extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) or anti-HA antibody and protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were either continued with kinase assays or separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. Kinase assays were carried out at 30 °C for 10 min using GST-MLC2 as substrates (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP, 10 μm ATP, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2.5 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.025% Triton X-100. Total soluble extracts from rat brain and COS-7 cells were used for Western blotting using mouse monoclonal antibody 1A1 or rabbit anti-ROKα antibodies raised against the different domains of ROKα. For immunoprecipitation, rat brain soluble extract (50 mg) was incubated with antibody-coupled Sepharose beads for 30 min. Immunoprecipitated products after extensive washing were resolved on 7.5% PAGE-SDS and immunoblotted with 1A1 antibody. HeLa cells were maintained and transfected as described (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For microinjection of HeLa and Swiss 3T3 cells, subconfluent cells were plated on coverslips for 48 h before microinjecting with the different ROKα constructs (50 ng/μl) or anti-ROKα antibodies (0.5–1 μg/μl). C3 exoenzyme (0.2 μg/μl; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was co-injected in some experiments. 2–4 h after injection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with a combination of various primary antibodies (anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-mouse, or FITC anti-rabbit antibodies. Stained cells were analyzed with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Confocal Imager adapted to a Nikon microscope. Other antibodies used for cell staining were obtained from various commercial sources (mouse anti-myosin light chain (Sigma), rabbit anti-myosin heavy chain (Biomedical Technologies Inc.), and mouse anti-vinculin (Sigma). Subconfluent HeLa cells were serum-starved for 6 h before injecting with the various antibodies. After incubating for 30 min, cells were treated with 0.3 μg/ml sphingosine 1-phosphate (Sigma). Time lapse phase-contrast microscopy of the injected and non-injected cells was followed immediately after treatment. Images at 0 time and 15 min were taken for comparison. To estimate the endogenous ROK activities in cells and tissues, we have attempted to raise antibodies against the various regions of ROKα for immunoprecipitation assays. An obvious phenomenon from these experiments was the inability of the antibodies against the kinase domain (both monoclonal antibody 1A1 and polyclonal antibodies KIN-Ab) in recognizing the native endogenous full-length protein in rat brain extracts (Fig. 1A). Antibodies against the coiled-coil domain of ROKα (CC-Ab), distal RhoA binding domain (BD-Ab), and the PH domain (PH-Ab) were all effective in immunoprecipitating the endogenous ROK (Fig. 1, A and C). To further investigate the specificity of these antibodies, immunoprecipitations using [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cell extracts were carried out. Here we showed that except for the kinase antibodies (KIN-Ab), other antibodies (CC-Ab, dBD-Ab, and PH-Ab) could specifically immunoprecipitate both the native and metabolically labeled ROK protein (Fig. 1B). To see if the anti-kinase domain antibodies are effective in recognizing the kinase domain alone, we used the antibodies to immunoprecipitate the kinase domain overexpressed in transfected COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the overexpressed kinase domain protein was readily immunoprecipitated by the kinase antibody 1A1. Furthermore, the antibody apparently inhibited the catalytic activity of the immunoprecipitated protein. This inhibitory effect could also be observed when 1A1 antibody was co-injected with ROK catalytic domain construct in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). Injection of this antibody alone into HeLa cells resulted in no obvious effect on the overall actin morphology (Fig. 2B, a and b). However, it was able to almost completely block the aberrant actin filament formation induced by the active ROK-CAT when co-injected (Fig. 2B,c and d), indicating that the antibody had an inhibitory effect against ROK in vivo. These results suggest that the failure of this antibody in recognizing the native full-length ROK protein could be due to inaccessibility of the kinase antibodies to the epitopes. It is therefore of great interest to find out why the kinase domain in the full-length protein is inaccessible to the antibodies. We found that full-length ROKα can exist in high molecular weight multimeric forms. As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous ROKα co-migrated with high molecular weight markers in a gel filtration analysis, and no monomeric form of the protein was detectable. A molecular size of about 600 kDa is suggestive of a tetrameric structure. Likewise, chemical cross-linking experiments with bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate also revealed a slow migrating band, confirming that ROK can exist as multimeric complexes (Fig. 3B). To define which region(s) of ROKα is involved in the oligomerization event, we have examined the various regions of ROKα that may have contributed to this event. Both the proximal and distal coiled-coil regions (including the Rho binding domain, which is located at the end of the extended coil regions) were effective in forming oligomers (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, the kinase domain alone can also form homophilic dimers. In contrast, the PH domain at the C terminus was totally ineffective in dimer formation. Apart from the intermolecular interaction, we also attempted to determine if intramolecular interactions may also take place. Indeed, the kinase domain can also interact with two independent regions, one at the distal coiled-coil region and an additional interaction at the C-terminal PH domain (Fig. 4C). Hence, our results have revealed that ROKα can form complexes through intermolecular interactions through its coiled-coil and kinase domains and that the N-terminal kinase domain can also interact intramolecularly with the C-terminal coiled-coil and PH domains. To see if these interactions are functional, we co-expressed the FLAG-tagged kinase domain with the various HA-tagged interacting partners to check for their associations and effects on the kinase domain activity. As shown in Fig. 4D, both the distal coiled-coil and PH domains can partially block the catalytic activities of the co-precipitated kinase domain. Interestingly, dimerization of the wild-type kinase with the kinase-dead ROKα kinase domain also resulted in an inactive kinase, suggesting that trans-autophosphorylation plays an essential role in regulating the kinase activity. Previous work on ROK isoforms reveal that the Rho binding domain is located at the end of the coiled-coil region (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol.

Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Because the antibodies are specifically raised against different domains, we have attempted to determine if binding of these antibodies to the RhoA binding domain of ROK competes with RhoA binding. As expected, only antibodies against the distal binding domain (dBD-Ab in Fig. 5A) are effective in blocking RhoA binding in vitro. Interestingly, full-length ROKα immunoprecipitated with this antibody showed significant increases in the catalytic activity in comparison with ROK protein pulled down by other antibodies (Fig. 5B). This suggested to us that the dBD-Ab not only blocked RhoA binding but also activated ROKα catalytic activity. To further examine the effectiveness of these antibodies in ROK activation in vivo, we have microinjected these antibodies into HeLa cells and checked the effects on actin morphology. As shown in Fig. 5C, cells injected with dBD-Ab gave significant increases in actin stress fibers. These actin filaments were not sensitive to C3 toxin, which is a potent inhibitor of RhoA but is readily disassembled in the presence of the kinase inhibitor HA1077. These results give further support of the in vitro data that the antibodies to the Rho binding domain can activate ROK catalytic activity independent of Rho. Thus far our results and others clearly show that the C terminus of ROKα can form part of intramolecular interaction with the kinase domain and this can negatively regulate the kinase activity (Fig. 4; Ref. 20.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, although antibodies against the Rho binding domain are effective in activating ROKα catalytic activity, the antibodies against the C terminus are apparently ineffective. A consistent observation was the lack of contractility of cells injected with the PH-Ab, in contrast to those injected with dBD-Ab (Fig. 6A). Cell contractility was also observed when HeLa cells were treated with Rho-activating agents such as lysophosphatidic acid or sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP; Fig. 6A), the responsiveness to these agents was lost when cells were injected with PH-Ab (Fig. 6A). To further characterize this phenotypic effect upon PH-Ab, we have stained injected cells for myosin light chain, polymerized actin filaments, and focal adhesions. As shown in Fig. 6B, cells injected with PH-Ab exhibited a prominent defect on myosin assembly with moderate changes in polymerized actin arrangement (Fig. 6B, a and b). By contrast, cells injected with dBD-Ab showed marked enhancement in myosin staining, whereas CC-Ab was relatively ineffective (Fig. 6B, c and d). PH-Ab-injected cells also showed mild but consistent decreases in focal adhesion staining (Fig. 6C, a and b) in contrast to cells injected with dBD-Ab, which showed marked increases (cand d), and to those with CC-Ab, which remained unchanged (c–f). Thus, PH-Ab apparently exerted a potent effect on myosin assembly with relatively milder effects on actin and focal adhesions. These cytoskeletal effects of the PH-Ab may account for the observed lack of contractility in PH-Ab-injected cells upon sphingosine 1-phosphate treatment. The observation of an inhibitory effect of the PH-Ab has prompted us to investigate if the C-terminal PH domain of ROKα may have other functional roles apart from its intramolecular kinase inhibition. A mutant with two conserved tryptophan residues (ROKα-CTAL; Refs. 25.Touhara K. Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17000-17005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 26.Maroun C.R. Moscatello D.K. Naujokas M.A. Holgada-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31719-31726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used to examine its effects on kinase inhibition. As shown in Fig. 7A, this mutant was as effective as the wild-type protein in interacting and inhibiting the kinase domain catalytic activity (Fig. 7A). However, the dominant negative effect of this mutant protein on actin cytoskeleton is lost (Fig. 7B), suggesting that the PH domain may have a role that is unrelated to the intramolecular kinase inhibition. Because both PH-Ab and overexpression of minimal PH domain apparently had similar cytoskeletal effects, we attempted to examine the effect of the PH domain on the localization of the endogenous ROKα protein in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using the CC-Ab. As shown in Fig. 7C, interphase fibroblast showed endogenous ROK co-localized with myosin filaments (a and b), in agreement with recent data showing co-localization of Rho regulatory proteins in these structures (27.Katoh K. Kano Y. Amano M. Onishi H. Kaibuchi K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 569-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). When overexpressing the PH domain, the distribution of endogenous ROK was more diffused, and myosin arrangement was in a random fashion (c and d). Expression of the mutant PH domain (ROKα-PHAL) apparently had no such effect, and endogenous ROK showed the normal close alignment with assembled myosin. Similar effects were observed with a PH domain mutant at the cysteine-rich domain region within the PH domain (C1284S/C1287S; data not shown). We therefore conclude that an intact PH domain is required for the blockage of endogenous ROK protein to localize to the site of myosin assembly. We have described in this report that antibodies against the kinase domain of ROKα can recognize the kinase domain alone but not the full-length protein. Further experiments have indicated that the kinase can exist in multimeric form, as the result of extensive intermolecular interactions of the various coiled-coil domains. A tetrameric structure can be predicted based on the molecular size of about 600 kDa on gel filtration chromatography and chemical cross-linking. Both the proximal and distal coiled-coil domains can form independent homophilic dimers. Furthermore, the C terminus can also interact intramolecularly with the kinase domain. These results are similar to an earlier report (20.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but our data suggest that a major interaction also include the distal coiled-coil region that overlaps with the RhoA binding domain, although the C-terminal PH domain may also contribute to the overall effect. Interestingly, the kinase domain is also able to form homodimers. The myotonic dystrophy kinase family including ROKα consists of a conserved activation loop and an extended C-terminal hydrophobic loop that are known for catalytic activation (15.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 16.Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 17.Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). In some cases the phosphorylation within these two regions can be achieved by other kinases or through an autocatalytic event. Our results of an inactive ROKα kinase when an active kinase domain dimerized with a kinase-dead counterpart may suggest that a trans-autophosphorylation event upon kinase dimerization is essential for kinase activation. The observation that autophosphorylation site mutants ROKαT240A in the activation loop region and ROKαT405A in the extended hydrophobic region that exhibited significant losses of catalytic activity also provides further support of this regulatory event (data not shown). Furthermore, co-expression of wild-type ROKα with PDK1 (both active and kinase-dead forms) did not result in alterations in ROKα catalytic activity, implying that ROKα is not regulated by this kinase (data not shown). It is tempting to speculate that the dimerization and autophosphorylation of ROKα may well be a major event for the regulation of these kinases. Our recent data on the related Cdc42-binding kinase myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase-α has also provided strong evidence for this notion. In this case the dimerization and activation of the kinase domain (which depends on the conserved N-terminal extended region) and the inhibitory interaction between the kinase domain and the distal coiled-coil domain are mutually exclusive and crucial for regulating the catalytic activity (18.Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A similar conserved mechanism may also be involved in the dimerization of the kinase domain of ROKα and its distal coiled-coil domain, with an additional requirement that a larger C-terminal region is required for effective interaction and kinase inhibition (20.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that ROKα can form multimeric complexes essentially with the central coiled-coil region. The homophilic dimer formation of the kinase domain is crucial for the catalytic activity, and this can be abrogated by interaction with the C-terminal region, in particular the distal coiled-coil region, which overlaps with the Rho-A binding domain and forms an essential part of the autoinhibitory motif. In this respect, it is intriguing to find that antibodies to the Rho binding domain can activate ROK kinase activity. It is conceivable that the interaction of the antibody with an exposed surface at this region close to the Rho binding and the overlapping kinase inhibitory interaction region is sufficient to cause a conformational change leading to activation of the kinase in a Rho-independent manner. We have previously mapped the Rho binding domain of ROKα to residues 968–1047 (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and more recent work (21.Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 22.Fujisawa K. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Bito H. Saito Y. Hall A. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 4: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) has documented a more likely binding site at a nearby N-terminal region. Antibodies directed specifically to the Rho-binding site of ROKβ were ineffective in recognizing the protein, indicating this region may not be exposed and, hence, inaccessible to the antibodies (see Fig. 1). The requirement of antibodies against an extended region beyond the Rho binding domain for the recognition and activation of ROKα may imply multiple binding sites for Rho. A weaker site at the C-terminal side of the Rho binding region may be necessary for opening up the distal coiled-coil region, where a more pertinent Rho binding can occur at a subsequent stage. It is likely that such perturbation may be crucial for releasing the inhibitory effect of this region upon the kinase domain, whose subsequent dimerization described earlier is essential for kinase activation. Although the PH domain can also form part of the autoinhibitory domain, it is not known whether it can serve other functional roles because PH domains are known to interact with phospholipid and membrane components (28.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PH domain of ROKα is unique, consisting of an internal cysteine-rich motif. Previous reports indicate that this motif alone can block stress fibers and focal adhesion formation, probably through the autoinhibitory effect on the kinase catalytic activity (6.Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Kaneko T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32418-32424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, our observation that the anti-kinase antibodies are unable to recognize the full-length protein may suggest that overexpression of the PH domain may not have major effects on the full-length protein because this could only be effective intramolecularly. Support of this view comes from the microinjection experiments with the PH antibodies that resulted in defective cell contractility and myosin assembly. Furthermore, PH mutants at the PH/cysteine-rich domain regions are significantly less effectively in blocking actin stress fiber and focal adhesion formation in comparison with the wild-type PH domain, although they still retained the ability to interact with the kinase domain protein and inhibited the catalytic activity. This provides strong evidence that this region of ROKα may have an additional functional role. The observation of a blockage of translocation of endogenous ROK to myosin assembly site may imply that this region of ROKα may play a role in kinase targeting to and subsequent assembling myosin. In summary, we have raised antibodies to the various regions of ROKα. Antibodies against the kinase domain have revealed that this part of the kinase is cryptic. This phenomenon is probably the result of extensive inter- and intramolecular interactions of the different domains that also form part of the kinase activation mechanism. Antibodies to the Rho binding domain can essentially replace Rho in terms of kinase activation, and antibodies to the C-terminal PH domain also revealed that this part of the kinase is essential for targeting of the kinase to actomyosin compartment. These antibodies are therefore useful in defining functions to the various structural domains of the protein."

The variable domain LEN was obtained from a patient who had no overt amyloidosis; however, LEN forms fibrils in vitro, under mildly destabilizing conditions. The in vitro kinetics of fibrillation were investigated using a wide variety of probes. The rate of fibril formation was highly dependent on the initial protein concentration. In contrast to most amyloid systems, the kinetics became slower with increasing LEN concentrations. At high protein concentrations a significant lag in time was observed between the conformational changes and the formation of fibrils, consistent with the formation of soluble off-pathway oligomeric species and a branched pathway. The presence of off-pathway species was confirmed by small angle x-ray scattering. At low protein concentrations the structural rearrangements were concurrent with fibril formation, indicating the absence of formation of the off-pathway species. The data are consistent with a model for fibrillation in which a dimeric form of LEN (at high protein concentration) inhibits fibril formation by interaction with an intermediate on the fibrillation pathway and leads to formation of the off-pathway intermediate.

The term “amyloid” was first used in 1851 by Virchow (1.Virchow R. Virchows Arch. 1851; 6: 415-426Google Scholar) to describe abnormal cerebral tissues that positively responded to iodine staining. The absence of starch and the presence of protein aggregates in these tissues were only later demonstrated. However, the term amyloid has been since used to describe abnormal protein aggregates associated with numerous diseases, such as myeloma and various neurodegenerative diseases (2.Uversky V.N. Talapatra A. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Med. Sci. Monitor. 1991; 5: 1001-1012Google Scholar, 3.Uversky V.N. Talapatra A. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Med. Sci.

Amyloid fibril deposits can be localized to a single organ (e.g. brain) as in the case of neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases) or distributed throughout the entire body (light chain-associated amyloidosis and familial amyloid polyneuropathy). It is believed that a common molecular mechanism underlies all amyloidosis diseases; the hypothesis that fibril formation arises from partially folded intermediates has been usually favored. Furthermore, fibril formation has been hypothesized to occur stepwise, a slow phase of nuclei formation preceding a relatively fast elongation/growth phase (5.Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). However, both the triggering factors and the mechanisms involved in the abnormal formation of in vivo insoluble fibrillar aggregates from soluble proteins are poorly understood (7.Kisilevsky R. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Light chain amyloidoses arise from the systemic deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain variable domains following their hypersecretion, usually by patients suffering from multiple myeloma (8.Solomon A. Semin. Oncol. 1986; 13: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar,9.Buxbaum J. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1992; 6: 323-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variable domains are usually composed of 110–130 residues with molecular masses between 12 and 14 kDa. They are characterized by a β-sheet fold (i.e. β-sandwich fold) giving remarkably similar secondary and tertiary structures among all variable domain proteins. It has been shown that most variable domains form dimers at moderately high concentrations (a few milligrams/ml). The variable domain studied here, LEN, using a recombinant expression system generously given by Dr. F. Stevens (10.Wilkins Stevens P. Raffen R. Hanson D.K. Deng Y.L. Berrios-Hammond M. Westholm F.A. Murphy C. Eulitz M. Wetzel R. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was originally isolated from the urine of a patient suffering from multiple myeloma, with no sign of renal dysfunction or amyloidosis, despite excretion levels as high as 50 g/day (11.Solomon A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 101-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, LEN has been shown to readily form fibrils in vitro, under mildly destabilizing conditions (12.Raffen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Pokkuluri P.R. Dave P. Wilkins Stevens P. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The purpose of our study was to investigate the kinetics of fibril formation of the variable domain of an immunoglobulin light chain (LEN) in detail using several biophysical methods to understand better the molecular mechanism involved in fibril formation. The best method to monitor quantitatively the in vitro kinetics of fibril formation is the increase in fluorescence intensity of the dye thioflavin T (ThT)1 upon its interaction with fibrils (13.Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 14.Naiki H. Higuchi K. Nakakuki K. Takeda T. Lab.

However, simply following the formation of fibrils provides no information about possible conformational changes in the protein nor about the formation of partially folded intermediates as fibril precursors. Various biophysical methods, such as intrinsic and ANS fluorescence, near- and far-UV CD, thin film ATR-FTIR, and small-angle x-ray scattering, were used to monitor the early stages of fibril formation. Upon incubating/stirring the protein solutions, aliquots were withdrawn at time points during the early stages of fibril formation to follow changes in the various parameters probed by these biophysical techniques. This study particularly focused on the early stages of the process to characterize the conformational changes and formation of soluble oligomers. Ultra-pure urea was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Acrylamide was purchased from Ampresco. Peptone and yeast extract used in the medium were purchased from Difco. All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher or Sigma and were of the highest grade available. The water was doubly deionized. LEN was overexpressed using a frozen stock of Escherichia coli JM83 cloned with the plasmid pkIVlen004. The recombinant system was a gift from Dr. Fred Stevens (10.Wilkins Stevens P. Raffen R. Hanson D.K. Deng Y.L. Berrios-Hammond M. Westholm F.A. Murphy C. Eulitz M. Wetzel R. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in a shaker (170 rpm) at 30 °C in a rich LB medium until an A600 of about 6 was obtained. The overproduction of LEN was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 1 mm) to the culture medium. After an additional incubation time, 16 h or until the A600 was close to 12, the proteins were harvested by submitting the cells to a cold TES (Tris buffer at pH 8, EDTA, and sucrose) extraction followed by several cold-water extractions. Significant amounts of LEN were observed (by SDS-gel electrophoresis) up to the fourth water extraction. Sucrose and water fractions were subsequently pooled together and dialyzed against a 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, solution. The solution was then eluted through an Econo-Pac High Q cartridge (Bio-Rad) to remove some protein impurities. The flow-through was then dialyzed against a 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0. The solution was then loaded on a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences). LEN was eluted using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 120 mm over 20 min. The purity of the 2-ml fractions collected was assessed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The purest fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mmphosphate buffer solution at pH 8.0, and concentrated by ultrafiltration to a final LEN concentration of about 4 mg/ml. LEN purity and conformation were assessed by SDS-gel electrophoresis, near-UV CD, and thin film ATR-FTIR. No impurity bands could be detected on the SDS gel when loaded at a concentration of ∼4 mg/ml. In vitro fibril formation was studied by incubating solutions of different concentrations of LEN at pH 2 (20 mmHCl), 100 mm NaCl, at 37 °C with stirring. Solutions of 3 (237 μm), 1 (79 μm), 0.5 (40 μm), 0.1 (7.9 μm), and 0.01 mg/ml (0.79 μm) were studied. The solutions, with volume ranging from 250 to 750 μl, were stirred in 2-ml high pressure liquid chromatography glass vials (Fisher) containing micro-stirrer bars (8 × 1.5 mm, Fisher). The stirring rate was maintained constant throughout this study and was estimated at ∼660 rpm. Aliquots of different volumes (depending on the analytical method used) were withdrawn at pre-determined time points to follow the kinetics of fibril formation. Kinetic experiments were normally repeated at least twice and gave reproducible results, with errors of ±10–15%. X-ray scattering data were performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The instrument was configured with a Mo:CB4 multilayer monochrometer, an 18-mm beam stop, and a 218-cm sample-to-detector distance. All measurements were performed using a static cell with a 1.3-mm path length. Protein solutions of 3 mg/ml were used. A radical scavenger (O-tert-butyl-l-serine-tert-butyl-ester hydrochloride), at a final concentration of 10 mm, was added to the protein sample before each measurement to inhibit radiation damages. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a FluoroMax-2 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex). All measurements were performed at 37 °C with final protein concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 0.001 mg/ml, depending on the initial experimental protein concentrations. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements were performed using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and recording the emission spectra from 300 to 420 nm. ANS fluorescence measurements were performed using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and recording the emission spectra from 420 to 600 nm. ThT fluorescence measurements were performed using an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and recording the emission spectra from 465 to 560 nm. Solutions of 10 μmANS and ThT at pH 2 were used throughout the study. The ANS/protein and ThT/protein molar ratios varied from 8.4 to 1140, depending on the initial experimental protein concentrations. Among different kinetic experiments, band pass adjustments were performed to compensate for eventual changes in the final protein concentrations. CD measurements were performed using a 60DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv). All measurements were performed at 37 °C with a protein concentration of 3.0 mg/ml. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded from 250 to 200 nm using a circular cell with a 0.01-cm path length. Near-UV CD spectra were recorded from 320 to 250 nm using a rectangular cell with a 0.1-cm path length. Spectra obtained after buffer subtraction were corrected for protein concentration and smoothed using the Savitsky-Golay function (using a second order polynomial function with 5 points). Near-UV CD spectra of protein solutions of various concentrations were recorded from 320 to 250 nm using circular cells of different path lengths (depending on protein concentrations). Cells with path length ranging from 0.1 to 10 cm were used for protein solution with concentrations ranging from 3.0 to 0.01 mg/ml, respectively. To obtain estimates of the ellipticities of the monomeric ([Θ]m) and dimeric ([Θ]d) forms and the association constant (Ka), the observed ellipticity at 282.5 nm ([Θ]obs) as a function of total protein concentration (CT) was curve-fitted using a least squares non-linear computer program based on Equations 1 and 2(16.Azuma T. Kobayashi O. Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Biochem.

FTIR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 800 spectrophotometer from 4000 to 400 cm−1 using a 4-cm−1resolution and an accumulation of 256 scans. The system was continuously purged with dry air. 84 μg (28 μl of a 3.0 mg/ml solution) of protein under various conditions of pH values and at pre-determined time points during kinetic experiments were evenly dried on the surface of a germanium crystal using nitrogen. Background and water vapor subtractions were performed until a straight base line was obtained between 2000 and 1750 cm−1. After stirring a 3.0 mg/ml solution of LEN at pH 2 at 37 °C for 2 and 4 h, its stability toward urea-induced unfolding was assessed by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence after incubation in increasing amounts of urea (from 0 to 6 m). The increase in intrinsic fluorescence intensity was used for the 0- and 2-h samples, while the change in λmax position was used for the 4-h sample. All samples were incubated for 4 h at room temperature to ensure complete unfolding equilibrium. The final protein concentration was 0.01 mg/ml. The fluorescence measurements were performed using a FluoroMax-2 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex) with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (5 nm band pass) and recording the emission spectra from 300 to 420 nm (5 nm band pass). Assuming a two-state folding mechanism, the fraction of the unfolded conformation was obtained using Equation 3,fu=(yf−y)/(yf−yu)Equation 3 where yf and yu values represent the intrinsic fluorescence value of ycharacteristic of the folded and unfolded conformations, respectively, under the conditions where y is being measured (17.Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). The values of yf and yu were obtained by linear regression on the data points before and after the unfolding transition, respectively. A sigmoidal curve-fit was subsequently used to determine the midpoints of the unfolding transition (Cm). Quenching experiments were performed by following the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of LEN solution (0.15 mg/ml) upon adding a series of 5-μl aliquots of a 3.0 m acrylamide solution. The fluorescence measurements were performed using a FluoroMax-2 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex) with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (2 nm band pass) and recording the emission spectra from 300 to 420 nm (2 nm band pass). Fluorescence intensities were further corrected for dilution due to the stepwise addition of acrylamide. The data were plotted as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity in the absence of acrylamide (Fo) to the fluorescence intensity in the presence of acrylamide (F)versus the concentration of acrylamide ([A]). The values of the Stern-Volmer constant (KSV) or dynamic quenching were obtained by curve-fitting the experimental data to Equation 4,Fo/F=(1+KSV[A])×exp(KST[A])Equation 4 where KST represents the static quenching constant responsible for a slight upward curvature. Because similar protein/acrylamide ratios were used throughout the experiment, the presence of similar static quenching between acrylamide and LEN (under various conditions) was assumed. Thus, the same value of KST was used for the curve fitting of all data. The formation of fibrils upon stirring 3.0 mg/ml LEN solutions at 37 °C was assessed by EM. The stirred protein solutions were sampled at pre-determined time points during the kinetic experiments. After a 2-fold dilution of the aliquots, 5-μl protein samples were dropped on Formvar-coated copper grids. After draining the excess sample with filter paper, the grids were air-dried. A freshly prepared 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution was then applied on the grids. After removal of the excess negative staining solution, the grids were air-dried again. Electron micrographs were collected using a JEOL JEM-100B microscope with a voltage accelerator of 80 kV. A magnification of 50,000 was used. LEN is a κIV IgG variable domain that has been reported not to form fibrils at neutral pH in the absence of destabilizing agents, when submitted to mild agitation (12.Raffen R. Dieckman L.J. Szpunar M. Wunschl C. Pokkuluri P.R. Dave P. Wilkins Stevens P. Cai X. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, in preliminary experiments, we determined that LEN forms fibrils at neutral pH with more vigorous agitation (data not shown). Furthermore, LEN fibrils were also observed to form at a reasonable rate at low pH or in the presence of low to moderate concentrations of urea at neutral pH (data not shown). For the present investigation, we chose to study the fibrillation process at pH 2.0 where no amorphous aggregates were observed under the experimental conditions used, for example, electron micrographs showed no evidence of amorphous material. It has been recognized that, for most proteins, at least partial conformational changes from their native state are an initial prerequisite to the formation of fibrils in vitro (18.Lai Z.H. Colón W.

Marginally destabilizing conditions are well known to populate partially folded intermediates (24.Fink A.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 495-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, low concentrations of denaturants and acidic pH have been the most common conditions to initiate fibril formation in vitro. Because the kinetics of LEN fibril formation were studied at pH 2, the extent of initial conformational changes of LEN upon lowering the pH to 2 was investigated. Various biophysical methods were used to compare LEN conformations at pH 8 (10 mm phosphate buffer), the pH of optimum stability, and pH 2 (20 mm HCl). Far- and near-UV circular dichroism have been extensively used to follow changes in protein secondary and tertiary structures, respectively (25.Woody R.W. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 25-67Crossref Google Scholar, 26.Manning M.C. ACS Symp.

The near-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 1a) of LEN at pH 8 was characterized by maxima at 295, 285, and 280 nm. On lowering the pH, a significant decrease of the amplitude of the signal was observed, indicating some reorganization of the environment of the tyrosine clusters and the tryptophan residues (Fig. 1a). However, the presence of substantial tertiary structure was still clearly present. The CD spectra obtained after incubation in 6 m urea was featureless, reflecting the unfolding of LEN in high urea concentration and confirming the presence of significant tertiary structure at pH 2. The far-UV CD spectra of LEN and related IgGs are unusual, due to the contributions of aromatic groups in the 210–230 nm region. Far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 1b), obtained at pH 2 and 8, were characterized by the presence of two minima (235 and 219 nm). The minimum at 219 nm is characteristic of β-structure and the one at 235 nm is attributed to the aromatic contributions of tyrosine clusters (28.Strickland E.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 2: 113-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 29.Sreerama N. Manning M.C. Powers M.E. Zhang J.X. Goldenberg D.P. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10814-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). An increase in ellipticity at 218 nm was observed upon lowering the pH, reflecting some rearrangement of the β-sheets and/or the aromatic clusters. In addition, the negative peak due to the tyrosine clusters was still observed at pH 2. The overall shape similarity of the two spectra indicated the small scale of these secondary structure changes. By using hydrated thin film ATR-FTIR it is possible to examine the secondary structure of native, partially folded intermediate, and unfolded states of proteins, as well as aggregated proteins and amyloid fibrils (30.Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 2-106Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31.Fink A.L. Seshadri S. Khurana R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). By analysis of the amide I band in the 1600–1700 cm−1 region, one can quantitatively assess the secondary structure composition of the sample. Very similar spectra for the amide I and II regions were observed at both pH 8 and 2 (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, the presence of tyrosine was also detected by a shoulder at 1518 cm−1 in the amide II region. The second derivative spectra, at both pH values, were essentially identical over the amide I and II regions (Fig. 1c). The absence of significant differences in the IR spectra confirmed the lack of significant changes in the secondary structure of LEN upon lowering the pH to 2 (the small changes in the CD spectra probably reflect small changes in the aromatic side-chain environment, possibly due to carboxylate quenching or loss of carboxylate quenching). ANS fluorescence has been used to probe protein conformational changes associated with the solvent exposure of hydrophobic patches (32.Stryer L. Science. 1968; 162: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 33.Goto Y. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 34.Semisotnov G.V.

Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), usually observed upon partial protein unfolding (e.g. molten globule formation). Both an increase in fluorescence intensity and a decrease in λmax values (blue shift) are usually observed upon binding of ANS to exposed hydrophobic clusters. No significant differences were observed in the λmax values (514 nm) and the fluorescence intensity of ANS upon its addition to a solution of LEN at pH 2 and 8 (Fig. 1d). In addition, no significant differences from the ANS controls (no protein) were observed (data not shown), indicating the absence of significant binding to the protein at both pH values, and hence the absence of evidence for partial unfolding at low pH. The intrinsic fluorescence of LEN results from the presence of two tryptophan residues at positions 35 and 50. Based on the crystal structure of LEN (35.Huang D.B. Chang C.H. Ainsworth C. Johnson G. Solomon A. Stevens F.J. Schiffer M. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), Trp35 is buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein, whereas Trp50 is significantly solvent-exposed. However, the spatial proximity of Trp35 to the disulfide bridge Cys23–Cys94 results in quenching, and thus the intrinsic fluorescence of LEN, under native conditions, is due essentially only to the fluorescence of Trp50, with insignificant contributions from tyrosine residues. In its native conformation (at pH 8), the fluorescence of Trp35 was quenched by the spatial proximity of the disulfide bridge, whereas Trp50 seemed to be significantly solvent-exposed, based on the high observed λmax value of 348 nm (Fig. 1e). Upon lowering the pH to 2, an increase in intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity was observed, whereas no changes in maximum peak position were seen. This change in intrinsic fluorescence seemed to indicate a reorganization of the tryptophan environments; the tryptophan fluorescence intensity is known to be very sensitive to subtle structural reorganizations. However, additional changes were observed after incubating the sample in 6 murea (Fig. 1e), where both an increase in intensity and a slight red shift of the peak maximum (350 nm) were observed, indicating that significant additional changes in the environment of the tryptophan residues occurred upon complete unfolding. Small angle scattering of x-rays by protein solutions has been used to obtain information on both the size and the shape of the scattering species but is only well suited for systems that contain a very limited number of discrete species (36.Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 1-515Google Scholar, 37.Semisotnov G.V. Kihara H. Kotova N.V. Kimura K. Amemiya Y. Wakabayashi K. Serdyuk I.N. Timchenko A.A.

J. 1993; 65: 912-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The scattering profiles were obtained for 3.0 mg/ml LEN solutions at pH 2 and 8 (Fig. 1f). No significant differences could be detected between the profiles at both pH values. In addition, the two profiles were compared with a theoretical profile calculated from the crystal structure of the dimeric form of LEN. The superposition of the theoretical scattering profile with those at both pH values indicated not only that LEN at 3.0 mg/ml was in its dimeric form at both pH values but also that the structure of LEN in solution was similar to that of the crystal conformation. From analysis of the Guinier plot, the Rg of LEN was 18.9 ± 0.16 Å at pH 8.0 and 18.3 ± 0.25 Å at pH 2. The linearity of the Guinier plots (data not shown) indicated that the species in solution was homogeneous. In addition, the corresponding Kratky plots (data not shown) showed a bell-shape curve characteristic of a tightly packed, folded protein. The linearity of the Guinier plot and the similarities in the bell-shaped curves of the Kratky plots indicated that lowering the pH to 2 did not significantly change the compactness or association state of LEN (at least at 3.0 mg/ml). The dissociation constant of LEN, under native conditions, is 10 μm (10.Wilkins Stevens P. Raffen R. Hanson D.K. Deng Y.L. Berrios-Hammond M. Westholm F.A. Murphy C. Eulitz M. Wetzel R. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We used near-UV CD to determine the dissociation constant of LEN dimers at pH 2 (20 mm HCl and 100 mm NaCl). CD spectra were measured at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 3 mg/ml (Fig. 2,inset), and a dissociation constant of 62 ± 20 μm was determined (Fig. 2), indicating a slightly weaker association than at neutral pH. The intrinsic fluorescence of LEN was also measured as a function of concentration. No significant differences in λmax and concentration-normalized fluorescence intensity were observed (data not shown), confirming the lack of participation of Trp50 in the self-association process."

In recent years, GBS has also attracted attention as a significant cause of disease in adults with underlying conditions (1.Baker C.J. Edwards M.S. Remington J.S. Klein J.O. Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and the Newborn Infant. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1995: 980-1054Google Scholar,2.Schuchat A.

Despite its importance as a human pathogen, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which this bacterium causes disease and evades attack from the human immune system, and a vaccine against GBS disease is not yet available. Attempts to develop a GBS vaccine have mainly focused on the polysaccharide capsule, which elicits antibodies that protect against experimental infection (1.Baker C.J. Edwards M.S. Remington J.S.

However, strains of GBS also express surface proteins that elicit protective immunity and these proteins have attracted increasing interest for studies of pathogenic mechanisms and for vaccine development (3.Lancefield R.C.

One of these proteins is the β protein (also known as Bac or β C), which is of interest not only because it elicits protective immunity but also because it binds to the Fc part of human IgA (10.Russell-Jones G.J.

The IgA-binding region is situated in the N-terminal part of the β protein (13.Hedén L.-O. Frithz E. Lindahl G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and has been localized to a sequence comprising 73 amino acid residues (15.Jerlström P.G. Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2787-2793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of β in infection is not known, but a recent study suggests that the ability of β to bind IgA-Fc may allow it to interfere with IgA effector function (16.Pleass R.J. Areschoug T. Lindahl G.

Here, we show that β also binds another component of the human immune system, the complement regulator factor H (FH). Human FH is a 150-kDa single chain plasma glycoprotein belonging to the regulators of complement activation (RCA) family. Like other members of the RCA family, FH is composed of domains designated short consensus repeat (SCR) or complement control protein (CCP) modules, and there are 20 such modules in FH (17.Kristensen T. Wetsel R.A. Tack B.F. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3407-3411PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Ripoche J. Day A.J. Harris T.J. Sim R.B. Biochem.

FH plays an important role in the regulation of the alternative pathway of complement activation by down-regulating the formation of the alternative pathway C3-convertase, resulting in decreased production of C3b, and by acting as a cofactor for factor I (FI) in the degradation of C3b (20.Morgan B.P. Harris C.L. Complement Regulatory Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1999Google Scholar). Our data show that the β protein has separate binding sites for FH and IgA-Fc and that bacteria-bound FH retains its ability to down-regulate complement activation. These findings focus interest on the role of β in the pathogenesis of GBS infections and suggest that GBS may exploit FH to evade complement attack. The GBS type Ia strain A909 expressing the β protein (10.Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Blake M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21.Bevanger L.

Plasmid pJRS233 is a shuttle vector in which replication is temperature-sensitive in Streptococcus pyogenes (22.Perez-Casal J. Price J.A. Maguin E. Scott J.R. Mol.

Plasmid pLZ12Spec is a shuttle vector in which replication is not temperature-sensitive (23.Husmann L.K. Scott J.R. Lindahl G. Stenberg L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 345-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pBAC601 is a pUC18 derivative containing an insert that includes the entire bac gene, the structural gene for the β protein, and the chromosomal regions upstream (∼1.3 kb) and downstream (∼2.9 kb) of bac (13.Hedén L.-O. Frithz E. Lindahl G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For construction of a derivative of pLZ12Spec carrying bac, the entire bac gene was amplified from plasmid pBAC601, using synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-AAATTTGAATTCTGCAGGAAGTTATTATTCCGAATG-3′ and 5′-AAATTTGGATCCGTATTTTCATTGCCCTCAACATCA-3′ as primers. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, recognition sequences for which had been introduced through the primers. This fragment was ligated into pLZ12Spec, generating plasmid pLZ bac. All GBS strains were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) at 37 °C without shaking. GBS transformed with the pLZ12Spec derivative pLZ bac was grown in presence of spectinomycin (70 μg/ml). The group B streptococcal β, Rib, and α proteins were purified from extracts from strains SB35, BM110, and A909, respectively, as previously described (5.Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Stenberg L.

Rabbit antiserum to the β protein was raised as described (5.Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Stenberg L. Lindahl G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Antiserum to human FH was purchased from Calbiochem or The Binding Site (Birmingham, UK). Rabbit antiserum to human IgA was from Dakopatts (Copenhagen, Denmark). Rabbit antiserum directed against the GBS type Ia capsular polysaccharide was kindly provided by Dr. D. L. Kasper (Channing Laboratory, Boston, MA). A mutant of strain A909 was constructed in which bac, the structural gene for β, had been replaced with the kanamycin resistance cassette ΩKm2 (25.Perez-Casal J. Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The procedure used to construct this mutant employed a derivative of pJRS233, a shuttle vector in which replication is temperature-sensitive in Gram-positive bacteria, allowing efficient selection of recombinants through homologous recombination (22.Perez-Casal J. Price J.A. Maguin E. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The pJRS233 derivative, designated pJRSΔbac, carried the ΩKm2 kanamycin resistance cassette surrounded by chromosomal regions located upstream and downstream of the bac gene, respectively (see below). Plasmid pJRSΔbac was transformed into strain A909 as described (26.Framson P.E. Nittayajarn A. Merry J. Youngman P. Rubens C.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3539-3547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a mutant was recovered after homologous recombination between the plasmid and the bacterial chromosome (22.Perez-Casal J. Price J.A. Maguin E. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The structure of the mutant was verified by PCR (data not shown). This β-negative mutant of strain A909 will be referred to as Δbac. Transformation of strain Δbac with plasmid pLZ bac generated the trans-complemented strain Δbac/pLZ bac. The insert in plasmid pJRSΔbac was constructed as follows. The bac gene in pBAC601 was deleted using two EcoRV sites located 6 bp upstream of the start codon and 30 bp downstream of the stop codon, respectively. This pBAC601 derivative was blunt ligated to SmaI-cleaved ΩKm2 cassette. The resulting plasmid had an insert in which ΩKm2 was surrounded by the chromosomal regions located upstream and downstream of bac. This insert was isolated after SalI digestion and ligated into SalI-cleaved pJRS233, resulting in plasmid pJRSΔbac (Fig. 1A). A 75-kDa C-terminal fragment of β was prepared by alkaline hydrolysis. A solution (22 ml) of β (35 μg/ml in 10 mm NaCl) was mixed with the same volume of 20 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 11.0, and incubated at 60 °C for 20 h. After neutralization and concentration by ultrafiltration, the preparation was analyzed by Western blotting. A distinct 75-kDa polypeptide in the hydrolysate lacked reactivity with antiserum to the N-terminal B6 fragment of β, suggesting that this 75-kDa polypeptide represented a C-terminal fragment of β. The 75-kDa polypeptide was purified by electroelution from gel slices (electroeluter model 422; Bio-Rad) and harvested in elution buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS). Amino-terminal sequencing showed that the 75-kDa fragment starts at residue Pro441, and the size of the fragment suggests that it corresponds to the entire C-terminal part of the β protein. The 75-kDa fragment contains the XPZ region, as shown by analysis with XPZ-specific antibodies (data not shown). Plasma proteins binding to whole bacteria were identified in absorption experiments. Bacteria in an overnight culture were washed twice in PBS and suspended to 1010 cfu/ml. Samples (2 ml) of this suspension were added to 7 ml of fresh human plasma, supplemented with EDTA (9 mm) to avoid complement activation, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The bacteria were washed three times in PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.0, for 15 min at room temperature. After removal of bacteria by centrifugation, the eluates were neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and concentrated ∼7-fold in a Centricon YM-10 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Plasma proteins binding to pure β were identified by passing plasma through a column containing immobilized β. Pure β (1 mg) was immobilized in a 1-ml HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences), following the instructions provided by the supplier. Fresh human EDTA-plasma (2 ml) was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter to remove particulate material, diluted 4-fold in PBS, and passed through the column. After washing the column with 15 ml of PBS, bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.0, and the eluates were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. To analyze binding of pure FH to the β-expressing strain A909 and its β-negative mutant Δbac, overnight cultures of bacteria were washed twice in PBSAT (PBS containing 0.02% NaN3 and 0.05% Tween 20) and suspended to 1010 cfu/ml. Identical samples (200 μl) of bacterial suspension were added to each of a series of tubes, and different amounts of pure FH were added to give the final concentrations indicated. After incubation for 2 h, the bacteria were washed twice with PBSAT and resuspended in 200 μl of a 1,000-fold dilution of anti-FH in PBSAT. After incubation for 2 h, the bacteria were washed as described above and resuspended with PBSAT (200 μl) containing 125I-labeled protein G (∼15,000 cpm). After incubation for 2 h, washing with PBSAT, and centrifugation, the radioactivity associated with each bacterial pellet was determined in a γ-counter. All incubations were performed at room temperature. Binding of anti-β antibodies and125I-labeled IgA to whole bacteria was analyzed as described (5.Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Stenberg L. Lindahl G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 27.Lindahl G. Åkerström B. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For competitive binding tests with proteins, the wells of microtiter plates were coated overnight with β protein (50 μl; 1 μg/ml in PBS). This coating step was performed at 4 °C, while all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBSAT and blocked by incubation for 1 h with the same buffer. To analyze the ability of FH or IgA to inhibit the binding of IgA to the immobilized β, unlabeled FH or polyclonal IgA was mixed with 125I-labeled polyclonal IgA in a total volume of 100 μl of PBSAT to the final concentrations indicated, and these mixtures were added to the wells coated with β. After a 2-h incubation and three washes with PBSAT, bound 125I-labeled IgA was detected in a γ-counter. Maximal binding (i.e. binding of 125I-labeled IgA in the absence of inhibitor) was ∼7%. Nonspecific binding to wells (≤0.3%) was determined by analyzing binding of125I-labeled IgA to uncoated wells. To analyze the ability of heparin to inhibit the binding of FH to β, unlabeled FH or IgA (negative control) was mixed with different amounts of heparin (final concentrations indicated) in a total volume of 115 μl of PBSAT. FH or IgA was used at a final concentration of 4.3 μg/ml. After preincubation for 2 h, 50 μl of the mixtures were added to wells coated with β protein (see above), and incubation was continued for 2 h. To detect bound FH, the wells were washed three times with PBSAT, and anti-FH antibodies (100 μl; diluted 1,000-fold in PBSAT) were added. The wells were incubated for 1 h, and after three washes with PBSAT, 125I-labeled protein G (∼10,000 cpm in 100 μl of PBSAT) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 h and three washes with PBSAT, the radioactivity associated with each well was determined in a γ-counter. Bound IgA was detected with anti-IgA antibodies (diluted 1,000-fold in PBSAT) and125I-labeled protein G, as described above. Maximal binding (i.e. binding in the absence of inhibitor) was about 7% for FH and 47% for IgA, respectively. Each of these experiments was performed at least twice, with similar results. Overnight cultures of bacteria were washed twice in TBS-T (50 mmTris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.3) and resuspended to 2 × 1010 cfu/ml. Aliquots (20 μl) were centrifuged, and the bacterial pellets (4 × 108 cfu) were resuspended in 19 μl of TBS-T containing pure FH (3.15 μg). After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, unbound FH was removed by three washes with TBS-T (450 μl). To determine the cofactor activity of the bacteria-bound FH, 125I-labeled C3b (∼320,000 cpm, corresponding to ∼8 ng) and FI (44 ng) were added in TBS-T (total volume 20 μl). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected. To analyze whether FH that had dissociated from bacteria during the experiment was responsible for cofactor activity, the β-expressing strain A909 with bound FH was incubated in TBS-T alone for 2 h at 37 °C and then centrifuged. The supernatant was then incubated for another 2 h with FI and 125I-labeled C3b, as described above. As a positive control, pure FH was mixed with FI and 125I-labeled C3b and incubated as described above. The amount of FH used was the same as that bound to the bacteria. To analyze whether the β-expressing strain A909 can degrade C3b in the absence of FH, a sample of this strain (19 μl) was incubated with FI and 125I-labeled C3b for 2 h at 37 °C. For analysis of C3b degradation, samples corresponding to ∼30,000 cpm were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Radiolabeling of proteins with carrier-free 125I (Amersham Biosciences) by the chloramine-T method, and Western blot analysis was performed as described (28.Stenberg L. O'Toole P. Lindahl G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). High molecular mass heparin (average molecular mass 14 kDa) was purchased from Leo Pharma (Malmö, Sweden). Amino-terminal sequencing of proteins was carried out at the Protein Analysis Center of Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden). Several studies have shown that β binds to the Fc part of human serum IgA (10.Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Blake M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11.Brady L.J. Boyle M.D.P. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Lindahl G. Åkerström B.

To analyze whether surface-expressed β can bind human plasma proteins other than IgA, we compared a β-expressing GBS strain and an isogenic β-negative mutant for ability to bind plasma proteins. The β-negative mutant was derived from the β-expressing strain A909, a strain of capsular type Ia that expresses both β and the unrelated α protein (10.Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Blake M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21.Bevanger L. Maeland J.A. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. B. 1979; 87: 51-54Google Scholar, 29.Michel J.L. Madoff L.C. Olson K. Kling D.E. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10060-10064Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The construction of this mutant is described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 1A. In this mutant, which is designated Δbac, the entire structural gene for β, the bac gene, is replaced with the kanamycin resistance cassette ΩKm2. Surface expression of β was completely abolished in Δbac, as shown by analysis with rabbit anti-β serum (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the wild type strain A909 bound IgA, while Δbac failed to bind IgA, confirming that expression of β is abolished in Δbac (Fig. 1C). In contrast, surface expression of the type Ia polysaccharide capsule and the α protein were not affected in Δbac, and the in vitro growth rate of Δbac was not different from that of the parental strain (data not shown). When the Δbac mutant was trans-complemented with the bac gene on a plasmid, the resulting strain, designated Δbac/pLZ bac, expressed β at a level very similar to that of the parental strain (Fig. 1, B and C). To compare wild type bacteria and the β-negative mutant Δbac for ability to bind plasma proteins, bacteria were incubated in human EDTA-plasma, and bound proteins were eluted with 0.1m glycine, pH 2.0 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The eluate from the wild type strain A909 contained three protein species of ∼150, ∼130, and ∼60 kDa that were not present in the eluate from the isogenic β-negative mutant (Fig. 2A). The absence of the polypeptides in the eluate from the β-negative mutant Δbac was not due to a polar effect of the ΩKm2 cassette on a gene located downstream, because the same three plasma proteins were also found in eluates from the trans-complemented and β-expressing strain Δbac/pLZ bac. Thus, absorption of the three polypeptides from plasma was mediated by surface-located β protein. Determination of N-terminal sequences showed that the sequence of the ∼150-kDa protein was ED XNELPP, which is identical to that of human FH. The identity of this ∼150-kDa protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis with specific anti-human FH antibodies (Fig. 2A). For unknown reasons, the eluted FH migrated as a doublet band, with a minor component of lower molecular weight. A similar observation has been made in another bacterial system (30.Kotarsky H. Hellwage J. Johnsson E. Skerka C. Svensson H.G. Lindahl G. Sjöbring U. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3349-3354PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the ∼130-kDa protein was identical to the β protein itself, indicating that this protein is partially released from the bacterial cell wall during the elution step. This observation was not surprising, because previous studies have shown that β is selectively released from whole bacteria when incubated at nonneutral pH (12.Lindahl G. Åkerström B. Vaerman J.-P. Stenberg L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, the ∼60-kDa protein was identified as the heavy chain (αH) of human IgA (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that β-expressing GBS not only bind IgA-Fc but also bind human FH. To analyze whether pure β protein has the same properties as β expressed on the bacterial cell surface, human EDTA-plasma was passed through a column containing highly purified β. Elution of bound proteins and analysis by SDS-PAGE demonstrated protein species of ∼150 and ∼60 kDa, and the ∼150-kDa protein was identified as FH using specific antibodies (Fig. 2B). The ∼60-kDa protein was similarly identified as IgA heavy chain (data not shown). The eluates also contained protein species of ∼75, ∼55, and ∼30 kDa. Amino-terminal sequencing identified the ∼55-kDa protein as a variant of the IgA heavy chain that for unknown reasons migrated faster than the major species. The ∼30-kDa proteins were identified as Ig light chains (L) (data not shown). The identity of the minor ∼75-kDa protein species is unknown. Absorption of these plasma proteins was not seen when plasma was passed through a column containing the GBS surface α protein, which is unrelated to β (29.Michel J.L. Madoff L.C. Olson K. Kling D.E. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10060-10064Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These results show that pure immobilized β specifically binds FH and IgA present in human plasma. The interaction between FH and protein β was further characterized by analyzing whether pure FH binds to whole β-expressing streptococci. The β-expressing wild type strain A909 was indeed able to bind pure FH (Fig. 3). No binding of FH was observed to the β-negative strain Δbac, but binding of FH was restored in the trans-complemented strain Δbac/pLZ bac. Thus, GBS bacteria were able to bind pure FH, and the binding was mediated by β. To investigate the ability of pure β to bind pure FH, the β protein was subjected to Western blot analysis using unlabeled FH as probe and anti-FH for detection. As shown in Fig. 4A, pure β bound FH in this analysis, while no binding was observed for two control proteins, the GBS surface proteins Rib and α, which are unrelated to β (5.Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Stenberg L. Lindahl G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1593-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29.Michel J.L. Madoff L.C. Olson K. Kling D.E. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18892-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the three GBS proteins were analyzed for FH-binding ability after immobilization in the wells of microtiter plates (data not shown). Binding of pure β to FH could also be demonstrated in a Western blot, in which FH was present on the blotting membrane and unlabeled β was used as the probe (Fig. 4B). In this analysis, the β protein also bound its other known ligand, human serum IgA, while no binding was detected for the control protein bovine serum albumin (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained when β in solution was analyzed for its ability to bind FH, IgA, and bovine serum albumin immobilized in the wells of microtiter plates (data not shown). Together, these data show that β binds directly to FH and that no other components in plasma or on the bacterial cell surface are required for the interaction. To analyze whether β proteins expressed by different GBS strains have similar properties with regard to FH binding, β was extracted from five different GBS strains of serotypes Ia and Ib. These extracts were prepared by incubating whole bacteria at"
https://openalex.org/W1999954836,"The EC50 of agonists and the partial agonist activity of antagonists are crucial parameters for steroid hormone control of gene expression and endocrine therapies. These parameters have been shown to be modulated by a naturally occurring cis-acting element, called the glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME) that binds two proteins, GMEB-1 and -2. We now present evidence that the GMEBs contact Ubc9, which is the mammalian homolog of a yeast E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Ubc9 also binds to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). Ubc9 displays no intrinsic transactivation activity but modifies both the absolute amount of induced gene product and the fold induction by GR. With high concentrations of GR, added Ubc9 also reduces the EC50 of agonists and increases the partial agonist activity of antagonists in a manner that is independent of the ability of Ubc9 to transfer SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier-1) to proteins. This new activity of Ubc9 requires only the ligand binding domain of GR and part of the hinge region. Interestingly, Ubc9 modulation of full-length GR transcriptional properties can be seen in the absence of a GME. This, though, is consistent with the GME acting by increasing the local concentration of Ubc9, which then activates a previously unobserved target in the transcriptional machinery. With high concentrations of Ubc9 and GR, Ubc9 binding to GR appears to be sufficient to permit Ubc9 to act independently of the GME.

The mechanism used to achieve these objectives is basically the same for all members of the steroid receptor superfamily. Ligand enters the cell by passive diffusion and binds to an intracellular receptor protein. After a still poorly understood step called activation, the receptor steroid complexes acquire an increased affinity for DNA and bind to specific DNA sequences called hormone response elements. These DNA-bound receptor complexes recruit an ever increasing number of coactivators, corepressors, and comodulators, the combination of which interacts with the transcriptional machinery to increase or decrease the magnitude of gene transcription (1.Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 2.Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of circulating steroids in mammals are usually well below that required for maximal induction of the regulated genes and much closer to that which is required, according to the dose-response curve, to afford half-maximal induction of most genes (i.e. the EC50). This permits relatively small differences in steroid hormone concentration to cause major changes in the levels of gene activation or repression. Conversely, any process that modifies the position of the dose-response curve (or the value of the EC50) will also affect the levels of gene expression (3.Simons Jr., S.S. Mercier L. Miller N.R. Miller P.A. Oshima H. Sistare F.D. Thompson E.B. Wasner G. Yen P.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2244s-2252sPubMed Google Scholar,4.Simons Jr., S.S. Oshima H. Szapary D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). In extreme conditions, the dose-response curves of two regulated genes can be so different that a physiological concentration of steroid will cause full induction, or repression, of one gene and have no effect on the other. Thus, processes or factors that modify the dose-response curve or EC50 represent an additional mechanism for achieving differential control of gene expression by steroid hormones in cells and organisms. A major clinical application of steroid hormones involves antisteroids, which block the actions of the endogenous hormones. Antisteroids, or antagonists, have found widespread use in endocrine therapy of such conditions as breast cancer (5.Jordan V.C. Murphy C.S. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 578-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), pregnancy (6.Baulieu E.E. Science. 1989; 245: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and prostate cancer (7.Crawford E.D. Eisenberger M.A. McLeod D.G. Spaulding J.T. Benson R. Dorr F.A. Blumenstein B.A. Davis M.A. Goodman P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). However, a puzzling feature of antisteroids is that they often display residual amounts of agonist activity that can vary between genes and among cells (8.Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 9.Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol.

Clearly an understanding of the parameters that affect the partial agonist activity of antisteroids would be of major assistance in their clinical uses. Several years ago, we described the first cis-acting element that could modify both the dose-response curve of agonist steroids and the partial agonist activity of antisteroids. This element, which we named the glucocorticoid modulatory element (GME),1 is located at −3.6 kb of the rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase gene (14.Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol.

The GMEBs possess intrinsic transactivation activity, they interact with each other in addition to GRs and CBP, they bind to DNA, they inhibit GR total transactivation, and they cause both a right shift in the dose-response curve of agonists and a decrease in the partial agonist activity of antagonists, presumably due to squelching (16.Oshima H.

Interestingly, GMEB-1 and -2 each possess a region of 93 amino acids that is 80% identical (24.Kaul S. Blackford Jr., J.A. Chen J. Ogryzko V.V. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1010-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several other molecules with transcriptional activity have been found to have a high degree of homology with this 93-amino acid region and thus may comprise a family of related molecules (24.Kaul S. Blackford Jr., J.A. Chen J. Ogryzko V.V. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1010-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The two best characterized members of this possible superfamily are Suppressin (25.Ban E.M. LeBoeuf R.D. Immunol. Res. 1994; 13: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the Drosophilaprotein called DEAF-1 (26.Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Suppressin has been described as a global negative regulator of human cell proliferation, and especially the immune system, and appears to be the short form of a protein called NUDR (27.Huggenvik J.I. Michelson R.J. Collard M.W. Ziemba A.J. Gurley P. Mowen K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1619-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). DEAF-1 is a transcriptional cofactor from Drosophila that is required for the activity of a 120-bp response element of the Deformed gene. To further define the mechanism of action of the GME, we sought to identify those molecules that the GMEBs contact and could thus be involved in modulating GR transcriptional properties. In view of the known ability of the GMEBs to homo- and hetero-oligomerize (16.Oshima H. Szapary D. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21893-21910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar),2 it is possible that the GMEBs might also heterooligomerize with other members of the KDWK superfamily, such as Suppressin and DEAF-1. Alternatively, a currently unidentified protein may be involved. In this study, we examined Suppressin and DEAF-1 for their ability to interact with the GMEBs and used a yeast two-hybrid screen to isolate other potential interacting proteins. One of the proteins identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen is Ubc9, which is a human homolog of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes of yeast. Ubc9 often conjugates an ubiquitin-like molecule, called small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1), to proteins in vertebrate cells (28.Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T.

Sumoylation of proteins can have a variety of effects, such as inhibiting the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Mdm2 (30.Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), increasing the nuclear translocation of RanGAP1 (31.Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J.

A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, Ubc9 also displays many of the same activities with other proteins in a manner that is independent of sumoylation, for example enhancing the transcriptional activity of ETS1 (36.Hahn S.L. Wasylyk B. Criqui-Filipe P. Criqui P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and AR (37.Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Karvonen U. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5602-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, Ubc9 appears to have both enzymatic and non-enzymatic effects in cells. Ubc9 also binds to a large number of proteins, possibly due to electrostatic interactions that are mediated by the presence of patches of both positive and negative charges on the surface of Ubc9 (40.Tong H. Hateboer G. Perrakis A. Bernards R. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21381-21387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that neither Suppressin nor a mammalian homolog of DEAF-1 are involved in GME action. Conversely, Ubc9 exhibits all of the characteristics expected for an intermediate that would participate in the ability of the GME to modulate the dose-response curve and partial agonist activity of GR complexes. These effects occur in the absence of sumoylation by Ubc9. Unless otherwise indicated, all operations were performed at 0 °C. Yeast media (Bio 101 Inc., Vista, CA), 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma), and 5-fluroorotic acid (Invitrogen) were all commercially available. Dexamethasone (Dex) was obtained from Sigma.

Restriction enzymes and digestions were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Anti-GMEB antibody, which detects both native and recombinant GMEB-1 and -2, has been described (22.Zeng H. Jackson D.A. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol.

Anti-DEAF-I antibody (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-Suppressin antibody (mouse monoclonal) were gifts from William McGinnis (University of California, San Diego, CA) and Robert LeBoeuf (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL), respectively. The following plasmid constructs (pM/GMEB-1, pVP16/GMEB-1, pCMVSport/GMEB-1, FLAG/GMEB-1, pcDNA3.1/HisA/GMEB-1, pM/GMEB-2, pVP16/GMEB-2, pCR II/GMEB-2, pcDNA3.1/HisA/GMEB-2, FLAG/GMEB-2, pcDNA3.1/HisC/GR, pR BalI17, pM/GR, pVP16/GR, pM, and pVP16) (24.Kaul S.

Similarly, pM/DEAF-1 and pVP16/DEAF-1 constructs were prepared by cloning the PCR amplified product from DEAF-1-pET15b (William McGinnis, University of California, San Diego, CA) into the MluI and XbaI sites of pM and pVp16. mouse Ubc9 (mUbc9) constructs VP16/mUbc9, pFLAGCMV2/mUbc9, and the mutant pFLAGCMV2/mUbc9[C93S] were kind gifts from Olli Jänne (University of Helsinki, Finland). GAL/mUbc9 was prepared by cloning a SalI-BamHI fragment of VP16/mUbc9 into pM (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). RanGap-pET15b was generously provided by Mary Dasso (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Renilla TS was a gift from Nasreldin M. Ibrahim, Otto Fröhlich, and S. Russ Price (Emory University School of Medicine). GAL/GR-525C was constructed using PCR amplification of pSVLGR with the 5′ primer of 5′-CGGGATCCGTGGAGTCTCACAAGACACTTCGGAAAATCCT-3′ and the 3′ primer of 5′-GCTCTAGATTCATTTTTGATGAAACAGAAGCTTTTTGATA-3′. The resulting PCR products were purified using a Wizard direct gel purification kit, digested with BamHI and XbaI, and ligated into the pM (CLONTECH) vector using the same restriction sites. GAL/GR-407C was similarly prepared using the 5′ primer of 5′-ATGGATCCGGTCAGTGTTTTCTAATG-3′ and the 3′ primer of 5′-TATCTAGAGTCATTTTTGATGAAACAG-3′. The PCR products were cut with BamHI and XhoI and ligated with pM vector at the BamHI/XhoI site. pPC86/Ubc9[1003] is the original clone isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen using GMEB-1 (in pDB-Leu) as the bait and an adult rat liver cDNA library (Invitrogen) in pPC86. The full-length rat Ubc9 (rUbc9) was excised as a SalI-NotI fragment and cloned into the corresponding sites of pCMVSport (Invitrogen) to give pCMVSport/rUbc9. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pCMVSport/Ubc9 was cloned into the corresponding sites of pSG5 to provide pSG5/rUbc9. The open reading frame of GMEB-1 was PCR-amplified with Pfu polymerase for high fidelity using oligonucleotides SK200 (5′-CT GAA TTC ATG TCG ACG ATG GCT AAT GCA G-3′) and SK201 (5′-CCC TGC GGC CGC CAG TTA ATC CTC TAA GAC-3′) and pM/GMEB-1 as the template. The above oligonucleotides were designed to create SalI and NotI at 5′ and 3′ ends of the PCR fragment. The amplified fragment was cloned in the above sites of pDB-Leu. The clones obtained were sequenced to confirm the correct frame with Gal-4 DBD of the plasmid. GMEB-1 cDNA from GAL/GMEB-1 was cloned into the SalI and NotI sites of pPC86. GMEB-2 was cloned into the NcoI and SpeI sites of pDB-Leu from pCRII/GMEB2 (22.Zeng H. Jackson D.A. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17756-17762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GMEB-2 cDNA from GAL/GMEB-2 was cloned into the SalI and SpeI sites of pPC86. pSG5/rUbc9 was modified using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Two mutagenic oligonucleotides (UBC1, GGCACAGTGTCCCTGTCCATCCTGG; UBC2, CCAGGATGGACAGGGACACTGTGCC) were used in the amplification reaction with pSG5/rUbc9 as the template. The mutation of C93S was determined by sequencing. The 2.3-kb hSA cDNA (Stratagene Liver catalog number 937224), cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pBluescript SK, was excised with EcoRI and KpnI and inserted into the pFLAG/CMV2 vector. The hSA insert was then excised from hSA/pFLAG/CMV2 using EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pSG5 to yield hSA/pSG5. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2). Transient transfections were achieved using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) or 5 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) in 3 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) without serum in 60-mm dishes (10-fold less in 24-well plates). The total transfected DNA was adjusted to 300 ng/well of a 24-well plate (or 3 μg/60-mm dish) with pBluescriptII SK+ (Stratagene). Renilla TS (5–10 ng/well of a 24-well plate) was included as an internal control. Cells were incubated with plasmid DNA, Opti-MEM I, and LipofectAMINE reagent for 24 h, after which this mixture was replaced by the normal media (5% fetal calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). The cells were induced with steroids 24 h after the start of transfection and then harvested after an additional 24 h. The cells were lysed and assayed for reporter gene activity using the Dual Luciferase assay reagents according to manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured by an EG & G Berthhold's luminometer (Microlumat LB 96 P). Small scale and library scale transformations of yeast Mav203 cells with GAL or VP16 constructs of GMEB-1 or -2 were performed using the competent and highly competent cells from Invitrogen as per the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast two-hybrid selection was conducted with GAL/GMEB-1 or -2 and an adult rat liver cDNA library fused to VP16 (Invitrogen). Plasmids were obtained from putative yeast clones according to the instructions for the Proquest two-hybrid system, and the DNA thus obtained was transformed into Escherichia coli (Electromax DH10B) by electroporation according to manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of β-galactosidase activity was accomplished according to the protocol of the Hybrid Hunter version kit (Invitrogen). pCMVSport/GMEB-1 (SP6), PCR 2.1/GMEB-2 (T7), pET15b/Suppressin (T7), and pET15b/DEAF-I (T7) were transcribed/translated using the RNA polymerase indicated in parentheses in the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel shift assays to detect the binding of GMEB-1, GMEB-2, DEAF-I, Suppressin, and HTC cytosol to a GME oligonucleotide were conducted as described (22.Zeng H. Jackson D.A. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17756-17762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sequences of the GME and mutant oligonucleotides (M1, M2, and M3) have been described (14.Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 416-428PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shift assays with the deformed response element were conducted according to Gross et al. (26.Gross C.T. McGinnis W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). GMEB-1 or GMEB-2 and RanGAP were in vitro transcribed and translated in absence or presence of purified SUMO-1 or GST-SUMO-1 and Xenopus Ubc9 (gifts from Mary Dasso, NCI) (44.Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The products were run on a standard 10% SDS-PAGE gel. GMEB-1 and GMEB-2 fusion proteins with a FLAG tag at the NH2 terminus were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the BAC to BACTM baculovirus expression system according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). M2-agarose beads (anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody conjugated to agarose, Sigma) were prepared by treating them with 100 mm glycine·HCl buffer (pH 2.5, 10 volumes) for 2–3 min, which was then neutralized with 1 M Tris·HCl (pH 8.0, 10 volumes). The beads were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and once with extraction buffer (10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris·HCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.2% Tween, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, and 500 mm KCl). Aliquots (100 μl) of Sf9 cell extracts containing baculovirus-expressed FLAG-mUbc9 were incubated with the above prepared M2-agarose beads for 2–3 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed five times with extraction buffer followed by one wash with elution buffer (10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris·HCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.2% Tween, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, and 250 mm KCl). The radioactive proteins (labeled with [35S]methionine during in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates) were added separately to the M2 beads bound with FLAG-Ubc9 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then at 4 °C for 12–16 h. The beads were washed with elution buffer five times. Finally the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of elution buffer and 20 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer, boiled for 3–5 min, and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. The recommended procedure for the Mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid assay kit (CLONTECH) was modified slightly by changing from a CAT reporter (pG5CAT) to a luciferase reporter pFRLuc (Stratagene). Smaller amounts of GAL4 and VP16 chimera DNAs were used (0.5 μg) because of the higher sensitivity of the luciferase reporter. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed in triplicate several times. The error bars in graphs of individual experiments correspond to the S.D. of the triplicate values. Best-fit curves (R2 ≥ 0.95) for each experiment to yield a single EC50 value were obtained with KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The values of n independent experiments are analyzed for statistical significance by the two-tailed Student's t test using the program “InStat 2.03” for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). In paired analyses, all comparisons in a given figure are performed at the same time with the same seeding of cells and then analyzed for n different experiments. GMEB-1 and -2 (24.Kaul S.

However, no significant interaction of the GMEBs with either DEAF-1 or Suppressin was observed in either mammalian two-hybrid or gel shift assays (data not shown). Given the lack of interaction with the GMEBs by other members of the KDWK family, we used chimeras of GAL-DBD and GMEB-1 or -2 to identify potential interacting proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screen. One clone containing an open reading frame of 528 nucleotides was isolated from an adult rat liver cDNA library that was identical to rat Ubc9.

Cysteine residues introduced into the N-terminal regions of subunits b and c of ATP synthase (bL2C/cS2C) were readily oxidized by treating the expressing cells with CuCl2 to form predominantly a b-c cross-link with b-b and c-c cross-links being minor products. The oxidized ATP synthases, either in the inverted membrane vesicles or in the reconstituted proteoliposomes, showed drastically decreased proton pumping and ATPase activities compared with the reduced ones. Also, the oxidized F0, either in the F1-stripped inverted vesicles or in the reconstituted F0-proteoliposomes, hardly mediated passive proton translocation through F0. Careful analysis using single mutants (bL2C or cS2C) as controls indicated that the b-c cross-link was responsible for these defects. Thus, rotation of the c-oligomer ring relative to subunit b is obligatory for proton translocation; if there is no rotation of the c-ring there is no proton flow through F0.

A low resolution crystal structure of an F1+c10 subcomplex from yeast mitochondria revealed a tight interaction between γε subunits of F1 and the c-ring of F0 (13.Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The cross-links were readily made between introduced cysteines of subunit c and γε subunits of F1 without losing functional coupling between F1 and F0 (14.Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ATP facilitated the movement of subunit c relative to subunit a that was assessed by the a-c cross-link (15.Hutcheon M.L. Duncan T.M. Ngai H. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8519-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A side stalk, made of b2 and δ, connects the stator of F0 and that of F1 and prevents the stators from being dragged by rotation of the central stalk (16.Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). From these and other observations, it is generally accepted that the c-ring rotates relative to stator subunits ab2 (17.Junge W.

Thus, proton influx into the cytoplasm through F0 (in the case of mitochondria, into the matrix) would cause rotation of the c-ring and hence the central γε stalk, which then enforces each catalytic site in F1 to synthesize ATP. As a reverse reaction, ATP hydrolysis in F1 drives reverse rotation of the γε stalk and c-ring, which causes proton efflux through F0. To explore the mechanism of proton flow through F0 and its coupling with rotation, measurement of the proton flow together with the c-ring rotation is absolutely required. The study has been impeded by the unstable nature of ATP synthases; the structural and functional integrity of the enzyme is easily damaged during experimental procedures (20.Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21.Jones P.C. Hermolin J. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31340-31346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, the cross-linking between subunits b and c in Escherichia coli ATP synthase impairs coupling between proton pumping and ATPase activity (21.Jones P.C. Hermolin J. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31340-31346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To overcome this difficulty, we have established an expression system for a stable ATP synthase of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TF0F1)1in E. coli cells. Cysteine residues introduced into subunits b and c of TF0F1 were readily cross-linked in the presence of CuCl2. The resultant enzyme lost both proton pumping and ATPase activity, an indication of retaining tight coupling after the cross-linking. The passive proton translocation through F0was also disabled by this cross-link. Thus, the c-ring must rotate for protons to pass through F0.DISCUSSIONThe major message of this report concerns the relation between the c-ring rotation and the proton flow through F0. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the F0 with a disulfide cross-link between subunits b and c was unable to mediate proton translocation (Fig. 4). With prevented proton translocation, ATP hydrolysis was also prevented, suggesting the retention of tight coupling between F0 and F1 in the cross-link containing TF0F1 (Fig. 3). Regardless of the directions of proton translocation, either the periplasmic side to the cytoplasmic side or the cytoplasmic side to the periplasmic side, translocations were equally blocked by the cross-linking. The inactivation is reversible; reduction of the disulfide restored the proton translocation by F0 and ATP-driven proton pumping by TF0F1. These results strongly indicate that protons cannot pass through F0 without rotation of the c-ring, or conversely, rotation of the c-ring must accompany proton translocation. Cross-linking of b and c subunits caused neither a proton leak nor the unleashing of activation of ATPase of F1. Thus the possibility that the cross-link itself disrupts the function of F0 is minimal, if not null. In our experimental setups, proton translocations across membranes down the Δμ̃H+ were measured. Previous data from other laboratories indicate that the coupling of proton translocation and c-ring rotation is maintained even in the absence of Δμ̃H+. Dimroth's group has detected 22Na+/Na+ exchange across proteoliposome membranes in the absence of Δμ̃H+through F0 isolated from Na+-transporting ATP synthase of Propionigenium modestum (33.Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). They did not examine the movement of the c-ring but assumed that the back-and-forth thermal rotary motion of the c-ring in F0 was responsible for the exchange. Fillingame and his colleagues (21.Jones P.C. Hermolin J. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31340-31346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) demonstrated by using the b-ccross-linking of uncoupled E. coli ATP synthase that the subunit c adjacent to subunit b is mobile and exchanges with subunits c that initially occupied other positions. This exchange occurs independently of ATP, suggesting thermal motion of the c-ring. Although not tested by their experiments, it is natural to assume that this thermal motion accompanies proton translocation. Taken together, it is safe to conclude that isolated F0 is a rotary proton channel in which the “friction” between rotor and stator is small enough to allow free fluctuating rotary motion even by environmental thermal energy. Nevertheless, this friction may differentiate the F0 channel from other open ion channels; the ion conductance of the former is several orders lower than that of the latter (F0, ∼7 s−1 (33.Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); potassium channel, >106 s−1 (34.Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T.

Once Δμ̃H+ is applied, the F0 rotary channel starts to rotate unidirectionally and protons are transported also unidirectionally across membranes. ATP synthases catalyze ATP synthesis/hydrolysis coupled with a transmembrane H+ (proton) translocation in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria (1.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of two portions, a water-soluble F1, which has catalytic sites for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis (4.Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28853-28856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and a membrane-integrated F0, which mediates H+ translocation. The bacterial enzyme has the simplest subunit structure, α3β3γ1δ1ε1for F1 and a1b2c10–11(?)for F0. F1 is easily and reversibly detached from F0 by removal of Mg2+ in a low ionic strength solution. F1 is by itself a rotary motor driven by ATP hydrolysis (5.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 6.Ren H. Allison W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in which a central stalk made of γ and ε subunits rotates relative to the surrounding α3β3 hexamer ring (7.Aggeler R. Ogilvie I.

F0 in ATP synthase is thought to work as a rotary motor driven by the energy of proton translocation down the electrochemical potential.

Because these responses are promoted most effectively by large VWF multimers, we hypothesized that receptor clustering modulates GP Ib-IX function. To test this, GP IX was fused at its cytoplasmic tail to tandem repeats of FKBP, and GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 and αIIbβ3 were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Under flow conditions at wall shear rates of up to 2000 s−1, GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 mediated cell tethering to immobilized VWF, just as in platelets. Conditional oligomerization of GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 by AP20187, a cell-permeable FKBP dimerizer, caused a decrease in cell translocation velocities on VWF (p < 0.001). Moreover, clustering of GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 by AP20187 led to an increase in αIIbβ3 function, manifested under static conditions by increased cell adhesion to fibrinogen (p< 0.01) and under flow by increased stable cell adhesion to VWF (p < 0.04). Clustering of GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2also stimulated rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of ectopically expressed Syk, a putative downstream effector of GP Ib-IX in platelets. These studies establish that GP Ib-IX oligomerization, per se, affects the interaction of this receptor with VWF and its ability to influence the adhesive function of αIIbβ3. By extrapolation, GP Ib-IX clustering in platelets may promote thrombus formation.

The GP Ib-IX-V complex consists of four leucine-rich, type I transmembrane polypeptides, two linked by disulfide bonds (GP Ibα and GP Ibβ), and two linked noncovalently (GP IX and GP V).

Blood. 1999; 94: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism(s) whereby VWF binding to GP Ib-IX triggers αIIbβ3-dependent functions remains unclear. von Willbrand factor hemagglutinin fluorescein isothiocyanate Chinese hamster ovary One structural change in the GP Ib-IX complex that could play a role in its adhesive and signaling functions is oligomerization or clustering within the plane of the plasma membrane. For example, GP Ib-IX might exist as individual 2:2:2:1 complexes or as a series of larger-order oligomers, either constitutively or in response to VWF binding. Consistent with the latter, it has long been known that there is a correlation between VWF multimer size and GP Ib-IX-mediated platelet function, as seen in variant von Willebrand disease patients lacking the largest VWF multimers (20.Sadler J.E. Mannucci P.M. Berntorp E. Bochkov N. Boulyjenkov V. Ginsburg D. Meyer D. Peake I. Rodeghiero F. Srivastava A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, in whom ultra-large VWF multimers may cause pathological platelet thrombi (21.Moake J.L. Rudy C.K. Troll J.H. Weinstein M.J. Colannino N.M. Azocar J. Seder R.H. Hong S.L. Deykin D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 307: 1432-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Further support for the functional significance of GP Ib-IX clustering comes from the following observations: 1) the binding of multivalent but not monovalent forms of VWF or antibodies to GP Ib-IX stimulates platelets (22.Yanabu M. Ozaki Y. Nomura S. Miyake T. Miyazaki Y. Kagawa H. Yamanaka Y. Asazuma N. Satoh K. Kume S. Komiyama Y. Fukuhara S. Blood. 1997; 89: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2) a subset of palmitoylated GP Ib-IX complexes may be organized into high-density patches within platelet membrane lipid rafts (23.Shrimpton C.N. Borthakur G. Cruz M.A. Dong J.F. Lopez J.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: P2640Google Scholar), and 3) deletion of the binding sites on GP Ibα for 14-3-3ζ and filamin A increases the lateral mobility of GP Ib-IX in the plane of the membrane, a possible prerequisite for regulated clustering of this receptor (24.Dong J.F. Li C.Q. Sae-Tung G. Hyun W. Afshar-Kharghan V. López J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12421-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that clustering of GP Ib-IX may play a prominent role in the adhesive and signaling functions of this receptor. Because multivalent ligands like VWF or anti-GP Ib-IX antibodies may have effects in addition to clustering of the receptor, we used small molecule dimerizer technology to cluster GP Ib-IX specifically and conditionally from within the cell (25.Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 26.Amara J.F. Clackson T. Rivera V.M. Guo T. Keenan T. Natesan S. Pollock R.

This system has been used previously to examine the effects of clustering of other plasma membrane receptors, including αIIbβ3 (28.Freiberg R.A. Spencer D.M. Choate K.A. Peng P.D. Schreiber S.L.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A chimeric GP IX subunit was constructed that contained two tandem FKBP repeats fused to the C terminus of the short cytoplasmic tail. After co-expression with GP Ibα and GP Ibβ in CHO cells, the receptor complex was clustered into oligomers by the addition of AP20187, a cell-permeable, bivalent FKBP ligand (30.Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). By assessment of GP Ib-IX functions under static and flow conditions, we establish that oligomerization of GP Ib-IX affects the interaction of this receptor with VWF and the ability of GP Ib-IX to promote stable cell adhesion mediated by αIIbβ3. Full-length human GP IX in pBluescript was used as a template for PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) to place HindIII and XbaI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen) along with an XbaI cassette containing two FKBP repeats and the influenza viral hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence, such that the 3′ end of GP IX was in-frame with the 5′ end of (FKBP)2. Each FKBP repeat contained a point mutation (F36V) that precludes binding to endogenous FKBP ligands but allows interaction with the bivalent small molecule ligand AP20187 (a gift from Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA) (30.Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Clones positive for GP IX(FKBP)2 were identified by colony PCR and restriction digest analysis, and complete coding sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The A5 CHO cell line, which stably expresses αIIbβ3, was a gift from Mark Ginsberg (Scripps Research Institute) (31.O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). A5 sublines also expressing GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 were produced by co-transfection of GP Ibα and GP Ibβ in pDX (a gift from Jose Lopez; Baylor College of Medicine), GP IX(FKBP)2 in pcDNA 3.1+, and CD Hyg for hygromycin resistance. After antibiotic selection, single cell clones were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using antibodies A2A9 (specific for αIIbβ3; Ref. 32.Bennett J.S. Hoxie J.A. Leitman S.S. Vilaire G. Cines D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2417-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and AP-1 (specific for GP Ibα; Ref. 33.Okita J.R. Pidard D. Newman P.J. Montgomery R.R. Kunicki T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Where indicated, these double-stable cell lines were transiently transfected with EMCV/Syk to assess the effects of GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 clustering on tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (34.Gao J. Zoller K. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6414-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, harvested using 0.5 mmEDTA, and lysed for 30 min in ice-cold Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 158 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, plus the inhibitors Pefabloc, aprotinin, leupeptin, and sodium orthovanadate). After clarification, lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody Y-11 against the HA tag on GP IX(FKBP)2(Santa Cruz Laboratories, Santa Cruz, CA). To monitor association of GP IX(FKBP)2 with GP Ibα and GP Ibβ, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using the complex-dependent, GP IX-reactive monoclonal antibody AK-1 (Ref. 35.Du X. Beutler L. Ruan C. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; a gift from Michael Berndt; Baker Research Institute) and Western blotted using rabbit polyclonal antiserum 3584 specific for GP Ibα (36.Vicente V. Houghten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 274-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands on Western blots were detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal WestPico reagent (Pierce). CHO cells were harvested and resuspended to 1 × 107 cells/ml in modified Tyrodes buffer (137 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 26 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5.0 mm Hepes, pH 7.35) (37.Huang M.-M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To examine surface expression of receptors, cells were incubated for 30 min with antibodies against either GP Ibα (AP-1 conjugated to Alexa-488), GP IX (SZ-1; a gift from Xiaping Du (University of Illinois) and C. Ruan (Suzhou Medical College); Ref. 35.Du X. Beutler L. Ruan C. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 1987; 69: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or αIIbβ3 (biotin-A2A9). When a fluorescent secondary reagent was needed, the cells were washed with ice-cold buffer, resuspended in the presence of a 1:25 dilution of FITC goat anti-mouse IgG (for SZ-1; BIOSOURCE) or phycoerythrin-streptavidin (for biotin-A2A9; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and incubated for an additional 15 min on ice. Samples were then diluted with a 10-fold excess of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide, and live (propidium iodide-negative) cells were analyzed in a FACSCalibur® flow cytometer (BC PharMingen). For determination of soluble VWF binding, VWF was labeled with FITC (38.Goto S. Salomon D.R. Ikeda Y. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23352-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). CHO cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μm AP20187 or with an equivalent volume of the vehicle that was used as diluent (30.Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Then 10 μg/ml FITC-VWF was added for 20 min, and binding was assessed by flow cytometry (29.Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Specific VWF binding was defined as that prevented by 10 μg/ml AP-1 (33.Okita J.R. Pidard D. Newman P.J. Montgomery R.R. Kunicki T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In some cases, VWF binding was induced artificially with 1.0 mg/ml ristocetin (Sigma Chemical Co.) or 2 μg/ml botrocetin (39.Andrews R.K. Booth W.J. Gorman J.J. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8317-8326Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To determine whether clustering of GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 affects the activation state of αIIbβ3, cells were treated with 1 μm AP20187 for 10 min, and binding of the ligand-mimetic antibody biotin-PAC-1 was determined by flow cytometry (29.Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Specific PAC-1 binding was defined as that inhibitable by 10 μm Integrilin, an αIIbβ3-selective antagonist (a gift from David Phillips; Cor Therapeutics Inc., South San Francisco, CA). In some cases, the combined effects of AP20187 and VWF binding to GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 were examined by determining PAC-1 binding in the presence of the dimeric A1 domain fragment of VWF. The A1 fragment can bind to GP Ib-IX in response to ristocetin or botrocetin but, in contrast to VWF, cannot bind to αIIbβ3 (40.Miyata S. Goto S. Federici A.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9046-9053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,41.Celikel R. Ruggeri Z.M. Varughese K.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When the VWF A1 domain was used, its binding to GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 was verified separately using the monoclonal antibody RG46 (42.Mohri H. Yoshioka A. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17361-17367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immulon-2 HB microtiter wells (Dynex Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with VWF (63.Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) or purified fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) at coating concentrations between 0.1 and 10 μg/ml in coating buffer and then blocked with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (29.Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). CHO cell transfectants were harvested, resuspended to 1 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated with 1 μm AP20187 or vehicle for 10 min. Then 100-μl aliquots were added to the microtiter wells for 45 min at 37 °C. After three gentle washes with modified Tyrodes buffer, cell adhesion was quantified using an acid phosphatase assay. To prepare washed red blood cells, 6 parts of venous blood from healthy adult donors were drawn into 1 part of NIH-ACD and centrifuged at 2100 × g for 15 min at room temperature. After removing the plasma and buffy coat, the red cells were resuspended in modified Tyrodes buffer, pH 6.5. After repeating this procedure three times, the erythrocytes were resuspended in modified Tyrodes buffer, pH 7.4, with 5% bovine serum albumin. The number of residual platelets in this preparation was minimal (<2 × 106 platelets/ml). CHO cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended to 1 × 107 cells/ml in modified Tyrodes buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2. Then cells were treated with either 1 μm AP20187 or vehicle for 30 min at room temperature, with or without selective inhibitors, as described in each experiment. Washed red cells were then added to yield a final CHO cell number of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml and a hematocrit of 42–48%. After the addition of 10 μm mepacrine to permit cell visualization, the cell suspensions were perfused through a modified Hele Shaw flow chamber whose bottom was constituted by a glass coverslip treated with a 40 μg/ml coating solution of purified VWF, as described previously (6.Savage B. Saldı́var E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was aspirated through the chamber with a Harvard syringe pump to produce flow rates calculated to generate wall shear rates of 200 or 2000 s−1at the chamber inlet. Cell-surface interactions were visualized in real time with an inverted epifluorescent microscope (Axiovert; Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) and recorded on videotape at the acquisition rate of 30 frames/s. Image analysis was performed off-line using Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA), and cell translocation velocity was calculated with an original computer program (6.Savage B. Saldı́var E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). A CHO cell was defined as exhibiting stable adhesion when its centroid was displaced by ≤1 cell diameter in 20 s. To study the functional effects of conditional oligomerization of GP Ib-IX, tandem FKBP dimerization domains and an HA tag were fused to the cytoplasmic tail of GP IX. Then GP IX(FKBP)2, along with GP Ibα and GP Ibβ, were stably expressed in A5 CHO cells, which already contain αIIbβ3. The GP V subunit is dispensable for the VWF receptor function of GP Ib-IX (43.Kahn M.L. Diacovo T.G. Bainton D.F. Lanza F. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Blood. 1999; 94: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Ramakrishnan V. Reeves P.S. DeGuzman F. Deshpande U. Ministri-Madrid K. DuBridge R.B. Phillips D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13336-13341Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and it was not included here to simplify the transfections. These new CHO cell clones are referred to here collectively as GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2/αIIbβ3 cells, and the results presented below are characteristic of all three independent clones examined. To assess whether GP IX(FKBP)2 was expressed, Triton X-100 cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with an anti-HA tag antibody. A single immunoreactive band of ∼44 kDa was observed, an electrophoretic mobility expected for full-length GP IX(FKBP)2 (Fig. 1A). No such band was observed in lysates from mock-transfected cells or from cells co-transfected with GP Ibα, GP Ibβ, and GP IX instead of GP IX(FKBP)2. GP Ibα could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with GP IX(FKBP)2 (Fig. 1B), indicating that these two subunits were expressed in a stable complex in CHO cells, just as reported for GP Ibα and wild-type GP IX (45.Li C.Q. Dong J.F. Lanza F. Sanan D.A. Sae-Tung G. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16302-16307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GP Ibα and GP IX(FKBP)2 were expressed on the cell surface along with αIIbβ3, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that GP IX(FKBP)2 can be successfully expressed on the surface of CHO cells in a GP Ib-IX complex. Consequently, the presence of FKBP repeats on GP IX should mediate clustering of the complex when cells are treated with AP20187, a cell-permeable, bivalent FKBP ligand (30.Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It is not possible to demonstrate a spontaneous interaction between soluble VWF and GP Ib-IX on platelets or CHO cells, but binding can be measured after the addition of ristocetin or after formation of a complex of VWF and botrocetin (46.Ruggeri Z.M. Savage B. Ruggeri Z.M. Von Willebrand Factor and the Mechanisms of Platelet Function. Springer, Berlin1998: 79-109Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked first whether oligomerization of GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 might affect steady-state interactions of the receptor with soluble FITC-VWF. As expected, there was no binding of FITC-VWF to untreated GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2/αIIbβ3 CHO cells, as detected by flow cytometry. Furthermore, when the cells were incubated for 30 min with 1 μm AP20187, an optimal concentration with respect to interaction of the dimerizer with FKBP in cells (30.Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X. Cerasoli F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), there was still no binding of FITC-VWF. The FITC-VWF was functional because specific binding increased approximately 5-fold in response to botrocetin. However, even this binding was unaffected by AP20187 (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with ristocetin instead of botrocetin (data not shown). Thus, at least under static conditions, oligomerization of GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2 has no discernable effect on the interaction of the receptor with soluble VWF. During vascular injury, platelets are exposed to VWF immobilized onto vascular matrices under conditions of hemodynamic flow. In this situation, the platelets become tethered to and roll on VWF in a manner dependent on GP Ib-IX; at this stage, no interaction of the cells with αIIbβ3 is required (6.Savage B. Saldı́var E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 7.Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Because GP Ib-IX can mediate a similar rolling response when ectopically expressed in CHO cells (47.Fredrickson B.J. Dong J.F. McIntire L.V. Lopez J.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 3684-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 49.Englund G.D. Bodnar R.J. Li Z.Y. Ruggeri Z.M. Du X.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16952-16959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we perfused GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2/αIIbβ3 cells over VWF at shear rates (γ) ranging from 200 to 2000 s−1 and examined whether receptor clustering affected cell rolling behavior. These shear rates reflect shear stresses of 8–80 dynes/cm2that are likely to occur in vivo under physiological or pathological circumstances (50.Ruggeri Z.M. FitzGerald G.A. Shattil S.J. Chien K.R. Breslow J.L. Leiden J.M. Rosenberg R.D. Seidman C. Molecular Basis of Cardiovascular Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1999: 566-590Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type CHO cells, GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2/αIIbβ3 cells tethered to and could roll on immobilized VWF. This response was blocked >95% by the anti-GP Ibα function-blocking antibody LJ-1B1, but not by 7E3 F(ab′)2, an anti-integrin β3function-blocking antibody. Thus, the presence of FKBP repeats on GP IX does not interfere with the ability of the receptor to support cell tethering to VWF under shear flow. When cells were treated for 30 min with 1 μm AP20187 and then exposed to VWF, their velocities of translocation were significantly lower than those of cells treated with vehicle alone (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). This difference was most notable at the shear rate of 2000 s−1, where there was a complete shift in the velocity distribution for AP20187-treated cells (mean velocity = 3.3 ± 0.2 μm s−1) compared with vehicle-treated cells (mean velocity = 5.7 ± 0.3 μm s−1) (Fig. 3). The effect of AP20187 was specific for the GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2/αIIbβ3 cells because it had no effect on CHO cells expressing wild-type GP Ib-IX and αIIbβ3 (data not shown). These results indicate that oligomerization of GP Ib-IX(FKBP)2, per se, modulates the adhesive interaction of this receptor with immobilized VWF under conditions of flow. In platelets, the binding of VWF to GP Ib-IX leads to an increase in the adhesive function of αIIbβ3, a process attributed to “inside-out” signaling from GP Ib-IX to αIIbβ3 (8.Berndt M.C. Shen Y. Dopheide S.M. Gardiner E.E. Andrews R.K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 51.De Marco L. Girolami A. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

One cardinal manifestation of inside-out signaling in platelets is affinity/avidity modulation, typically measured under static conditions by the binding of soluble fibrinogen or an αIIbβ3-specific ligand-mimetic antibody, such as PAC-1 (53.Shattil S.J.

Within 1 h of treatment, cultures accumulated an extracellular activity capable of cleaving a substrate for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This activity was inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or antibodies to uPA but not tPA. Pro-uPA activation was preceded by dramatic changes in lysosome trafficking and the extracellular appearance of cathepsin B and β-hexosaminidase but not cathepsins D or L. Co-treatment of cultures with the cathepsin B inhibitors CA-074 or Z-FA-FMK suppressed the cytostatic effects of TPA and activation of pro-uPA. In the absence of TPA, exogenously added cathepsin B activated pro-uPA and suppressed MCF10A-Neo proliferation. The cytostatic effects of both TPA and cathepsin B were suppressed in cells cultured in medium depleted of plasminogen/plasmin or supplemented with neutralizing TGF-β antibody. Pretreatment with cycloheximide did not suppress the exocytosis of cathepsin B or the activation of pro-uPA. Hence, TPA activates signaling processes that trigger the exocytosis of a subpopulation of lysosomes/endosomes containing cathepsin B. Subsequently, extracellular cathepsin B initiates a proteolytic cascade involving uPA, plasminogen, and plasmin that activates serum-derived latent TGF-β. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) suppresses the proliferation of the human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A-Neo by initiating proteolytic processes that activate latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in the serum used to supplement culture medium.

Latency is a consequence of intracellular processing. Specifically, after translation TGF-β1 polypeptides dimerize and subsequently undergo cleavage to yield amino-terminal latency-associated peptides and carboxyl-terminal peptides (11.Massague J. Annu.

Latency-associated peptides remain associated with the dimerized carboxyl-terminal peptides via electrostatic interactions, thus forming latent TGF-β.

Nature. 1994; 370: 460-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) suggest that these proteases may contribute to the in vivo activation of latent TGF-β1 in some situations, and data continue to be published documenting plasmin-mediated TGF-β activation in cell lines (25.Herbert J.M.

Reiners Jr., J.J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1303-1312PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). We recently reported that the spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A-Neo arrests in G1following exposure to 10 nm TPA (27.Guo M. Reiners Jr., J.J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1303-1312PubMed Google Scholar). This arrest developed quickly and was paralleled by the production of a cytostatic medium. A variety of approaches suggested that ∼50% of the cytostatic activity of TPA was mediated by a TGF-β family member. Surprisingly, the serum used to supplement the culture medium, and not the MCF10A-Neo cells, was the source of the latent cytokine (27.Guo M. Reiners Jr., J.J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1303-1312PubMed Google Scholar). The current study was initiated to identify the processes activated by TPA in MCF10A-Neo cultures responsible for the activation of latent TGF-β. Preliminary studies (27.Guo M. Reiners Jr., J.J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1303-1312PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the cytostatic effects of TPA could be inhibited by co-treatment with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Consequently, we hypothesized that a proteolytic cascade involving urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasmin was involved in this activation. This hypothesis proved to be correct. However, it involved an unexpected mechanism for the activation of pro-uPA. Specifically, TPA treatment of MCF10A-Neo cultures triggered the exocytosis of a subpopulation of lysosomes/endosomes, and released lysosomal/endosomal cathepsin B catalyzed the activation of pro-uPA. Aprotinin, cathepsin C, Me2SO, TPA, cycloheximide, l-lysine agarose, 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-glucosaminide, control murine IgG, control rabbit IgG, and a neutralizing polyclonal pan rabbit antibody made to a mixture of TGFβ1 + TGFβ1.2 + TGFβ2 + TGFβ5 were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant-derived human PAI-1 and cathepsins L and D were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The fluorescent substrates Z-GGR-AMC and Z-RR-AMC were obtained from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Neutralizing rabbit antibodies to tPA and uPA were purchased from American Diagnostic Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Protein G-agarose, trypsin, penicillin/streptomycin solution, and horse serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Purified human liver cathepsin B was purchased from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). l-[3,4,5-3H(N)]Leucine came from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The protease inhibitors E-64 and CA-074 were purchased from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, KY). The cysteine protease inhibitor Z-FA-FMK was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). The cathepsin D substrate Ac-GE(Edans)-Z-EVNLDAEF-Z-K(Dabcyl)-G-NH2 and standard Ac-RE(Edans)-A-NH2 were synthesized by P. Richardson (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). The MCF10A-Neo cell line was obtained from the Cell Lines Resource (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI). It was derived by transfection of the spontaneously immortalized, nontumorigenic human breast epithelial MCF10A cell line with plasmid Homer 6 (pHo6) and subsequent selection for G418 resistance. The MCF10A-Neo line consists of the pooled survivors. Detailed characterizations and descriptions of the derivations of the MCF10A and MCF10A-Neo cell lines have been published (28.Soule H.D.

Guo and J. J. Reiners, Jr., unpublished observations. MCF10A-Neo cells were cultured in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium as previously described (30.Basolo F.

The supplements consisted of human insulin (10 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), cholera toxin (100 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 5% horse serum. Proliferation studies were performed with cultures plated at a density that ensured exponential growth for a minimum of 4 days. The cultures were routinely treated 40–48 h after plating. The details of treatment are provided in the text. TPA, cycloheximide, E-64, CA-074, Z-GGR-AMC, Z-RR-AMC, and Z-FA-FMK were all dissolved and diluted in Me2SO. Organic solvent never exceeded 0.2% of total culture/assay volume. Aprotinin and PAI-1 were diluted in sterile water. Purified human cathepsin B was diluted in a solution containing 1 mm EDTA and 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The various antibodies used in this study were reconstituted/diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. For estimation of cell numbers, the cultures were harvested by exposure to a solution of 0.25% trypsin, 0.1 mm EDTA. Viability was assessed by determining the ability to exclude trypan blue. Culture medium supplemented with 5% horse serum was incubated with 12 μg/ml of a rabbit neutralizing polyclonal TGF-β pan antibody or 12 μg/ml of control rabbit IgG for 2 h at 37 °C. The medium was then chromatographed on a column of protein G-agarose that had been washed and equilibrated in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl. The eluant was used as a source of TGF-β-depleted medium. Medium supplemented with horse serum was also chromatographed on a column ofl-lysine-agarose that had been washed with 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. The eluant was used as a source of plasminogen/plasmin-depleted medium. Cells grown in 35-mm culture dishes were treated with varied concentrations of cycloheximide for 30 min. The cultures were then washed twice with PBS prior to being pulsed withl-[3,4,5-3H(N)]leucine (1 μCi/ml of culture medium) in the presence of fresh cycloheximide. The cultures were harvested at varied times thereafter for analyses of [3H]leucine incorporation into protein. The procedure used for the processing of labeled cells has been described in detail (31.Schöller A. Hong N.J. Bischer P. Reiners Jr., J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 944-954PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was detected by scintillation counting and expressed as dpm/106 cells. The cells were plated in either 35-mm culture dishes or 96-well culture plates. Culture medium was also added to a parallel set of wells/dishes that lacked cells. After 1.5–2 days in culture, the cells were treated with various antibodies or protease inhibitors 1 h prior to the addition of either Me2SO or TPA (10 nm). Culture medium (200 μl) was periodically removed thereafter and transferred to 96-well plates appropriate for fluorescent assay measurements. Analyses of uPA/tPA were initiated by the addition of 100 μm Z-GGR-AMC. The release of AMC was monitored for 12–15 min on a SPECTRAmax Gemini dual scanning microplate spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Parallel analyses were performed on culture medium taken from dishes/wells lacking cells. Changes in fluorescence over a set time were determined and converted to fmol of AMC by comparison to a standard curve. Cell-derived activity was calculated as the difference in activities of media derived from dishes/wells having and lacking cells. For the calculation of specific activities, cells were released from dishes/wells by treatment with 0.25% trypsin, 0.1 mmEDTA, and counted. Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity is reported as fmol of AMC produced per min per 103 cells. The protocol described by Linebaugh et al. (32.Linebaugh B.E. Sameni M. Day N.A. Sloane B.F. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was used for the assay of extracellular and intracellular cathepsin B. The cultures were treated as described above and washed twice with PBS at varied times after Me2SO or TPA addition before being covered with pericellular assay buffer (PAB), which consisted of Hanks' balanced salt solution lacking sodium bicarbonate but containing 0.6 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 2 mml-cysteine, and 25 mm PIPES, pH 7.0. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, 200 μl of the PAB solution was transferred to a 96-well plate. The assay was initiated by the addition of 100 μm Z-RR-AMC to each well in the absence or presence of 5–20 μm CA-074 and followed for 15 min on a fluorescence plate reader using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. To measure intracellular cathepsin B activity, the cultures were washed twice with PBS and then lysed with PAB supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysates were assayed as described above. Changes in fluorescence over time were determined and converted to fmol of AMC by comparison with a standard curve. Activity inhibited by CA-074 was considered to represent cathepsin B. With Z-RR-AMC as a substrate, this represented ∼90–95% of the total activity measured in Triton X-100 lysates. Duplicate cultures not used for the assay of cathepsin B were treated with trypsin/EDTA and counted. Cathepsin B specific activities are reported as fmol of AMC produced per min per 103 cells. Extracts prepared for cathepsin B analyses were also used for the assay of cathepsins L and D. The assay for cathepsin L was similar to that used for cathepsin B except for the substitution of Z-FR-AMC (100 μm) as substrate. Cleavage activity not inhibited by 10 μm CA-074 was considered to be cathepsinl-like activity. Cathepsin L specific activities are reported as fmol of AMC produced per min per 103 cells. Cathepsin D was assayed by a published procedure (33.Ladror U.S. Snyder S.W. Wang G.T. Holzman T.F. Kraft G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18422-18428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that monitors the cleavage of Ac-GE(Edans)-Z-EVNLDAEF-Z-K(Dabcyl)-G-NH2, a highly selective substrate for cathepsin D (33.Ladror U.S. Snyder S.W.

This peptide corresponds to a mutant of the amyloid B protein precursor having an Asn-Leu substitution at amino acids 670–671 and contains Dabcyl and Edans groups, which act as internal quencher and fluorophore, respectively. Release of the Edans fluorophore was followed on a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorophotometer using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 490 nm. The assays contained 40 mm sodium formate, pH 3.5, and 100 μm peptide substrate (dissolved in Me2SO). The reactions were initiated by the addition of extract. Activity inhibited by the addition of 10 μm pepstatin A represented cathepsin D. Changes in fluorescence over time were determined and converted to fmol of Edans by comparison with a standard curve made with Ac-RE(Edans)-A-NH2. Cathepsin D specific activities are reported as fmol of Edans fluorophore released per min per 103 cells. The assay described by Storrie and Madden (35.Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) was modified slightly and used to assay β-hexosaminidase. The cells were plated in 60-mm culture dishes. After 2 days the cultures were washed, refed with 1.5 ml of growth medium, and treated with Me2SO or TPA (10 nm). Samples of 200 μl were periodically removed and incubated with 200 μl of assay mixture (0.1 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 1 mm4-methyl-umbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-glucosaminide). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.5 mglycine, 0.5 m Na2CO3. Samples (200 μl) of the assay mixture were transferred to a 96-well plate and analyzed with a dual scanning microplate spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 364 nm and an emission wavelength of 448 nm. The above assay represents conditions used to monitor the extracellular accumulation of β-hexosaminidase over time following the addition of TPA. To determine the rate of β-hexosaminidase secretion, 2-day-old cultures were treated with TPA or Me2SO and at varied times thereafter washed and refed with 1 ml of fresh medium. After 15 min the culture medium was removed for assay as described above. Total cellular β-hexosaminidase activity was assayed as above using lysates prepared by exposing cultures to 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 2 min. Additional plates were exposed to a solution of 0.25% trypsin, 0.1 mm EDTA and counted. β-Hexosaminidase activity is reported as either relative fluorescent units/103 cells or relative fluorescent units/103 cells/min. Untreated/unconditioned medium (with or without Nonidet P-40 depending on the protocol) was used as a control and subtracted from each sample. MCF10A-Neo cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Two days later they were treated with either Me2SO or 10 nm TPA. At various times after treatment coverslips were washed, fixed, and processed for indirect immunolocalization of cathepsin B by confocal microscopy. The procedure used has been described in detail (36.Kessel D. Luo Y. Mathieu P. Reiners Jr., J.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The primary antibody was a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes human cathepsin B and procathepsin B (37.Moin K. Day N.A. Sameni M. Hasnain S. Hirama T. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (A 11008, Molecular Probes). The images were captured using a Zeiss 310 confocal microscope and a 63×/1.4 oil immersion lens, PH3 phase condenser, and a 488-nm laser light source with a pinhole setting of 17. All of the images were captured at the same contrast and brightness settings. All enzymatic assays involved analyses of a minimum of four culture wells or three culture dishes/treatment/experiment. Cell counts were performed on three or four culture wells or culture dishes. The data were analyzed by the Tukey HSD test. The Statistica 5.0 software package (StaSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK) was used to perform these calculations. The tripeptide Z-GGR-AMC is a substrate for a limited number of serine proteases including uPA and tPA (38.Walker B. Elmore D.T. Thromb. Res. 1984; 34: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 39.Bigbee W.L. Weintraub H.B. Jensen R.H. Anal.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). MCF10A-Neo cultures constitutively expressed a non-cell-associated, extracellular activity capable of cleaving Z-GGR-AMC (Fig. 1 A). This activity was not affected by exposure to Me2SO but was elevated after exposure to TPA (Fig. 1 A). Maximal increases were noted 1–2 h after TPA treatment. Thereafter, cleavage activity declined and returned to control levels within 8 h of TPA treatment. The assay employed in Fig. 1 A was not designed to measure extracellular, cell-associated Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity. To measure such activity, cleavage assays were performed directly in the culture wells (cell-associated + non-cell-associated activities) and compared with the activities in medium assayed after removal from the culture wells (non-cell-associated activity). No additional activity was detected when the assays were performed in the presence of cells (Fig. 1 B). Hence, the TPA-induced extracellular Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity was not cell-associated. Exposure of cultures to the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin prior to Me2SO treatment strongly inhibited extracellular Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity (Fig. 2 A). Aprotinin co-treatment also suppressed TPA-induced extracellular cleavage activity. Indeed, the extracellular Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity of cultures co-treated with TPA and aprotinin was similar to the activity measured in cultures co-treated with Me2SO and aprotinin (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of cultures with the tPA/uPA inhibitor PAI-1 had no effect on basal extracellular Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity (Fig. 2 B). However, co-treatment of TPA cultures with PAI-1 completely suppressed the TPA-dependent induction of extracellular Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity (Fig. 2 B). Neutralizing antibodies to tPA and uPA were used to determine whether either protease was responsible for extracellular Z-GGR-AMC hydrolysis (Fig. 3). Antibodies to tPA affected neither basal nor TPA-induced Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity. Neutralizing uPA antibody had no effect on basal Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity. However, the uPA antibody inhibited completely the extracellular Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity induced by TPA (Fig. 3). Hence, the extracellular Z-GGR-AMC cleavage activity induced by TPA appeared to be uPA. Co-treatment of cultures with uPA antibody suppressed the cytostatic effects of TPA by ∼50% (Table I). In contrast, uPA antibody had no effect on the growth of solvent-treated cultures. Control IgG had no effect on the growth of either solvent- or TPA-treated cultures (Table I). The magnitude of protection (∼50%) afforded by co-treatment with uPA antibody is significant because TGF-β was shown previously to mediate ∼50% of the cytostatic effects of TPA on MCF10A-Neo proliferation (27.Guo M. Reiners Jr., J.J.

In several other model systems, Src kinases are upstream regulators of PKC δ. To examine this relationship in epidermal carcinogenesis, v-ras transformed mouse keratinocytes were treated with a selective Src kinase inhibitor (PD 173958). PD 173958 decreased autophosphorylation of Src, Fyn, and Lyn kinases and prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of the Src kinase substrate p120. PD 173958 also prevented PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation and activated PKC δ as detected by membrane translocation. Expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers increased in PD 173958-treated v-ras- keratinocytes, and fluid-filled domes emerged, indicative of tight junction formation. Antisense PKC δ or bryostatin 1 inhibited dome formation, while overexpression of PKC δ in the presence of PD 173958 enhanced the formation of domes. Plasmids encoding phenylalanine mutants of PKC δ tyrosine residues 64 and 565 induced domes in the absence of PD 173958, while phenylalanine mutants of tyrosine residues 52, 155, and 187 were inactive. Thus, Src kinase mediated post-translational modification of PKC δ on specific tyrosine residues in ras-transformed mouse keratinocytes inactivates PKC δ and contributes to alterations in the differentiated phenotype and tight junction formation associated with neoplasia.

Thus, Src kinase mediated post-translational modification of PKC δ on specific tyrosine residues in ras-transformed mouse keratinocytes inactivates PKC δ and contributes to alterations in the differentiated phenotype and tight junction formation associated with neoplasia. The elucidation of specific genetic changes associated with early events in human cancer pathogenesis has focused efforts to relate these changes to particular characteristics of the neoplastic phenotype. The mouse skin carcinogenesis model lends itself well to these analyses. Activating mutations of the ras gene family are frequently detected in human squamous cell carcinomas, and expression of an oncogenic ras gene is sufficient to initiate benign tumor formation in mouse skin. The clearly defined genetic and phenotypic stages in the evolution of squamous tumors on mouse skin provide an opportunity to evaluate mechanisms of carcinogenesis in a stage-specific manner. We have used an in vitro model for initiation of skin carcinogenesis whereby we introduce an oncogenic v-ras into normal primary keratinocytes via retroviral transduction (1.Roop D.R. Lowy D.R. Tambourin P.E. Strickland J. Harper J.R. Balaschak M. Spangler E.F. Yuspa S.H. Nature. 1986; 323: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Initiated cells in this model display the hyperproliferative phenotype, express an altered pattern of differentiation markers, and resist terminal cell death, which are all characteristics of benign squamous papillomas (2.Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1178-1189PubMed Google Scholar). Since tumor formation in terminally differentiating tissues requires inhibition of terminal cell death, understanding the mechanisms involved may suggest novel targets for rational therapy of these tumors. Our earlier studies had implicated PKC as a regulator of keratinocyte terminal differentiation, and studies with v-ras initiated keratinocytes specifically identified PKC δ as being inactivated by tyrosine phosphorylation in papilloma cells (3.Lee Y.S. Dlugosz A.A. McKay R. Dean N.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 18: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H.

Direct evidence that PKC δ was involved in a keratinocyte death pathway came from studies in which PKC δ, overexpressed in neoplastic keratinocytes by an adenoviral vector, induced apoptosis associated with PKC δ translocation to mitochondria and reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (6.Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results were subsequently confirmed for PKC δ in other tumor model systems (7.Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

Wang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKC δ acts as a lamin kinase leading to phosphorylation and proteolysis needed for the disassembly of the nuclear lamina, a step that occurs during apoptosis (10.Cross T. Griffiths G. Deacon E. Sallis R. Gough M. Watters D. Lord J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Together these findings support a role for PKC δ as a death inducer and tumor suppressor, a hypothesis consistent with the finding that transgenic mice that overexpress PKC δ in the skin are resistant to chemically induced skin tumor formation (11.Reddig P.J. Dreckschmidt N.E. Ahrens H. Simsiman R. Tseng C.P. Zou J. Oberley T.D. Verma A.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5710-5718PubMed Google Scholar). In several model systems, tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in regulating PKC δ activity with resultant increase or decrease in catalytic activity dependent on cell type and phosphorylation site (12.Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 13.Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).

PKC δ is a substrate for activated c-Src and v-Src in vivo, and in several systems this interaction inactivates PKC δ catalytic function and causes rapid degradation of the PKC (17.Zang Q. Lu Z.

Marras E. Concari P. Piccinini F. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Src family kinases phosphorylate PKC δ οn tyrosine residues in vitro, and these kinases are activated in v-ras-transformed keratinocytes (14.Li W. Jiang Y.X. Zhang J. Soon L. Flechner L. Kapoor V.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Src family kinases are also activated in epidermal tumors (22.Xian W. Rosenberg M.P. DiGiovanni J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and targeting a human c-Src protein to the basal epidermis in transgenic mice causes spontaneous skin tumor formation (23.Matsumoto T. Jiang J. Kiguchi K. Ruffino L. Carbajal S. Beltran L. DiGiovanni J. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 2001; 42: 421Google Scholar). In this study, we used a selective pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PD 173958 (24.Moasser M.M. Srethapakdi M. Sachar K.S. Kraker A.J. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6145-6152PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Kraker A.J. Hartl B.G. Amar A.M. Barvian M.R. Showalter H.D. Moore C.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 885-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), to evaluate the interaction of Src kinases and PKC δ in the neoplastic phenotype produced by v-ras initiation of normal mouse keratinocytes. platelet-derived growth factor protein kinase C 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide platelet-derived growth factor protein kinase C 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from newborn BALB/c epidermis and seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 8% Chelex treated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts) and 0.05 mm Ca2+ as described previously (26.Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 3 days prior to infection with a replication-defective retrovirus encoding v-rasHaas described in Roop et al. (1.Roop D.R. Lowy D.R. Tambourin P.E. Strickland J. Harper J.R. Balaschak M. Spangler E.F. Yuspa S.H. Nature. 1986; 323: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To induce dome formation, v-rasHa-transduced primary keratinocytes (v-ras-keratinocytes) were cultured for 24 h in medium containing 1.4 mm Ca2+ prior to the addition of the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD 173958 for 24 h. The dishes were fixed with 10% formalin, stained with 0.36% rhodamine, and domes were quantified using a dissecting microscope. Cultured cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 200 μm NaVO3, and 10 mm NaF. Proteins were quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. PKC δ polyclonal antibody was used at a 1:30000 dilution (R & D Systems), and mouse monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibody (PY99) and rabbit polyclonal anti-p120 (S-19) were used at 1:1000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Detection of differentiation markers, keratins 1 and 10, loricrin, and filaggrin, has been described previously (27.Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from cultured keratinocytes with TRIzol (Invitrogen). For cDNA synthesis, 2 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplifications were performed in a volume of 20 μl using Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). The primers used for this analysis were: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward sequence, ATG GTG AAG GTC GGT GTG AAC G; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse sequence, ACC TGG TCC TCA GTG TAGC CCA; loricrin forward sequence, TAC CTG GCC GTG CAA GTA AG; loricrin reverse sequence, AAC AGG ATA CAC CTT GAG CGA C; filaggrin forward sequence, CAA GAT CAG GCT CAG GAG GAA G; filaggrin reverse sequence, GCA GGA ACA GAA TTG CAA ACA C. To avoid saturation or plateau effect of amplification, PCR was limited to a total of 20 cycles for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 30 cycles for filaggrin and loricrin. Each reaction was performed from three independent experiments. Primary control or v-ras-keratinocytes were seeded in 10-cm dishes and treated with the kinase inhibitor PD 173958 for 5 h. Cells were lysed in the same buffer mix for immunoblotting but containing 50 mmTris, pH 7.5. Lysates were pre-cleared by rotating with 20 μl of G/A PLUS agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitation reactions consisted of 0.7 mg of protein lysate, 1 μg of antibody, and 20 μl of G/A PLUS agarose. The antibody and protein were incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of the agarose beads. The immunoprecipitation proceeded at 4 °C overnight, and beads were washed six times with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% deoxycholic acid. The immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation of Src kinase family members and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitation studies were repeated in three independent experiments. For transient transfection of v-ras-keratinocytes using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen), cells were cultured for 48 h post-viral infection. PLUS reagent was diluted 1:50 in serum-free 0.05 mmCa2+ medium, and the LipofectAMINE reagent was diluted 1:33 in serum-free 0.05 mm Ca2+ medium. Diluted PLUS was incubated with 4 μg of plasmid DNA for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the diluted lipid reagent. Cells were transfected under serum-free conditions for 6 h and then placed in complete 0.05 mm Ca2+ medium. The plasmid DNAs used for the tyrosine mutants of PKC δ have been described previously (28.Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative PKC δ plasmid was a generous gift from Susan Jaken (29.Kiley S.C. Clark K.J. Goodnough M. Welch D.R. Jaken S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3230-3238PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined using the CellTiter 96 (Promega) kit. Cells were seeded in six-well dishes at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells per well. Cells were cultured for 3 days prior to v-rasHa infection. PD 173958 was added at doses of 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μmovernight in 3 ml of 0.05 mm Ca2+ medium. 300 μl/well of dye solution was added for 4 h followed by 3 ml of the stop solution. After 1 h of incubation, absorbency of the samples was determined at 570 nm. As a control for cell death, wells were freeze-thawed for several repetitions prior to the addition of the MTT dye. Each treatment was performed in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated independently four times. To examine membrane translocation of PKC δ as an indication of kinase activation, particulate and cytosolic protein fractions were prepared for immunoblotting. After treatment with varying doses of PD 173958, keratinocytes were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mmsucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 200 μmNaVO3, and 10 mm NaF. Cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C at 100,000 ×g. The soluble protein fraction and the membrane protein pellet were resuspended in the lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100 added. Protein was quantified by the Bradford method and ∼4–5 μg of particulate protein and 4–6 μg of cytosolic protein were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting for PKC δ. At concentrations of 0.25 to 10 μm the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD 173958 was not toxic to v-ras-keratinocytes when assayed by the MTT assay (Fig. 1A and not shown). In these same cells, low doses of the inhibitor decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with the molecular weight of ∼60 kDa somewhat selectively (Fig. 1B) and specifically reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of p120, a known substrate for Src kinase activity (Fig. 1C). To confirm a specific effect of PD 173958 on Src activity, the individual Src kinases were immunoprecipitated from protein lysates of treated v-rasHa keratinocytes and analyzed by immunoblotting for tyrosine phosphorylation. Three of the Src kinases, Src, Fyn, and Lyn, were tyrosine-phosphorylated in neoplastic keratinocytes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of all three Src kinases was reduced in PD 173958 treated cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Thus, PD 173958 appears to be a selective compound to reduce activity of these enzymes in neoplastic keratinocytes.Figure 2PD 173958 inhibits Src kinase activity in neoplastic keratinocytes. v-ras-keratinocytes were treated with various doses of PD 173958 for 5 h. Using specific antibodies, Src, Fyn, and Lyn proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and specific Src family antibodies. Shown is a representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While overall PKC δ protein levels were unchanged, a specific dose-dependent decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ was detected in neoplastic keratinocytes as a result of inhibiting Src kinases (Fig. 3A). Inhibitor treatment did not alter the low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation detected for PKC α or PKC ε. The decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation corresponded with activation of PKC δ as indicated by translocation of the enzyme almost entirely to the membrane fraction in treated v-ras- keratinocytes (Fig. 3B). This translocation was likely to be mediated by the elevated levels of diacylglycerol measured in v-ras- keratinocytes (30.Lee E. Punnonen K. Cheng C. Glick A. Dlugosz A. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 2367-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Src, Fyn, or Lyn are the essential kinases that tyrosine phosphorylate and inactivate PKC δ in neoplastic keratinocytes. While Abl kinase can also tyrosine-phosphorylate PKC δ under some circumstances (31.Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and the closely related PD180970 is reported to inhibit Abl kinase in vitro (32.Dorsey J.F. Jove R. Kraker A.J. Wu J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3127-3131PubMed Google Scholar), Abl kinase tyrosine phosphorylation was not increased in v-ras-keratinocytes, and constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation was not decreased at doses of PD 173958 below 1 μm (data not shown). Treatment with 0.5 μm PD 173958 caused v-ras-keratinocytes to form multiple domes randomly across the plate when cultured in 1.4 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 4A). The number of domes forming was dependent on the concentration of PD 173958, and domes did not form when neoplastic cells were maintained in 0.05 mmCa2+ medium. Domes also formed when normal keratinocytes were treated with the inhibitor and cultured in medium with 1.4 mMCa2+, and these appeared to be even larger than domes forming in v-ras keratinocytes (Fig. 4A). In the absence of overlying medium, the domes could be seen to retain fluid (Fig. 4A, inset). By inverted phase contrast microscopy, domes were identical to those reported to be PKC-dependent fluid-filled hemicysts in LLC-PK1 pig kidney cortical cells (33.Mullin J.M. Snock K.V. Shurina R.D. Noe J. George K. Misner L. Imaizumi S. O'Brien T.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Dome formation was dependent on PKC δ activity as quantified by counting the number of domes in formalin fixed and rhodamine-stained dishes (Fig. 4C). Transient transfection with a dominant-negative plasmid for PKC δ or treatment with 1 nm bryostatin, a concentration that specifically inhibits PKC δ (34.Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar), prevented dome formation in PD 173958-treated v-ras-keratinocytes (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, transfection of a GFP-PKC δ fusion plasmid (6.Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) enhanced formation of domes in the presence of the inhibitor. To determine whether inhibition of Src kinases and restoration of PKC δ activity influenced the differentiation state of v-ras-keratinocytes, PD 173958-treated cultures were exposed to 0.05 or 1.4 mm Ca2+ medium for various times and examined for expression of differentiation markers by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). Inhibition of Src kinases caused a slight increase in the expression of loricrin and filaggrin in normal keratinocytes, and PD 173958 substantially enhanced expression in v-ras-keratinocytes, both at the protein and RNA levels (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, inhibition of Src activity increased the expression of keratins 1 and 10 in the neoplastic cells, where v-ras transformation has a suppressive influence on expression of these markers. Since dome formation is quantitative and dependent on PKC δ activity, we used the formation of domes as an assay to map tyrosine residues that are functionally important for PKC δ activation in v-ras-keratinocytes. PKC δ plasmids encoding specific phenylalanine mutants in tyrosine residues where biological activity is preserved (28.Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected into v-ras-keratinocytes in the absence of PD 173958 (Table I). After switching to 1.4 mmCa2+ medium, dome formation was quantified on formalin-fixed and rhodamine-stained dishes. The single mutants Y64F (C2-like domain) and Y565F (catalytic domain) produced domes while Y52F, Y187F, and Y155F did not. Combinations of a mutant that induces dome formation with a mutant that did not (Y52F), or inclusion of all five mutations in the same construct, were still permissive for dome formation, indicating that the sites that did not induce dome formation did not have a suppressive influence on dome formation. These results indicate that in neoplastic epidermal cells, tyrosine residues 64 and 565 are critical sites for PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivation by Src kinases.Table ITyrosine residues 64 and 565 are targets for PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylationPlasmidDome formationPKC δ V+Y52F−Y187F−Y155F−Y565F+Y64F+Y52F + Y565F+Y52F + Y64F+Y565F + Y64F+Untransfected−GFP plasmid−Five tyrosine residues of PKC δ were mutated to phenylalanine, and plasmids containing either all five mutations (PKC δ V) or individual mutations were transiently transfected into v-ras-keratinocytes without exposure to PD 173958.

Three independent transfections were performed with values indicating 4–12 domes per dish (+) and indicating no domes observed (−). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ is emerging as an important theme in signal transduction in a variety of cellular systems (12.Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 13.Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The consequence of this modification appears to be cell type and stimulus specific. For example, tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC δ resulting from activation of the IgE receptor in rat basophilic leukemia cells or v-Src transformation of rat fibroblasts has diminished catalytic activity for selective substrates (17.Zang Q.

In contrast, phosphotyrosine-modified PKC δ isolated from H202-treated C0S-7 cells, ceramide-treated HeLa cells, or PDGF-treated 32D cells has increased catalytic activity (15.Li W. Yu J.C.

While the underlying mechanisms that determine these responses are not apparent, recent data suggest that the tyrosine residue that is phosphorylated is important in the biological readout (16.Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), is now recognized as an important signaling complex in several biological processes. Activated Src phosphorylates PKC δ on tyrosine 311 in murine fibroblasts leading to degradation of PKC δ that is required for growth stimulation by v-Src or PDGF (18.Blake R.A. Garcia-Paramio P. Parker P.J. Courtneidge S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of PKC δ by v-Src in rat fibroblasts is required for transformation and defines a reciprocal interaction between serine phosphorylation on Src and tyrosine phosphorylation on PKC δ leading to down-regulation of the PKC (17.Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13275-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In PDGF-treated C6 glioma cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ by Fyn kinase is required for inhibition of glutamine synthetase, a marker of differentiation (28.Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the tyrosine phosphorylation and catalytic inactivation of PKC δ in response to transformation of primary mouse keratinocytes by oncogenic Ras or activation of the EGF receptor (5.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,37.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this model, tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC δ was associated with a block in terminal differentiation as implied by studies with staurosporine, a kinase inhibitor that both prevented PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation and induced PKC-dependent terminal cell death (5.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now present direct evidence that c-Src, c-Fyn, and c-Lyn are activated in ras-transformed keratinocytes and mediate PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation. It is likely that all three Src kinases are involved in the modification of PKC δ, since previous studies have shown that clearing Src or Fyn from keratinocyte membranes reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of recombinant PKC δ in vitro (37.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and Lyn phosphorylates tyrosine residue 565 in vitro, a likely target of modification in the keratinocyte system (38.Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Chang E.Y. Rivera J. Yuspa S.H. Lehel C. Olah Z. Anderson W.B. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). When Src kinase activity is inhibited by a Src kinase-selective inhibitor, PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation is prevented and PKC δ translocates from the cytoplasmic to membrane compartment, indicating it has been activated. The active PKC δ induces the neoplastic population to form domes and express terminal differentiation markers when challenged by 1.4 mm Ca2+ as a differentiation inducer. Studies with transfected PKC δ tyrosine mutants implicate residues 64 and 565 as critical targets for inactivation of PKC δ by tyrosine phosphorylation in v-ras-transformed keratinocytes. Previous studies have shown that PKC δ translocates to membrane compartments in normal mouse keratinocytes induced to differentiate by calcium (4.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar), and PKC δ levels increase as hyperproliferative neonatal epidermis matures into the adult more differentiated phenotype (39.Leibersperger H. Gschwendt M. Gernold M. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14778-14784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of PKC δ in human keratinocytes causes growth arrest and induction of transglutaminase 1, a key enzyme in terminal differentiation (40.Ohba M. Ishino K. Kashiwagi M. Kawabe S. Chida K. Huh N.H. Kuroki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC δ also activates the promoter sequences of involucrin and SPRR1B, both important components of cornified envelopes, the terminal mature phenotype of normal keratinocytes (41.Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1601-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42.Vuong H. Patterson T. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Wu R. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Kleeberger S.R. Reddy S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32250-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our current findings that preventing PKC δ inactivation by Src kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in neoplastic keratinocytes is associated with increased gene expression of markers of late differentiation, loricrin and filaggrin, in response to 1.4 mm Ca2+medium. However, v-ras-keratinocytes did not continue through terminal cell death in this model. This partial differentiation response may result from a requirement for Fyn activity in conjunction with PKC η to express the fully differentiated phenotype as recently reported by Cabodi et al. (43.Cabodi S. Calautti E. Talora C. Kuroki T. Stein P.L. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1121-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the presence of PD 173958, this activity would be inhibited. The PKC δ-dependent formation of domes may be another manifestation of a differentiation program. Significant dome formation required both PD 173958 and 1.4 mm Ca2+ in cells transformed by v-ras. Large domes also formed in normal keratinocytes treated with PD 173958 and 1.4 mmCa2+, possibly reflecting an inhibition of PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation detected in differentiating keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo (44.Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Cheng C. Dempsey P.J. Coffey Jr., R.J. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. Exp. Dermatol. 2000; 9: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dome formation was dependent on PKC δ activity as it was reduced by PKC δ inhibition and increased by active PKC δ. Furthermore, domes were induced in the absence of PD 173958 by transfecting PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation-defective mutants Y64F and Y565F. The domes forming in our study appear to be identical to those studied extensively by Mullin and collaborators in LLC-PK1 pig kidney epithelial cells (33.Mullin J.M. Snock K.V. Shurina R.D. Noe J. George K. Misner L. Imaizumi S. O'Brien T.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In that model, dome formation represents a differentiated phenotype in which functionally intact tight junctions form at confluence in the presence of high calcium medium. These intact tight junctions reduced transepithelial permeability producing fluid-filled blisters. Both PKC δ and PKC α activation increased transepithelial permeability and disrupted dome formation (45.Rosson D. O'Brien T.G. Kampherstein J.A. Szallasi Z. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Mullin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14950-14953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 46.Mullin J.M. Kampherstein J.A. Laughlin K.V. Clarkin C.E. Miller R.D. Szallasi Z. Kachar B. Soler A.P. Rosson D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C544-C554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In keratinocytes, the action of PKC on dome formation seems to be reversed. This may reflect the different functions of the two tissues, where in one case secretion and absorption are required, and in the other barrier formation is needed. Thus, the formation of tight junctions may be an important keratinocyte differentiation function regulated by PKC δ and disturbed by oncogenic Ras transformation (47.Morita K. Itoh M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Furuse M. Yoneda K. Imamura S. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Invest Dermatol. 1998; 110: 862-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 48.Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Src kinases disrupt cell-cell adherens junctions in normal and neoplastic human keratinocytes (49.Owens D.W. McLean G.W. Wyke A.W. Paraskeva C. Parkinson E.K. Frame M.C. Brunton V.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), possibly contributing further to a defective differentiation program in keratinocyte transformation. Since PKC δ also phosphorylates the α6β4 integrin complex, reducing keratinocyte attachment to substrate (50.Alt A. Ohba M. Li L. Gartsbein M. Belanger A. Denning M.F. Kuroki T. Yuspa S.H. Tennenbaum T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4591-4598PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibition of Src kinase in v-ras-keratinocytes may increase tight junction and adherens junction binding, and PKC δ may induce cell detachment from the substratum to form domes. The stratified detached epithelial sheet forming the dome may be analogous to the suprabasal layers of the epidermis that are detached from a basement membrane. PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation detected in suprabasal differentiating normal keratinocytes may serve to regulate the extent of tight junction formation depending on the physiological requirements of the dynamic epidermis. From the existing literature, it is difficult to define a unifying functional consequence of PKC δ tyrosine phosphorylation (12.Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 13.Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For example, tyrosine phosphorylation at residue 311 in H202-treated C0S-7 cells or by Lck in vitro activates catalytic activity (16.Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6587-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), while modification at residue 311 by Src kinase inactivates catalytic activity and promotes degradation of PKC δ (18.Blake R.A. Garcia-Paramio P. Parker P.J. Courtneidge S.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar). In various cell systems or in vitro assays, tyrosine residues 52, 155, 187, and 565 have been implicated as targets for phosphorylation, and growth factor receptors (insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, PDGF receptor), cell surface antigen receptors (IgE, B cell antigen receptor), or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (v-Src, c-Src, c-Lyn, Lck) as proximate kinases. When phenylalanine mutants at residues 155 and 187 were introduced independently into C6 glioma cells, each mutant had a distinct functional consequence indicating that the specific tyrosine residue phosphorylated may determine the divergence of signaling processes (28.Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our studies support this concept. Preventing phosphorylation at tyrosine 64 in the regulatory domain and 565 in the kinase domain induces dome formation in the absence of Src kinase inhibition. Thus, these sites are likely targets for Src kinase mediated catalytic inactivation of PKC δ in v-ras-keratinocytes. In contrast, phenylalanine substitutions at tyrosine residues 52, 155, and 187 were without effect. Confirmation of these modification sites and identification of others that may also be involved will require additional structural approaches. However, the specificity of the results with mutant constructs indicates potential strategies to overcome the terminal differentiation defect in neoplastic keratinocytes. Previous studies have demonstrated the pro-apoptotic influence of overexpressed PKC δ in v-ras-keratinocytes and tumor-derived keratinocyte cell lines from murine and human sources (6.Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic targeting of PKC δ to mouse epidermis inhibits tumor formation (11.Reddig P.J. Dreckschmidt N.E. Ahrens H. Simsiman R. Tseng C.P. Zou J. Oberley T.D. Verma A.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5710-5718PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies indicate that adenoviral encoded PKC δ can prevent tumor growth when injected into the tumor mass in situ. 2L. Li and S. H. Yuspa, unpublished data. By using biologically active PKC δ mutants where tyrosine phosphorylation at crucial residues is prevented or by combined treatment with native PKC δ and selective Src kinase inhibitors, it might be possible to increase the antitumor activity of a PKC δ-based therapy. While this strategy might be at first confined to mouse models, published studies on human tumors or human tumor cells suggest that activating PKC δ in the tumor mass may have broader applicability (51.Basu A. Akkaraju G.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4245-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 52.Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

It is highly homologous to Ras but it is down-regulated by its own set of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs).

The GTPase reaction of Rap1 is stimulated 105-fold by Rap1GAP and has a kcatof 6 s−1 at 25 °C. The catalytic effect of GAPs from Ras, Rho, and Rabs depends on a crucial arginine which is inserted into the active site. However, all seven highly conserved arginines of Rap1GAP can be mutated without dramatically reducing Vmax of the GTP-hydrolysis reaction. We found instead two lysines whose mutations reduce catalysis 25- and 100-fold, most likely by an affinity effect. Rap1GAP does also not supply the crucial glutamine that is missing in Rap proteins at position 61. The Rap1(G12V) mutant which in Ras reduces catalysis 106-fold is shown to be efficiently down-regulated by Rap1GAP.

Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In humans, four isoforms, Rap1A, Rap1B, Rap2A, and Rap2B, exist. Rap1A and Rap1B share more than 90% sequence identity and in most studies no discrimination between these isoforms has been made. Rap1A/B (Rap1 from now) is the closest relative of the Ras protein with more than 50% sequence identity. Just as Ras, it cycles between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active form, and this switching is regulated by specificguanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 andGTPase activating proteins (GAPs).

Biochemical experiments have demonstrated that the Cdc25 domain is fully capable for catalyzing nucleotide exchange (20.Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 19: 7420-7430Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional structure of the Ras-SOS complex has shown that the Ras exchanger motif domain is stabilizing the Cdc25 domain (21.Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Barsagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Due to the conservation of the Cdc25 domain in both Ras and Rap-specific GEFs it is expected that the basic mechanism of nucleotide exchange will be similar between these, and mutagenesis studies have in fact supported this (22.Van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11078-11085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).In contrast to RapGEFs, Rap-specific GAPs have no sequence homology with RasGAP and other GAPs such as RanGAP or RhoGAP. The first RapGAP, Rap1GAP, was purified as a cytosolic and a membrane-associated higher molecular weight isoform (23.Polakis P.G. Rubinfeld B. Evans T. McCormick F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24.Nice E.C. Fabri L. Hammacher A. Holden J. Simpson R.J. Burgess A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1546-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic form was cloned and identified as a 663-residue protein which worked on Rap1, somewhat less on Rap2, but had no activity toward Ras and other small GTP-binding proteins (25.Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recent results propose an interaction between a splice isoform of Rap1GAP, termed Rap1GAPII, and the Gαi isoform of a heterotrimeric G proteins (26.Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T. Kitabatake A. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and similar connections to Gαz and Gαo were also reported (27.Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J.S. Iyengar R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36663-36669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The interaction is mediated by the GoLoco domain of Rap1GAPII which is a general Gα-interacting motif (29.Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M.A. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).A catalytic domain sufficient for RapGAP activity was identified in Rap1GAP (30.Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This domain was later found in Spa1, a 130-kDa protein with high expression in lymphoid tissues (31.Kurachi H. Wada Y. Tsukamoto N. Maeda M. Kubota H. Hattori M. Iwai K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28081-28088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and E6TP1, a protein interacting with the E6-oncoprotein of human papilloma viruses (32.Gao Q.S. Srinivasan S. Boyer S.N. Wazer D.E. Band V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Limited homology to Rap1GAP was identified in tuberin which is encoded by a gene disrupted in patients with tuberous sclerosis, a syndrome characterized by the development of benign tumors. Indeed, a weak RapGAP activity was demonstrated for Tuberin (33.Wienecke R. König A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). GAPIP4BP, which by sequence is closely related to RasGAP, has been reported to stimulate the GTPase activity of both Ras and Rap1 (34.Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, Bud2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has sequence homology to the RasGAP domain but acts on Bud1p/Rsr1p, a putative yeast homologue of Rap1 (35.Park H.-O. Chant J. Herskowitz I. Nature. 1993; 365: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Nothing is known about the mechanism of GTPase activation of Rap1 by RapGAPs. For RasGAP it has been shown that the catalytic mechanism involves the stabilization of the catalytic Gln61 on Ras and the introduction of a catalytic arginine from GAP, the arginine finger, into the active site to complement the catalytic machinery (36.Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar,37.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), and similar findings have been made for Rho and RhoGAPs (38.Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 39.Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). By aligning the sequence of GAPs for other small G proteins and identifying invariant arginines (40.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), it was postulated that they might employ a similar mechanism, as verified in the meantime for the Rab-RabGAP interaction (41.Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 42.Rak A. Fedorov R. Alexandrov K. Albert S. Goody R.S. Gallwitz D. Scheidig A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5105-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is, however, anticipated that the mechanism is different for Rap, since Rap is the only small guanine nucleotide-binding protein that does not contain a residue homologous to Gln61 in Ras.By using a bacterial expression system we prepared a catalytically active fragment of Rap1GAP of 341 amino acids (termed here RapGAP-341) to study the mechanism of GTPase activation. We can show that RapGAP-341 accelerates the slow intrinsic hydrolysis by 5 orders of magnitude. However, no arginine is involved in the reaction mechanism. The G12V mutant of Rap1, believed to be insensitive to RapGAPs and thus dominant active, can be efficiently down-regulated by RapGAP-341. Instead, we identify Rap1(F64A) as a mutant whose GTPase activity is not down-regulated by Rap1GAP. For future transfection studies, Rap1(F64A) thus appears to be a suitable dominant active Rap mutant. Rap is a small guanine nucleotide-binding protein implied in signal transduction processes (reviewed in Ref. 1.Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In humans, four isoforms, Rap1A, Rap1B, Rap2A, and Rap2B, exist. Rap1A and Rap1B share more than 90% sequence identity and in most studies no discrimination between these isoforms has been made. Rap1A/B (Rap1 from now) is the closest relative of the Ras protein with more than 50% sequence identity. Just as Ras, it cycles between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active form, and this switching is regulated by specificguanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 andGTPase activating proteins (GAPs). After its original cloning (2.Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204PubMed Google Scholar) and purification (3.Kawata M. Matsui Y. Kondo J. Hishida T. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18965-18971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rap1 was shown to inhibit K-Ras-mediated transformation (4.Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and growth factor-induced and Ras-mediated MAP kinase activation (5.Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In contrast to its suggested role as a Ras antagonist, Rap1 becomes activated in parallel to Ras by receptor tyrosine kinase activators and is believed to mediate its own type of intracellular signals (6.Zwartkruis F.J.T. Wolthuis R.M.F. Nabben N.M.J.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It was shown to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells via a pathway involving B-Raf (7.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) and to act as a mitogenic stimulus in certain cell types (8.Altschuler D.L. Ribeironeto F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These data confirmed the homotetrameric nature of the enzyme and the identity of the catalytic glutamate that abstracts an α-hydrogen as a proton. Amino acid sequence alignments identified a common glutamate in SCAD and bSCAD at the same position. It was expected that the analogous Glu-368 residue in SCAD would be in position to act as the catalytic residue, which was confirmed by site-specific mutagenesis (17.Battaile K. Mohsen A.-W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15356-15363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Of particular interest in the ACD family is the nature of substrate specificity. The protein sequence similarity across all ACDs of ∼33% (4.Matsubara Y. Indo Y. Naito E. Ozasa H. Glassberg R. Vockley J. Ikeda Y. Kraus J. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16321-16331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests a common substrate binding mode and reaction mechanism. Although each ACD has an optimal substrate, the pattern of specificity for an individual ACD can overlap with other ACDs (7.Ikeda Y. Ikeda K.O. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1311-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9477-9487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J.

Kim J.-J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12412-12420Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), specific residues in the binding cavities of SCAD and MCAD have been studied to determine their roles in substrate specificity. Altering the position of the catalytic residue in SCAD and MCAD (Glu-368 and Glu-376, respectively) through mutagenesis to the corresponding position of the catalytic residue in LCAD/IVD (Glu-261 and Glu-254, respectively) slightly changed the activity profile of SCAD. The values of Vmax/Km for butyryl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA are 280 and 3.8 min−1μmol−1, respectively in the wild-type enzyme, whereas the corresponding values are 9 and 1.1 min−1μmol−1 in the E368G/G247E mutant. On the other hand, the analogous mutant in MCAD dramatically changed the specificity of MCAD from an optimal substrate of octanoyl-CoA to dodecanoyl-CoA. Although mutagenesis thus far has focused on the catalytic residue with the most success, clearly the amino acid residues in the binding cavity are of equal, if not greater, importance, as the minimal effect seen in the SCAD mutant study demonstrates. The deficiencies of all the ACDs combined represent an important group of metabolic disorders; however, only a few patients have been described with SCAD deficiency (24.Turnbull D.M. Bartlett K.

Presentation typically involves muscle weakness, lethargy, free carnitine depletion with elevated plasma butyryl-carnitine, and ethylmalonic aciduria. Metabolic stress can result in the excretion of methylsuccinate. Several patients with SCAD deficiency have been reported as well as mutations thereof (27.Gregersen N. Winter V.S. Corydon M.J.

As the amino acid sequence identity between rat and human SCAD is 92%, we have mapped 10 reported clinical mutations and two polymorphisms onto the SCAD structure reported herein in an effort to gain insight into the mechanism of pathogenesis of SCAD deficiency. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of rat SCAD at 2.25Å resolution. Expression and purification of recombinant SCAD has been described elsewhere (17.Battaile K. Mohsen A.-W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15356-15363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mature coding region from the cDNA of SCAD was cloned into the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression vector pKK223-3 with the addition of an N-terminal methionine. After induction, Escherichia coli cultures were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Recombinant SCAD was purified by successive chromatography steps including DE52 (Whatman), hydroxyapatite, and S-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The enzyme was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method (31.McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 182-187Google Scholar). Trigonal crystals with an orange tint grew from drops of 8.8 mg/ml SCAD in the presence of 1.2 molar equivalents of acetoacetyl-CoA/monomer of enzyme in 85 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, and 270 mm ammonium sulfate equilibrated against a solution containing 85 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, and 3.78m ammonium sulfate. The crystals belong to a trigonal space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 143.61 Å and c = 77.46 Å. Diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA with a 0.3-mm collimator coupled to an RAXIS-II detector system. Data reduction was carried out with the Denzo/Scalepack software package (32.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). Data collection and structure refinement statistics are given in Table I. The structure of SCAD was solved by the molecular replacement method using the software package X-PLOR (33.Brunger A. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and the structure of MCAD (Protein Data Bank accession code 3MDD) as the probe. The initial probe structure was generated by manually replacing amino acid residues in MCAD to match the SCAD sequence. The highest peak from the cross-rotation function (θ1, θ2, θ3 = 274.78, 4.5, and 234.78°, respectively; 15–4 Å data with I/ς > 8) was used in the subsequent translation search. Two trigonal space groups, P321 and P312, were consistent with the systematic absence of extinction reflections. X-PLOR rigid body refinement based on the highest peak on the P321 translation search using reflections from 15 to 4 Å lowered the R-value from 43.7 to 36.1%. Several cycles of refinement with 6993 reflections with intensities of >4 ς (15–4 Å) yielded an R-value of 24.2%. At this point, all data with I/ς > 0 were used for the subsequent refinement using X-PLOR and later CNS (34.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

TURBO-FRODO, Version 4.2. Bio-Graphics, Mountain View, CA1993Google Scholar). Water molecules were added in areas of electron density in difference Fourier maps that were <3.3 Å from a hydrogen bond partner.

Open table in a new tab As expected from their sequence similarity, the overall structure of SCAD is similar to those of MCAD, IVD, and bSCAD. Like the structures of the other ACDs, the monomeric structure of SCAD is composed of three domains: an N-terminal α-helical domain containing six helices (A–F), a medial β-sheet domain containing seven β-strands (1.Ikeda Y.

Chem. 1985; 260: 1311-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a C-terminal α-helical domain containing five helices (G–J in Fig. 1A). SCAD, like the other ACDs, forms a tetramer of identical monomers with 222 symmetry. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a dimer that forms the tetramer with a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The root-mean-square deviation for the α-carbon atoms between the two monomers in the asymmetric unit is 0.27Å. All but five residues were identified in the electron density map, the three N-terminal residues (Leu-1, His-2, Thr-3), the initiating methionine required for expressing the mature form of SCAD in a bacterial system, and Ser-388 at the C terminus. Fig. 1B shows an overlay of the Cα traces of one monomer each of SCAD, MCAD, IVD, and bSCAD. The average root-mean-square deviation between the Cα of SCAD and the other ACD structures ranges from 1.7 Å with MCAD and 1.5 Å with bSCAD to 1.2 Å with IVD. The structural alignment in Fig. 2 shows that all homologous strands and helices in the four structures have the same number of residues with the exception of the E-helix in which SCAD, IVD, and bSCAD have 21 residues compared with 20 in MCAD. The E-helix lines the “bottom” of the substrate binding cavity. This insertion (Ser-97 in SCAD) in the E-helix has the local effect of shifting its N-terminal two turns of the helix slightly closer to the binding cavity in SCAD/IVD/bSCAD and making the binding cavity more shallow. The length of loops is a primary difference in the structures, and yet most of these length differences do not appear to result in any significant difference in enzyme function. In the loops between β-strands 5 and 6, Pro-194 adopts a cis conformation.Figure 2Structure-based sequence alignment of the ACDs. The mature protein sequences of the four ACDs that had been subject to crystallographic studies were aligned manually by their secondary structural elements. The positions of the α-helices are indicated by the gray bars and the β-strands by the arrows above the sequence. The asterisk(*) indicates the position of the catalytic glutamate in bSCAD, pig MCAD, and rat SCAD. The caret (^) indicates the position of the catalytic glutamate in human IVD. Note that the catalytic residue of IVD is located >100 residues away from the other ACDs. The plus signs (+) indicate the positions of the reported mutations and polymorphisms in SCAD. Residues lining the binding cavity for the fatty-acyl portion of the substrate (from Table II) are shaded. GenPept sequence record numbers are: bSCAD, AAA03594; rat SCAD, AAA40669; human IVD, AAA52711; pig MCAD, AAA83759.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 3′-AMP moiety of the CoA is exposed to solvent, and the fatty acyl moiety is buried deeply inside the molecule near the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD. The binding cavities of SCAD, IVD, and bSCAD are more shallow than that of MCAD, which at the bottom expands away from the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD and ends near Glu-99. In the structure of MCAD without substrate, there are series of well defined water molecules in the substrate binding cavity. When the substrate binds in MCAD, water molecules are displaced, and the side chains of amino acids Gln-95, Glu-99, Leu-103, Val-259, Tyr-375, and Glu-376 move aside to accommodate the substrate (14.Kim J.-J.P. Wang M. Paschke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The movement of these amino acid side chains enlarges the cavity to accommodate substrate. Although structures of SCAD, bSCAD, and IVD without bound ligand have not been determined, it is reasonable to assume that water occupies the binding cavity in all ACDs in the absence of substrate, which is then displaced upon substrate binding. As the CoA portion of the substrate is common for all of the ACDs, it would be expected that the regions involved in binding the CoA moiety would be very similar. The backbones for all four dehydrogenases overlay very well at the top of the binding cavity with the exception of the loop between strands 4 and 5. This difference can be seen in the structural alignment in Fig. 2. Even though this region is different in the four structures, it does not appear to play a significant role in the binding of the CoA moiety to the enzyme. As in other ACD structures, adenosine binding is mediated mostly through interactions with a single monomer, particularly residues Asn-183, Lys-184, Phe-237, Lys-238, Met-241, Asp-245, and Thr-318 in SCAD (Fig. 3). The sole contribution to substrate binding from the adjacent monomer is through Phe-276, which forms a Van der Waals' interaction (3.81 Å) with the start of the pantothenic acid moiety. Asp-245 is conserved in all enzymes and forms a hydrogen bond with the C(6) amino group of the adenine. The shape of the cavity opening and the pantothene-binding portion of the cavity is uniformly shaped in all of the structures. A minor difference is in the opening of MCAD, which is slightly wider and extended in the direction of the adenosine moiety. Table II contains a list of structurally homologous residues in the ACDs that line the binding cavity for the fatty-acyl portion of the CoA thioester substrate. In addition, the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD forms one wall of the binding cavity in all ACDs. Eight residues are responsible for shaping the binding cavity of SCAD;Val-90, Val-94, Leu-98, Phe-128, Thr-163, Ile-251, Tyr-367, and the catalytic residue Glu-368 (Table II, Fig. 4A). The side chain of Ile-251 extends partially into the binding cavity and appears to be the critical residue for limiting the depth of the binding cavity. This is in part because of the altered trajectory of the G helix in SCAD compared with MCAD, a difference that was also observed in the bSCAD structure (15.Djordjevic S. Pace C.P. Stankovich M.T. Kim J.-J.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, the corresponding residue in MCAD is valine at this position, which adopts a conformation such that it does not interfere with the binding cavity. The small but significant activity toward octanoyl-CoA (Vmax/Km for octanoyl-CoA is 70-fold smaller than that of butyryl-CoA) of SCAD (17.Battaile K. Mohsen A.-W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15356-15363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is a certain degree of flexibility among the residues lining the binding cavity to allow longer substrates to bind. In bSCAD as in SCAD, eight residues shape the binding cavity, all of which are in the same position as SCAD and five of which are identical to those in SCAD: Ile-88, Ala-92, Leu-96, Phe-126, Thr-162, Val-250, Tyr-366, and the catalytic residue Glu-367 (Table II, Fig. 4B). In bSCAD, Ile-88 impinges on the binding cavity from the opposite side as Ile-251 does in SCAD. The homologous residue of Ile-251 in bSCAD is Val-250, which does not restrict the binding cavity. This is due to the direct approach of the Ile-88 side chain into the binding cavity (15.Djordjevic S. Pace C.P. Stankovich M.T. Kim J.-J.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and the shorter side chain of the valine. As was the case with bSCAD, IVD also shares many similar residues lining the binding cavity with SCAD. The primary difference here is that the binding cavity in IVD is expanded laterally to accommodate branched chain substrates because of a glycine at position 374 (16.Tiffany K.A. Roberts D.L. Wang M. Paschke R. Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Kim J.-J.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8455-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which is a leucine in IBD and a tyrosine in other ACDs. Residues shaping the IVD binding cavity are Leu-95, Ala-99, Leu-103, Leu-133, Thr-168, Leu-258, Leu-370, Tyr-371, Gly-374, Ala-375, and the catalytic residue Glu-254 (Table II, Fig. 4C). Although bSCAD shared five identical residues with SCAD, IVD shares two. IVD has two residues in position to block the bottom of the binding cavity to longer chain substrates, Leu-258 (Ile-251 in SCAD) and Leu-95 (Val-90 in bSCAD) (16.Tiffany K.A. Roberts D.L. Wang M. Paschke R. Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Kim J.-J.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8455-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In MCAD, because of a larger binding cavity, more residues are involved in forming the binding cavity. These residues are Gln-95, Thr-96, Glu-99, Ala-100, Thr-102, Leu-103, Tyr-133, Thr-168, Thr-255, Pro-258, Val-259, Tyr-372, Tyr-375, and the catalytic residue Glu-376 (Table II, Fig. 4D). The increased size of the binding cavity of MCAD is due in part to the shorter amino acid side chains in MCAD of residues homologous to the blocking residues in SCAD/bSCAD/IVD and the difference in trajectory of the G- and E-helices that line the binding cavity. These two factors together allow for the expansion of the binding cavity away from the FAD, which allows for the binding of longer substrates.Table IIResidues lining the binding cavity in the four reported ACD structuresrSCADbSCADhIVDpMCADGln-95Val-90Ile-88Leu-95Thr-96Glu-99Val-94Ala-92Ala-99Ala-100Thr-102Leu-98Leu-96Leu-103Leu-103Phe-128Phe-126Leu-133Tyr-133Thr-163Thr-162Thr-168Thr-168Glu-254Thr-255Pro-258Ile-251Val-250Leu-258Val-259Leu-370Tyr-371Tyr-372Tyr-367Tyr-366Gly-374Tyr-375Glu-368Glu-367Ala-375Glu-376Residues in rows are structural homologs. The catalytic residues are in italics. Open table in a new tab Residues in rows are structural homologs. The catalytic residues are in italics. The binding of long acyl-CoAs to SCAD, bSCAD, and IVD is significantly affected because the side chains of Ile-251 (SCAD), Leu-258 (IVD) or Ile-88 (bSCAD) are blocking the bottom of the binding cavity. The insertion of an extra residue in helix E results in the bending of the helix toward the active site in SCAD/bSCAD/IVD. In MCAD, on the other hand, a proline substitution in the G-helix makes the helix bend away from the active site. For SCAD and IVD the blocking residue (Ile-251/Leu-258) is on one side of the binding cavity, whereas for bSCAD it (Ile-88) is on the other side. The second structural difference appears to be the position of the peptide backbone in the region of the binding cavity. All of the enzymes have subtle differences in the position of the main chain atoms. In the vicinity of the binding cavity, these differences result in the movement of amino acid side chains further into the binding cavity, as is the case with SCAD/bSCAD/IVD, or further away from the binding cavity, as is the case in MCAD and, presumably, LCAD/VLCAD. The combination of the differences in the residues, combined with the trajectory of the helices they are part of, together help to modulate the size of the bottom of the binding cavity, thus controlling the binding of longer substrates. The molecular basis of oxygen reactivity of ACDs has been a subject of some debate (36.Johnson J.K. Kumar N.R. Srivastava D.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4738-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37.DuPlessis E.R. Pellett J. Stankovich M.T. Thorpe C.

When reduced flavins of mammalian ACDs are bound to certain acyl-CoA ligands, reoxidation by molecular oxygen of the flavins is dramatically slowed. Wang and Thorpe (38.Wang R. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7895-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that the half-life of the photo-reduced FAD of pig MCAD was increased up to 3,600-fold when complexed with certain substrate analogs. Rat SCAD also shows a similar result when bound to substrate/product analogs. 2M. S"
https://openalex.org/W2129613459,"The Shaker family K+channel protein, Kv1.3, is tyrosine phosphorylated by v-Src kinase at Tyr137 and Tyr449 to modulate current magnitude and kinetic properties. Despite two proline rich sequences and these phosphotyrosines contained in the carboxyl and amino terminals of the channel, v-Src kinase fails to co-immunoprecipitate with Kv1.3 as expressed in HEK 293 cells, indicating a lack of direct Src homology 3- or Src homology 2-mediated protein-protein interaction between the channel and the kinase. We show that the adaptor proteins, n-Shc and Grb10, are expressed in the olfactory bulb, a region of the brain where Kv1.3 is highly expressed. In HEK 293 cells, co-expression of Kv1.3 plus v-Src with Grb10 causes a decrease in v-Src-induced Kv1.3 tyrosine phosphorylation and a reversal of v-Src-induced Kv1.3 current suppression, increase in inactivation time constant (τinact), and disruption of cumulative inactivation properties. Co-expression of Kv1.3 plus v-Src with n-Shc did not significantly alter v-Src-induced Kv1.3 current suppression but reversed v-Src induced increased τinact and restored the right-shifted voltage at half-activation (V1/2) induced by v-Src. The v-Src-induced shift in V1/2 and increased τinact was retained when Tyr220, Tyr221, and Tyr304 in the CH domain of n-Shc were mutated to Phe (triple Shc mutant) but was reversed back to control values when either wild-type Shc or the family member Sck, which is not a substrate for Src kinase, was substituted for the triple Shc mutant. Thus the portion of the CH domain that includes Tyr220, Tyr221, and Tyr304 may regulate a shift in Kv1.3 voltage dependence and inactivation kinetics produced by n-Shc in the presence of v-Src. Collectively these data indicate that Grb10 and n-Shc adaptor molecules differentially modulate the degree of Kv1.3 tyrosine phosphorylation, the channel's biophysical properties, and the physical complexes associated with Kv1.3 in the presence of Src kinase. The Shaker family K+channel protein, Kv1.3, is tyrosine phosphorylated by v-Src kinase at Tyr137 and Tyr449 to modulate current magnitude and kinetic properties. Despite two proline rich sequences and these phosphotyrosines contained in the carboxyl and amino terminals of the channel, v-Src kinase fails to co-immunoprecipitate with Kv1.3 as expressed in HEK 293 cells, indicating a lack of direct Src homology 3- or Src homology 2-mediated protein-protein interaction between the channel and the kinase. We show that the adaptor proteins, n-Shc and Grb10, are expressed in the olfactory bulb, a region of the brain where Kv1.3 is highly expressed. In HEK 293 cells, co-expression of Kv1.3 plus v-Src with Grb10 causes a decrease in v-Src-induced Kv1.3 tyrosine phosphorylation and a reversal of v-Src-induced Kv1.3 current suppression, increase in inactivation time constant (τinact), and disruption of cumulative inactivation properties. Co-expression of Kv1.3 plus v-Src with n-Shc did not significantly alter v-Src-induced Kv1.3 current suppression but reversed v-Src induced increased τinact and restored the right-shifted voltage at half-activation (V1/2) induced by v-Src. The v-Src-induced shift in V1/2 and increased τinact was retained when Tyr220, Tyr221, and Tyr304 in the CH domain of n-Shc were mutated to Phe (triple Shc mutant) but was reversed back to control values when either wild-type Shc or the family member Sck, which is not a substrate for Src kinase, was substituted for the triple Shc mutant. Thus the portion of the CH domain that includes Tyr220, Tyr221, and Tyr304 may regulate a shift in Kv1.3 voltage dependence and inactivation kinetics produced by n-Shc in the presence of v-Src. Collectively these data indicate that Grb10 and n-Shc adaptor molecules differentially modulate the degree of Kv1.3 tyrosine phosphorylation, the channel's biophysical properties, and the physical complexes associated with Kv1.3 in the presence of Src kinase. voltage-gated potassium olfactory bulb postnatal day neuronal viral analysis of variance Voltage-gated potassium (Kv)1 channels form highly potassium-selective pores that are conformationally switched open or closed by changes in membrane voltage (1.Biggin P.C.

Neuron. 2000; 27: 423-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Kv channels may not function in isolation in the plasma membrane but rather be intricately involved in protein-protein interactions (3.Scannevin R.H. Trimmer J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1997; 232: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such interactions build a molecular scaffold that may modulate the channel's subcellular distribution in the neuron, regulate the level of expression of the channel, introduce signaling interchange with particular proteins contained in specific transduction cascades, and ultimately affect the functional properties of the channel (3.Scannevin R.H. Trimmer J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1997; 232: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 4.Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.-P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J.

Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions occur between two or more proteins at discreet modules that may or may not require phosphorylation for recognition of the signaling motif. Voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels have been reported to interact with the Src homology (SH) 3 domains of Src kinase by recognition of a proline-rich P XXP sequence motif in the channel review (9.Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 10.Magoski N.S. Wilson G.F. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to cause biophysical changes in channel function due to the interaction or to tyrosine phosphorylation by Src. Kv1.3, a mammalian homologue to the Shaker subfamily, contains two proline-rich stretches, one in the amino terminus (39–44 PLPPALP) and one in the carboxyl terminus (493–496 P XTP) of the channel protein that could interact with Src kinase SH3 domain. Kv1.3 also has a total of 16 tyrosine residues, six of which lie within good recognition motifs for tyrosine-specific phosphorylation and could serve as potential interactive sites for Src kinase SH2 domain once phosphorylated by Src (see Fig. 1). Binding at the SH2 or SH3 domains of Src kinase has been found to propagate downstream signaling, and at times, inappropriate signaling by phosphorylation that has been linked to several pathological conditions including asthma, autoimmune disease, oncogenesis, Alzheimer's, and allergies (11.Bradshaw J.M. Mitaxov V. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 971-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that while a related Kv family member, Kv1.5, co-immunoprecipitates with Src kinase at the Src SH3 domain, Kv1.3 fails to retain a strong interaction with Src kinase in HEK 293 cells by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (5.Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that adaptor molecules could form the physical complexes bringing together Kv1.3 and viral Src (v-Src) kinase to modulate the electrical activity by tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus the repertoire of adaptor proteins expressed in a given neuronal cell type and the specific capacity for regulating the proximity of kinase to its effector (the ion channel) may influence the electrical phenotype of a neuron to the same extent that expression of various voltage-gated channel species shape the overall macroscopic current properties of a cell. Kv1.3 is highly expressed in T-lymphocytes, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the pyriform cortex, and the olfactory bulb (OB) (12.Kues W.A. Wunder F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 1296-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the olfactory bulb, Kv1.3 is localized to the mitral and granule neurons, where it is a substrate for protein phosphorylation by multiple tyrosine kinases that induce change in its function as assessed electrophysiologically (13.Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6126-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Fadool D.A. Tucker K. Phillips J.J. Simmen J.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2332-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Two adaptor proteins that have been shown to be substrates of Src kinase and which we found were well expressed in the olfactory bulb, are neuronal Shc and collagen homology protein (n-Shc) and growth factor receptor binding protein 10 (Grb10) (15.Pelicci G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6960-6967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Thus the olfactory bulb represents a discrete brain region where channel-kinase-adaptor protein physiology could be investigated and where association of protein modules may influence channel function. Herein we report that two adaptor proteins differentially modulate v-Src-induced Kv1.3 phosphorylation and modulation of channel function. Grb10 adaptor significantly reduces v-Src-induced Kv1.3 phosphorylation, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.3 is modestly increased in the presence of n-Shc adaptor. The proline-rich sequences contained in Grb10 adaptor protein may compete for the SH3 domain of Src to decrease the ability for Src to phosphorylate Kv1.3 and suppress Kv1.3 current magnitude, increase the inactivation time constant (τinact), and disrupt cumulative inactivation during repetitive voltage stimulation. n-Shc adaptor also acts to prevent the v-Src-induced increase in the Kv1.3 inactivation time constant (τinact) but additionally reverses a shift in voltage dependence typically observed for Kv1.3 in the presence of v-Src. Through site-directed mutagenesis of the regulatory Tyr residues in the CH domain of n-Shc and comparison of the activity of n-Shc with a close family member, Sck, data suggest that a portion of the CH domain that includes Tyr221, Tyr222, and Tyr304and is homologous to Sck regulates a shift in Kv1.3 voltage dependence and inactivation kinetics in the presence of v-Src kinase and Shc adaptor protein. Human embryonic kidney cell (HEK 293) patch pipette solution contained (in mm): 30 KCl, 120 NaCl, 10 HEPES, and 2 CaCl2 (pH 7.4). HEK 293 cell recording bath solution contained (in mm): 150 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, and 0.5 MgCl2 (pH 7.4). Cell lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (PPI solution) contained (in mm): 25 Tris (pH 7.5), 250 NaCl, 5 EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 sodium orthovanadate, 1:100 dilution of Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (catalog number P-5726), 1:500 dilution of Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (catalog number P-8340). Wash buffer contained (in mm): 25 Tris (pH 7.5), 250 NaCl, 5 EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Homogenization buffer contained (in mm): 320 sucrose, 10 Tris base, 50 KCl, and 1 EDTA (pH 7.8). All salts were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Tissue culture and transfection reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. One set of OB from Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day 17 (P17) and P30 (adult) were quickly dissected using American Veterinary Medical Association- and National Institutes of Health-approved methods. Harvested OB tissue was homogenized on ice using a Kontes tissue grinder (size 20; 50 strokes) and homogenization buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 detergent and Sigma protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (see “Solutions and Reagents”). The mixture was vortexed every 15 min for 4 h and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (lysate) was stored at −80 °C until subsequent use. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay; 10 or 40 μg of lysate was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blots were probed with antisera for Src, Shc, and Grb (see below). All channel, kinase, and adaptor protein coding regions were downstream from a cytomegalovirus promoter. The v-Src cDNA construct was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Huganir (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and was located in a modified PRK5 vector. The R385A v-Src cDNA construct (v-Src with severely impaired tyrosine kinase activity) was a generous gift from Dr. M. Senften (Friedrich Miescher-Institute, Basel, Switzerland) (19.Senften M. Schenker G. Sowadski J.M. Ballmer-Hofer K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 199-203PubMed Google Scholar). The entire R385A v-Src coding region was inserted into a modified PRK5 vector (20.Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Berman K. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Neuronal Shc (n-Shc), Sck, and n-Shc mutant cDNA (Tyr to Phe point mutations at Tyr220, Tyr221, and Tyr304) were generous gifts from Dr. T. Nakamura (Sumitomo Electric Industries, Yokohama, Japan) and were expressed in the vector pCMV1 (21.Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1121Google Scholar). The n-Shc mutant will be referred to as the “triple” mutant. Grb10 cDNA was a gift from Dr. R. Roth (Stanford University) and was expressed in pBlueScript SK (−) vector (Stratagene). AU13, a rabbit polyclonal Kv1.3 antiserum, was designed against the 46-amino acid sequence (478MVIEEGGMNHSAFPQTPFKTGNSTATCTTNNNPNDCVNIKKIFTDV523) representing the unique coding region of Kv1.3 between the amino terminus and transmembrane domain 1. The purified peptide was produced by Genmed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA), and the antiserum was generated by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). This antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (1:1000) and Western blot detection (1:1500) of Kv1.3. 2K. Tucker and D. A. Fadool, submitted for publication. The monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biochemical) recognized phosphorylated tyrosine residues and was used at 3.5 μg/ml for immunoprecipitation and 1:1000 for Western analysis. Src monoclonal antibody, directed against the Src SH3 domain (Oncogene Ab-1), was used at 10 μg/ml for immunoprecipitation and 1:40–1:100 for Western analysis. Polyclonal antisera for Shc (H-108) and Grb10 (K-20) were from Santa Cruz; each was used at 20 μg/ml for immunoprecipitation and between 1:200–1000 for Western blot detection. HEK 293 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM), 2% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Before transfection, cells were grown to 100% confluency (7 days), dissociated with trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) and mechanical trituration, diluted in MEM to a concentration of 600 cells/ml, and replated on Corning dishes (catalog number 25000, Fisher Scientific). cDNA was introduced into HEK 293 cells with a LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) 3–5 days after passage as previously described (13.Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6126-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Fadool D.A. Tucker K. Phillips J.J. Simmen J.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2332-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected for 4–5 h with 0.5–0.75 μg of each cDNA construct per 35-mm dish for electrophysiology or 3.5–5.0 μg of each cDNA construct per 60-mm dish for biochemistry. Plasmid DNA with no coding insert (control vector) served as the control to equalize total μg of cDNA added to each dish. Cells were either harvested for biochemical analysis or used for electrophysiological recordings ∼30–40 h after transfection. For patch clamp experiments, transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfecting with pHook (Invitrogen) as a means of rapidly selecting cells expressing Kv1.3 channels. pHook encodes a transmembrane domain from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, which is then anchored on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. Before patch recording, a brief incubation with an appropriate antibody linked to a 5-μm polystyrene bead allowed recognition of transfected cells. Efficiency of co-transfection (>95%) with our transfection method has been tested using double sequential labeling and confocal microscopic visualization, as reported previously (14.Fadool D.A. Tucker K. Phillips J.J. Simmen J.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2332-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Patch electrodes were fabricated from Jencons glass (Jencons Limited, Bedfordshire, UK), fire-polished to ∼1 μm, and coated near the tip with beeswax to reduce the electrode capacitance. Pipette resistances were between 9 and 14 megohms. Hoffman modulation contrast optics was used to visualize cells at 40× magnification (Axiovert 135, Carl Zeiss). Macroscopic currents in cell-attached membrane patches were recorded using an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 2–5 kHz, and stored for later analysis. All voltage signals were generated and data were acquired with the use of either a Microstar DAP 800/2 board with in-house written software (DapClamp, Microstar Lab, Bellevue, WA) or an Axon Digidata 1200 board with pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Data were analyzed using Microcal Origin software. Outward macroscopic currents were recorded in the cell-attached rather than whole-cell configuration; Kv1.3 channel expression is so robust in the HEK 293 expression system that it is not routinely possible to record whole-cell currents without saturating the amplifier (20.Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Berman K. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22.Bowlby M.R. Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Levitan I.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,23.Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patches were held at a holding potential of −90 mV and stepped in 20 mV depolarizing potentials using a pulse duration of 1000 ms. Pulses were generally delivered at intervals of 60 s or longer to prevent cumulative inactivation of the Kv1.3 channel (24.Marom S. Goldstein S.A. Kupper J. Levitan I.B. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar). Kv1.3 peak current amplitude, channel inactivation (τinact) and deactivation (τdeact) kinetics, voltage at one-half-maximal activation (V1/2), and slope of the voltage dependence (κ) were measured in the presence of Src kinase and in the presence or absence of an adaptor protein (n-Shc or Grb10). Each biophysical property was analyzed in the form of non-normalized data by one-way ANOVA with a Student-Newman-Keuls' (S-N-K) follow-up test at the 95% confidence level to determine any statistical difference in Kv1.3 channel function in the presence of kinase or adaptor proteins. For graphical representations of peak current amplitudes among different transfection conditions, measurements were normalized to the transfection condition of Kv1.3 alone within a single recording session and respective transfection set. Kinetic properties of Kv1.3 have been reported to be independent of current magnitude (24.Marom S. Goldstein S.A. Kupper J. Levitan I.B. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar), thus peak current amplitude but not kinetic data were normalized to adjust for differences in channel expression between transfections. Fitting parameters for inactivation and deactivation kinetics were as previously described (14.Fadool D.A. Tucker K. Phillips J.J. Simmen J.A. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2332-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, the inactivation of the macroscopic current, during a 1000-ms voltage step from −90 to +40 mV, was fit to the sum of two exponentials by minimizing the sums of squares using a bi-exponential function (y = y0 +A1e−(x−x0)/τ1 +A2e−(x-x0)/τ2). The two inactivation time constants (τ1 and τ2) were combined by multiplying each by its weight (A) and summing. The summed inactivation rate was calculated with the equation tau inactivation (τInact) = [(A1 ∗ τ1) + (A2 ∗ τ2)]/(A1 +A2). The deactivation of the macroscopic current was fit similarly but to a single exponential (y = y0+ Ae-(x-x0)/τ). Tail current amplitudes were plotted in a current-voltage relationship and fit to a Boltzmann sigmoidal curve (y = [(A1 +A2)/(1 +e(x-x0)/dx)] + A2) to calculate the slope of voltage dependence (κ) and voltage at half-activation (V1/2) for Kv1.3. To study cumulative inactivation of Kv1.3 under the control condition and in the presence of Src and/or an adaptor protein, patches were held at −90 mV and stepped to +40 mV twelve times using a similar pulse duration as above but recording using different interpulse intervals, including 60, 30, 10, 2, 1, and 0.5 s. Peak current amplitudes were normalized to the initial trace in each series for a given interpulse interval. Cumulative inactivation was always present with interpulse intervals less than 60 s in the control (Kv1.3 alone) transfection condition, and as much as 50% of channels were caught in the inactivated state with repeated stimulation less than 2 s. Transfected cells were harvested by lysis 2 days posttransfection in ice-cold PPI solution (see “Solutions and Reagents”). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h with 0.2–0.3 mg/ml protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), followed by recentrifugation to remove the protein A-Sepharose. To test the phosphorylation state of Kv1.3 in the presence of v-Src kinase plus or minus an adaptor protein, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from the clarified lysate by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 3–4 μg/ml 4G10 antibody (Upstate Biochemical). Immunoprecipitated proteins were harvested by a 2-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose and centrifugation as above. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer. Lysates and washed immunoprecipitates were diluted in SDS gel loading buffer (25.Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing 1 mmNa3VO4. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay. Proteins were separated on 10% acrylamide SDS gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody against Kv1.3, v-Src, Shc, or Grb10. Membranes were then exposed to species-specific peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences or Sigma) for 90 min at room temperature. ECL (Amersham Biosciences) exposure of Fuji RX film (Fisher) was used to visualize labeled protein. Resultant bands were quantified by densitometry using a Hewlett-Packard Photosmart Scanner in conjunction with Quantiscan software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Pixel densities for each band were normalized to Kv1.3 within the same cell passage, transfection, and autoradiograph. Mean pixel densities were then calculated across sets of normalized data contained in single autoradiographs. This type of quantification was designed to reduce inherent variability in cell culture, transient transfection efficiencies, and ECL exposure times. Statistical significance was set at the 95% confidence level for immunodensitometry data that were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with S-N-K follow-up test. In this study we have found that the modulation of the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.3, by the cellular tyrosine kinase, v-Src, is differentially affected by the presence of two adaptor proteins, n-Shc and Grb10. A schematic of the protein interaction modules and tyrosine phosphorylation recognition motifs contained in Kv1.3, n-Shc, Grb10, and Src is presented in Fig. 1. Kv1.3 becomes robustly phosphorylated at Tyr137 and Tyr449 when co-expressed with v-Src kinase in HEK293 cells to induce current suppression and decreased kinetics of inactivation (increased τinact time constant) (20.Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Berman K. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Likewise, patch pipette dialysis of c-Srcpp60 plus Mg-ATP induces similar biophysical changes in the outward whole-cell current of OB neurons, which is carried largely by Kv1.3 (13.Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6126-6137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Src kinase is ubiquitously expressed throughout the central nervous system, it was important to confirm the expression of Src in the OB in addition to its capacity for modulation of Kv1.3. Ten or 40 μg of OB lysate was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with a monoclonal antibody for viral Src (v-Src, 1:40–1:100) and Src expression was detected in the OB lysates at the expected molecular mass of 60 kDa (Fig. 2). In HEK 293 cells, a direct protein-protein interaction has been observed between v-Src kinase and Kv1.5, and this protein-protein interaction causes current suppression of Kv1.5 (5.Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although Src kinase modulates channel properties of Kv1.3 by tyrosine phosphorylation, the channel fails to co-immunoprecipitate with Src kinase in HEK 293 cells (5.Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We conjectured that perhaps adaptor protein modules might facilitate channel-kinase interactions in native neurons expressing Src and Kv1.3. We thus probed the SDS-PAGE-separated OB lysates with antisera for Shc (H-108) and Grb10 (K-20). Fig. 2demonstrates the observed protein bands of the predicted molecular mass (46/52/66 kDa and 60 kDa, respectively) for these two adaptor proteins. Shc adaptor protein is not expressed in brain regions; however, a neuronal-specific member of the Shc family, n-Shc, is highly expressed in the brain and the OB, as shown by in situ hybridization (18.Nakamura T. Muraoka S. Sanokawa R. Mori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6960-6967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because H-108 antibody detects all Shc isoforms as well as n-Shc, it is highly likely that we are detecting predominantly the n-Shc family member in the OB. Deletion of the c-Src activation loop produces the viral form of Src, v-Src, which has unlimited, constitutive activity in the absence of other cellular signaling (26.Maroney A.C. Qureshi S.A. Foster D.A. Brugge J.S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1207-1214PubMed Google Scholar). The rest of the experiments of this study were performed by transient co-transfection of v-Src plus Kv1.3 in an heterologous expression system (HEK 293 cells). This model facilitated the understanding of the potential mechanisms by which Src kinase could exert its effects on Kv1.3 in native OB neurons by allowing the experimenter to control the expression of putative protein-protein interacting partners and by having the ability to activate the kinase without induction of the endogenous upstream signaling cascade. Additionally, HEK 293 cells are known to express high levels of cloned proteins (27.Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G.W. Howe J.R. Hughes T.E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 211-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which facilitates good protein yields for immunoprecipitation. Untransfected HEK 293 cells also show no C-type inactivating K+ currents in response to voltage stimulation (20.Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Berman K. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with cDNA for Kv1.3 plus v-Src (see “Experimental Procedures”) plus or minus cDNA coding n-Shc or Grb10 adaptor proteins. Kv1.3 plus v-Src-co-transfected HEK 293 cells demonstrated that v-Src kinase significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.3 14-fold over that found in Kv1.3 alone-transfected cells (n = 10) (Fig. 3). Kv1.3 exhibited low levels of basal tyrosine phosphorylation, but as also observed by Holmes et al. (23.Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J.

The basal value of Kv1.3 tyrosine phosphorylation was assigned an arbitrary value of 1.0 (Fig. 3B). This value was used as a normalization factor for all other transfection conditions.

TNF-α also stimulates sphingosine kinase, the enzyme that phosphorylates sphingosine to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), a further metabolite of ceramide. Several clones of C6 cells, expressing widely varying levels of sphingosine kinase, were used to examine the role of SPP in regulation of GTPCH and BH4 biosynthesis. Overexpression of sphingosine kinase, with concomitant increased endogenous SPP levels, potentiated the effect of TNF-α on GTPCH expression and activity and BH4 biosynthesis. In contrast, enforced expression of sphingosine kinase had no effect on iNOS expression or NO formation. Furthermore, N,N-dimethylsphingosine, a potent sphingosine kinase inhibitor, completely eliminated the increased GTPCH activity and expression induced by TNF-α. Surprisingly, we found that, although C6 cells can secrete SPP, which is enhanced by TNF-α, treatment of C6 cells with exogenous SPP or dihydro-SPP had no affect on BH4 biosynthesis. However, both SPP and dihydro-SPP markedly stimulated ERK 1/2 in C6 cells, which express cell surface SPP receptors. Interestingly, although this ERK activation was blocked by PD98059, which also reduced cellular proliferation induced by enforced expression of sphingosine kinase, PD98059 had no effect on GTPCH activity. Collectively, these results suggest that only intracellularly generated SPP plays a role in regulation of GTPCH and BH4levels.

Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that BH4 may also have cofactor-independent roles (2.Milstien S. Curtius H.C. Blau N. Levine R.A. Unconjugated Pterins and Related Biogenic Amines. W. de Gruyter, Berlin1987: 49-65Google Scholar), including inhibition of cytokine-induced apoptosis (3.Mogi M. Kinpara K. Kondo A. Togari A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and stimulation of dopamine release (4.Koshimura K. Miwa S. Lee K. Fujiwara M. Watanabe Y. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cellular levels of BH4 are regulated by the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway (5.Thony B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Its expression is increased by proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, and is coordinately regulated with cytokine-inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) (6.Sakai N. Kaufman S. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). BH4 binds to NOS monomers, promoting their dimerization and subsequent activation (7.Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and recent crystallographic analysis suggests that it may play a direct role in the NOS reaction in a radical form (8.Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). GTPCH, a homodecamer of 30-kDa subunits arranged as two pentamers facing one another (9.Steinmetz M.O. Pluss C. Christen U. Wolpensinger B. Lustig A. Werner E.R. Wachter H. Engel A. Aebi U. Pfeilschifter J. Kammerer R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), catalyzes the rearrangement of GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate. This intermediate is then converted to BH4 in two subsequent reactions catalyzed by 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase, respectively, neither of which are rate-limiting. The signal transduction pathways that regulate induction of GTPCH are not well understood, although transcription factors such as NF-κβ and AP-1 are required for GTPCH mRNA expression (10.Togari A. Arai M. Mogi M. Kondo A. Nagatsu T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and recently, 5.8 kb of the rat GTPCH promoter have been cloned and found to contain a number of potential cytokine responsive elements (11.Kapatos G. Stegenga S.L. Hirayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5947-5957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that iNOS induction is dependent on the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB, we previously showed that NF-κβ was not required for induction of GTPCH in rat C6 glioma cells, a convenient astrocyte model, when stimulated with combinations of proinflammatory cytokines (12.Vann L.R. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13275-13281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas increases in levels of the sphingolipid metabolite ceramide induced by TNF-α played a role in iNOS induction, ceramide did not mimic the stimulatory effect of TNF-α on GTPCH expression. This led us to suggest that TNF-α regulates iNOS and GTPCH expression by divergent pathways and that TNF-α stimulates GTPCH transcription in C6 cells via a ceramide- and NF-κB-independent pathway. Sphingolipid metabolites, especially ceramide (N-acyl-sphingosine) and its further metabolite, sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP), have been implicated as mediators of TNF-α actions (reviewed in Refs. 13.Hannun Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 14.Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem.

In many cell types, TNF-α increases ceramide levels by activating sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzes plasma membrane sphingomyelin (14.Kolesnick R. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem.

Hara A. Uematsu T. Life Sci. 2000; 66: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), TNF-α stimulates sphingosine kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to form SPP. It is now well established that the bioactive lipid SPP regulates vital biological processes, including growth, survival, cell locomotion, angiogenesis, vascular maturation, inflammation, neurite retraction, and soma rounding (reviewed in Refs. 21.Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22.Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem.

Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SPP has been suggested to have novel dual modes of action: It is the ligand of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), known as the Endothelial Differentiation Gene-1 (EDG-1) family, which includes EDG-1, -3, -5, -6, and -8 (21.Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22.Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem.

Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and it functions intracellularly, acting through as yet unidentified targets (25.Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The EDG-1 receptors are highly specific and are only activated by SPP and dihydro-SPP, which has the same structure as SPP but lacks the 4,5-trans double bond. Dihydro-SPP, however, does not mimic all of the effects of SPP, especially those related to cell survival (26.Van Brocklyn J.R. Lee M.J. Menzeleev R. Olivera A. Edsall L. Cuvillier O. Thomas D.M. Coopman P.J.P. Thangada S. Hla T. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that SPP also has non-EDG receptor-mediated actions. As TNF-α stimulates GTPCH expression via a ceramide-independent pathway (12.Vann L.R. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13275-13281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and increases SPP levels (17.Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), it was of interest to investigate the role of sphingosine kinase and SPP in the regulation of GTPCH and BH4 biosynthesis. To this end, we generated several clones of stably transfected C6 cells that express varying levels of SPHK with concomitant increased endogenous SPP levels. TNF-α stimulated BH4 synthesis to a much greater extent in C6 cells expressing the highest sphingosine kinase activity. Surprisingly, we found that, although C6 cells can secrete SPP, only SPP generated intracellularly in response to TNF-α stimulated GTPCH activity and BH4 biosynthesis. Murine recombinant IL-1β was purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD). Recombinant rat TNF-α was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Mouse macrophage polyclonal iNOS antibody and mouse macrophage-positive controls were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Ann Arbor, MI). Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). All electrophoresis and Western blot materials were from NOVEX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). C6 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Murine SPHK1 (GenBankTM accession number AF068748) was subcloned by PCR into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with an N-terminal c-Myc epitope tag as previously described (27.Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stable transfectants were selected in growth medium containing 1 g/L G418 (Invitrogen). In preliminary studies, we found that multiple passages of C6 cells altered their responses to cytokines. Thus, all experiments were performed on a freshly thawed batch of cells that had been passaged only twice, then aliquoted and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen vapor. Prior to each experiment, cells were defrosted and grown in 175-cm2 flasks until 80–90% confluent, trypsinized, and then seeded at 100,000 cells/well in 6-well plates (3 ml of medium). After 48 h, cells were serum-starved for 4 h prior to treatments. All cytokine solutions were prepared according to the suppliers' instructions. After various treatments, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested by scraping in buffer A (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 15 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm4-deoxypyridoxine). Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing three times, and cytosolic fractions were prepared by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 20 min. 100 μl of cytosol (20–50 μg) was incubated with 10 μl of sphingosine (1 mm), prepared as a sphingosine-BSA complex (4 mg/ml BSA), and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) and sphingosine kinase activity measured as previously described (28.Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). C6 cells were washed with PBS and scraped in 1 ml of methanol containing 2.5 μl of concentrated HCl. Lipids were extracted by adding 2 ml of chloroform/1m NaCl (1:1, v/v) and 100 μl of 3 n NaOH, and phases were separated. The basic aqueous phase containing SPP, and devoid of sphingosine, ceramide, and the majority of phospholipids, was transferred to a siliconized glass tube. The organic phase was re-extracted with 1 ml of methanol/1 m NaCl (1:1, v/v) plus 50 μl of 3 n NaOH. Mass levels of SPP in the aqueous phase were measured as described previously (29.Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Total phospholipids in the organic phase were determined exactly as previously described (28.Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). C6 cells were incubated with 40 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in serum-containing medium for 48 h to label phospholipid pools to isotopic equilibrium. Cells were then washed and incubated in serum-free medium for the indicated times. Cells and media were extracted in alkaline conditions as described above, followed by back extraction into chloroform/methanol/conc. HCl (100:100:1, v/v). [32P]SPP was resolved by TLC in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v) and quantified with a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). After metabolically labeling cells with 32Pi, lipids were extracted as described before (28.Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L.C. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and separated by two dimensional-TLC on Silica Gel 60-G. Plates were developed in the first dimension with chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (13:7:1, v/v) and with chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (30:30:2:5, v/v) in the second dimension. Phospholipids were located by autoradiography and quantified with a PhosphorImager. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4), detached by trypsinization, then pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 3 min. Cell pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 250 μl of extraction buffer (EB) containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4/1 mm EDTA/1 mm DTT. Cell suspensions were sonicated on ice with a fine-tipped probe sonicator for 15 s, lysates were cleared at 10,000 ×g for 3 min, supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Blue Plus reagent (Pierce, Rockville, IL). BH4 was measured as previously described (12.Vann L.R. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13275-13281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, 50 μl of cell lysate was diluted to 80 μl with EB buffer, then mixed with 20 μl of 1 mH3PO4/1.5 m HClO4 (1:1, v/v). Approximately 10 mg of MnO2 was added to oxidize reduced pterins to their fluorescent aromatic forms. After 20 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. Supernatants were removed, and biopterin measured by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (30.Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GTPCH activity was measured essentially as previously described (30.Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, to 30 μl of lysate was added 5 μl of 0.5 mTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 μl of 10 mm DTT, 5 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA, and 5 μl of 10 mm GTP. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and placed on ice, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 1 m HCl, followed by 5 μl of iodine reagent (1% I2/2% potassium iodide (w/v)). After 20 min at room temperature in the dark, 5 μl of 2% ascorbic acid (w/v) was added followed by 10 μl of 2m Tris base. Neopterin triphosphate was then dephosphorylated by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 units of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase, followed by addition of 50 μl of 1 m H3PO4 to terminate the reactions. Samples were cleared by centrifugation, and neopterin was measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection (30.Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from confluent cultures with TRIzol reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA (1 μg) was converted to cDNA with random hexamers and Omniscript reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was amplified by PCR as previously described (12.Vann L.R. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13275-13281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The following forward and reverse PCR primers were used (predicted product size): GTPCH fwd, 5′-GGATACCAGGAGACCATCTCA-3′; GTPCH rev, 5′-TAGCATCCTGCTAGTGACAGT-3′ (372 bp); actin fwd, 5′-TTGTAACCAACTGGGACGATATGG-3′; actin fwd, 5′-GATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGCTAGG-3′ (743 bp). PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV fluorescence. Reaction conditions were optimized in preliminary experiments so that amplifications were within the logarithmic phase and yields were approximately linear with input cDNA concentration. To ensure that contaminating genomic DNA was not being amplified, PCR was also performed without reverse transcriptase treatment. Nitrite, the stable oxidation product of NO and an index of iNOS activity, accumulates in the media and was measured essentially as described previously (12.Vann L.R. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13275-13281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysates containing 20 μg of protein were concentrated using solvent phase partition. In brief, lysates were diluted to 450 μl with H2O and mixed with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1) to give a final ratio of 1:1:0.9. The mixture was vortexed and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 3 min to separate the phases. With this solvent combination, the proteins aggregate at the interphase. 700 μl of the upper phase was removed without disturbing the interphase, discarded, and an equivalent volume of methanol added back to the lower phase. The protein aggregates were pelleted at maximum speed for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Supernatants were carefully aspirated, and the pellets were dried at 50 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of 1× LDS NuPAGE sample buffer (NOVEX) containing 50 mm DTT, then heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Proteins were resolved on 4–12% Bis/Tris NuPAGE gels for 90 min at 175 V and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) at 100 V for 60 min in NOVEX transfer buffer at 4 °C. NuPAGE antioxidant (1:1000, v/v) was added to assist with transfer of high molecular weight proteins. Membranes were blocked with 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk/0.02% (v/v) azide/0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for at least 1 h at room temp, or overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with wash buffer (KPL), membranes were incubated with iNOS antibody (1:7500) for 2 h in milk diluent (KPL) and then with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000) for 1 h. Membranes were extensively washed, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). For analysis of total and phosphorylated ERK1/2, 80–90% confluent cultures of C6 cells in 10-cm dishes were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1:500 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Equal amounts (20 μg) of cytosol proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and ERK activation was determined with phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies (New England BioLabs). Stably transfected C6 cells (1000 cells) were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h, cells were washed with DMEM and then grown in serum-free medium. At the indicated times, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with methanol for 10 min, and stained with crystal violet. Incorporated dye was dissolved in 700 μl of 0.1 msodium citrate (pH 4.0) in 50% ethanol, and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. Previously, we found that, although TNF-α-induced expression of iNOS and subsequent NO production were mediated in part by increases in ceramide levels, GTPCH expression and activity and levels of the iNOS cofactor BH4 were not increased in parallel (12.Vann L.R.

Because ceramide can be readily converted to sphingosine and then SPP, it was of interest to determine whether a shift in the balance of cellular sphingolipid metabolites toward SPP might play a role in regulating the levels of BH4. To examine the possibility of a link between SPP levels and BH4 synthesis, C6 cells were stably transfected with c-Myc-tagged SPHK1 and multiple clones were analyzed for their respective SPHK activities and SPP levels. Three clonal lines were selected for further study with low, intermediate, and high levels of recombinant SPHK1 expression, designated C6-A, C6-B and C6-C, respectively (Fig. 1A). Basal SPP levels in these clones somewhat mirrored the differences in SPHK activities (Fig. 1B). Moreover, in the C6-C high SPHK1 cells, sphingosine levels were concomitantly reduced to 0.13 ± 0.01 from 0.2 ± 0.01 pmol/nmol phospholipid in the vector transfectants. Western blot analysis with anti-c-Myc antibody revealed that the different levels in SPP and SPHK activity resulted from differing levels of SPHK protein expression (Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, enforced expression of SPHK1 did not result in any changes in ceramide levels, although treatment with TNF-α increased ceramide levels by 50% in C6-C cells. In agreement, TNF-α induced a significant reduction in 32P-labeled sphingomyelin in these cells. However, two-dimensional TLC analysis did not reveal any differences in 32P-labeled phospholipids comigrating with phospholipids of C6 vector cells compared with C6-C cells, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and sphingomyelin (data not shown). TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, has previously been shown to stimulate SPHK activity and SPP levels (17.Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol.

In agreement, TNF-α increased SPHK activity and further increased SPP (data not shown) in the transfected C6 cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B). Treatment with TNF-α activated endogenous SPHK activity in empty vector-transfected cells after 15 min, which returned to basal levels by 30 min, typical of changes in SPHK activity previously observed in other cell types following stimulation with various agonists (17.Xia P.

After stimulation with TNF-α, SPHK activity in C6-C cells peaked at around 5 min, remained elevated for up to 30 min, an decreased thereafter (Fig. 2B). Thus, in agreement with previous results in transfected HEK 293 cells (35.Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Xia P. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. D'Andrea R.J. Wattenberg B.W. J. Biol.

The five different transporter subtypes show a high degree of similarity and are likely to form similar structures in the membrane. A number of models for the membrane topology of glutamate transporters have been proposed. Initial predictions of the topology from hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequence lead to three different models with 8, 10, and 12 transmembrane domains (8.Stork T. Schulte S. Hofmann K.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The models proposed from these studies both predict six α-helical transmembrane domains in the amino-terminal portion of the protein followed by a series of reentrant loops and membrane-associated structures followed by a final α-helical transmembrane domain and an intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain. The reentrant loop and membrane-associated structures are highly conserved in their amino acid sequences, and from mutagenesis studies, it has been proposed that this region forms the pore structure through which glutamate and the various co-transported and counter-transported ions pass. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether any of these residues also interact with anions, which raises the question as to whether the same region of the transporter that mediates the transport process is also responsible for allowing the uncoupled anion conductance. In a recent study (13.Mitrovic A.D. Plesko F. Vandenberg R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 26071-26076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Zn2+ ions selectively inhibit the anion conductance with no significant effect on the transport characteristics of the glutamate transporter EAAT-4, which suggests that the transport and anion conductances are mediated by distinct conformational states of the transporter. The Zn2+ binding site was found to be in the large second extracellular loop, which is in a region that is distinct from the reentrant loops and transmembrane domains that interact with glutamate and the co-transported and counter-transported cations. The aim of this study is to further investigate the conformational states responsible for the transport and anion channel functions of the transporter. We have attempted to identify amino acid residues, which when changed to cysteine and modified with the methanethiosulfonate (MTS) class of compounds (14.Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 15.Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), differentially alter the transport and anion channel properties of the transporter. To achieve this result, amino acid residues, which are accessible to MTS reagents and in close proximity to the pore region but do not directly interact with either glutamate or the co-transported and counter-transported cations, were targeted. Seal et al., (12.Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) identified a number of amino acid residues in a membrane-associated linker region that are accessible to MTS reagents, which appear to satisfy these criteria. In this study, we report [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) modification of the EAAT-1 mutant V452C blocks glutamate transport but does not interfere with glutamate binding to the transporter and activation of the uncoupled anion conductance. The selective disruption of transport while maintaining the anion channel function of EAAT-1 suggests that different conformational states of the transporter mediate the two functions. dl-Threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) was obtained from Tocris (Bristol, UK), and MTS derivatives were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. EAAT-1 subcloned into the plasmid oocyte transcription vector (pOTV) was kindly supplied by Susan Amara (The Vollum Institute, Portland, OR). A cysteine-less EAAT-1 (CLE1) was engineered by making conservative substitutions of the three native cysteine residues in EAAT-1 (C186A, C252A, and C375A) using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit and recommended protocol (Stratagene). Valine 452 was also mutated to a cysteine residue, V452C, using the same protocol. Both CLE1 and V452C were sequenced on both strands by dye terminator cycle sequencing (ABI PRISM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the Sydney University Prince Alfred Macromolecular Analysis Center. The CLE1 and V452C transporter cDNAs were linearized with BamHI and cRNA transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and capped with 5′-7-methylguanosine using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Inc., TX). Oocytes were harvested fromX. laevis as described previously (16.Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Chebib M. Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and 50 nl of cRNA was injected into defoliculated stage V oocytes and incubated in standard frog Ringer's solution called ND96 (96 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.55) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Current recordings were made 2–5 days later using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique with a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon instruments, Foster City, CA) interfaced with a MacLab 2e chart recorder (ADI Instruments, Sydney, Australia) using the Chart software and a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments), which is controlled by an IBM-compatible computer installed with pClamp software, version 7.0 (Axon Instruments). The current-voltage relationships for substrate-elicited conductances were determined by subtraction of steady-state current measurements in the absence of substrate obtained during 200-ms voltage pulses from −30 mV to potentials between −100 and +40 mV in 10 mV steps from corresponding current measurements in the presence of substrate. Current voltage measurements were normalized to the current generated by l-glutamate at −100 mV unless otherwise stated. In recordings in which the extracellular Cl− concentration was altered, equimolar substitutions were made with bromide (Br−), iodide (I−), or nitrate (N O3⨪), and recordings were made with the bath grounded via a 3m KCl/agar bridge connected to a 3 m KCl reservoir to minimize offset potentials. To measure reverse transport conductances, ND96 buffer was replaced with a high K+buffer (46 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl), and steady-state currents measured in the presence of 300 μmTBOA during 200-ms voltage pulses from −30 mV to potentials between −100 and +40 mV in 10 mV steps were subtracted from corresponding current measurements in high K+ buffer alone. The uptake ofl-[3H]glutamate (Amersham Biosciences) was measured in oocytes expressing CLE1, V452C, and uninjected oocytes by placing five oocytes in ND96 buffer containing 10 μml-[3H]glutamate. MTSET-treated cells were incubated in 1 mm MTSET for 5 min and washed three times in ND96 at room temperature before uptake was performed. After 5 min,l-[3H]glutamate uptake was terminated by three rapid washes in ice-cold ND96 buffer followed by lysis in 50 mm NaOH and scintillation counting. The effects of MTSET treatment of V452C and CLE1 ond-[3H]aspartate (Amersham Biosciences) reverse transport were also measured. Oocytes were incubated with 10 μmd-[3H]aspartate in ND96 for 1 h at room temperature to load the oocytes withd-[3H]aspartate followed by washing the cells three times in ice-cold buffer.d-[3H]Aspartate-loaded cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mm MTSET for 5 min at room temperature and washed three times in buffer before release was initiated. Single oocytes were placed in 500 μl of high K+ buffer (46 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl) for 90 s, and 400 μl of the external solution was then removed for scintillation counting and measurement of the extent of reverse transport. Background rates of release were measured in the presence of 1 mm TBOA. Oocytes were also removed, and the level of radioactivity was measured to confirm the extent of loading ofd-[3H]aspartate. An analysis of kinetic data was carried out using the Kaleidagraph Software version 3.1.l-Glutamate dose responses were fitted by least squares as a function of current (I) to I/Imax = [S]/(EC50 + [S]), where Imax is the maximal current, EC50 is the concentration ofl-glutamate that generates half-maximal current, and [S] is the l-glutamate concentration. TBOA is a competitive blocker of glutamate transport (17.Shimamoto K. LeBrun B. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Sakaitani M. Shigeri Y. Yumoto N. Nakajima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and the following equation was used to estimate the IC50 for TBOA,I/Iglu = 1 − ([TBOA]/[TBOA + IC50]). All values presented are the means of at least three cells ± S.E. One-way ANOVA test with the Bonferroni'spost hoc test or the Student's t test were performed using GraphPad Prism (18.Motulsky, H. (1999) Analysing Data with GraphPad Prism, pp. 45, 69, and 70, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar) to assess the difference in the means. p < 0.05 were taken to be significant and are indicated in figures with an asterisk. The application of MTS derivatives to the wild-type EAAT-1 transporter does not alter its transport activity (19.Seal R.P. Amara S.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1487-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, to ensure that further mutations do not expose a previously unreactive cysteine residue, a cysteine-less transporter was constructed. Conservative substitutions for the three endogenous cysteine residues (C186A, C252A, and C375A) resulted in a transporter termed CLE1. The application of l-glutamate or d-aspartate to oocytes expressing CLE1 elicits a conductance that is qualitatively similar to wild type in terms of current amplitude, rectification, and apparent substrate affinity (Fig. 1,A and C). The application of 1 mmMTSET for 5 min caused no change in thel-glutamate-elicited or d-aspartate-elicited conductances (Fig. 1, A and C). The application of 100 μml-glutamate to oocytes expressing CLE1 or the V452C mutant generates similar conductances, which suggests that the cysteine mutation does not alter the structure or function of the transporter. The application of 1 mm MTSET does not affect thel-glutamate-activated conductance of CLE1 but does cause significant changes in the l-glutamate-activated conductance of the V452C mutant (Fig. 1B). The amplitude of the current is decreased at negative potentials, and the reversal potential of the current is shifted 40 mV to more negative membrane potentials to −18.7 ± 0.9 mV (n = 6,p < 0.0001). Similar reductions in current amplitude and reversal potential measurements are also observed ford-aspartate-activated conductances (Fig. 1D). Despite these differences, the EC50 for thel-glutamate-activated conductances of the V452C mutant were not significantly different before and after treatment with MTSET or compared with the CLE1 transporter (Fig. 2) and the wild-type transporter (4.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar,20.Vandenberg R.J. Arizza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol.

In wild-type EAAT-1, the glutamate-activated conductance is composed of an inwardly rectifying glutamate transport conductance and an uncoupled chloride conductance (4.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 22.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Xenopus laevisoocytes, the reversal potential for chloride ions is ∼−20 mV (3.Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arizza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 4.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 23.Barish M.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref Scopus (490) Google Scholar), which is similar to the reversal potential observed for the V452C mutant after MTSET treatment (−18.7 ± 0.9 mV). Thus, the effect of MTSET may be to selectively reduce the transport component of the conductance with chloride contributing a greater proportion of the current, resulting in the current reversing the direction closer to the reversal potential for chloride ions. To confirm this hypothesis, l-[3H]glutamate uptake by oocytes expressing CLE1 and the V452C mutant with and without MTSET treatment was measured. Under control conditions with no MTSET treatment, the rates of l-[3H]glutamate uptake by oocytes expressing CLE1 and V452C-expressing oocytes are similar (Fig. 3). After incubation of the oocytes with 1 mm MTSET, the rate ofl-[3H]glutamate uptake by oocytes expressing CLE1 is unaffected, whereas the rate of uptake by oocytes expressing the V452C mutant is reduced to background levels (Fig. 3). These results confirm that the rate of glutamate transport is unaffected by the V452C mutation and that application of MTSET to the V452C mutant transporter selectively inhibits the transport component of the glutamate-activated conductance. The uncoupled anion conductance of the glutamate transporter family displays a chaotropic selectivity sequence in which some anions are more permeant than others (4.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 5.Billups B. Rossi D. Atwell D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the more permeant anions in the extracellular solution, the substrate-induced currents are larger in amplitude and the reversal potential of these currents shifts to more hyperpolarized potentials as the proportion of the current being carried by the anions increases. When extracellular Cl− is substituted with either bromide (Br−), iodide (I−), or nitrate (NO3⨪), the amplitude and reversal potential of the glutamate-activated currents of CLE1 and V452C (Fig. 4) are similar to that previously described for wild-type EAAT-1 (4.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 22.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MTSET treatment does not affect the amplitudes or reversal potentials of the glutamate-activated conductances of CLE1 but does cause significant changes in the V452C mutant (Fig. 4). MTSET treatment of V452C transporters increases the amplitude of the anion conductance and shifts the reversal potential to more hyperpolarized potentials. These results confirm that the application of glutamate to the mutant transporter after MTSET treatment still activates an anion conductance, but they also confirm that the nature of the anion conductance has not been altered. The results presented thus far suggest that MTSET modification of the V452C mutant EAAT-1 does not affect glutamate binding and activation of the anion conductance but does inhibit glutamate transport. We have also investigated whether reverse transport and the reverse transport-activated chloride conductance (5.Billups B. Rossi D. Atwell D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are similarly affected. To isolate reverse transport and reverse transport-activated chloride conductances, it was necessary to use the glutamate transport blocker TBOA (17.Shimamoto K. LeBrun B. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Sakaitani M. Shigeri Y. Yumoto N. Nakajima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). TBOA is a non-transportable competitive inhibitor of glutamate transport that binds to the extracellular-facing glutamate binding site. However, before using TBOA to characterize reverse transport, we investigated its effect on forward transport under standard ionic conditions to confirm that it still binds to the mutant transporter. After MTSET treatment, increasing doses of TBOA caused a progressive reduction in the glutamate-activated conductance with an IC50 of 43 μm for CLE1 and 181 μm for the V452C transporter (n = 2, data not shown). Thus, although glutamate binding to either CLE1 or V452C is unaffected by MTSET treatment (see above), the affinity of TBOA for the MTSET-modified mutant is reduced. Nonetheless, high doses of TBOA used in the following experiment still block a large proportion of the conductance elicited by 30 μml-glutamate. Under conditions of elevated extracellular K+ and reduced extracellular Na+, glutamate transporters may function in reverse (1.Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 45: 634-637Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 24.Szatkowski M. Barbour B. Attwell D. Nature. 1990; 348: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In X. laevis oocytes, this procedure may lead to the activation of a variety of conductances, but with the use of TBOA, it is possible to isolate the conductance changes that are specific to reverse operation of glutamate transporters. Under conditions of elevated extracellular K+ (50 mm) and reduced extracellular Na+ (46 mm, the application of 300 μm TBOA blocks conductances because of reverse transport in both CLE1 and the mutant transporter V452C, which reverse the direction at −48 ± 5 mV (n = 3) and −52 ± 1 mV (n = 3), respectively, and are ∼10% of the forward transport conductance activated by 30 μml-glutamate (Fig. 5, A and B). After MTSET treatment, TBOA block of the reverse transport conductance of CLE1 is unaffected. However, high extracellular K+ does not activate any conductance of the MTSET-modified mutant V452C, which can be blocked by TBOA. The conductance activated by reverse transport in the wild-type transporter will also have two components comprised of the coupled movement of glutamate/3Na+/H+/K+, and the reverse transport-activated chloride conductance (5.Billups B. Rossi D. Atwell D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Watzke N. Grewer C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The lack of any conductance blocked by TBOA after MTSET treatment of V452C suggests that both the reverse transport and reverse transport-activated chloride conductance are not activated by high extracellular K+. To confirm these findings, the reverse transport ofd-[3H]aspartate was measured. Oocytes expressing CLE1 or V452C oocytes were preloaded withd-[3H]aspartate, which was chosen as it is a non-metabolized substrate of EAAT-1. Control oocytes were placed in ND96 at room temperature, whereas MTSET-treated cells were incubated with 1 mm MTSET for 5 min. Oocytes were washed and then placed in the same high K+ buffer used for the electrophysiological recordings. Transporter-specific release ofd-[3H]aspartate was determined by the subtraction of the amount of release measured in the presence of 1 mm TBOA. MTSET treatment significantly reduced the amount of V452C-specific release to background levels (Fig. 5C) but did not affect the amount of CLE1-specificd-[3H]aspartate release (data not shown). The lack of d-[3H]aspartate release and the lack of any conductance blocked by TBOA after MTSET treatment of V452C suggest that both the reverse transport and reverse transport-activated chloride conductance are prevented by the MTSET treatment. These results are in contrast to that observed for the effects of MTSET on forward transport where only the coupled transport conductance was inhibited, and these results suggest that the effects of MTSET are asymmetrical with respect to forward and reverse transport activation of the chloride conductance. The observation that glutamate transporters may have a secondary function as glutamate-activated anion channels (3.Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arizza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G.

Dowling J.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3852-3862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has raised a number of questions. 1) What is the structural basis for the different functions? 2) How are these two processes coordinated? 3) Is it possible to independently modulate the two processes? In this study, we have described a mutant EAAT-1 transporter V452C that when modified with MTSET selectively blocks glutamate transport while retaining the glutamate-activated uncoupled chloride channel function of the transporter. The EC50 for glutamate activation of the anion conductance of the MTSET-modified transporter is not significantly different from the EC50 for glutamate transport and anion conductance activation of the CLE1 or wild-type EAAT-1, which demonstrates that the glutamate recognition site is not significantly altered in the MTSET-modified mutant transporter. Valine 452 is located in a hydrophobic “linker” region that is exposed to the extracellular solution and lies between the reentrant loop that is likely to form the glutamate recognition site (12.Seal R.P.

The results presented in this study confirm that this linker region is unlikely to be directly involved in glutamate recognition and activation of the anion conductance but do suggest that conformational changes mediated by this region may be required for the translocation of glutamate through the transporter. The activation of the anion conductance of the MTSET-modified V452C mutant transporter requires glutamate binding but clearly does not require active transport, which confirms previous studies (5.Billups B. Rossi D. Atwell D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that the binding of glutamate to the transporter without transport is sufficient for activation of the anion conductance. The anion conductance of the MTSET-modified mutant transporter shows some subtle differences compared with the anion conductance that is activated by glutamate binding/transport of the wild-type EAAT-1 and the CLE1 transporter. In addition to the shift in reversal potential of the glutamate-activated conductance before and after MTSET treatment because of the removal of the transport component of the conductance, the amplitude of the anion conductance is significantly greater. These changes in anion conductance amplitude are most apparent with the more permeant anions iodide and nitrate, and in the case of nitrate, the slope conductance measured between 0 and +40 mV was increased 1.9-fold after MTSET treatment. The simplest explanation for these differences in the anion conductance properties is that the MTSET treatment prevents the transporter from undergoing conformational changes required for transport and increases either the open time for the anion channel or the frequency of anion channel opening resulting in a larger anion conductance. The results presented suggest that MTSET modification of V452C locks the transporter into a conformation that allows glutamate binding and activation of the anion conductance but does not allow translocation of glutamate through the transporter. However, under the conditions that cause the wild-type and CLE1 transporters to function in reverse, MTSET modification of the mutant appears to prevent both reverse transport and reverse transport activation of the anion conductance. This observation can be explained by postulating that MTSET modification of the mutant transporter locks the transporter into a conformation that allows glutamate to bind to an outward facing recognition site but does not allow reorientation of the transporter to bind glutamate from the intracellular surface. Thus, in the absence of glutamate binding to the intracellular recognition site, there is no anion conductance activated and no transporter-associated conductances for TBOA to block (Fig. 5,B and C). The selective manipulation of the transport properties of EAAT-1 without affecting the anion conductance is in contrast to the effects of Zn2+ on the glutamate transporter EAAT-4 in which Zn2+ selectively inhibits the anion conductance without affecting transport (13.Mitrovic A.D. Plesko F. Vandenberg R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 267: 26071-26076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These two studies (34.Haugeto O. Ullensvang K. Levy L.M. Chaudhry F.A.

A. 2000; 95: 8641-8646Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrate that it is possible to selectively manipulate the two functions of glutamate transporters, which highlights the possibility that the two functions are mediated via separate pore structures. The quaternary structure of the glutamate transporters is unknown, but two studies have suggested that that the transporters associate to form homomultimeric complexes. Electron micrograph studies of EAAT-3 expressed in oocyte membranes suggest that the transporters exist as a pentameric assembly (35.Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 95: 8641-8646Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It was suggested that each transporter “subunit” conducted coupled glutamate transport, whereas the association of the subunits allows the formation of a central chloride channel. If this model is correct, MTSET modification of the mutant transporter may prevent translocation of glutamate by each of the subunits but not alter the conformational changes required for the opening of the central chloride ion channel. Although the structural model proposed by Eskandari et al. (35.Eskandari S. Kreman M. Kavanaugh M.P. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 95: 8641-8646Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) can explain how it is possible to independently manipulate the transport and anion channel functions of the transporter, the results presented in this study can also be equally well explained by a common pathway for transport and chloride ion permeation in which the transporter is able to switch between the two modes of operation. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that the transport and chloride channel properties are mediated by different conformational states of the transporter, and additional site-directed mutagenesis studies, which identify distinct molecular determinants of the two functions, will be required to distinguish between the single and multiple pore models for glutamate transporter function. Since the original submission of this paper, a similar study has been published by Seal et al. (36.Seal R.P. Shigeri Y. Eliasof S. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This study investigated the effects of MTS reagents on a valine residue 449 to cysteine mutation in EAAT-1 (36.Seal R.P.

A. 2001; 98: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and also showed that MTS reagents abolish glutamate transport but do not affect the anion conductance. If the domain containing these residues is an α-helix, the two residues (449 and 452) would be located on the same side of the helix and suggests that this domain may form part of a structure necessary for the transduction of substrate binding into substrate translocation through the transporter.

https://openalex.org/W2006515971,"Abstract Light chain amyloidosis involves the systemic deposition of fibrils in patients overproducing monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains. The kinetics of fibril formation of LEN, a benign light chain variable domain, were investigated at physiological pH in the presence of urea. Despite the lack of in vivofibril formation, LEN readily forms fibrils in vitro under mildly destabilizing conditions. The effect of low to moderate concentrations of urea on the conformation, association state, stability, and kinetics of fibrillation of LEN were investigated. The conformation of LEN was only slightly affected by the addition of up to 4 m urea. The fibrillation kinetics were highly dependent on protein and urea concentrations, becoming faster with decreasing protein concentration and increasing urea concentration. Changes in spectral probes were concomitant to fibril formation throughout the protein and urea concentration ranges, indicating the absence of off-pathway oligomeric species or amorphous aggregates prior to fibril formation. Reducing the amount of dimers initially present in solution by either decreasing the protein concentration or adding urea resulted in faster fibril formation. Thus, increasing concentrations of urea, by triggering dissociation of dimeric LEN, lead to increased rates of fibrillation."

Functional analysis has shown that HAND2 is involved in development of the branchial arches, heart, limb, vasculature, and nervous system. Although it is essential for development of numerous tissues, little is known about its mode of action. To this end, we have characterized HAND2 transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Using mammalian one-hybrid analysis we show that HAND2 contains a strong transcriptional activation domain in the amino-terminal third of the protein. Like most tissue-restricted bHLH factors, HAND2 heterodimerizes with the broadly expressed bHLH factors, the E-proteins. We determined the consensus DNA binding site of HAND2 and show that HAND2 binds a subset of E-boxes as a heterodimer with E12. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a neuroblastoma cDNA library for HAND2-interacting proteins selected HAND2 and numerous additional members of the E-protein family. Although HAND2 homodimer formation was confirmed by in vitro analysis, HAND2 fails to homodimerize in a mammalian two-hybrid assay but demonstrates robust HAND2/E12 interaction.

Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). They are most often associated with developmental events including lineage determination and differentiation and regulation of tissue-specific genes. Their roles in development and the mechanisms of bHLH protein function have been most extensively studied in the developing myogenic and neural lineages. In these lineages, bHLH factors are essential for all aspects of development from cellular determination through terminal differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 2.Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar and 3.Mccormick M.B. Tamimi R.M. Snider L. Asakura A. Bergstrom D. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5792-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The bHLH family is divided into several classes based on structure, function, and expression pattern during development (2.Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). The distinguishing structural characteristics of this family of transcription factors are a DNA binding basic domain and a helix-loop-helix dimerization domain. In general, these factors regulate transcription through direct binding to DNA in the regulatory regions of genes. Binding of bHLH factors requires dimerization with other members of the bHLH family. Tissue-restricted bHLH factors compose the largest class and generally function by dimerization with a small but broadly expressed class of bHLH factors, the E-proteins. Members of the tissue-restricted class of bHLH factors act to regulate transcription as activators, repressors, or both (3.Mccormick M.B. Tamimi R.M. Snider L. Asakura A. Bergstrom D. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5792-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, transcriptional activity of the tissue restricted bHLH proteins requires association with other bHLH and non-bHLH proteins. For example, the myogenic and neurogenic factors regulate at least partially through direct interaction with histone acetyl transferase factors (4.Mutoh H. Fung B.P. Naya F.J. Tsai M.J. Nishitani J. Leiter A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3560-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5.Mutoh H. Naya F.J. Tsai M.J. Leiter A.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These interactions have been shown to be essential for modulating transcriptional activity as well as controlling differentiation (6.Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V. Ogryzko V. Puri P.L. Wu H.Y. Wang J.Y.

Repression by bHLH factors also occurs through recruitment of repressor proteins. Among the best characterized of these repressors are members of the Enhancer of split/Hairy family of repressors (11.Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K.L. Lyons G.E. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A.

Sen R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 133: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The E-box element has been identified as essential for the regulation of a wide array of genes in neurons, muscle and other tissues. Because of their low level of complexity, E-boxes are found in high numbers throughout the genome; however, the central two bases and sequences flanking the E-box provide additional DNA binding specificity. Within the tissue-restricted class of bHLH factors, groups of proteins share similarities in sequence and expression patterns. Although members of these families often share overlapping expression patterns, they have different functions. For example, members of the twist-related bHLH subfamily that includes twist (9.Fuchtbauer E.M. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), Dermo-1 (10.Li L. Cserjesi P.

During embryogenesis they are expressed in numerous tissues including the heart, neural crest derivatives, smooth muscle, and extraembryonic lineages, suggesting that they play a role in the development of both mesodermal and nonmesodermal lineages. The expression patterns of the HAND genes is reflected in the distinct phenotypes produced by gene ablation through site-directed mutagenesis (17.Srivastava D. Thomas T. Lin Q. Kirby M.L. Brown D.

Cserjesi, unpublished observations. HAND1 null mice have extensive defects in the development of extraembryonic lineages leading to early embryonic lethality, whereas HAND2 null embryos succumb to cardiovascular defects. Although the biological importance of HAND2 during development has been well established, the molecular mechanism of HAND2 function has not been examined extensively. It has been shown that HAND1 and HAND2 can interact to form a heterodimer and unexpectedly that HAND2 also homodimerizes (20.Firulli B.A. Hadzic D.B. McDaid J.R. Firulli A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33567-33573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). HAND1 and HAND2 contain several regions of high sequence similarity including almost complete identity in the HLH region, suggesting the two proteins share some common functions. However, in their basic domain they share only 62% overall identity and no identity in the core amino acids identified as essential for DNA sequence recognition in a number of bHLH factors. This suggests that HAND2 binds a different DNA sequence and regulates different target genes. To better understand the differences between these proteins and their molecular bases of action, we have undertaken an analysis of HAND2 activity. We find that HAND2 activates gene expression through a transcriptional activation domain located in the amino-terminal region that can be masked by intra- or intermolecular interactions. Using cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) (21.Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we determined that HAND2 binds an E-box distinct from that bound by HAND1. E-box-specific binding is dependent on heterodimer formation with E-proteins. We show that the consensus sequence for this E-box supports HAND2 dependent transcription in vivo. Our analysis suggests that HAND2 forms a homodimer in vitro but functions as a heterodimer with E-proteins in vivo and functions to activate transcription through binding a subset of E-boxes as a heterodimer with the broadly expressed E-proteins. The following constructs were generated. The original HAND2 cDNA clone was obtained from a pLox mouse embryo cDNA library. For pBSKII-H2–7, the 1.2-kb cDNA insert was subcloned as an EcoRI and HindIII fragment into Bluescript vector (Stratagene). For pRSET2b-His-HAND2, the coding region of HAND2 was amplified by PCR from pBSKII-H2–7 using the primers 5′-GGAAGGCGCCATGGGTCTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-TCTGGCGCCATGGCCCCCG-3′ to simultaneously add NcoI restriction sites at the start of translation and after the stop codon. The PCR product was cloned into the NcoI site of pRSET2b (Invitrogen). For pGEX2TK-GST-dHAND, the NcoI fragment of HAND2 from pRSET2b was end-filled with Klenow and cloned into the SmaI site of the pGEX2TK (Amersham Biosciences). For pcDNA-His-HAND2, the BamHI and EcoRI fragment from pRSET2B-HAND2 was cloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites in pcDNA-His B (Invitrogen). For pAS2-HAND2, the NcoI HAND2 fragment from pRSET2b-His-HAND2 was cloned into the NcoI site of pAS2 (gift of Steve Ellidge, Baylor College of Medicine). For pSG424-HAND2, HAND2 was excised from pRSET2b-His-HAND2 as an NcoI fragment, end-filled with Klenow, and cloned into pSG424-Gal4 vector at the SmaI site fusing HAND2 in-frame with the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Gal4. The generation of amino-terminal deletions of HAND2 was by PCR synthesis using pSG424-HAND2 as template. Synthesized fragments were cloned into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of the expression vector pM (CLONTECH). The sense primer (S) for AA 1–20, 1–40, 1–60 was located in the Gal4-DBD binding domain, 5′-CATAGAATAAGTGCGACATCA-3′. The antisense (AS) primers were: AA 1–20, 5′-GGCCTTCTAGAGAATGGGTAGCCCTCATGG-3′; AA 1–40, 5′-GGCCTTCTAGAGTTCTCTTCGTGGCTGCAG-3′; AA 1–60, 5′-GGCCTTCTAGACAGGGCCATACTGTAGTCG-3′. For AA 51–73 the primers were 5′-GATTAGAATTCCCGGAGATGTCGCCCCCCGAC-3′ (S) and 5′-GAAATTCTAGACGC GGCACCGCTGGCGTACTC-3′ (AS). For AA 17–40 the primer was 5′-GATTAGAATTCGGCTACCCATTCGCCGCAGCC (S) and the same AS primer used for the AA 1–40 construct. For AA 40–85 the primers were 5′-GATTAGAATTCAACCCC TACTTCCACGGCTGG-3′ (S) and 5′-GAAATTCTAGAGGGCGGCACTCCCCCATAATG-3′ (AS). For AA 40–73, the S primer was the same as that used for deletion AA 40–85, and the AS primer was the same as used for AA 51–73 synthesis. For pSG424-E12(bHLH), the bHLH domain of E12 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain was a gift from Anthony Firulli (20.Firulli B.A. Hadzic D.B. McDaid J.R. Firulli A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33567-33573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For pRc/RSV-H2, the HindIII/BamHI fragment of HAND2 from pcDNA-His-HAND2 was cloned into pRc/RSV (Invitrogen). For 4HE-TK-CAT, the reporter contains four copies of the HAND2 consensus binding site E-box (TCGACAGGGCCATCTGGCATTG) cloned upstream of a minimal TATA-thymidine kinase promoter. For TATA-Luc, the rat α-myosin TATA box (5′-AGCTTCGTGCAGTATAAAGGG-3′) was cloned into the HindIII site of pGL2 basic (Promega) (22.Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37178-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For 6HE-α-myosin-Luc, six copies of the HAND2 E-box were clones upstream of the TATA box of pTATA-Luc. HAND2-specific antibodies were generated in rabbits against a synthetic peptide (VKEEKRKKELNEILK) corresponding to a region in the amino-terminal portion of the protein using standard procedures (Research Genetics). Rabbit serum was tested for specificity by Western blot analysis on bacterially produced HAND1 and HAND2 protein. The serum was further tested by expression of HAND1 or HAND2 in NIH3T3 cells by transient transfection and testing for specificity by immunocytochemical analysis and by Western blot analysis of extracted cellular proteins. The consensus DNA binding site for HAND2 was determined using a modified CASTing protocol (21.Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A 63-bp oligonucleotide containing 16 random bases flanked by EcoRI and HindIII sites (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTAAGCTTNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGATCCTCATGGTCATAGCTGTTT-3′) was synthesized and made double-stranded by PCR with the primer (VB2B)-AAACAGCTATGACCATGAGGA using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). 5 μg of double-stranded DNA was mixed with 2 μl each of in vitro TNT translated HAND2 and E12 protein in a 20-μl binding reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 80 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, and 0.5 μg Poly(dI:dC). After a 30-min incubation, 0.5 μl of rabbit anti-HAND2 antibody No. 13 was added, and the mixture incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature. HAND complexes were pulled down with the addition of 10 μl of protein A-beads at 4 °C for 1 h, and the mixture was pelleted and washed three times with Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 80 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The DNA was eluted by resuspending the beads in 40 μl of PCR buffer, boiled for 5 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 min. PCR amplification of the eluted DNA was performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 45 s, for 20 cycles using 15 pmol of primers VB2B and VB3 (TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTAAG). Half of the reaction was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and the remainder was extracted once with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated for the next CASTing cycle. After five rounds of selection, the amplified PCR product was end-labeled with 32P and further selected by gel mobility shift assay. The HAND2 gel shift complex was excised from the gel, eluted and re-amplified by PCR, and cloned into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pBS-KSII (Stratagene) for sequencing. HAND2 and E12 proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TNT-coupled Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega) using T7 RNA polymerase transcription of pRSET2b-His-HAND2 and pBS-E12. The size of the translated proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE using35S-labeled proteins synthesized in parallel. The expression vector for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HAND2 fusion protein, pGEX2TK-HAND2, was transformed into JM109 cells. To produce purified GST fusion proteins, 50 ml of an overnight culture of JM109 cells containing a GST fusion protein vector was diluted 1:10 with Luria broth containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml and cultured in a rotary shaker until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6–1.0. Next, expression of the GST-HAND2 fusion protein was induced for 3 h by the addition of isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold MTPBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3). The cell suspension was sonicated four times for 15 s, and then Triton X-100 was added to a concentration of 1% and the suspension incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g, 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 2.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (pre-equilibrated with MTPBS buffer) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h while shaking. The beads were then centrifuged through 20% sucrose in MTPBS for 5 min at 2,500 rpm, washed once each with MTPBS buffer, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2. The GST fusion protein was then eluted from the Sepharose 4B-glutathione beads with 25 mm glutathione. One microgram of bacterial produced GST-HAND2 fusion protein was conjugated to Glutathione-beads, mixed with 5 μl of 35S-labeled proteins in 250 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40), and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rocking. The complexes were washed three times in 1 ml of binding buffer. As a negative control, the 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with GST-beads alone. The beads were heated to 95 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and interacting proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Double-stranded oligonucleotide was annealed and end-radiolabeled with 50 μCi of 32P-dCTP using Klenow to fill in protruding ends. For each EMSA assay, 2 μl of each in vitro translated protein lysate was combined and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of EMSA binding buffer and oligonucleotides. The protein mixture was incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 80 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, and 0.25 μg poly(dI:dC)) at room temperature for 20 min; ∼0.1 pmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe was added and incubated 30 min at room temperature in a 10-μl total volume. The incubated mixture was separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel run buffered with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiographic analysis. Cells were plated to 20–40% confluence 12–18 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Transfection was performed at a reporter to activator ratio of 1:2. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and lysates were assayed for CAT activity and normalized for transfection and assay efficiency using β-galactosidase activity. For luciferase assays, COS-7 cells were grown in a 6-well cell culture plate, transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) for 5 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then cultured for an additional 24–48 h in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were lysed, analyzed for luciferase, and normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity. A yeast cDNA library was constructed using mRNA isolated from neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells by oligo d(T) cellulose chromatography. The library was constructed in the pGAD10 yeast expression vector with a yeast two-hybrid cDNA construction kit (CLONTECH). First strand cDNA was synthesized using both random and oligo-d(T) primers. Prior to cloning, double-stranded cDNA was size-selected for molecules >500 bp. Analysis of 20 randomly selected clones from the library showed an average size of 1.2 kb with 95% of the clones containing an insert. The HAND2 coding region was inserted in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (AA 1–147) into the yeast expression vector pAS2. This construct was transformed into the yeast strain Y190 and expression of HAND2 analyzed by Western blotting with HAND2-specific antibody. The neuro-2a library was transformed into yeast expressing HAND2, and cells were plated on SD/His−/Leu−/Trp−plates to select for colonies containing interacting proteins. Plasmids from positive colonies were transfected into a leuB HB101 strain of Escherichia coli by electroporation. DNA from 80 positive clones was sequenced and the sequences analyzed for homology to known clones using GenBankTM. The demonstrated ability of HAND2 to regulate developmental events suggests that like other bHLH factors, HAND2 regulates gene transcription. To analyze the mechanism by which HAND2 regulates gene expression, we examined the ability of HAND2 to stimulate transcription using a mammalian one-hybrid assay. HAND2 was fused with the yeast Gal4 minimal DNA binding domain to create a chimeric transcription factor dependent on HAND2 for transcriptional activation but not DNA binding. The Gal4-HAND2 fusion plasmid and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing five Gal4 DNA binding sites upstream of the E1b basal promoter were co-transfected into COS-7 cells. Because the activation domains of numerous bHLH transcription factors including MyoD (23.Huang J. Weintraub H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5478-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Mash1 (24.Persson P. Jogi A. Grynfeld A. Pahlman S. Axelson H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and E12 (25.Markus M. Benezra R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1040-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are regulated through intramolecular interactions, we generated a series of HAND2 deletions fused to Gal4-DBD and tested their ability to activate transcription by transient co-transfection with the 5E1b-Luc reporter construct (Fig. 1A). We found that full-length HAND2 does not significantly activate transcription. The construct containing the bHLH plus the carboxyl portion of HAND2 (encoding AA 86–217) activates transcription to slightly higher level than the full-length HAND2 protein. The Gal4 fusion construct containing only the amino-terminal region of HAND2 (encoding AA 1–85) activates transcription 47-fold higher than the full-length HAND2 protein. These results suggest that HAND2 functions as a transcriptional activator. The high activity associated with the amino-terminal domain and low activity observed for the full-length protein suggest that HAND2 function is regulated by intra- or intermolecular interactions that mask full transcriptional activity. To further delineate the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain, we generated a series of deletions within the HAND2 amino-terminal region (Fig. 1B). Deletions were generated within the first 85 amino acids of by PCR, and the resulting sequence was cloned in-frame to the Gal4-DBD. These deletion constructs were tested by co-transfection into COS-7 cells with the Gal4-luciferase reporter, pG5-E1b-Luc. Deletion of amino acids 61–85 resulted in a 90% reduction in transcriptional activity suggesting that this region is essential for activation. Deletion of the first 40 amino acids of HAND2 reduced activity by only 20%, whereas constructs containing only the first 40 amino acids weakly activate transcription. All deletions within amino acids 41–85 reduced transcriptional activity. Taken together, the deletion analysis suggests that a core activation domain is situated between amino acids 41–85. The masking of transcriptional activity in full-length HAND2 was observed in a number of other mammalian cell lines (data not shown) as well as in a yeast two-hybrid screen. To examine whether the failure of full-length HAND2 to activate transcription in yeast was due to a masking effect, as seen in mammalian cells, deletions of HAND2 were subcloned into the yeast Gal4 expression vector pAS2 and tested for transcriptional activity (Table I). As in mammalian cells, full-length HAND2 protein, the bHLH and carboxyl-terminal regions (86–217), and the carboxyl-terminal region alone (166–217) all failed to activate transcription in yeast. However, as in mammalian cells, the amino-terminal region of HAND2 robustly activated transcription in yeast. The activity of the transcriptional activation domain and the masking by the rest of the protein is conserved in both yeast and mammalian cells. These results suggest that a strong transcriptional activation domain resides in the amino terminus of HAND2, and in both yeast and mammalian cells this domain is masked in the full-length protein.Table IYeast one-hybrid analysis of HAND2 transcriptional regulatory regionsGal4-DBD-HAND2 constructsβ-galactosidase activityHAND2 (1–217)1N terminus (1–85)70bHLH-C (86–217)1C terminus (166–217)1Full-length HAND2 does not function as a transcriptional activator in yeast.

Deletion analysis shows the amino third of the protein contains a strong transcriptional activation domain that is masked by intramolecular or intermolecular interactions. β-Galactosidase activity is presented as relative activity. The protein dimerization and DNA binding activities of bHLH proteins are separable events regulated by the HLH and basic domains, respectively. It has been reported that HAND2 homodimerizes and also heterodimerizes with HAND1 as well as interacting with E-proteins in vitro(20.Firulli B.A. Hadzic D.B. McDaid J.R. Firulli A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33567-33573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, the interaction between HAND1 and HAND2 proteins when tested for interaction in a mammalian two-hybrid assay was weak, suggesting that more complex interactions may be involved in regulating HAND protein interactions. We therefore screened a neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell line library for HAND2-interacting proteins. We screened ∼6 × 106 clones using full-length HAND2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. From this screen, 80 HAND2-interacting clones tested positive in subsequent re-screens (Table II). Members of the E-protein family were the most highly represented class of HAND2-interacting proteins, and a number of different family members were represented, including E47, E12, and ITF2a.Table IIYeast two-hybrid analysis of a neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell library for HAND2-interacting proteinsYeast two-hybrid screen% of clonesE-proteins41HAND214Nucleophosmin/B2328Centromeric protein CENP-B14JAB13A yeast two-hybrid library was constructed using cDNA from the neuroblastoma cell line neuro-2a and screened with full-length HAND2 as bait.

(1999) EMBO J. 18, 4657–4668). To clarify the role of STAT3 in signaling the migration, we studied the intracellular signaling pathway through an integrin receptor in STAT3-deficient keratinocytes. STAT3-deficient keratinocytes demonstrated increased adhesiveness and fast spreading on a collagen matrix. Staining with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that STAT3-deficient keratinocytes had an increased number of tyrosyl-hyperphosphorylated focal adhesions. Analyses with immunoprecipitation revealed that p130cas was constitutively hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues, while other focal adhesion molecules such as focal adhesion kinase and paxillin were not. Transfection of STAT3-deficient keratinocytes with an adenoviral vector encoding the wild-type Stat3 gene reversed not only impaired migration but also the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. These results strongly suggest that STAT3 in keratinocytes plays a critical role in turnover of tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas, modulating cell adhesiveness to the substratum leading to growth factor-dependent cell migration. We previously reported that STAT3 plays a crucial role in transducing a signal for migration of keratinocytes (Sano, S., Itami, S., Takeda, K., Tarutani, M., Yamaguchi, Y., Miura, H., Yoshikawa, K., Akira, S., and Takeda, J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 2.Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 3.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). STATs are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by activated kinases in receptor complexes, leading to formation of homo- or heterodimers and translocation to the nucleus in which they regulate transcription. STAT3 is activated by a variety of cytokines and growth factors such as interleukin-6, epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), platelet-derived growth factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. These cytokines and growth factors regulate the biological activities of keratinocytes (4.Bennett N.T. Schultz G.S. Am. J. Surg. 1993; 165: 728-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar,5.Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar), suggesting that STAT3 plays a crucial role in keratinocytes. Because germ line STAT3 deletion leads to embryonic lethality (6.Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), to elucidate the biological roles of STAT3 in the skin, we previously generated keratinocyte-specific STAT3-deficient mice by conditional gene targeting using the Cre-loxP strategy (7.Sano S.

The Stat3 gene was disrupted under the control of a keratin 5 promoter. The mutant mice were born with no apparent abnormalities, and their epidermis and hair follicle development was normal at birth. However, wound healing was markedly retarded, and the second hair cycle was impaired in keratinocyte-specific Stat3 gene knockout mice. An in vitro study with cultured keratinocytes revealed that this phenotype was attributed to impaired migration because of the failure of STAT3 activation. Cell migration is composed of several concerted steps (8.Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar, 9.Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Migration is initiated with membrane protrusion (filopodia and leading edge) and adhesion to the extracellular matrix, followed by cell traction and the release of adhesions at the rear portion of the cell. These events are regulated by multiple signaling mechanisms, such as tyrosine kinase and/or phosphatase signaling (10.Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A.

However, it is still undetermined whether STAT3 is involved in these signaling events. In this report, we found that STAT3-deficient keratinocytes showed increased adhesiveness and forced spreading on a collagen matrix and that an increased number of hyperphosphorylated focal adhesions, in particular, an adaptor protein, p130cas, was constitutively hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. These results strongly suggest that intracellular signaling of STAT3 in keratinocytes modulates tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas and cell adhesiveness to the substratum, leading to cell migration in response to growth factors. Keratinocyte-specific STAT3-disrupted mice were generated by using the Cre -loxP strategy under the control of a keratin-5 promoter as previously described (7.Sano S. Itami S. Takeda K. Tarutani M. Yamaguchi Y. Miura H. Yoshikawa K. Akira S. Takeda J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4657-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice carrying keratin-5 promoter-driven (K5)-Cre transgene and a STAT3-null allele (K5-Cre:STAT3+/−) were mated with STAT3flox/flox mice. Offspring carrying a floxed STAT3 allele and/or K5-Cre transgene (K5-Cre:STAT3flox/+,K5-Cre:STAT3flox/−, STAT3flox/+, STAT3flox/−) were examined for their genotypes by allele-specific PCR. Care of mice was in accordance with institutional guidelines. Primary cultures of mouse keratinocytes were established from newborn to 5-day-old mice. The total skin taken from mice was treated with 250 units/ml dispase (Godo Shusei, Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 4 °C, and the epidermis was peeled off from the dermis. Keratinocytes were collected upon trypsinization and washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were resuspended in MCDB153 medium containing 3% fetal calf serum and seeded onto type I collagen-coated dishes. Anti-p130cas, FAK, and paxillin were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-c-Src (B-12) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20) was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Anti-PTP-PEST monoclonal antibody was from Exalpha Biologicals, Inc. (Boston, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was from DAKO (Denmark). Keratinocytes were cultured in type I collagen-coated dishes until they reached confluence. After starvation for 24 h, they were treated with 10 μg/ml mitomycin C for 2 h to avoid a proliferative effect on the cells. A cell-free area was introduced by scraping the monolayer with a yellow pipette tip. Cell migration to the cell-free area was evaluated in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or HGF (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA). After 48 h, photographs were taken using a phase-contrast microscope (DIA-PHOT 300; Nikon). The number of migrating keratinocytes was counted after taking photographs of four nonoverlapping fields. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of migrating cells per square millimeter beyond the front lines of the introduced wound edge. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Keratinocytes collected upon trypsinization of epidermal sheets were washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were resuspended in serum-free MCDB153 medium at 106 cells/ml and added to type I collagen-coated dishes. These dishes were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and attached cells were counted. Values represent the mean ± S.D. and were analyzed statistically using Student's t test. Keratinocytes were seeded onto type I collagen-coated dishes at 5 × 105 cells/ml, and allowed to spread for the indicated times. After washing out the nonadherent cells, photographs were taken in the nonoverlapping fields under a phase-contrast microscope, and spread cells were counted. Spread cells were identified as opaque cells, exhibiting membranous protrusions. However, nonspread cells were rounded and phase-bright. Values represent the mean ± S.D. and were analyzed statistically using Student's t test. Keratinocytes (5 × 105 cells/ml) were plated onto type I collagen-coated coverslips for 24 h in MCDB153 medium containing 3% fetal calf serum. After serum starvation for 24 h, coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for permeabilization, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After washing with PBS, fixed cells were blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were stained with a 1:100 diluted anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20). Cells were further incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and washed with PBS. Images were analyzed using a confocal microscope (model LSM 410; Carl Zeiss). Keratinocytes were washed twice with PBS and lysed in a radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The protein concentration of the lysates was normalized before Western blotting or immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation, equivalent lysates were incubated with precipitating antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with the radioimmune precipitation buffer. The immunoprecipitates or whole lysates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and reacted with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). A recombinant adenoviral vector containing the wild-type STAT3 expression cassette (Adeno-stat3) was constructed using the circular form of the adenoviral genome cloned in a cosmid and the Cre-loxPrecombination system according to Tashiro (21.Tashiro F. Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 1845-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The pALC cosmid and wild-type STAT3 expression cassette were ligated. The resulting pALC-STAT3 cosmid vector was purified from E. coli DH5α and transfected into 293 cells with the pMC1-cre plasmid. The cosmid backbone was excised by transiently expressed Cre recombinase. Recombinant adenoviruses were purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation and cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. For reintroduction of wild-type STAT3, keratinocytes were infected with Adeno-stat3 during a serum starvation period for 24 h at a multiplicity of infection of 5. We previously demonstrated that keratinocyte-specific STAT3-disrupted mice showed retardation of skin wound healing and that migration of STAT3-deficient keratinocytes was impaired (7.Sano S. Itami S. Takeda K. Tarutani M. Yamaguchi Y. Miura H. Yoshikawa K. Akira S. Takeda J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4657-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Cell migration is a coordinated and complex process, including cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, we hypothesized that STAT3 is involved in a specific point in these processes. First we compared cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. Freshly isolated keratinocytes were seeded onto type I collagen-coated dishes. Then nonadherent cells were removed by washing at the indicated time points, and attached cells were counted. As shown in Fig. 1a, STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes (white bars) showed significantly increased adhesiveness to the collagen matrix as compared with control cells (black bars) at 20 min, although no difference was observed after 1 or 3 h. The adhesion of keratinocytes to type I collagen is mediated through α2β1 and/or α3β1 integrins, and the STAT3 signaling pathway may modulate integrin expression (22.Wooten D.K. Xie X. Bartos D. Busche R.A. Longmore G.D. Watowich S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26566-26575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in some cells. However, no difference in integrin expression was found between control and STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes (Ref. 7.Sano S. Itami S. Takeda K. Tarutani M. Yamaguchi Y. Miura H. Yoshikawa K. Akira S. Takeda J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4657-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar and data not shown). Therefore, increased adhesion of STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes was not attributed to increased integrin expression. Next, we compared cell spreading on the substratum of STAT3(−/−) keratinocytes with controls. Twenty min after seeding, an increased number of STAT3(−/−) keratinocytes were opaque with membranous protrusions (Fig. 1b, black arrows), which is a characteristic feature of spread cells, whereas control keratinocytes (STAT3(+/−)) were mostly round and phase-bright (nonspread) (Fig. 1b, upper panel). Quantitative evaluation revealed that the number of spread cells in STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes was 5-fold that at 20 min compared with controls, although no difference in cell spreading was observed between the two kinds of keratinocytes later than 1 h (Fig. 1c). Taken collectively, these results indicate that STAT3-disrupted cells were primed for attachment and spreading on the substratum, implying that STAT3 plays a critical role in regulating subsequent cell motility through integrin/focal adhesion signaling. In cultured cells, integrins and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are concentrated at focal adhesions, where actin cytoskeletons are connected with the extracellular matrix. Many lines of evidence have revealed that the number and/or tyrosine phosphorylation status of focal adhesions influenced adhesiveness, spreading, and cell migration (10.Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F.

Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the formation and tyrosine phosphorylation status of focal adhesions, by immunostaining with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. Strikingly, individual STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes exhibited coarse and strong signals on the surface (Fig. 2, right panel,red arrowheads) compared with control cells (Fig. 2, left panel), indicating that focal adhesions of STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes were hyperphosphorylated. To determine the focal adhesion molecule responsible for hyperphosphorylation in STAT3(−/−) keratinocytes, Western blot analysis was performed. Whole cell lysates (Fig. 3a, left panel) or PY20 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3a,right panel) were subjected to Western blot analysis with PY20. Approximately 60–90- and 120–130-kDa proteins were hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues in STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes (Fig. 3a, black arrows). Previous studies showed that many tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are associated with focal adhesions, including nonreceptor kinases, adaptor proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins (13.Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 24.Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 25.Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, focal adhesion kinase (FAK;Mr ∼125,000), p130cas(Mr ∼130,000), paxillin (Mr ∼68,000), and Src (Mr ∼60,000) were candidates for the hyperphosphorylated proteins observed in Fig. 3a. Therefore, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation state of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 3b, no differences were demonstrated in protein expression or tyrosine phosphorylation levels of FAK, Src, and paxillin between control and STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes. However, p130cas was constitutively hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues in STAT3(−/−) keratinocytes (Fig. 3b,black arrow). p130cas is thought to be an adaptor protein that contains an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a central substrate domain, and proline-rich motifs (26.Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The central substrate domain has multiple phosphotyrosine motifs where Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing molecules recruit. The hyperphosphorylation of p130cas in STAT3-disrupted keratinocytes may result in abnormal assembly of interacting proteins, aberrant turnover of focal adhesions, increased cell adhesiveness, and faster cell spreading, leading to impaired migration. It is possible that the hyperphosphorylation of p130cas might be the result of down-regulation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTP-PEST, has been shown to interact with p130cas, and it has been demonstrated that PTP-PEST(−/−) fibroblasts have a phenotype similar to STAT3(−/−) keratinocytes (10.Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined expression levels of PTP-PEST. However, as shown in Fig. 3c, no difference was demonstrated in protein expression levels of PTP-PEST between control and STAT3(−/−) keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2041242808,"Three independent three-dimensional reconstructions of the spinach photosystem II-light-harvesting complex supercomplex were derived from single particle analyses of non-stained, vitrified samples imaged by electron microscopy. Each reconstruction was found to differ significantly in the composition of the lumenal oxygen-evolving complex extrinsic proteins. From difference mapping, aided by electron microscopy of negatively stained selectively washed samples, regions of density were assigned to the PsbO and PsbP/PsbQ proteins. Interpretation of the density assigned to the PsbO protein was explored using computer-aided structural predictions. PsbO is calculated to be mainly a beta-protein (38% beta) composed of two domains within an overall elongated shape (Pazos, F., Heredia, P., Valencia, A., and De Las Rivas, J. (2001) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 45, 372-381). The positioning and fitting of the proposed structural model for the PsbO protein within the three-dimensional map indicated that there is a single copy per reaction center. Moreover, the structural model derived for PsbO, together with difference mapping, indicates that this protein stretches across the surface of the reaction center with its N- and C-terminal domains located toward the CP47 and CP43 side, respectively. This structural assignment is discussed in terms of the recent x-ray-derived cyanobacterial model of PSII (Zouni, A., Witt, H.-T., Kern, J., Fromme, P., Krauss, N., Saenger, W., and Orth, P. (2001) Nature 409, 739-743)."
https://openalex.org/W2120314738,"Lactase gene transcription is spatially restricted to the proximal and middle small intestine of the developing mouse. To identify regions of the lactase gene involved in mediating the spatiotemporal expression pattern, transgenic mice harboring 0.8-, 1.3-, and 2.0-kb fragments of the 5′-flanking region cloned upstream of a firefly-luciferase reporter were generated. Transgene expression was assessed noninvasively in living mice using a sensitive low light imaging system. Two independent, 1.3- and 2.0-kb, lactase promoter-reporter transgenic lines expressed appropriate high levels of luciferase activity in the small intestine (300–3,000 relative light units/μg) with maximal expression in the middle segments. Post-weaned 30-day transgenic offspring also demonstrated an appropriate 4-fold maturational decline in luciferase expression in the small intestine. The pattern of the 2.0-kb promoter transgene mRNA abundance most closely mimicked that of the endogenous lactase gene with respect to spatiotemporal restriction. In contrast, a 0.8-kb promoter-reporter construct expressed low level luciferase activity (<25 relative light units/μg) in multiple organs and throughout the gastrointestinal tract in transgenic mice. Thus, a distinct 5′-region of the lactase promoter directs intestine-specific expression in the small intestine of transgenic mice, and regulatory sequences have been localized to a 1.2-kb region upstream of the lactase transcription start site.

Lactase is present predominantly along the brush-border membrane of differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. Expression of the lactase gene is spatially restricted along the longitudinal axis of the gut (1.Rings E.H. de Boer P.A. Moorman A.F. van Beers E.H. Dekker J. Montgomery R.K. Grand R.J. Buller H.A. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1154-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lactase gene is expressed maximally in the proximal and middle small intestine and declines significantly in the distal segments of the intestine. Lactase gene expression is also temporally restricted in the gut during intestinal maturation. Enzyme activity is maximal in the small intestine of pre-weaned mammals and declines markedly during maturation. The maturational decline in lactase activity contrasts with a maturational increase in enzymatic activity of other intestinal hydrolases essential for digestion of solid foods (for comprehensive review see Ref. 2.Henning S. Rubin D.C. Shulman R.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 571-610Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms regulating the spatial and temporal restriction of lactase gene expression have not been fully defined, lactase spatiotemporal restriction is largely regulated at the level of gene transcription. This is suggested by co-localization of lactase protein along the longitudinal axis of the gut and lactase mRNA transcripts detected by Northern blot and in situ hybridization (1.Rings E.H. de Boer P.A.

In vitro binding studies have shown that the lactase gene promoter interacts with specific nuclear proteins from intestinal cells. The enterocyte nuclear factor, NF-LPH1, binds to and protects a distinct cis element region of the pig lactase 5′-flanking region, CE-LPH1, from DNase I digestion (11.Troelsen J.T. Olsen J. Noren O. Sjostrom H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20407-20411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an electrophoretic mobility shift of CE-LPH1 is more prominent with nuclear extracts obtained from pre-weaned piglets than from adult animals. We and others (12.Troelsen J.T.

Similarly, Fitzgerald et al.(14.Fitzgerald K. Bazar L. Avigan M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G314-G324PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-6 can bind to a cis element in the lactase promoter and can activate reporter gene transcription. We have recently demonstrated (15.Fang R. Olds L. Santiago N. Sibley E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G58-G67PubMed Google Scholar) that each of the GATA family members expressed in intestine, GATA-4 and GATA-5 in addition to GATA-6, can stimulate transcription of a reporter gene driven by the lactase promoter in intestinal cell culture. The spatial restriction and maturational decline in lactase gene transcription is likely mediated by differential interaction between the lactase gene sequences and specific nuclear transcription factors.

In this report, we describe localization of an essential 1.2-kb region of the rat lactase gene promoter involved in directing appropriate spatial and temporal transgene expression during gut maturation. Regulation of gene expression has been widely studied using bioluminescent markers (e.g. luciferase) as biological reporters in cell culture assays performed on cell lysates. An in vivo bioluminescent imaging method has been developed recently (29.Contag P.R. Olomu I.N. Stevenson D.K. Contag C.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) that allows these studies to be performed in living cells and animals such that dynamic biological processes can be evaluated in intact organ systems. In this approach, the bioluminescent reporter luciferase serves as an internal biological source of light that can be monitored externally providing an indication of gene expression patterns in living animal models. In this report, we have utilized a similar in vivo bioluminescent imaging method to characterize intestine-specific gene transcription patterns driven by lactase promoter-reporter transgenes in mice. The plasmid constructs gLac800, gLac1.3k, and gLac2.0k have been described previously (13.Fang R. Santiago N.A. Olds L.C. Sibley E. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 115-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The constructs contain 0.8- (−819 to +13), 1.3- (−1307 to +13), and 2.0-kb (−2033 to +13), respectively, of the 5′-flanking sequences of the rat lactase gene cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Linearized and purified transgene constructs were injected into fertilized mouse eggs, reimplanted into pseudopregnant mice, and allowed to develop to term. Animals were generated through the Transgenic Core facility of the Stanford University Digestive Disease Center at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute (Palo Alto, CA). Mice carrying transgenes were identified by PCR of genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers specific for the rat lactase promoter (30.Verhave M. Krasinski S.D. Maas S.M. Smiers F.J. Mishra K.

To determine the copy number of the integrated transgene, genomic DNA was analyzed by Southern hybridization and by quantitative multiplex PCR in which the transgene signal (glac and luc primers) was compared with that of the endogenous lactase gene (glac and clac primers) by inclusion of the lactase exon 1 antisense primer clac: 5′-AAATTTCTGTCGGATTCCCAGTC-3′ (31.Duluc I. Boukamel R. Mantei N. Semenza G. Raul F. Freund J.N. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 275-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number X56747). Transgenic lines were established by outbreeding founder Fo mice to obtain heterozygous mice. Organs were harvested from transgenic mice and assayed for luciferase activity using the LuciferaseTM Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically, organ tissue (∼50 mg) was homogenized in cell lysis buffer (500 μl), and lysate protein concentration was determined. Lysate aliquots were incubated in the presence of luciferin substrate as described by the reporter assay system, and luciferase activity was quantified in a Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD PharMingen). The results are reported as relative light units per μg of total protein. Transgenic mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (70 mg/kg body weight). An aqueous solution of the substrate d-luciferin (150 mg/kg) was injected into the peritoneal cavity 5 min before imaging. The animals were then placed in a light-tight chamber and imaged with an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera (model C2400–32, Hamamatsu, Japan). Photons emitted from luciferase activity within the animal and then transmitted through the tissue were collected for a period of 5 min. A pseudocolor image representing light intensity was generated using the Argus image processor (Hamamatsu, Japan) and superimposed over a gray scale whole body reference image similar to the method described previously (32.Contag C.H. Spilman S.D. Contag P.R. Oshiro M. Eames B. Dennery P. Stevenson D.K. Benaron D.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In this study the camera controls were managed by the LivingImage software (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) as an overlay on the Igor image analysis program (Wavemetrics, Seattle, WA), and LivingImage was used to collect, archive, and analyze images. Total RNA was extracted from the harvested organ tissue using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. RNA concentrations were determined by optical densitometry at 260 nm, and absence of RNA degradation was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For RT-PCR, cDNA was initially synthesized from 1.0 μg of total RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), according to the protocol of the supplier, and brought to a final volume of 100 μl. PCRs were then carried out with synthetic oligonucleotide primers corresponding to different coding sequences of the firefly luciferase (GenBankTM accession number U47295), lactase (31.Duluc I. Boukamel R. Mantei N. Semenza G. Raul F. Freund J.N.

To prevent nonspecific amplification, hot start PCRs (50 μl) were carried out with 5 μl of the reverse-transcribed cDNA solution: 0.4 μm primers, 0.20 mm dNTPs, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of TaqPolymerase (Invitrogen) preincubated with 1:28 with TaqStart Antibody (CLONTECH). Amplification conditions are as follows: 94 °C, 45 s; 55 °C, 45 s; and 72 °C, 45 s performed from 15 to 40 cycles to optimize for PCR products in the linear range of exponential amplification. PCR products were analyzed after electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels using a Molecular Analyst Densitometer (Bio-Rad). For immunohistochemical detection, mid-jejunal segments of wild-type or transgenic mice were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned onto glass slides. Sections were then deparaffinized in xylene (2 times for 10 min) followed by sequential treatments in ethanol (100, 80, and 70%; 2 times for 2 min each). After washing in distilled water, slides were treated with Antigen Unmasking Solution 1:100 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 min. Slides were then washed in PBS (3 times for 5 min) followed by a 15-min incubation in 1% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase. After three PBS washes, sections were then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Prior to incubation with the specific antibodies, sections were blocked by incubation with 10% normal goat serum, 0.3% Tween 20 in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a Biotin Block solution (Vector Laboratories) treatment according to the method of the manufacturer. Sections were then incubated overnight at 5 °C in a humid chamber with rabbit anti-luciferase antibody or normal rabbit serum diluted 1:6000 in blocking buffer. The anti-luciferase antibody was kindly provided by W. Just, Institut für Biochemie, Universität Heidelberg, Germany (34.Soto U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Just W.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35.Hocker M. Cramer T. O'Connor D.T. Rosewicz S. Wiedenmann B. Wang T.C. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 43-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Following antibody incubation, sections were washed in 0.3% Tween 20, PBS (5 times for 10 min each) and then incubated at room temperature for 60 min with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:200 in 1% normal goat serum, 0.3% Tween 20. Detection of the antigen-antibody complex was performed with the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) avidin/biotin method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, sections were incubated with the avidin/biotin/horseradish peroxidase reagent, washed in PBS, reacted with fresh 3,3-diaminobenzidine for 2 min, washed in distilled water, and counterstained with hematoxylin. For in situ hybridization, gene-specific RNA was detected in mid-jejunal sections from wild-type or transgenic mice using biotin-labeled RNA probes. For luciferase detection, a 0.7-kb fragment (NcoI-SphI) of the full-length luciferase gene was cloned from pGL3-Basic into pBluescript KSII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For lactase detection, a 0.5-kb fragment (SacI-HindIII from exon 1 of the rat lactase gene) was cloned into pBluescript KSII. Biotin-labeled sense and antisense luciferase and lactase RNA probes were prepared, and in situ hybridization was performed following the protocol of the In Situ Hybridization kit for Biotin Labeled Probes (Sigma). In brief, sections were prepared as above with the exception that the jejunal segment was flushed with RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) prior to formalin fixation. After deparaffinization, sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, treated with proteinase K (30 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C, washed in PBS, and then dehydrated in graded ethanol treatments. The sections were hybridized overnight at 45 °C in the Sigma Hybridization Solution with the biotinylated luciferase (5 μg/ml) or lactase (0.75 μg/ml) RNA probes. Hybridized signal was detected by treatment with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and amplified (for luciferase probes) with TSA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by chromogenic 3,3-diaminobenzidine substrate incubation. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. 5′-Flanking regions of the rat lactase gene cloned upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene were microinjected to generate transgenic founder mice (Fig. 1). Transgenic mice were identified by genomic PCR detection and confirmed by Southern hybridization. The gLac800 transgene, containing the proximal 800 bp of the lactase 5′-flanking region in the pGL3-Basic reporter vector, was incorporated into seven founder LacLuc-0.8k mice. The gLac1.3k transgene, containing 1.3-kb of the lactase 5′-flanking region was incorporated into two founder LacLuc-1.3k mice. The gLac2.0k transgene, containing 2.0-kb of the lactase 5′-flanking region, was incorporated into four founder LacLuc-2.0k mice. The promoterless vector, pGL3-Basic, and the SV40 promoter/enhancer construct, pGL3-Control, were each incorporated into a founder mouse as controls. The number of transgenes integrated into the DNA of each founder mouse varied from 1 to 33 copies/cells (Fig. 1). Transgene expression was detected by assaying for luciferase activity in organ homogenates. Four of the seven LacLuc-0.8k mouse lines expressed detectable levels of luciferase in at least one tissue (Fig. 1). One of the two LacLuc-1.3k lines and two of the four LacLuc-2.0k lines expressed detectable levels of luciferase. Each of the pGL3-Basic and pGL3-Control transgenic mice expressed the luciferase reporter gene. An in vivo bioluminescence imaging method was used to rapidly screen for transgenic reporter expression in founders and subsequent F1 offspring. Specifically, luciferase substrate was injected intraperitoneally into sedated mice, and light emission was detected with a low light imaging system using an ICCD camera. A representative pseudocolor image depicting photon emission intensity used to identify rapidly the transgenic versusnon-transgenic F1 generation offspring of the LacLuc-2.0kA founder line is shown in Fig. 2. Transgenic mice expressing the luciferase reporter were readily detected at 7 days of life (Fig. 2A) and in the same animals at 28 days (Fig. 2B). The results of in vivo screening were confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA and by quantitative luciferase assay of internal organ homogenates by luminometer. The non-transgenic (PCR-) F1 littermates do not express luciferase and do not emit light. To determine tissue specificity of transgene expression, multiple organs harvested from transgenic mice were assayed for luciferase activity. Organ homogenates, incubated in the presence of luciferin substrate, were assayed in a luminometer, and luciferase activity (relative light units/μg protein) was plotted for organs in Fig. 3A. The 0.8-kb lactase promoter-luciferase reporter mouse lines (LacLuc-0.8k25 is shown in white) and the LacLuc-2.0kC line (not shown) possessed a low level of luciferase expression (<25.0 RLU/μg) in multiple organs. Two independent transgenic lines,LacLuc-1.3kD (shown in black) and LacLuc-2.0kA line (shown in gray), possessed a high level of luciferase activity (300–3,000 RLU/μg) in the small intestine. The “promoterless” pGL3-Basic transgene expressed low level luciferase activity (<5.0 RLU/μg) in multiple organs. The pGL3-Control transgene that bears an SV40 promoter-enhancer linked to luciferase reporter directed low levels of expression in multiple organs with slightly higher expression in the heart (20 RLU/μg). To confirm that the expression pattern directed by the 1.3- and 2.0-kb 5′-flanking sequences represents tissue-specific transcription, the luciferase activity quantified above was compared with the transcript abundance for the luciferase reporter gene mRNA and the endogenous lactase mRNA (Fig. 3B). Total RNA was isolated from intestinal and non-intestinal tissues of LacLuc-1.3kD and LacLuc-2.0kA transgenic mice and wild-type mice and analyzed for gene transcription by RT-PCR analysis. The tissue-specific pattern of luciferase enzyme activity correlates with luciferase mRNA abundance detected by RT-PCR. There was significantly enhanced transgene expression in the small intestine (compare Fig. 3,A and B). In addition, transcription from the 1.3- and 2.0-kb 5′-flanking segments of the lactase-luciferase transgene correlates with the pattern of transcription of the endogenous lactase gene (Fig. 3B). Specifically, RT-PCR detected high levels of lactase and luciferase mRNA in the jejunum, and transcript levels were below detectable levels in the stomach, colon, and non-intestinal organs. Luciferase activity and mRNA was detected in the liver of the LacLuc-1.3kD line and may thus indicate the absence of a liver-specific repressor present in the larger 2.0-kb construct. The minus reverse transcriptase control amplifications were negative in all organs (data not shown). To define further the regional expression of the lactase promoter-reporter transgene along the gut longitudinal axis, luciferase activity and mRNA levels were analyzed in tissue segments harvested along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. The small intestine from mice of the LacLuc-2.0kA and LacLuc-1.3kD lines was divided into equal one-eighth segments beginning with the proximal duodenum and extending to the distal ileum. The maximal level of reporter expression was detected by luciferase activity in the distal duodenum and jejunum (the 3/8th to 6/8th segments) as shown in Fig. 4A(LacLuc-2.0kA) and Fig. 4C(LacLuc-1.3kD). The pattern of luciferase activity correlated with luciferase mRNA levels as detected by RT-PCR with maximal levels of transgene transcription and protein expression in the 3/8th to 6/8th segments (Fig. 4, B and D). This region-specific transcription pattern directed by two independent 5′-flanking region transgenes corresponds closely to the regional transcription (distal duodenum and jejunum) of the endogenous lactase gene (compare lactase and luciferase panels). The LacLuc-2.0kA transgene expression zone closely approximates the endogenous lactase expression zone. The LacLuc-1.3kD transgene expression pattern overlaps with the endogenous zone and extends to slightly more distal segments of the small intestine. Detection of bioluminescence along the gastrointestinal tract using the ICCD camera allowed direct visual confirmation of the spatial restriction of the lactase-luciferase transgene (Fig. 5). The gastrointestinal organs from an adult LacLuc-2.0kA mouse were harvested en blocand bathed in a buffered luciferin solution and imaged with the ICCD camera. Maximal light emission was detected in the proximal-middle segment of the small intestine. Lactase gene transcription declines dramatically at around the time of weaning, between 2 and 3 weeks in mice. To determine whether the lactase-luciferase transgenes were capable of directing a similar maturational decline, the mid-jejunum was harvested from LacLuc-2.0kA transgenic littermates sacrificed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks of age. Transgene expression was quantified by measuring luciferase enzyme"

In this study we have investigated the structure-function relationship of Png1p by site-directed mutagenesis. Cys-191, His-218, and Asp-235 of Png1p are conserved in the sequence of factor XIIIa, where these amino acids constitute a catalytic triad. Point mutations of these residues in Png1p resulted in complete loss in activity, consistent with a role for each in catalyzing deglycosylation of glycoproteins. Other conserved amino acid residues, Trp-220, Trp-231, Arg-210, and Glu-222, were also vitally important for folding and structure stability of the enzyme as revealed by circular dichroism analysis. The potential effects of the mutations were predicted by mapping the conserved amino acids of Png1p within the known three-dimensional structure of factor XIIIa. Our data suggest that the lack in enzyme activity when any of the catalytic triad residues is mutated is either due to the absence of charge relay in the case of the triad or due to the disruption of the native fold of the enzyme. These findings strongly suggest a common evolutionary lineage for the PNGases and transglutaminases.

Proteins with a native conformation enter Golgi transport vesicles and are then sent to other destinations. However, misfolded or non-native proteins cannot enter Golgi transport vesicle and are retained in ER (1.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In some cases these misfolded proteins are subjected to degradation by ER-associated degradation mechanism (2.Kopito R.R.

In the case of misfolded glycoproteins that are transferred from the lumen of ER to the cytosol for degradation, the cleavage of the N-linked glycan is catalyzed by the enzyme peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase), which hydrolyzes the β-aspartylglycosylamine bond of aspargine-linked glycopeptides and glycoproteins and may act in concert with the proteasomal degradation of proteins that are exported out of the ER to the cytosol (7.Wiertz E.J.H.J.

The gene PNG1 encoding for the cytoplasmic deglycosylating enzyme has been identified in yeast and was found to be well conserved throughout the eukaryotes (9.Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). More recently, physical interaction between yeast PNGase (Png1p) and the 26 S proteasome was found to be mediated via the protein Rad23 (10.Suzuki T. Park H. Kwofie M.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21601-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), further indicating the functional relationship of the deglycosylating enzyme with the proteasomal degradation. However, up to now knowledge about the structural features of this enzyme has been very limited. PNGase has been classified as a member of the “transglutaminase superfamily” based on the conservation of amino acid residues surrounding the catalytic triad of transglutaminase (11.Makorova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Transglutaminases catalyze amide bond formation between the γ-carboxyamide group of glutamine and the ε-amino group of lysine (12.Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The cross-linking of the two proteins involves deamidation of glutamine. Png1p catalyzes a reaction (cleavage of an amide bond), which is reverse of that in transglutaminases (formation of a amide bond) (Fig. 1). Transglutaminases possess a catalytic triad of three amino acids Cys, His, and Asp. This catalytic triad is similar to that found in thiol proteases (13.Pedersen L.C. Yee V.C. Bishop P.D. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Stenkamp R.E. Prot. Sci. 1994; 3: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We found that this putative catalytic triad is conserved through all of Png1p homologs, suggesting that Png1p might also utilize this triad for its enzymatic reaction. Based on homology with factor XIIIa and with PNGases from other eukaryotes, we examined several mutations of Png1p at putative active site and non-active site residues. The effect on the Png1p-mediated deglycosylation of a glycopeptide (biochemically purified) supports the idea that Png1p utilizes a similar catalytic triad for an enzymatic reaction, which is consistent with its classification as a novel member of the transglutaminase superfamily. We have shown that Png1p requires Cys-191, which is predicted to supply the nucleophilic residue of the catalytic triad. His-218, which is proposed to function as a catalytic base analogous to the invariant histidine residue present in the catalytic triad of serine and cysteine proteases, is also essential (14.Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7872-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 15.Gorbalenya A.E. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Koonin E.V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Asp-235, the third residue of the catalytic triad, was also found to be crucial. The carboxylic acid of aspartic acid is important to maintain the proper orientation of the histidine residue, facilitating its participation in catalysis (16.Sprang S. Standing T. Fletterick R.J.

Science. 1987; 237: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Several other residues in Png1p conserved in factor XIIIa have also been identified as essential components for the PNGase activity. The structural and/or functional importance of these mutants in Png1p was examined by comparison with the known three-dimensional structure of factor XIIIa (18.Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Trong I.L. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the amino acid sequence of yeast Png1p. All residues were mutated to Ala (one at a time) except Cys-129, Cys-132, Cys-165, and Cys-168, which were mutated either to Ala or Ser, and Trp-220 and To-231, which were mutated either to Ala or Phe. Mutagenesis was performed by using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The primers used are summarized in Table I. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IPrimers used in this study Open table in a new tab DNA manipulations were performed according to Sambrook et al. (19.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Constructs made were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and expression of PNG1 and mutants were induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at A600 = 0.8/ml. After 3 h at 37 °C, 3 ml of cells was centrifuged and protein was extracted by adding 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by sonication on ice using a Branson sonicator at level 3 twice for 10 s with a cooling interval of 1 min. The cell extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was assayed for PNGase activity. All the protein extracts were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. The protein amount was also checked by Western blot analysis. Protein extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-(his)6antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by 1:1000 dilution with anti-rabbit IgG horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Gels were visualized using chemiluminescence after exposure to medical x-ray film (Fuji photo Film Co., Stamford, CT). PNGase activity was assayed using fetuin-derived asialoglycopeptide I ([14C](CH3)2Leu-Asn(GlcNAc5Man3Gal3)-Asp-Ser-Arg) as described previously (20.Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Suzuki T. Park H. Kitajima K. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21526-21530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was monitored on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and quantitated using ImageQuanT (version 1.2). To further explore the kinetic parameters and structural features of the WT and mutant Png1p, the (his)6-tagged WT Png1p and mutant Png1ps (Cys-129 → Ser, Cys-132 → Ser, Cys-165 → Ser, Cys-168 → Ser, Cys-191 → Ala, Arg-210 → Ala, Trp-220 → Ala, and Tyr-273 → Ala) were expressed in Escherichia coli as described above. The pellet obtained from a 1-liter culture was suspended with 5–7 ml of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME), and the cells were lysed using a French press. The extract obtained was subjected to 20% ammonium sulfate precipitation for 2 h before binding the supernatant to a chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Chelating Sepharose was charged with Ni2+ according to the manufacturer's instructions and equilibrated with the starting buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm BME). The protein was allowed to bind for 18 h at 4 °C. The entire amount was then transferred to a 20-ml gravity flow column, and the flowthrough was collected. The resin was further washed (3 column volumes) with the starting buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (10 and 100 mm) and then eluted with 3 gel volumes of buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Column fractions equal to 1 gel volume were collected. After elution DTT and EDTA were added to each fraction to adjust the final concentration to be 1 mm each. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assayed for PNGase activity. The pure fractions were pooled, and imidazole was removed using a Microcon 10 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) with 20 mm Na2HPO4 containing 0.1m NaCl, 10 mm BME, and 1 mm EDTA for kinetic experiments. For circular dichroism (CD) experiments protein samples were desalted using Microcon 10 and buffer containing 0.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mmNaCl, 10 mm BME, and 1 mm EDTA. All the protein samples were stable for 2–3 days at low salt concentrations. The protein concentration was calculated at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient 69,480 for WT, C191A, C129S, C132S, C165S, C168S, R210A; 63,940 for W220A; and 68,000 for Y273A. All CD experiments were done on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. A 0.1-cm path length cell was used to collect data in the far UV and near UV. All the experiments were done at room temperature. The concentration of all the samples was 5 μm for far UV measurements and 75 μm for near UV measurements. Spectra were collected with a scan rate of 100 nm/min, 1-nm bandwidth, and 1-s response time. Spectra were measured in buffer containing 0.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm NaCl, and 10 mm BME. The spectrum of a blank containing buffer alone was subtracted from all spectra. WT Png1p and four Cys-to-Ser mutants (C129S, C132S, C165S, and C168S) were used to determine the Michaelis constants (Km and Vmax) of the enzyme, using asialofetuin glycopeptide I as a substrate. The enzymatic reaction was performed in 120 mm Mes buffer (pH 6.6) containing 1 mm DTT. Because the release of peptide was proportional to a reaction period up to 1 min for WT and up to 40 h for mutants when 0.05 mm (the lowest concentration) of substrate was used, incubation was carried out at various concentrations of the substrate (1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 mm) for 1 min for WT and 40 h for mutants. Initial reaction rates were expressed as nanomoles of peptide released under the assay conditions per minute per milligram of protein. The purpose of the present work was to explore the structural-functional consequences of mutation of the conserved amino acid residues of Png1p based on the sequence homology with factor XIIIa, a member of the transglutaminase family whose three-dimensional structure is known (18.Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Trong I.L. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of Png1p was aligned with six eukaryotic PNGases and blood coagulating factor XIIIa using the ClustalW program (Fig. 2). In the present study Png1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScPng1p) was used; the sequence numbering is shown at the top. Sequence numbering for factor XIIIa is shown at the bottom. The mutations on Png1p studied and the relative activity with WT are listed in Table II.

Therefore, C191A, H218A, and D235A were prepared separately to determine the effect of each of these residues on enzymatic activity. The concentrations of WT and mutant proteins were similar based on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3a) as well as Western blot using anti-(his)6 antibody (Fig. 3c). No deglycosylation of the fetuin-derived [14C]glycopeptide was observed with any of the three mutant proteins even upon extended incubation (24 h), which is in sharp contrast with WT enzyme (Fig. 4; compare lane 2 (WT) and lanes 3–5 (mutants)). Our data thus provide the first biochemical evidence that support the hypothesis that Png1p is a novel member of the transglutaminase superfamily (11.Makorova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), all of which use a similar catalytic triad to carry out their enzymatic reactions. This is a common type of enzymatic catalysis in cysteine proteases (22.Drenth J. Kalk K.H. Swen H.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), serine proteases (23.Blow D. Nature. 1990; 343: 694-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24.Wright C.S. Alden R.A. Kraut J. Nature. 1969; 221: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and α/β hydrolases (25.Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Other than the aforementioned catalytic residue mutants, several other single-amino acid mutants that lacked enzyme activity were identified by extensive mutant studies (Table II). Among these were mutants whose aromatic residues (Trp-220 and Trp-231) were altered to Ala. When a protein amount equal to WT was used for enzyme activity assays, W220A and W231A mutants were found to be inactive (Table II). However, mutation of each of the Trp-220 and Trp-231 to another aromatic residue, Phe, retained enzyme activity (Table II). The Trp-220 and Trp-231 can be sequentially aligned to Trp-375 and Trp-392 of factor XIIIa, respectively. These results suggest that these aromatic residues are crucial in maintaining the structural stability of the protein. This finding is consistent with the CD analysis (see below). Besides the catalytic triad and hydrophobic residues, other residues, e.g. Arg-210 and Glu-222 of Png1p, which are aligned with Arg-333 and Glu-377 of factor XIIIa, were also found vitally important for the activity of Png1p (Table II). Arg-333 and Glu-377 are involved in the formation of a hydrogen bond in factor XIIIa. Thus, the loss of activity with mutants R210A or E222A is most likely due to the altered conformation of the core structure of the enzyme as confirmed by CD analysis. This result leads us to assume that a similar hydrogen bond might be formed in Png1p. Among Png1p homologs there are sequence homologies outside the “transglutaminase motif” (9.Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Among these conserved residues are four cysteine residues that form two C XXC motifs (Cys-129, Cys-132, Cys-165, and Cys-168 in Png1p) (9.Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The Cys-to-Ala mutations of these residues resulted in loss of the enzymatic activity (Table II). However, mutation to Ser yielded an enzyme with a very low level of activity. Among the other residues Phe-261, Asp-268, Tyr-257, and Tyr-273 are also highly conserved in PNGases from diverse organisms (but are not conserved in factor XIIIa). These residues spatially located farther from the catalytic residues were found to be crucial for enzyme activity (Table II), because their mutation destroyed activity. CD analysis of Y273A also confirms that this is an essential residue in maintaining the native structure of enzyme (see below). Besides these residues, none of the other conserved residues in Png1ps had any profound effect on enzyme activity (Table II). To further explore the structure-activity relationship of the WT and various inactive mutant Png1ps (C191A, R210A, W220A, and Y273A), far UV and near UV CD spectra were measured. An equal concentration of protein was used for all the experiments. The far UV CD spectra (Fig. 5A) showed negative peaks at 222 and 209 nm and a positive peak at 195 nm, typical of proteins with a high α-helix and low β-sheet content, in agreement with the data available on the secondary structure prediction of Png1p (26.Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, loss in α-helicity was observed with the mutant proteins. The far UV CD spectrum of a protein can be deconvoluted to estimate the fraction of secondary structure components (27.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). An analysis of the secondary structure of WT and mutant Png1p is shown in Table III. Compared with WT, the mutant forms have 7–20% less α-helix structure. Concomitantly, a gain in the percentage of the β-sheet was observed in the mutants. Thus, interconversion of α-helix into β-sheets may have caused the inactivation of the enzyme.Table IIIDetermination of the percentage of α-helix and β-sheets in WT and mutant Png1p using selcon3 (27.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal.

The CD spectrum of WT protein showed peaks around 270, 285, and 295, which are attributable to phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan residues, respectively (Fig. 5B). However, the absorbance pattern changed when mutant proteins (C191A, R210A, W220A, and Y273A) were used (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with a non-native conformation for the mutant Png1p protein, and the loss in their enzyme activity is most likely due to disruption of the native structure of the enzyme. The results in Table II showed that for four Cys-to-Ser mutants (C129S, C132S, C165S, and C168S) no activity was observed after 30 min of incubation. However, after extended incubation (40 h) these Cys-to-Ser mutants revealed very low level of activity, whereas other mutants upon extended time showed no further effect on activity. The differential behavior of these four mutants prompted us to analyze their kinetic parameters and compare the mutant enzymes with WT. C129S, C132S, C165S, and C168S mutants belong to two C XXC motifs located at the N terminus in all Png1p homologs (9.Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These mutants were purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The purity of all four protein samples were analyzed by using 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3b). The amount of protein in these Cys to Ser mutants was comparable to WT analyzed by using Western blot (Fig. 3d). Despite the presence of an equal amount of protein in the Cys to Ser mutant, the activity was remarkably low in all the four mutants compared with WT. The kinetic parameters of all four Cys to Ser residues were compared with WT enzyme. As shown in Table IV, more than a 1000-fold difference was found in Vmax and turnover rate of WT compared with Cys-to-Ser mutants. However, the Km was similar for the WT and these mutant Png1p. The extremely reduced activity of Cys-to-Ser mutants in the C XXC motifs, therefore, suggest that the hydroxyl bond of the substituted amino acid cannot fully replace the sulfhydryl bond of cysteine residue at that position.Table IVDetermination of the kinetic parameters of four Cys to Ser mutants of CXXC motifsWT or mutantKmvmaxRelative turnover rate4-aTurnover rate for WT is set to 1.μmnmol/mg.minWT2101401C129S1100.0344.4 × 10−4C132S1300.0475.2 × 10−4C165S1600.0615.7 × 10−4C168S2100.0523.6 × 10−44-a Turnover rate for WT is set to 1.

Recently it has been reported that yeast Png1p physically associates with the 26 S proteasome through Rad23 protein, a nucleotide excision repair protein (10.Suzuki T. Park H. Kwofie M.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21601-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mouse homolog of Png1p has been found to bind numerous ubiquitin proteasome pathway-related proteins, supporting the idea that Png1p is indeed involved in proteasomal degradation processes (31.Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Based on primary structure comparisons, Png1p has been reported to be a member of the transglutaminase superfamily of proteins (11.Makorova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the current study, structure-function relationship of Png1p was further investigated by identifying critical amino acid residues that are essential for enzyme activity. The reactions catalyzed by these enzymes in transglutaminase superfamily so far involve either the formation of amides by linking alkylamines to the glutamate side chains of proteins (transglutaminase) or hydrolysis of peptide bonds (proteases) (11.Makorova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Prot. Sci. 1999; 8: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Png1p inclusion in the transglutaminase superfamily is consistent with the reaction that involves breakage of the amide bond between N-acetylglucosamine and an aspargine side chains (32.Takahashi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Png1p is currently unknown. Thus, the structural effects of the point mutations studied were predicted using the three-dimensional structure of factor XIIIa (18.Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Trong I.L. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6 is shown the structural location of the catalytic and other conserved residues in factor XIIIa. The catalytic residue Cys-314 in factor XIIIa, which is shown to be essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity (33.Folk J.E. Cole P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3238-3240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is located at the amino terminus of the longest helix in the structure. The sulfhydryl group of Cys-314 forms a hydrogen bond with catalytic His-373 (34.Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Micanovic R. Procyk R. Lin W. Matsueda G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9190-9194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which emanates from a strand in the middle of a β-sheet. The terminal oxygen atom of Asp-396 forms a hydrogen bond with the other nitrogen atom of the His-373. Asp-396 is located on the neighboring strand of the same β-sheet. The hydrogen bond interaction between Cys-314 and His-373 is that of a thiol-imidazolium ion pair, as in the cysteine proteases. The loss in activity of Png1p upon mutation of any one of the three catalytic residues (Cys-191, His-218, and Asp-235) to Ala, therefore, may be due to the breakage of hydrogen bonds between Cys-191, His-218, and Asp-235 thus, affecting the native-like structure which in turn effects charge relay. Loss in hydrogen bond would disrupt the native-like structure, which is consistent with CD analysis of the C191A showing non-native conformation for the enzyme. Our results are consistent with the loss in activity for all the three catalytic residues when mutated to Ala, one at a time, in factor XIIIa (34.Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28309-28313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the conserved residues in Png1p, aromatic residues Trp-220 and Trp-231, which are also conserved in factor XIIIa (Fig. 2) showed a loss of enzyme activity on mutation to Ala. A plausible explanation for this can be based on the known structure of factor XIIIa. The equivalent aromatic residues in factor XIIIa are Trp-375 and Trp-392, respectively. Trp-375 is sequentially and spatially close to the catalytic residue His-373 and has hydrophobic interactions with the aromatic ring of His-373 thus stabilizing the orientation of this catalytic residue (Fig. 6). Another conserved residue, Trp-392, is found in the terminal region of strand 3 and interacts with the hydrophobic part of the side chain of Arg-333. The importance of these hydrophobic interactions between the catalytic His-218 and Trp-220 and the side chain of Arg-210 and Trp-231 in Png1p was elucidated by mutation of Trp-220 and Trp-231 to an equivalent aromatic residue Phe. Interestingly, both of these mutants retained enzyme activity. In factor XIIIa, the side-chain of Arg-333 (strand 1) when mapped on the available core structure, indicates its involvement in the formation of a hydrogen bond with a distance of 2.8 Å to the side chain of Glu-377 located in strand 2 (see Fig. 6). The equivalent residues in Png1p are Arg-210 and Glu-222. In factor XIIIa, these residues are likely to be firmly anchored in space to stabilize the structure. Mutation of Arg-210 and/or Glu-222 to Ala would thus tear away this hydrogen bond stabilizing strands 1 and 2 leading to a non-native conformation of the protein. This prediction, based on the sequence mapping in structure of factor XIIIa, is consistent with the CD spectra of R210A. These results provide possible evidence for a hydrogen bond between Arg-210 and Glu-222 in Png1p. The functions of two thioredoxin like motifs (C XXC) and other residues (Y257A, F261A, D268A, and Y273A) in Png1p remain elusive. None of these residues are found to be conserved in factor XIIIa. Additional information is needed to elucidate the biological and structural importance of the C XXC motifs and the other residues. Taken together all of our results, one can conclude that mutations within the core domain of the enzyme have a profound influence on the structure of protein, because they interfere with proper functioning of the enzyme. The present data indicates that the fold of the core domain of Png1p might be similar with the other members of the transglutaminase superfamily, therefore suggesting a common evolutionary lineage (26.Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The most significant achievement of this study was the identification of catalytic amino acid residues Cys-191, His-218, and Asp-235 in Png1p, which are involved in the cleavage of amide bond between N-acetylglucosamine and the Asn side chain in a glycopeptide/glycoprotein. These catalytic residues are well conserved in all eukaryotic PNGases, which leads us to propose the catalytic mechanism, similar to the proteolytic mechanism of serine proteases, in the deglycosylation reaction as shown in Fig. 7. The requirement of a nucleophile is fulfilled by Cys-191, which attacks the carbonyl group of the side chain of Asn (reaction step 1, Fig. 7a) linked to glycan generating a tetrahedral intermediate (reaction step 2, Fig. 7a). If this is the case, the imidazole ring of His-218 takes up the liberated proton and forms a imidazolium ion. This process is then aided by the polarizing effect of the carboxylate ion of Asp-235. Thus all the three residues can be involved in charge relay, which is essential for the catalytic process. The tetrahedral intermediate decomposes to an acyl-enzyme intermediate (reaction step 3, Fig. 7a) releasing the glycosylamine. Water is the attacking nucleophile (reaction step 4, Fig. 7a) in the deacylation step, which again forms a tetrahedral complex (reaction step 5, Fig. 7a). Finally, the aspartic acid is released at the site of cleavage (reaction step 6, Fig. 7a). The glycosylamine, which is released after the decomposition of acyl-enzyme intermediate, is hydrolyzed to free glycan and ammonia as shown in Fig. 7b. This is the first study on the structure-activity relationships of Png1p. Additional tools, e.g. crystal structure or more structural investigations are needed to further elucidate the structure-function relationship of PNGases, and this line of study is currently underway.

It has also been shown that the organic chelated vanadyl (VO2+) compounds illustrated in Fig. 1 exhibit significantly enhanced insulin-mimetic activity in diabetic laboratory animals compared with that of inorganic VO2+ introduced as VOSO4 (6.Yuen V.G.

Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because the capacity of organic chelates of VO2+ to lower blood glucose is equivalent whether administered gastrointestinally or intraperitoneally (6.Yuen V.G. Orvig C. McNeill J.H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the enhanced insulin-mimetic action compared with that of VOSO4 cannot be due only to increased lipophilicity, facilitating transport across the intestinal wall. The insulin-mimetic action of these organic chelates must be the result of how the organic moiety modulates the intrinsic chemical properties of the VO2+ ion. While pH-dependent speciation of organic chelates observed on the basis of EPR spectra has been ascribed to rearrangements of the organic ligand moieties and displacement by solvent molecules (9.Hanson G.R Sun Y. Orvig C. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 6507-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10.Crans, D. C. (1998) In Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Therapeutic Applications (Tracey, A.

Furthermore, the physiologically active form of chelated VO2+ in the blood stream is not established. An important observation made by Chasteen and co-workers (12.Chasteen N.D. Lord E.M. Thompson H.J. Grady J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 884: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) shows that VO2+, when given as VOSO4 by gastric intubation to laboratory rats, distributes itself in circulating plasma between the two major isoforms of the serum transferrins in proportion to the amount administered. Although serum albumin and transferrin bind VO2+ tightly in the micromolar range (13.Chasteen N.D. Francavilla J. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 867-871Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14.Chasteen N.D.

White L.K. Campbell R.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is difficult to ascribe the enhanced glucose-lowering capacity of organic VO2+ complexes simply to the “stripping” out of the VO2+ ion from its chelate ligand environment to form protein-bound VO2+ in the blood stream. Such action would be likely to render organic VO2+ complexes no more potent in glucose-lowering capacity than VOSO4 itself. Since the serum transport proteins albumin, transferrin, and transthyretin bind a variety of organic ligands, e.g. fatty acids, steroids, and thyroxine hormone as carrier molecules in circulating blood (17.Jakoby IV, M.G. Covey D.F. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8780-8787Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18.Bailey S. Evans R.W. Garratt R.C. Gorinsky B. Hasnain S. Horsburgh C. Jhoti H. Lindley P.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6202-6206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we would argue that the organic moiety of VO2+ chelates likely also facilitates binding to serum transport proteins. For this reason in these initial studies, we have investigated the potential of organic chelates of VO2+, namely VO(acac)2, 1The abbreviations used are: VO(acac)2bis(acetylacetonato)oxovanadium(IV)BSAbovine serum albuminENDORelectron nuclear double resonancehfhyperfine KRBH, Krebs-Ringer bufferVO(malto)2bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) compound b in Fig. 1, to form adducts with serum albumin of defined stoichiometry. We have also analyzed the spectroscopic properties of VO(acac)2 by EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy to determine the stoichiometry of the organic ligand bound to VO2+ as a function of pH. To investigate whether serum proteins have an influence on the insulin-mimetic action of VO2+ chelates, we have compared glucose transport, measured as the uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose by 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by VO(acac)2, in the absence and presence of albumin. The results disprove previous interpretations of the pH-dependent speciation of these organic chelates (10.Crans, D. C. (1998) In Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Therapeutic Applications (Tracey, A. S., and Crans, D.

Not only does VO(acac)2 form a tightly bound adduct with albumin of 1:1 stoichiometry, but also a ratio of VO2+ chelate to protein of ≤1.0 elicits maximal enhancement of insulin-mimetic activity in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. bis(acetylacetonato)oxovanadium(IV) bovine serum albumin electron nuclear double resonance hyperfine KRBH, Krebs-Ringer buffer bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) Vanadyl sulfate hydrate and bis(acetylacetonato)oxovanadium(IV) were purchased from Aldrich. Crystalline bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) was a gift from Professor C. Orvig of the University of British Columbia. Crystalline [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetato]oxovanadium(IV) was a gift from Professor D. C. Crans of Colorado State University. Insulin, deoxy-2-glucose, differentiation reagents, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose (56 mCi/mmol) was supplied by ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All other reagents were of analytical reagent grade, and deionized distilled water was used throughout. Spectroscopic grade methanol was obtained from Aldrich. Absolute ethanol was obtained from Aaper Chemical Co. (Shelbyville, KY). Deuterated water (99.8 atom % 2H2O) and [2H4]methanol (99 atom % 2H) were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Woburn, MA). A protocol was developed to avoid the presence of serum or albumin while measuring the influence of insulin and insulin-mimetic compounds on the uptake of 2-deoxy-[1-14C]glucose by 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained and differentiated into adipocytes as reported previously (21.Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were used 4–9 days after completion of the differentiation protocol when >95% of the cells contained lipid droplets. Prior to insulin stimulation or treatment with VO2+ compounds, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered isotonic saline at 37 °C and serum-starved for 2.5 h at 37 °C in 1 ml/well KRBH with 5 mm glucose and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The basal and insulin-stimulated rates of glucose transport in adipocytes treated in this manner were identical to cells serum-starved in KRBH/glucose plus 0.5% BSA and were similar to previous results when Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum was used (22.Jensen T.C. Crosson S.M. Kartha P.M. Brady M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 75: 40148-40154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The serum starvation medium was then removed, the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered isotonic saline (37 °C), and the adipocytes were placed in 0.5 ml/well KRBH containing insulin, the VO2+ compound desired (accordingly in the absence or presence of BSA), or no insulin-mimetic compound. After 30 min at 37 °C, 20 μm2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose (∼20 cpm/pmol) was added to all wells. After 5 min at room temperature, the assay was terminated by addition of 50 μl of 200 mm2-deoxy-d-glucose and washing the cells three times with phosphate-buffered isotonic saline on ice. Adipocytes were collected in 0.5 ml of distilled water, and 2-deoxyglucose uptake was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Concentrated stock solutions of VO(acac)2 or VO(malto)2 for metabolic studies were made by dissolving the crystalline compound in a small volume of absolute ethanol followed by dilution so that the final solution contained 150 mm sodium chloride buffered to pH 7.4 with 10 mm HEPES. The buffered saline had been previously purged with nitrogen gas. Aliquots of the buffered saline suspension of the organic chelate were then added to the wells in the presence or absence of BSA. (The ethanol content of incubation mixtures was no greater than 1%.) Before use, BSA had been exhaustively dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline at pH 7.4 containing 10 mm EDTA followed by dialysis against HEPES-buffered saline without EDTA to remove possible contaminant vanadium (23.Sakurai H. Nishida M. Kida K. Koyama M. Takada J. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1987; 138: 149-153Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). No vanadyl species could be detected in the BSA solution by EPR. Concentrated stock solutions of VOSO4 were prepared by dissolving vanadyl sulfate hydrate in a small volume of H2O under a nitrogen atmosphere, and aliquots were added to a solution of BSA in buffered isotonic saline to result in 1 mm final concentration of each. This solution was then used for suspension of adipocytes for glucose uptake measurements. Stock solutions of VO(acac)2 for acid-base titrations monitored by EPR were made by dissolving the crystalline compound in methanol or in nitrogen-purged water. EPR spectra of aqueous or methanol solutions of VO(acac)2 at ambient room temperature were collected with the sample in quartz capillaries. For titrations of VO(acac)2 in aqueous solution, small aliquots of concentrated HCl or NaOH were added. Before and after spectral recording, the pH was measured with a Radiometer PHM82 standard pH meter equipped with a glass electrode to ensure that the pH of the solution had not changed. The pH meter was generally calibrated with two standard pH solutions bracketing the pH of the test solution. The volume change after addition of concentrated acid or base was less than 1%. Acid-base titrations of VO(acac)2 in methanol were carried out by two different methods. Equivalent results were obtained with both methods. Either small aliquots of concentrated aqueous HCl or NaOH were added to the methanolic solution, the volume of the aqueous component remaining <1% of the total volume. To completely avoid possible effects of the aqueous component, aliquots of methanol saturated with dry, gaseous HCl or NH3 were added to the methanolic solution of VO(acac)2 to alter [H+]. The pH* was measured with a glass electrode prior to and after spectral recording according to Bates (24.Bates R.D. Determination of pH: Theory and Practice. Wiley & Sons, New York1973: 211-253Google Scholar), allowing adequate time for equilibration of the electrode. The nominal pH reading was converted to pH* according to the relationship pH* ≡ paH* = pH − δ, where pH is the nominal reading of the electrode and δ has the value of −2.34 for 100% methanol as solvent (24.Bates R.D. Determination of pH: Theory and Practice. Wiley & Sons, New York1973: 211-253Google Scholar). EPR and ENDOR spectra were recorded with an X-band Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with a cylindrical TE011 ENDOR cavity, an Oxford Instruments ESR910 liquid helium cryostat, and Bruker ENDOR digital accessory as described previously (25.Jiang F.S. Makinen M.W. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1736-1744Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26.Mustafi D. Nakagawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11323-11327Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The ESP 300E spectrometer was equipped with a complete computer interface (Bruker ESP3220 data system) for spectrometer control and data acquisition and processing. Typical experimental conditions for ENDOR measurements were: temperature, 20 K; microwave frequency, 9.45 GHz; incident microwave power, 64 microwatts (full power, 640 milliwatts at 0 dB); rf power, 50–70 watts; rf modulation frequency, 12.5 kHz; and rf modulation depth, 10–20 kHz. The static laboratory magnetic field was not modulated for ENDOR. EPR spectra were simulated with use of the program WINEPR2.11 (Bruker Instruments, Inc., Bellerica, MA) as described previously (27.Mustafi D. Galtseva E.V. Krzystek J. Brunel L.C. Makinen M.W. J. Phys. Chem. Ser. A. 1999; 103: 11279-11286Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 compares representative EPR spectra of VO(acac)2 at ambient room temperature in aqueous solution with those observed in methanol. The absorption intensity of the EPR spectrum of the S = 1/2 oxovanadium(IV) ion in solution at ambient temperatures is distributed over eight components due to the hyperfine coupling of the unpaired electron with the (I = 7/2) 51V nucleus. While the centrally located components for the different spectral species overlap heavily with each other over the titratable pH range, the low field and high field components are separated from each other at extremes of protonic activity. In aqueous solutions we have observed the reversible formation of four spectrally distinct species, labeled A–D, while in methanol only three were observed. Vertical lines have been drawn, therefore, in Fig. 2 at low field and high field positions identifying each species. For both solvent systems, it is seen that the vertical lines for species B and B′ in aqueous and methanol systems, respectively, identify a weak shoulder that is not part of the spectrum for species A or A′. It is seen in Table I that species A–D and A′–C′ in aqueous and methanol solutions, respectively, differ from each other primarily on the basis of Aovalues. Comparable observations have been made earlier by others for VO(acac)2 (11.Amin S.S. Cryer K. Zhang B. Dutta S.K. Eaton S.S. Anderson O.P. Miller S.M. Reul B.A. Brichard S.M. Crans D.C. Inorg.

The values of the spectroscopic parameters g∥, g⊥ and A∥, A⊥ for these species obtained from frozen solution spectra, summarized in Table I, are nearly identical, indicating very similar structural environments of the oxovanadium(IV) ion. Corresponding values for VO(acac)2 have not been reported from frozen solution spectra by others. Our results for VO(acac)2 from frozen solution spectra are comparable to those reported for VO(malto)2 (9.Hanson G.R Sun Y. Orvig C. Inorg.

Open table in a new tab In Table I it is seen that the g- and A-values for species A, B, and C in aqueous solution are within experimental measurement identical to the g- and A-values of species A′, B′, and C′ in methanol solution, respectively. Only in aqueous solution is the fourth species D observed. Its spectrum yields g- and A-values identical to those of the [VO(H2O)5]2+ ion (9.Hanson G.R Sun Y. Orvig C. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 6507-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26.Mustafi D. Nakagawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, no previous study has shown the equivalence of species A, B, and C in aqueous solution to A′, B′, and C′, respectively, in methanol. Crans and co-workers (10.Crans, D. C. (1998) In Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Therapeutic Applications (Tracey, A. S., and Crans, D. C., eds) pp. 82–103, American Chemical Society Symposium Series No. 711, Oxford University Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 11.Amin S.S. Cryer K. Zhang B. Dutta S.K. Eaton S.S. Anderson O.P.

Chem. 2000; 39: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have stated that for VO(acac)2 freshly prepared in aqueous solutions the conversion of species A to species C is time-dependent, requiring up to 11 days at ambient temperature. The spectral changes have, therefore, been interpreted to reflect kinetically sluggish, time-dependent alterations in coordination geometry and displacement of an equatorial organic ligand by water. With freshly prepared, unbuffered solutions of species A, we have similarly observed this phenomenon after 11 days but find that the change in spectra was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in pH. On the other hand, direct adjustment of the pH of a solution of species A elicits the conversion of species A to C immediately within the mixing time. Since the g- and A-values provide a signature of elemental composition of the four equatorial donor-ligand atoms of the complex (29.Chasteen N.D. Berliner L. Reben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 3. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar), we conclude that species A, B, and C in aqueous solutions are identical to their A′, B′, and C′ counterparts in methanol, respectively. Fig. 3 illustrates titration curves constructed on the basis of the EPR spectra of VO(acac)2 in aqueous solution, demonstrating the reproducibility of the data and complete reversibility of ionizations. Data of equivalent precision were collected for titrations in methanol. The titration curves could be constructed only through careful measurement of the peak-to-peak amplitudes of the hyperfine components for each spectral species. Exquisite care was taken to avoid introduction of air into the solution to prevent oxidation of the oxovanadium(IV) ion. Species A, viz. A′, is readily defined under conditions of low acidity; however, as [H+] increases, species B, viz. B′, appears with closely overlapping spectral features before species C, viz. C′, is detectable. The spectral features of species A and B remained closely overlapping, and titration data could be analyzed only by considering the summed total of species A(+ B) distinct from species C. The titration curves, therefore, were calculated as a function of the composition of A(+ B), C, and D in aqueous solution and, correspondingly, A′(+ B′) and C′ in methanol. In aqueous solution, as illustrated in Fig. 3, one ionization was observed with a p Ka value of ∼3.1, governing the reversible interconversion between species A(+ B) and C, while the second ionization with a p Ka value of ∼1.7 governs the equilibrium between species C and D. In methanol only one ionization was observed as a function of protonic activity with a p Ka* value of ∼5.1, governing the interconversion between species A′(+ B′) and C′. The spectral speciation of VO(acac)2 (10.Crans, D. C. (1998) In Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Therapeutic Applications (Tracey, A. S., and Crans, D.

Chem. 1996; 35: 6507-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has been previously noted by others on the basis of EPR spectra; however, the values of ionization constants governing their interconversion have not been estimated, and the spectroscopic equivalence of species A, B, and C for VO(acac)2 in aqueous solutions and of A′, B′, and C′ in methanol solutions has not been demonstrated hitherto. While the molecular origins of the two ionizations in aqueous solution are under further investigation in this laboratory through use of perdeuterated VO(acac)2, the results do demonstrate that the metallo-organic chelate VO(acac)2 is stable in aqueous solutions of pH ∼2. This observation, together with its expected greater lipophilicity, undoubtedly underlies in part its enhanced insulin-mimetic activity when introduced orally to laboratory animals compared with that of VOSO4 (6.Yuen V.G. Orvig C. McNeill J.H. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Isomerizations of the organic ligand, replacement of carbonyl oxygen atoms by solvent molecules, and other similar structural changes have been attributed to underlie the pH-dependent spectral speciation of VO(acac)2(10.Crans, D. C. (1998) In Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Therapeutic Applications (Tracey, A. S., and Crans, D. C., eds) pp. 82–103, American Chemical Society Symposium Series No. 711, Oxford University Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 11.Amin S.S. Cryer K. Zhang B. Dutta S.K. Eaton S.S. Anderson O.P. Miller S.M. Reul B.A. Brichard S.M. Crans D.C. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 39: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the values of the spectroscopic parameters in Table I extracted from spectra can be related only to the average elemental composition of the equatorial donor-ligand atoms with appropriate changes in vanadium-oxygen covalency (29.Chasteen N.D. Berliner L. Reben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 3. Plenum Press, New York1981: 53-119Crossref Google Scholar). The spectroscopic effect of a solvent oxygen atom is essentially indistinguishable from that of a carbonyl or hydroxyl oxygen. Angle-selected ENDOR, therefore, becomes the method of choice to assign the coordination geometry of the acetylacetonate ligand. The underlying principles of angle-selected ENDOR of VO2+ have been described in earlier studies from this laboratory (25.Jiang F.S. Makinen M.W. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1736-1744Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30.Mustafi D. Makinen M.W. Inorg. Chem. 1988; 27: 3360-3368Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31.Mustafi D. Telser J. Makinen M.W. J.

WhenH0 is set to the −7/2∥ feature of the EPR absorption spectrum and is, therefore, parallel to the symmetry axis or the V=O bond of the complex, a proton located along the symmetry axis gives rise to a parallel hyperfine (hf) resonance coupling (A∥), while A⊥ or the perpendicular hf coupling is observed for a proton in the molecular x, y plane. On the other hand, when the field is set to the −3/2⊥ absorption feature, an axial proton gives rise to a perpendicular hf coupling A⊥, and the equatorial proton gives rise to a combination of parallel and perpendicular hf couplings. The combination of parallel and perpendicular hf couplings is observed only for a proton in the equatorial plane for the −3/2⊥ setting of H0. On the other hand, only an axial proton gives rise to a single pair of ENDOR features whenH0 is set to the −3/2⊥ absorption feature. This variation in the resonance pattern, dependent on the orientation of the magnetic field H0 with respect to magnetic axes in the molecule, is the essence of angle-selected ENDOR as first observed by Rist and Hyde (34.Rist G.H. Hyde J.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 52: 4633-4643Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The detection of ENDOR features of the VO2+ ion is heavily dependent on the nearby solvent environment and the quality of glass formation (25.Jiang F.S. Makinen M.W. Inorg.

For this reason, because of the near identity of the g- and A-values of species A, B, and C to those of A′, B′, and C′, respectively, we have collected ENDOR spectra of species A′ and C′ only in methanol because of its glass-forming properties. Water does not form a glass upon freezing, and therefore, broadening of ENDOR lines occurs because of variations in the crystalline field, particularly for small molecule VO2+ complexes, preventing detection of ENDOR absorptions. Fig. 4 illustrates the proton ENDOR spectra of VO(acac)2 in perdeuterated methanol. Only nonexchangeable, covalently attached hydrogens in the acetylacetonate ligand are detected by ENDOR under these conditions. WithH0 set to the −3/2⊥ component of the EPR spectrum, both A∥ and the A⊥ hf couplings are observed for species A′ formed at high pH* and for species C′ formed at low pH* as defined by the spectra in Fig. 2. On the other hand, withH0 set to the −7/2∥ component of the EPR spectrum, only the A⊥ hf couplings were detected. This pattern of resonances is seen only when the ENDOR-detected hydrogens are in the equatorial plane. This result, therefore, indicates that there is no change in geometry of the bound acetylacetonate ligand with change in [H+]. Since the peak-to-peak amplitudes and line widths of the resonance features for both A′ and C′ species are identical within experimental measurement, the ENDOR spectra also indicate that there is no change in stoichiometry of bound acetylacetonate ligand with change in pH*. These observations were confirmed by collecting ENDOR spectra of VO(acac)2 in [2H3]methanol (data not shown). No resonance features characteristic of equatorial OH groups (30.Mustafi D. Makinen M.W. Inorg. Chem. 1988; 27: 3360-3368Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) could be observed for species A′ or C′ that would have resulted from displacement of an acetylacetonate oxygen by a methanolic hydroxyl group according to the equilibria proposed (10.Crans, D. C. (1998) In Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Therapeutic Applications (Tracey, A. S., and Crans, D.

Also since the ENDOR spectra for both species A′ and C′ have their origin only in equatorial hydrogens covalently attached to the organic ligand, proposed isomerizations of the ligand into axial positions (10.Crans, D. C. (1998) In Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Therapeutic Applications (Tracey, A. S., and Crans, D.

The molecular origins of the ionizations described in Figs. 2 and 3, therefore, must derive from changes in the covalency of vanadium-oxygen interactions induced through protonation-dependent changes of outer sphere solvent molecules hydrogen bonded to the equatorial carbonyl oxygens or to the vanadyl oxygen. Fig. 5 compares proton ENDOR spectra of VO(acac)2 in deuterated aqueous buffer in the presence of BSA. The spectra were collected with H0 set to both the −3/2⊥ and −7/2∥ components of the EPR spectrum of VO(acac)2. While the underlying ENDOR features of the acetylacetonate ligand remained unchanged indicating that the organic chelating ligand was not displaced, there are additional features near the Larmor frequency that have their origin in protein residues. Since exchangeable protons on the serum albumin molecule will have been substituted by deuterons from the solvent, the new resonance features can be ascribed only to covalent hydrogens of nearby amino acid residues. The ENDOR splittings of these resonance features arise from amino acid hydrogens over a 5–10-Å distance from the vanadium nucleus (25.Jiang F.S. Makinen M.W. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1736-1744Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30.Mustafi D. Makinen M.W. Inorg. Chem. 1988; 27: 3360-3368Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31.Mustafi D. Telser J. Makinen M.W. J.

Biol. 2000; 46: 1345-1360PubMed Google Scholar); they, therefore, clearly indicate binding of the organic chelate to the protein molecule. The plot in Fig. 6 shows that binding occurs to form an adduct of 1:1 stoichiometry. Because the underlying features of the acetylacetonate ligand are observed in the ENDOR spectra in Fig. 6, the spectra indicate that the VO(acac)2 complex remains intact upon binding to the protein. The vanadium hf components in the EPR spectra of VO(acac)2 showed no broadening in the presence of BSA. Comparable observations have been reported by others (35.Hollender D. Nerinovski K. Kiss T. Luchinat C. Bertini I. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 2001; 86 (abstr.): 267Google Scholar). Since unresolved ligand hf broadening measurably adds to the EPR line width only for hydrogens covalently attached to equatorial donor-ligand atoms (36.Albanese N. Chasteen N.D. J. Phys. Chem. 1978; 82: 910-914Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we conclude that the oxovanadium(IV) moiety is bound axially to the protein either through a residue hydrogen bonded to the axial water molecule or through a residue directly coordinated to the vanadium ion, having displaced the axial water. At present we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.Figure 6Plot of the peak-to-peak amplitude of the ENDOR features immediately adjacent to the Larmor frequency from the −7/2∥ spectrum in Fig. 6 (with VO(acac)2 resonance contributions subtracted) as a function of increasing albumin concentration relative to VO2+. The solid line was calculated for saturation of a protein with ligand for one binding site. The intersection point of the asymptotes indicates a binding stoichiometry of ∼1.0 VO(acac)2 per albumin molecule.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Albumin is often added to cell culture medium as a neutral, protectant macromolecule (cf. Ref. 7.Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); therefore, we have used serum-starved, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes for metabolic assays to avoid albumin as a complicating factor in the assay medium as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered isotonic saline (37 °C) and serum-starved for 2.5 h in KRBH lacking BSA or serum. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated for 30 min in KRBH with the indicated additions prior to measurement of glucose transport rates. On this basis, we were able to separate the intrinsic influence of a VO2+ compound alone on the uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose from that in the presence of added BSA. Comparative effects are summarized in Table II for four VO2+-containing systems.Table IIComparison of insulin-mimetic activity of oxovanadium(IV) compounds measured as uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[1-14C]glucose by differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytesKRBHKRBH + BSABasal1.953.32100 nm insulin42.1641.950.5 mmVO(acac)217.9633.640.5 mmVO(malto)210.4615.460.5 mmVO(Hhida)a[N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetato]oxovanadium(IV).2.112.141.0 mmVOSO4NDbNot determined because the chemical state of the VO2+ ion is undefined in KRBH.4.02Values for glucose uptake are in units of pmol/min/well.a [N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetato]oxovanadium(IV).b Not determined because the chemical state of the VO2+ ion is undefined in KRBH. Open table in a new tab Values for glucose uptake are in units of pmol/min/well. As shown in Table II, added BSA had no influence on the action of insulin or on the basal rate of glucose uptake. However, not only did the addition of BSA have a pronounced effect on the insulin-mimetic activity of VO(acac)2, but also this varied according to the molar ratio of added BSA to VO2+ chelate. Fig. 7 compares in histogram form the uptake of 2-deoxy-d- [1-14C]glucose as a function of the VO(acac)2:BSA molar ratio. It is seen that the near maximal influence of BSA on the insulin-mimetic effect of VO(acac)2 occurs at a VO(acac)2:BSA ratio of ∼1.0. Addition of VO(acac)2 in excess of this ratio resulted in a decrease in the enhancement of glucose uptake. Since the results of ENDOR titrations in Fig. 5 indicate that the VO2+ ion is not removed from its organic chelate environment, we believe that the lower activity observed at VO(acac)2:BSA ratios ≥1.0 is due to the intrinsically lower activity of the free, unbound portion of VO(acac)2(cf. Table II). Although comparable effects were observed also for VO(malto)2, the influence of added BSA was less pronounced. In contrast to the enhancement of the insulin-mimetic action of VO(acac)2 or VO(malto)2 by added BSA, no influence for [N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-iminodiacetato]oxovanadium(IV) was observed above the basal level for the free VO2+ ion added as VOSO4 (cf. Table II). The molecular mechanisms by which VO2+ and its chelates exert their insulin-mimetic effects in vivo and in vitro have not been fully clarified. It has been demonstrated that both inorganic salts and organic chelates of VO2+ exert their insulin-mimetic effect, at least in part, by stimulating lipogenesis in adipocytes via membrane-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatases and a cytosolic, non-insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase (7.Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Other enzyme systems may also be involved. Since enhancement of lipogenesis by VO(acac)2 has been shown to be far greater than that by VOSO4 in the studies by Shechter and co-workers (7.Li J. Elberg G. Crans D.C. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8314-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the structure and affinity of the organic ligand for VO2+ are likely to be critical in the expression of insulin-mimetic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2078569485,"The FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein has a zinc finger domain, hydrophobic region, proline-rich region, and a HMG box-like domain. We have reported that zinc release at the zinc finger is probably facilitated by the non-canonical cysteine residue at position 56, and that EDTA causes the structural change and enhances the self-assembly of the protein (Kanaya, E., Watanabe, K., Nakajima, N., Okada, K., and Shimura, Y.

Gel retardation experiments showed that the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein binds to DNA without sequence specificity. Deletion analyses suggested that the zinc finger domain and the hydrophobic region are not required but the proline-rich region and the HMG box-like domain are indispensable for the DNA binding by the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein. The DNA binding by the protein consisting of the zinc finger domain and the rest of the regions was reduced with the addition of EDTA.

In higher plants, all lateral organs exhibit abaxial-adaxial asymmetries, and common genetic mechanism is likely to work to specify organ polarity (1.Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D.

The FILAMENTOUS FLOWER ( FIL ) gene is thought to be a member of a gene family whose role appears to be pivotal in specifying the abaxial cell fate of lateral organs (1.Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K.

In this gene family, FIL, YABBY2(YAB2), and YABBY3( YAB3 ) are expressed abaxially in all developing lateral organs and are proposed to redundantly promote the abaxial fate of all lateral organs (1.Sawa S.

The protein encoded by FIL consists of 229 amino acid residues, and has the amino-terminal zinc finger domain between positions 10 and 60, the hydrophobic region between positions 60 and 100, the proline-rich region between positions 127 and 145, and the carboxyl-terminal HMG 1The abbreviations used are: HMGhigh mobility groupFILFILAMENTOUS FLOWERYAB2YABBY2YAB3YABBY3AP1APETALA1EMSAselectrophoretic mobility shift assaysFITC5′-fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate 1The abbreviations used are: HMGhigh mobility groupFILFILAMENTOUS FLOWERYAB2YABBY2YAB3YABBY3AP1APETALA1EMSAselectrophoretic mobility shift assaysFITC5′-fluorescein 5-isothiocyanatebox-like domain between positions 145 and 180 as shown in Fig. 1a. The presence of these domains, in particular the HMG box-like domain, suggests that the FIL gene may function as a transcriptional regulator, and the FIL protein is likely to work as a DNA-binding protein (1.Sawa S.

Bustin M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the HMG domain consists of a global fold of three α-helices (helix I, helix II, and helix III) stabilized in an L-shaped configuration (8.Weir H.M. Kraulis P.J. Hill C.S.

The HMG box proteins in the first class are transcription factors and bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner, such as the human sex-determining factor SRY (10.Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the lymphoid enhancer binding factor LEF1 (11.Travis A. Amsterdam A. Belanger C. Grosschedl R.

Nature. 1995; 376: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and the T-cell factor TCF-1 (13.van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Dooijes D. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The HMG box proteins in the second class are more abundant and bind to DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner. Although their biological functions are currently not clear, they are thought to participate in DNA recombination and repair, activation and repression of transcription, and nucleosome assembly and disassembly. Examples include HMG1 and 2 (HMG1/2) proteins from higher eukaryotes (14.Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), NHP6A and NHP6B from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (16.Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and HU from Escherichia coli (17.Pettijohn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12793-12796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HMG1/2 proteins strongly distort DNA upon binding, and stabilize bent and supercoiled DNA. NHP6A induces a large bend of DNA upon binding. HU exists in the cell as homo- and heterodimers and seems to participate to wrap the oriC sequence (18.Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the HMG box-like domain between positions 145 and 180 of the FIL protein which contains the putative helix 3 and helix 4 (Fig. 1b), shows a homology to those of the regions containing helix I and helix II of both the HMG domain of human mitochondrial transcription factor 1 and mouse testis-specific HMG (1.Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D. Kanaya E. Morita E.H. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, homology was not found in the region corresponding to helix III. A loop structure is predicted for the region corresponding to helix III and a short helix (helix 5) follows it in the FIL protein (Fig. 1b). The structure of the HMG box-like domain of FIL is different from those of the typical HMG domain in the region around helix III. Murphy et al. (19.Murphy IV, F.V. Sweet R.M. Churchill M.E.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6610-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) identified three specificity determinants to differentiate between the non-sequence specific and sequence-specific HMG domains. First all non-sequence-specific HMG proteins have a serine residue at position 146 (Ser146) whereas all sequence-specific HMG proteins have an asparagine at the corresponding position. Second, non-sequence specific proteins have a hydrophobic residue at position 168, whereas sequence-specific proteins have a hydrophilic residue at the corresponding position. The presence of a Ser146 in the FIL protein agrees with FIL having a non-sequence specific HMG domain but the presence of His168in FIL does not. The third determining domain is in a C-terminal hydrophobic core. But, the HMG box-like domain of the FIL protein has no corresponding region. The HMG box-like domain of the FIL protein is partially different from the typical HMG box domains. Recently, we have reported that the non-canonical cysteine residue at position 56 (Cys56) in the FIL protein potentially interferes with a zinc ligation within the zinc finger and probably facilitates the zinc release, and that the addition of EDTA causes the structural change and enhances the multimerization of the FIL protein. The COOH-terminal half of the zinc finger domain and the following hydrophobic region participate with the region between positions 45 and 107 functioning in the intermolecular contacts between the FIL proteins (20.Kanaya E. Watanabe K. Nakajima N. Okada K. Shimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To place these data within the framework of the potential transcriptional role of the FIL protein we examined the relation among the zinc finger domain, the hydrophobic region, the proline-rich region, and the HMG box-like domain in DNA binding using gel retardation. We found that the proline-rich region and the HMG box-like domain are required for the DNA binding by the FIL protein. The addition of EDTA reduced the DNA binding by the FIL protein with the zinc finger domain present. It might be suggested that zinc release probably facilitated by the non-canonical Cys56, the structural change probably occurring in the zinc finger domain, the intermolecular interaction occurring in the COOH-terminal half of the zinc finger domain and the following hydrophobic region, and the self-assembly of the FIL protein (20.Kanaya E.

EMSAs were performed with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide probes listed in Table I. 5′-Fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled double- stranded random oligonucleotide pool of 76-mer in Table I was generated by polymerization in one direction using 5′-FITC labeled-ACGCGTTGGGAGCTCTCCGGATCCA-3′ as a primer, 5′- ACTC- GAGGAATTCGGTACCCCGGGT(X)26TGGATCCGGAGAGCTCCC- AACGCGT-3′ as a template, and KOD DNA polymerase from Toyobo Co. at 74 °C for 15 min. Double stranded oligonucleotides with different lengths and sequences summarized in Table I were synthesized by Sawady Technology Co., Ltd. A 20-μl reaction for EMSA containing Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1–0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.04 m NaSCN), 2.5 pmol of FITC-labeled or 0.2 pmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, and 0.1–30 μg of the FIL protein were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min or 15 h. The solution of the mixture was electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (60:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at room temperature. Fluorescence of FITC was detected by FMBIO II Multi-View from TAKARA. The amount of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe in the gel was quantified from the autoradiogram using a laser-excited image analyzer (BAS5000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).Table ISequences used for EMSAsbpSequence (5′ to 3′)76(FITC)-ACGCGTTGGGAGCTCTCCGGATCCA (X)26ACCCGGGGTACCGAATTCCTCGAGTaSmaI site is underlined.55(FITC)-ACGCGTTGGGAGCTCTCCGGATCCA (X)26ACCC70GGAGCATCTTGATAGGTCTGAAAAAGCAGGTCGGCCATGGAATAGATCGGCATTCTGTGGCTGATTAGAG60GGAGCATCTTGATAGGTCTGAAAAAGCAGGTCGGCCATGGAATAGATCGGCATTCTGTGG50GGAGCATCTTGATAGGTCTGAAAAAGCAGGTCGGCCATGGAATAGATCGG40GGAGCATCTTGATAGGTCTGAAAAAGCAGGTCGGCCATGG30GGAGCATCTTGATAGGTCTGAAAAAGCAGG20GGAGCATCTTGATAGGTCTG51TTCCTTCCCTCACATATAACTATCAACCAAGTACAAAACTTTTGTCAATTC52GGTAAAGGATCCACTTGAGTTACTAAAAATGGAAAGTATTGCCGAATTCATGbThe CArG box is underlined.a SmaI site is underlined.b The CArG box is underlined. Open table in a new tab The 15-amino acid S·tag peptide was fused to the NH2-terminal end of the FIL protein using the expression vector pET28a from Novagen. The S·tag fused FIL protein was purified as described above, and the gel mobility shift of the S·tag-FIL protein-DNA (the 51-bp DNA in Table I) complex was caused identically to that of the FIL-(6–229)·DNA complex. The band of the S·tag-FIL protein-DNA complex was excised from the gel, and the complex was eluted from the gel in the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaSCN, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1.0% sodium deoxycholate by shaking at 20 °C for 15 h. The amount of the S·tag-FIL protein in the complex was quantified by S·tag Rapid Assay kit from Novagen. The molar amount of DNA was determined by comparison to several known amounts of the DNA fragment electrophoresed on the same gel. The FIL protein (FIL6–229) was mixed with a 5′-FITC-labeled random double-stranded oligonucleotide pool of 76-bp, 5′ FITC-labeled ACGCGTTGGGAGCTCTCCGGATCCA(X)26ACCCGGGGTACCGAATTCCTCGAGT-3′ (Table I) in which a random sequence of 26 nucleotide residues and SmaI site (underlined) are included. The interaction of the FIL protein with the 76-bp DNA was analyzed by EMSA in which a protein-DNA complex is retarded in migration from the free DNA probe. As shown in Fig. 2, the FIL protein bound to the 76-bp with random 26 nucleotide residues. The fraction of the bound form was more than 70%, when 8 μg of the FIL protein was mixed with 2.5 pmol of the 76-bp DNA (Fig. 2). The FIL protein bound similarly to the 5′-FITC-labeled random double-stranded oligonucleotide pool of 55-bp, 5′-FITC-ACGCGTTGGGAGCTCTCCGGATC-CA(X)26ACCC-3′ (Table I), which is the SmaI digest of the random 76 bp (data not shown). These results suggest that the FIL protein binds without sequence specificity to the double-stranded oligonucleotide. The FIL protein was mixed with six double-stranded oligonucleotides with different chain length of 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20 bp which are summarized in Table I. As shown in Fig. 3, the FIL protein effectively bound to the 70-, 60-, and 50-bp DNA. As the length of DNA became shorter, the binding efficiency was decreased. The FIL protein hardly bound to the 20-bp DNA. To determine the stoichiometry of the FIL protein-DNA complex, Stag·FIL fusion protein was constructed, and was mixed with the 51-bp DNA in Table I. The FIL-DNA complex was isolated from the gel, and the protein and DNA were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quantification of three individual FIL-DNA complexes gave average molar ratios of 2.3 ± 0.1. This result suggests that two FIL protein molecules bind to one 51-bp DNA. The FIL protein has four regions, that is, the amino-terminal zinc finger domain between positions 10 and 60, the hydrophobic region between positions 60 and 100, the proline-rich region between positions 127 and 145, and the carboxyl-terminal HMG box-like domain between positions 145 and 180 as shown in Fig. 1a. To determine the region which is necessary for the DNA binding, eight different truncations of the FIL protein were constructed, that is, FIL-(6–229), FIL-(65–229), FIL-(120–229), FIL-(143–229), FIL-(6–203), FIL-(6–183), FIL-(6–165), and FIL-(120–183), as shown in Fig. 1c. These proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (1.Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D. Kanaya E. Morita E.H. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 20.Kanaya E. Watanabe K. Nakajima N. Okada K. Shimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The zinc finger domain was removed in FIL-(65–229). Both the zinc finger domain and the following hydrophobic region were removed in FIL-(120–229). The zinc finger domain, the hydrophobic region, and the proline-rich region were removed in FIL-(143–229). The C-terminal α-helix (helix 5 in Fig. 1b) predicted by the secondary structure prediction was removed in FIL-(6–203). The region between positions 184 and 229 and that between positions 166 and 229 were removed in FIL-(6–183) and FIL-(6–165), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, among the eight truncated FIL proteins, FIL-(6–229), FIL-(65–229), FIL-(120–229), FIL-(6–203), FIL-(6–183), and FIL-(120–183) bound to the 52-bp DNA, while the two FIL proteins FIL-(143–229) and FIL-(6–165) did not. These results suggest that the region between positions 120 and 143 containing the proline-rich region and the HMG box-like domain between positions 145 and 180 are required for the DNA binding by the FIL protein, while the zinc finger domain, the following hydrophobic region, and the C-terminal region between positions 184 and 229 are not indispensable for the DNA binding by the FIL protein (Fig. 1c). The FIL protein has seven cysteine residues at positions 14, 26, 30, 33, 54, 56, and 57 in the zinc finger domain, and among them, it is thought that four cysteine residues at positions 30, 33, 54, and 57 are in the typical canonical positions for zinc ligation. We have reported that the cysteine residue at non-canonical position 56 (Cys56) probably facilitates the zinc release from the zinc finger domain of the FIL protein, and the loss of the zinc ion and the subsequent structural change probably occurring in the zinc finger domain are correlated with the self-assembly of the FIL protein, which are enhanced by the addition of EDTA (20.Kanaya E. Watanabe K. Nakajima N. Okada K. Shimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the changes in FIL protein structure influence DNA binding, FIL protein-DNA complex formation was assessed in the presence of EDTA. EDTA (12.5, 25, 50, or 100 mm) was added to the solution containing the FIL protein (FIL-(6–229), FIL-(65–229), or C56A) and the 52-bp DNA. C56A is a mutant fil protein in which Cys56 is replaced by Ala allowing a means to investigate the role of the non-canonical Cys56 in the zinc release, structural change, and self-assembly of the FIL protein (20.Kanaya E. Watanabe K. Nakajima N. Okada K. Shimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7383-7390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed to investigate the effect of EDTA on the formation of each FIL-DNA complex (Fig. 5). The proportion of the FIL-(6–229)-DNA complex fraction decreased from 62 to 30% as the concentration of EDTA was increased (Fig. 5, a and b). The decrease of the proportion of the FIL-(65–229)-DNA complex fraction under the same conditions was significantly less (from 75 to 67%; Fig. 5, a and b), and that of the C56A-DNA complex fraction from 74 to 66% (Fig. 5, a and b). The results (Fig. 5) suggest that the zinc release, structural change of the zinc finger domain, and self-assembly of the protein cause FIL-(6–229) to dissociate from DNA. The DNA binding ability of the five truncated FIL proteins and the mutant fil protein C56A were compared in both the absence and presence of EDTA by estimating the concentration of protein required to shift 50% of the input DNA into slower mobility complex upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Table II). Images of the gels obtained in the gel shift assays using the six FIL proteins in both the absence and presence of EDTA are shown in Fig. 6. The proportion of the protein-DNA complex fraction was increased as the concentration of the protein was increased as shown in Fig. 6, a–f. These increases in the proportion of the FIL-(6–229)-DNA and FIL-(6–203)-DNA fractions were reduced when EDTA was present in the reaction mixture as shown in Fig. 6, a and b. While, the effect of EDTA seems to be small in the rest of four FIL-DNA complexes as shown in Fig. 6, c–f.Table IIDNA binding properties of the FIL proteins in vitroProteinApparent KD for 52-bp DNAWithout EDTAWith 10 mm EDTAμmFIL-(6–229)7.9 ± 0.912.8 ± 2.1FIL-(65–229)5.0 ± 0.55.8 ± 0.8FIL-(120–229)4.4 ± 1.05.4 ± 1.3FIL-(6–203)13.0 ± 3.036.0 ± 5.5FIL-(6–183)17.2 ± 2.728.1 ± 4.2C56A8.5 ± 0.49.4 ± 0.3Affinity measurements were performed as described in the legends for Figs. 6 and 7.

Open table in a new tab Affinity measurements were performed as described in the legends for Figs. 6 and 7. Apparent dissociation constants (KD) were obtained by fitting the data to a linear function by Kaleidagraph 3.0 (Abelbeck Software). The measurements were repeated at least three times for each protein and the values summarized here represent the averages. Standard error values are those estimated by Kaleidagraph. Typical reciprocal plots are shown in Fig. 7 to illustrate the affinities of the 52-bp DNA for the six FIL proteins in both the absence and presence of EDTA. In the plots for FIL-(6–229) and FIL-(6–203), differences were observed between the value of the × intercept in the absence of EDTA and that in the presence of EDTA as shown in Fig. 7, a and b. While, the differences between these values were small in the plots for FIL-(65–229), FIL-(120–229), and C56A as shown in Fig. 7, d–f. The measurements were repeated at least three times for each protein, and the values summarized in Table II represent the averages. When the apparent KD values in the presence of EDTA were compared with those in the absence of EDTA, FIL-(6–229) displayed a 1.6-fold reduction, FIL-(6–203) displayed 2.8-fold reduction, and FIL-(6–183) displayed a 1.6-fold reduction in the DNA binding. While FIL-(65–229), FIL-(120–229), and C56A displayed an about 1.2-fold reduction in DNA binding (Table II). That the effect of EDTA on DNA binding was larger in FIL-(6–229), FIL-(6–203), and FIL-(6–183) than that in the DNA binding by FIL-(65–229) and FIL-(120–229), implies that EDTA affects on the DNA binding by the FIL proteins carrying the zinc finger domain may occur through enhancement of the zinc release. Consistent with this the effect of EDTA on the DNA binding by C56A was smaller than that by FIL-(6–229) (Table II), suggesting that the decrease of the zinc release in the C56A protein by the substitution of the cysteine residue at position 56 to alanine, suppressed the reduction in DNA binding caused by loss of the zinc ion and the self-assembly of the protein caused by EDTA. As summarized in Table II, the apparent KD value for FIL-(120–229) (4.4 μm) is smallest and similar to that for FIL-(65–229) (5.0 μm). While, the apparent KD value for FIL-(6–229) (7.9 μm) suggests 1.6-fold less DNA binding compared with FIL-(65–229). The apparent KD value for FIL-(6–203) (13.0 μm) suggests that 1.6-fold less DNA binding by FIL-(6–203) compared with FIL-(6–229) (7.9 μm). These results suggest that the zinc finger domain seems to reduce the DNA binding ability of the HMG box-like domain of the FIL protein, while, the COOH-terminal region between positions 203 and 229 containing putative helix 5 (Fig. 1b) is not indispensable but contains an important enhancer of DNA binding by the FIL protein. The synergistic inflorescence phenotype of the fil ap1 double mutated plant as compared with the wild-type suggested that the FIL and AP1 proteins might interact in vivo to promote formation of floral meristems (23.Sawa S. Ito T. Shimura Y. Okada K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We investigated a possible DNA binding interaction between FIL and AP1 proteins using DNA which has a target sequence of the AP1 protein, CArG box.

Gott J.M. Hanson M.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1105-1123PubMed Google Scholar). Editing of coding sequences or RNA splice sites can alter the primary sequence of a protein, often with profound physiological consequences. Adenosine deamination is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as ADARs (adenosinedeaminases active on RNA) that recognize select adenosines within double-stranded regions of substrate mRNAs and convert them to inosine (2.Gerber A.P. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 376-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Editing of cytidine by deamination is catalyzed by enzymes known as CDARs (cytidine deaminases active on RNA) and results in a change to uridine. Of the many CDAR-like proteins reported (reviewed in Ref. 2.Gerber A.P. Keller W. Trends Biochem.

Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) are known to edit mRNA. The best characterized enzyme, APOBEC-1, catalyzes the deamination of nucleotide C6666 of apolipoprotein B mRNA, resulting in a codon change from glutamine to STOP (5.Chen S.H. Habib G. Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Lee B.R. Weng S.A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M. Gotto M. Li W.-H. Chan L. Science. 1987; 238: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Thus, apoB1expression generates mRNAs that encode either apoB100 (unedited) or apoB48 (edited) protein isoforms (5.Chen S.H. Habib G. Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Lee B.R. Weng S.A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.J.

Although apoB100 and apoB48 have similar lipid carrying capacities in blood, apoB48 containing lipoprotein particles are cleared more rapidly from the circulation and do not associate with the lipoprotein (Lp(a)). Hence, elevated levels of apoB48 containing lipoproteins reduce atherogenic risk (6.Teng B. Blumenthal S. Forte T. Navaratnam N. Scott J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Chan L. J. Biol.

The role of ASP in apoB mRNA editing had not been determined, nor was it known how these virtually identical proteins were encoded. We show that human ACF64 and ACF65mRNAs are encoded by the same gene through alternative splicing of exon 12 and that their protein products support equivalent levels of editing in cells. A promoter region was identified immediately upstream of exon 1, and several ESTs were identified that suggested that the ACF transcript may be subject to further alternative and nonexclusive alternative splicing events. cDNA sequences for ACF64 (AF209192) and ACF65 (AJ272079) were aligned to the Celera (www.celera.com) human genomic data base by BLAST analysis and identified an incomplete 53-kb contig on chromosome 10 (identification number hCT18761). This contig was used to perform a BLAST search of the Public Chromosome 10 data base (www.sanger.ac.uk) and identified the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) bA449016, which contains the entire ACF64/ACF65 cDNA sequence. Sequence data reported in this manuscript were produced by the Chromosome 10 Sequencing Group at the Sanger Center (ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/human/sequences/Chr_10/unfinished_sequence/bA449016). Restriction enzyme-digested human genomic DNA was resolved through 1% agarose and transferred to a nylon membrane (Stratagene). Probes for exons 11 and 12 were generated by PCR and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the RTS RadPrime system (Invitrogen). The blots were hybridized to probe in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) at 60 °C, washed, and autoradiographed. Cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained as recommended. Primary hepatocytes were obtained from Dr. S. Strom (University of Pittsburgh). The transfections were performed using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the total cellular RNA was isolated as previously described (20.Sowden M. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C.

RNA. 1996; 2: 274-288PubMed Google Scholar) and HSACF64/ACF65–5′ and HSACF64/ACF65–3′ to amplify exons 11 and 12. Exons 8–10 were amplified with E4Δ5E6 and HindIII5′. ΔE5 was specific for the exon 8/10 junction, and ACF65WT was specific for the inserted 24 nucleotides in ACF65. ACF mRNA sequences were analyzed for high score SR protein motifs (21.Liu H.X.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) using curated data sets for the score matrices. Only scores above the following thresholds are considered to have potential for exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) function: SF2/ASF-1.956, SC35–2.383, SRp40–2.670, and SRp55–2.676 (see Fig. 6). A reporter minigene construct containing a 2.3-kb PCR product encompassing exons 11 and 12, and the intron was amplified from the BAC clone (bA449016) and subcloned into pcDNAIII V5-His (Invitrogen). To ensure detection of the ACF64/65 spliced variant mRNAs encoded by the transfected minigene, an ACF-specific and a vector-specific primer (T7) were used in the PCR. Expression plasmids for SR proteins have been described (23.Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). ApoB RNA editing efficiency was determined upon RT-PCR-amplified human apoB reporter RNA transcripts by poisoned primer extension analysis (24.Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An ACF64 cDNA was PCR-amplified from a rat liver cDNA library (Stratagene) and subcloned into p cDNAIII-V5 (Invitrogen). ACF65 cDNA was derived from ACF64 by run-around PCR (25.Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A 1.8-kb PCR-amplified human genomic DNA fragment containing exon 1 as well as promoter subfragments were subcloned into p GL3Basic (Promega). The cells were transfected in triplicate in 24-well cluster dishes with 0.5 μg of reporter DNA and 0.2 ng of DNA encoding Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV; Promega) as a transfection control and harvested after 48 h. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). BLAST analyses using cDNAs for ACF64 (AF209192) and ACF65 (AJ272079) of the public and private genomic data bases were performed. The Celera data base contained a 53-kb aligned contig (identification number hCT18761) that mapped to chromosome 10, position 10q11.21 at 47.76–47.85 m but that lacked 135 nucleotides of cDNA sequence. BLAST analysis of the Sanger Center's unpublished chromosome 10 data base with this contig identified a single BAC clone (bA449016) that mapped to the identical region but contained all ACF64 and ACF65 cDNA sequences. The exon/intron structure of the ACF gene was determined by pairwise BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) of bA449016 sequence with ACF64/ACF65 cDNA sequences. The ACF gene spans 82 kb and comprises 15 exons (Fig. 1) ranging from 45 to 274 bp (Table I). The introns range from 997 bp to 21.4 kb, and all splice junctions follow the consensus GT-AG motif. The currently described functional domains of ACF are present in separate exons (Table I). ACF65 cDNA differs from ACF64 by insertion of 24 nucleotides at position 1140 with respect to the start codon (9.Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19848-19856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Significantly, this insertion is identical to the 3′ 24 nucleotides of intron 11, suggesting that ACF65 and ACF64 are alternatively spliced variants of exon 12 (Fig. 1).Table IGene structure of ACFIntron 3′ sequenceExon terminiIntron 5′ sequence and size (bp)Exon number and size (bp)Codon at splice junctionProtein domainATAATCA- ∼ -TACTCAGgtatga- 213671//475′-Untranslated regionctagATAACAG- ∼ -AAATTATgtaagt- 8202//485′-Untranslated regiontcagCATGACT- ∼ -CAAAGAGgtgtaa- 290331-aAlternatively spliced exons located in EST clones only.//935′-Untranslated regiontcagTGAGCAA- ∼ -GGTCCAGgtagga- 88664//144QNone definedaaagGAATTTT- ∼ -GGAAAAGgtaagc- 654251-aAlternatively spliced exons located in EST clones only.//143Internal STOPgcagGAAAATG- ∼ -GTGAAAAgtgagt- 19956//135KRNP2 of RRM1gcagAATCGGT- ∼ -AAATTAGgtaagc- 55497//131RRNP1 of RRM1gcagAAATGGG- ∼ -CTACCAGgttagc- 77788//239GRRM2acagGAAGAAT- ∼ -AAACCAGgtagga- 74819//165GRNP2 of RRM3acagGTGCTGT- ∼ -TGGCAAGgtaagg- 427210//98KRNP1 of RRM3acagGTGCTGG- ∼ -GTTAGAGgtaaca- 1943/196711//274GNone definedctagAAATTTA- ∼ -TCCCCAGgtaggt- 273012 ASP variant//206QASP variantgtagGGGCTGC- ∼ -TCCCCAGgtaggt- 273012 ACF variant//182QACF variantgtagATATTAG- ∼ -CTGCAATgtgcgt- 99713//137IDouble-stranded RNA bindingccagCCACCCT- ∼ -TTCCCAGgtatgg- 291814//149GNone definedccagGATATGC- ∼ -AAAAGAA15//211None definednyagG/A-Consensus-C/AAGgtragt-The exons and their sizes, coding capacity, and sequences at their 5′ and 3′ termini are listed.

Open table in a new tab The exons and their sizes, coding capacity, and sequences at their 5′ and 3′ termini are listed. Nucleotides shown in bold indicate the reading frame of each exon. An alternative origin for ACF64 and ACF65 mRNAs would be gene duplication. To investigate this possibility, human genomic DNA was analyzed by Southern blotting using diagnostic restriction sites located within intronic sequences flanking exons 11 and 12 (Fig. 2). The exon 11 probe hybridized to only the predicted 2.6-, 4.3-, and 5.5-kb restriction fragments. Similarly, the exon 12 probe, containing the additional 24 nucleotides, hybridized to only the predicted 5.1- and 4.3-kb fragments and two fragments of 2.35 and 0.8 kb. The lack of hybridization of either probe to other restriction fragments indicated that there is only one gene that encoded both ACF64 and ACF65. Moreover, searches of the public and private human genomic DNA data bases with cDNA or identified genomic sequence failed to identify other loci that encode complete cDNA sequences. Despite extensive searching of GenBank's human EST data base, no indication of the transcribed sequence upstream of exon 1 was found. To prove that the identified ACF gene is functional and not an inactive pseudogene, the upstream sequence was evaluated for promoter activity. Exon 1 and the −1.73-kb region were subcloned into the promoter assay plasmid, pGL3Basic. Promoter activity was assayed in transfected HepG2, Caco2, and HeLa cells and normalized with respect to Renilla luciferase activity. The −1.7-kb ACF gene fragment showed a 147- or 427-fold increase in luciferase expression relative to pGL3Basic control in HepG2 and Caco2 cells, respectively (Fig. 3A). There was no detectable promoter activity in HeLa cells. To further delimit where the cell type-specific promoter activity resides, deletion constructs were evaluated that contained either exon 1 through −0.33 kb or exon 1 plus the distal −1.4-kb upstream sequence but in which the exon 1-proximal −330 bp had been deleted. The −330-bp region proximal to exon 1 retained significant promoter activity in both HepG2 and Caco2 cells (Fig. 3B). However, deletion of the upstream 1.4-kb sequence resulted in a 2-fold less active promoter in Caco2 cells (180-fold induction) compared with a promoter of equivalent strength in HepG2 cells (115-fold induction). The −330-bp promoter fragment showed no activity in HeLa cells. The reverse orientation of the −330-bp or −1.4-kb fragments had barely detectable promoter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that a functional promoter is located in the −0.3-kb region that is active in liver and intestinal cell lines but not cervical carcinoma cells. Moreover, there are likely intestinal cell-specific regulatory elements in the upstream −1.4-kb fragment. Analysis of the −1.73-kb region using TESS and NSITE (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/seq-search/gene-search.html) revealed multiple potential transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 3B). Within the −330-bp promoter region, putative binding sites were identified for general, liver-specific, and hormonally induced transcription factors. Lellek et al. (9.Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19848-19856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) reported the presence of ACF64 and ACF65 in intestinal and liver cDNA libraries, respectively, whereas Mehta et al.(8.Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) identified ACF64 cDNAs from intestinal and kidney libraries. To determine whether there is tissue-specific expression of each variant in human cells, an RT-PCR strategy was employed to coamplify both mRNAs. Oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA was amplified with primers HSACF64/ACF65 5′ and HSACF64/ACF65 3′, which are located in exons 11 and 12, respectively. PCR products of 224 bp for ACF65 and 200 bp for ACF64 were detected in primary human hepatocytes, HepG2, hepatoma cells, and Caco2 intestinal cells at an approximate ratio of 4:1. (Fig. 4). These data are the first demonstration that the spliced variants are simultaneously expressed in liver and intestinal cell types. ACF64 is necessary and sufficient as an auxiliary factor for complementing APOBEC-1 to edit apoB mRNA (8.Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, the function of ACF65 has not been determined (9.Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19848-19856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The eight-amino acid insertion (EIYMNVPV) constitutes a tyrosine phosphorylation site (NETPHOS; www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/) that might alter complementation activity and/or subcellular localization of ACF65. CHO cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding epitope-tagged ACF64 or ACF65, together with APOBEC-1 and apoB mRNA expression vectors. CHO cells were selected for these analyses because they do not express detectable levels of ACF by Western blot compared with HepG2 or Caco2 cells (data not shown), nor are they capable of supporting high levels of APOBEC-1-dependent editing in the absence of exogenous ACF64 or ACF65 (4% editing; Fig. 5A). ACF64 and ACF65 increased the editing efficiency of the apoB reporter mRNA 17-fold (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, an equivalent level of promiscuous editing (Fig. 5A, bands labeled 1 and 2) was promoted by both proteins. Western blotting demonstrated that the epitope-tagged ACF64 and ACF65 were expressed at equivalent levels and that the expression of APOBEC-1 was also comparable between all transfectants (Fig. 5B). Editing efficiency is not affected by apoB mRNA abundance (20.Sowden M. Hamm J.K. Spinelli S. Smith H.C. RNA. 1996; 2: 274-288PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore the expression level of the apoB reporter RNA was not determined. The subcellular localization of epitope-tagged ACF65 was determined by immunocytochemistry in editing competent (McArdle RH7777) and incompetent (CHO) cell lines (data not shown) and showed equivalent nuclear and cytoplasmic localization to that of ACF64 (26.Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22663-22669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The SR family of proteins consists of highly conserved serine/arginine-rich RNA-binding proteins that regulate alternative splice site selection (reviewed in Ref. 27.Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis (21.Liu H.X. Chew S.L. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 22.Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) predicted several high score motifs for the SR proteins SC35, SRp40, SRp55, and SF2/ASF in exon 12 (Fig. 6A). To evaluate whether SR proteins are involved in regulating exon 12 alternative splicing, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with the exon 11–12 minigene (Fig. 6A) and an expression plasmid for each of the four SR proteins. RT-PCR was performed using primers specific for the ACF64/65 spliced variant mRNAs encoded by the transfected minigene. The PCR products differ by only 24 nucleotides; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that each mRNA was amplified with equal efficiency; hence the ratio of the two bands is a good semi-quantitative means of evaluating the level of alternative splicing within each sample (Fig. 6B). Compared with the vector control, SRp40 had the most significant effect on alternative splicing. Its expression promoted the inclusion of the 24 nucleotides at the 5′ end of exon 12. SRp55 increased the abundance of ACF65 mRNA slightly. SC35 marginally increased ACF64 mRNA. SF2/ASF had no effect on the ratio of ACF65/ACF64. SR proteins affect alternative splicing in vivoin a concentration-dependent manner (27.Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), and thus it is likely that the alteration of the ratio of endogenous SR proteins to mRNA transcript will affect the level of alternative splicing. The reduced ratio of ACF65/ACF64 mRNA expressed from the minigene construct compared with that observed on the endogenous transcript (4:1 ratio; Fig. 4) is likely due, therefore, to overexpression of the ACF reporter RNA. Recently, a deletion variant of ACF (ACFdel55) was reported (28.Chester A. Scott J. Anant S. Navaratnam N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1494: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) for which neither a function nor an origin was described. From our described exon structure ACFdel55 lacks exon 9 and therefore likely results from alternative splicing of the ACF primary transcript. To evaluate this possibility, mRNA from primary human hepatocytes, HepG2 cells, and Caco2 cells was analyzed by RT-PCR. Primers specific for exons 8 (E4Δ5E6) and 10 (ACF HindIII3′) generated a 292-bp product indicative of exon 9 inclusion and, although at much lower abundance, a product of 127 bp, the expected size for an mRNA in which exon 9 had been skipped (Fig. 7A). The size difference between the two PCR products precludes an accurate determination of their relative abundance, but it is likely that the ACFdel55variant is very poorly expressed. A primer (ΔE5) specific for the exon 8/10 junction created in ACFdel55 mRNA together with ACF65WT (specific for the alternatively spliced 24 nucleotides of exon 12) yielded a PCR product of 408 bp (Fig. 7B). The presence of another ACF variant that lacked exon 9 but included the 24 nucleotides at the 5′ end of exon 12 demonstrates that the two identified alternative splicing events of ACF RNA are not mutually exclusive. We propose that the exon 9-skipped ACF64 and ACF65 mRNAs be named ACF58 and ACF59 based upon their theoretical molecular masses. Human EST data base analyses revealed further ACF splice variants (Fig. 8). Some have an altered exon composition upstream of the ATG initiator codon in exon 4. AV655933 is a unique variant that includes an additional exon (exon 3), whereas AK000324,AV687201, AV698948, AV684607, and AV688086 all lack exon 2. The role of these alternative splicing events located in the 5′-untranslated region is unclear unless ACF translation is subject to regulation through elements contained within these exons. Variants AK000324 and AF271790include a novel exon 5, and both comprise the shorter variant of exon 12. Whether alternative splicing of these upstream exons regulates the downstream exon composition of ACF remains to be elucidated. The cloning of APOBEC-1 demonstrated that cytidine to uridine editing of apoB mRNA editing requires a cytidine deaminase whose activity on RNA depends on auxiliary protein factors (4.Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The inability of APOBEC-1 alone to edit apoB mRNA can be explained, in part, by its low affinity and nonselective binding to the editing site (29.MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consequently, multiple auxiliary proteins have been implicated in apoB mRNA editing through their ability to interact with the apoB mRNA editing site and/or APOBEC-1 and in some cases, modulate editing activity (8.Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 9.Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol.

Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).

IgA is the major class of immunoglobulin in human mucosal secretions. Two subclasses, IgA1 and IgA2, exist, and IgA2 is found in three allelic forms, A2m(1), IgA2m(2), and A2m(3), among which IgA2m(1) is expressed mainly in Caucasians (1.Mestecky J. Moro I Underdown B.J. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. Bienenstock J. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Immunology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999: 133-152Google Scholar). The IgA1 subclass is predominant in the upper respiratory tract and in serum, whereas more even proportions of IgA1 and IgA2 occur in intestinal and urogenital secretions (2.Brandzaeg P. Farstad I.N. Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. Bienenstock J. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Immunology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999: 439-468Google Scholar, 3.Kirkeby L. Rasmussen T.T.

This group of postproline endopeptidases cleaves one of several Pro-Ser or Pro-Thr peptide bonds in the hinge region of human IgA1, including its secretory form, S-IgA1, within an inserted stretch of 13 amino acid residues lacking in IgA2. IgA1 proteinase-producing species include the three leading causes of bacterial meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis, Hemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae; three commensal streptococci, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus sanguis; Gemella hemolysans; and several species of Capnocytophaga and Prevotella. In addition, the urogenital pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Ureaplasma urealyticum produce IgA1 proteinase (reviewed in Refs. 4.Plaut A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1983; 37: 603-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar and 5.Kilian M. Reinholdt J. Lomholt H. Poulsen K. Frandsen E.V.G. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1996; 104: 321-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).It is conceivable that IgA1 proteinases enable the bacterial species to escape specific immune defense on mucosal surfaces, although lack of relevant animal models has precluded definitive identification of their exact biological significance (5.Kilian M.

Notably, human IgA1 cleaving activity among these bacteria has evolved in at least three independent evolutionary lineages, emphasizing the biological importance of these enzymes. Inhibition studies and molecular characterizations have shown that the Hemophilus and Neisseria IgA1 proteinases are homologous serine-type proteinases, the streptococcal IgA1 proteinases are mutually related metalloendopeptidases, and the enzyme from Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus) is a cysteine proteinase (reviewed in Ref. 5.Kilian M.

An IgA1 proteinase of N. gonorrhoeae has been shown to cleave not only human IgA1 but also LAMP1 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) receptor II, features that may contribute to the pathogenesis of infections caused by these bacteria (6.Lin L Ayala P.

It is part of the commensal flora in the human intestine (8.Senda S. Fujiyama Y. Ushijima T. Hodohara K. Bamba T. Hosoda S. Kobayashi K. Microbiol.

Microbiol. 1995; 42: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Some strains of C. ramosum produce an IgA proteinase that cleaves human IgA1 and IgA2 allotype A2m(1) at a Pro-Val peptide bond at positions 221–222 just N-terminal to the hinge region (8.Senda S.

In IgA2m(2) and IgA2m(3), the Pro at position 221 is substituted by Arg, apparently rendering these allotypes resistant to cleavage by the IgA proteinase. Other Clostridium species may produce proteinase(s) with similar activity (13.Hashim O.H. Hassan H. Immunology. 1991; 73: 235-238PubMed Google Scholar). The C. ramosum IgA proteinase is inhibited by high concentrations of EDTA, suggesting that it is a metalloproteinase (11.Fujiyama Y. Kobayashi K. Senda S. Benno Y. Bamba T. Hosoda S. J.

Otherwise, this enzyme has not yet been characterized.Here we describe the purification, cloning, and characterization of the C. ramosum IgA proteinase. Analysis of the deduced translation product of the iga gene encoding the enzyme revealed that it is a metalloendopeptidase with a putative extended zinc-binding motif HEXX HXXXGXXD. The primary structure of the IgA proteinase shows no significant overall similarity to any other known metalloendopeptidase, including any IgA1 proteinase belonging to this class of proteolytic enzymes. Notably, however, the sequence of 30 residues around the zinc-binding motif shows up to 60% identity to the equivalent region of proteinases grouped into the family M6 of metallopeptidases, including PrtV proteinase of Vibrio cholerae and immune inhibitor A of Bacillus thuringiensis. The GC% of the iga gene is significantly higher than that reported for the C. ramosum genome, suggesting that the IgA proteinase gene was acquired recently in evolution through horizontal gene transfer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial StrainsC. ramosum strain AK183, which produces an IgA proteinase that cleaves both human IgA1 and the IgA2m(1) allotype, was obtained from Dr. Y. Fujiyama (Kyoto, Japan). Bacteria were grown anaerobically at 37 °C in 2× YT medium (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.05% sodium thioglycolate. The 2× YT medium was used because it is devoid of high molecular weight proteins that may complicate subsequent purification of the proteinase. Escherichia coli JM 109 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as host for propagation of recombinant forms of plasmid pUC19. E. coli One Shot was used for cloning derivatives of the pCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands), and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (R & D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK) was used for the expression cloning. The E. coli strains were grown in 2× YT or LB medium (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with antibiotics when appropriate.Preparation of the IgA ProteinaseThe cell-free supernatant of a 5-liter culture of C. ramosum was obtained by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added stepwise to 47% saturation, which in a pilot experiment was found to precipitate the IgA proteinase, and NaN3 was added to a final concentration of 0.05%. The precipitate formed overnight at 4 °C was collected by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C), dissolved in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2 (buffer T), dialyzed against the same buffer, and stored at −20 °C until used. The ammonium sulfate cut was further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a column (1.6 × 50 cm) of Sepharose 12 (prep grade; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer T. Eluent fractions containing the IgA proteinase were identified by the capacity to cleave human IgA1 (see below). Fractions with maximal IgA1 cleaving activity were pooled and subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer T. Protein fractions eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0–1 m) in buffer T were analyzed for IgA1 cleaving activity.IgA Proteinase Activity AssaysIgA proteinase activity was detected by its capacity to cleave purified human myeloma IgA1. Briefly, IgA proteinase test samples were incubated with myeloma IgA1 at 0.5 mg ml−1 in buffer T at 37 °C overnight, and cleavage was subsequently detected by the presence of characteristic Fc and Fd fragments as revealed by SDS-PAGE (15.Reinholdt J. Tomana M. Mortensen S.B. Kilian M. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assay was used to determine the susceptibility of the recombinant IgA proteinase to inhibition by human α2-macroglobulin and various synthetic compounds including specific inhibitors of serine peptidases (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, and Pefabloc), cysteine peptidases (E-64 and iodoacetamide), and metallopeptidases (EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, phosphoramidon, 2-(N-hydroxycarboxamido)4-methyl pentanoyl-l-Ala-Gly-NH2 (Zincov), N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Pro-Leu-Glu-hydroxamate, and p-aminobenzoyl-Gly-Pro-d-Leu-d-Ala-hydroxamic). Pefabloc was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Zincov was from Merck, 1,7-phenanthroline was from GFS Chemicals (Powell, OH), and the other compounds were from Sigma. The α2-macroglobulin was titrated on trypsin prior to use and found to be 60% active, and incubation time before adding IgA1 substrate was up to 5 h.For quantitative purposes, IgA proteinase activity was titrated using a previously described assay involving enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology (16.Reinholdt J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 191: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, serial dilutions of test sample were incubated with an equal volume of myeloma IgA1 substrate (50 μg ml−1), after which reaction mixtures were incubated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay wells precoated with antibody specific for Fcα. Subsequently, wells were incubated with enzyme-conjugated antibody to immunoglobulin light chains and developed with chromogenic substrate. In this assay, cleavage of IgA1 was reflected as a decrease in OD signal relative to the signal measured for wells receiving IgA1 incubated without protease. Based on a regression curve fitted to a plot of OD against dilution, the IgA1 proteinase titer was calculated as the sample dilution corresponding to a 50% decrease in OD.To examine the effect of reducing agents on enzyme activity, purified IgA proteinase was incubated with dithiothreitol (1 mm) or β-mercaptoethanol (1 mm) for 1 h at room temperature, and the activities of such treated proteinases were titrated along with an untreated control sample of the enzyme. To prevent interference of reducing agents with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reaction mixtures were diluted 1:15 with phosphate-buffered saline prior to analysis.To evaluate potential proteolytic activity of the IgA proteinase against other substrates, several proteins at 1 mg ml−1were incubated in a volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 24 h with an amount of the partially purified recombinant proteinase capable of cleaving completely 0.5 mg of human IgA1 within 2 h. The proteins used were human IgG, IgD, IgE, IgM, α2-macroglobulin, α1-proteinase, α1-antichymotrypsin (all from Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA) and fibrinogen, bovine albumin, carboxymethylated lysozyme, collagen type I and IV, oxidized insulin α-chain, and gelatin from Sigma. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by boiling in reducing sample buffer, and the integrity of the proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Amino Acid SequencingThe most active fractions eluted from the Mono-Q column were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE, blotted onto ProBlott membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and stained with Coomassie Blue. The band corresponding to the presumed IgA proteinase was excised, and the N-terminal sequence was determined using an ABI 477A/120A protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For generation of tryptic peptides, the band in the polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue was excised from several lanes and digested in situ as described (17.Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulu T. Wittmann-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis: Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997: 97-104Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, after washing with a mixture of ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, pieces of the gel were shrunk with acetonitrile and dried completely. A solution containing modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was allowed to soak into the gel pieces. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, generated peptides were recovered by extraction and separated by narrow bore RP-HPLC using the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). Amino acid sequencing of selected peptides was performed as described above.Southern Blot AnalysisUnless otherwise stated, the DNA manipulations were performed according to Sambrook et al.(14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Whole-cell DNA from C. ramosum was isolated, digested with Eco RI, and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot analysis including hybridization at high and low stringency as described previously (18.Poulsen K. Reinholdt J. Kilian M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As probes we used a 5.1-kb fragment of the S. sanguis strain ATCC 10556 iga gene (18.Poulsen K. Reinholdt J. Kilian M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a PCR product of genomic DNA from C. ramosum strain AK183 amplified with the primers 5′-AACGTGTTTTCGGGCAGATGA-3′ and 5′-TGATAGTCTTGCATCGCTTTC-3′, identified in the present study, using the Expand Long Template PCR System as recommended by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA probes were purified after agarose gel electrophoresis (QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and labeled with [32P]dCTP (Random Labeling Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals).Sequencing the IgA Proteinase GeneSeveral degenerate primers with sequences corresponding to reverse translation of the obtained amino acid sequences of the peptides analyzed were purchased from DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark). The primers were combined in pairs of a forward and a reverse one and used in PCRs containing 100 ng of genomic DNA and 30 pmol of each primer using Ready To Go PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subjected to the following cycling parameters for 30 cycles: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the E. coli plasmid vector pCR-TOPO using the TOPO-TA Cloning KIT (Invitrogen). For inverse PCR, the genomic DNA was digested with either MspI or EcoRI, and 50 ng of the resulting fragments was circularized in a 20-μl reaction volume (Rapid DNA Ligation Kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The self-ligated mixture was purified with Wizard Minicolumns (Promega) and used as template in the inverse PCR with primers pointing outwards using either Ready To Go PCR beads or the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the same cycling parameters as described above except that the annealing temperature was 60 °C. The inverse PCR products were cloned into E. coli plasmids pCR-TOPO or pUC19. The ExoIII/S1 Deletion Kit (MBI, Fermentas, Lithuania) was used for construction of plasmid clones with nested, unidirectional deletions for sequencing the insert of recombinant plasmids using the universal M13 primers.Plasmid DNAs for sequencing were prepared as recommended by the supplier of the sequencing kit, and PCR products were purified with Wizard Minicolumns (Promega). Individual sequence reactions on plasmid DNA were performed with the Taq DyeDeoxy-Terminator cycle sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), whereas Thermo Sequenase Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for sequencing PCR products. Sequence reactions were analyzed with an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). As sequencing primers, we used the universal M13 sequencing primers as well as oligonucleotides designed on the basis of preceding sequences. The DNA sequence was determined for both strands of the iga gene. Computer analysis of the sequences was performed with programs included in the GCG package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). BLAST and PSI-BLAST at NCBI (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) were used for data base searching.Expression of the ORF 1The abbreviations used are: ORFopen reading frameIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside 1The abbreviations used are: ORFopen reading frameIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideFor expression in E. coli of the ORF, we used the vector pGEX-5T, which is designed to express a recombinant fusion protein consisting of a histidine hexapeptide and glutathione S-transferase followed by the amino acid sequence of interest (19.Berthold H. Frorath B. Scanarini M. Abney C.C. Ernst B. Northemann W. Biotechnol. Lett. 1992; 14: 245-250Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The primers 5′-CCGATGACCATTGGATCCGCATCAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTAAAGGTCTATTCTCGAGTTATTCAGCG-3′ were used in a PCR on genomic DNA from strain AK183 to amplify a fragment encoding the presumed secreted form of the IgA proteinase, and, in addition, the primers add a BamHI and an XhoI restriction site, respectively. For the PCR, we used the Pwo polymerase as recommended by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The vector and the PCR product were digested with BamHI and XhoI, ligated, and transformed into E. coliJM109. Colonies harboring the correct recombinant plasmid, termed pGEX-5T-iga, were identified by restriction analysis of plasmid DNA. The plasmid DNA was subsequently used to transform E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS, and expression of the recombinant protein was induced in a culture with an A600 of 0.6 by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm. After an additional 4 h of growth, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, and disrupted by mild sonication. The supernatant of the lysate was tested for IgA1 cleaving activity as described above.The recombinant IgA proteinase was partially purified using affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, the E. coli cells from 3 liters of culture grown for 4 h at 25 °C after induction of expression by IPTG were suspended in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted using a French press. Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (105,000 × g for 60 min), and recombinant IgA proteinase was separated using an on-column cleavage and purification procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. Thrombin was removed using benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences).Site-directed MutagenesisThree mutants of the C. ramosum IgA proteinase, H539A, D550A, and E551A, were generated. Mutator oligonucleotide primers were designed to introduce restriction enzyme sites to facilitate subsequent screening for mutated DNA products.For the H539A mutation, the codon CAC for histidine was replaced by GCC, a codon for alanine. In addition, a silent mutation in codon Ala538 was introduced by changing GCA into GCG, creating an Eco52I restriction site, CGGCCG. Outward facing primers for the H539A mutagenesis were 5′-AACCGTGTCCAAACTCGGCCGCAAAAGTTT-3′ and 5′-TGCTCGGTCTCGGTGATGAATA-3′. For the D550A mutation, the codon GAT for aspartic acid was replaced by GCT, a codon for alanine. In addition, a silent mutation in codon Gly549 was introduced by changing GGT into GGG, creating an Eco88I restriction site, CTCGGG. Outward facing primers for the D550A mutagenesis were 5′-ATCCGTTACTGTATTCAGCCCCGAGACCGA-3′ and 5′-ATTTGCTTGACGATAAGGAACTTAA-3′. For the E551A mutation, the codon GAA for glutamic acid was replaced by GCA, a codon for alanine. This change created an Mph1103I restriction site, ATGCAT. Outward facing primers for the E551A mutagenesis were 5′-CAAATATCCGTTACTGTATGCATCACCGAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGACGATAAGGAACTTAAATCAC-3′. A 1.2-kb SalI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pGEX-5T-iga was cloned into HindIII- and SalI-digested pTZ19R, generating pSH1200. Desired mutations and restriction sites were introduced into pSH1200 by inverse PCR using Pfu polymerase as recommended by the supplier (Fermentas) and the primer pairs described above. Following temperature cycling, the PCR products were treated with DpnI restriction endonuclease to digest parental DNA template methylated by the Dam methylase. After heat inactivation of DpnI, the DNAs were used to transform E. coli JM109 supercompetent cells. The mutants were selected by restriction analysis of plasmid DNA and confirmed by sequence analysis. The 1.2-kb SalI-HindIII fragments with desired mutations were cloned into SalI- and HindIII-restricted pGEX-5T-iga. The resulting plasmids, termed pGEX-iga-H539A, pGEX-iga-D550A, and pGEX-iga-E551A, had single amino acid substitutions at amino acids His539 to Ala, Asp550 to Ala, and Glu551 to Ala, respectively. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and expression of recombinant proteins was induced as described above.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPurification, Characterization, and Amino Acid Sequence Analysis of the C. ramosum IgA ProteinaseDifferences in the proportion of secreted compared with cell-associated forms of the IgA1 proteinase produced have been observed for different species and strains of bacteria (20.Reinholdt J. Kilian M. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4452-4459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we found that in the early stationary phase the majority of the IgA1 cleaving activity in C. ramosum strain AK183 was secreted into the medium (data not shown). The C. ramosum IgA proteinase was purified from culture supernatant by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, size exclusion, and anion exchange chromatography. Eluent fractions containing the proteinase were identified by their ability to cleave human IgA1, releasing intact Fc and Fd fragments (analyzed by SDS-PAGE), and the activity in fractions was determined by titration of the ability to cleave human IgA1 (analyzed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay). The titer of IgA proteinase activity in the initial 5 liters of culture supernatant was 8, and in the peak activity fraction (0.5 ml) upon anion exchange it was 128. This modest increase in activity suggested a loss of enzyme activity during the process of purification. Because C. ramosum is a strictly anaerobic bacterium, we speculated that the enzyme might regain its activity if subjected to reducing conditions. However, we found that preincubation with neither 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol nor 1 mmdithiothreitol had any influence on its capacity to cleave human IgA1. The loss of activity during purification remains unexplained.The IgA proteinase was active at neutral pH, and it retained activity upon storage at −20 °C for several weeks. It has been previously shown that 100 mm EDTA inhibits the activity of the C. ramosum IgA proteinase (11.Fujiyama Y. Kobayashi K. Senda S. Benno Y. Bamba T. Hosoda S. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 573-576PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the IgA1 cleaving activity was completely inhibited by 0.5 mm EDTA, suggesting that the enzyme is a metalloproteinase. More detailed enzymatic characterization of the IgA proteinase activity was performed using the partially purified recombinant form of the enzyme (see below).Reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the Mono-Q fractions revealed that the intensity of a band corresponding to a protein of 130 kDa correlated with the IgA1 proteinase activity, suggesting that this band represented the IgA proteinase (Fig. 1). The 130-kDa protein as well as tryptic peptides derived from it and purified by HPLC were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The N-terminal sequence of the 130-kDa protein was determined to be A XKPDIKV XDYVKMGVYNN, while the N-terminal sequences EYGFHYFISPSD, FEDG XEIPNTAGG, and EYTGAY were obtained for three of the tryptic peptides. None of the sequences shared significant similarity to other bacterial IgA1 proteinases or to any known proteins, as revealed by searching the GenBankTMdata base.The iga Gene Sequence from C. ramosum Strain AK183Although the molecular mass and catalytic mechanism of the C. ramosumIgA proteinase was similar to that of the IgA1 proteinase from streptococcal species (18.Poulsen K. Reinholdt J. Kilian M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Gilbert J.V. Plaut A.G. Wright A. Infect.

Immun. 1996; 64: 3967-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the C. ramosum iga gene encoding the IgA proteinase showed no homology to the streptococcal iga genes. Even when using hybridization at very low stringency conditions, genomic DNA from C. ramosum strain AK183 did not hybridize with the iga gene from S. sanguis in a Southern blot analysis (data not shown). To isolate the C. ramosum iga gene, the N-terminal amino acid sequences obtained for the putative IgA proteinase and the tryptic fragments of it were used to design degenerate primers for PCR amplification of a part of the C. ramosum iga gene using genomic DNA from strain AK183 as template. Forward primer 5′-ATGGGIGTITAYAAYAAY-3′ was deduced from reverse translation of the amino acid sequence MGVYNN from the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein, and reverse primer 5′-RAARTARTGRAAICCRTAYTC-3′ was deduced from the sequence EYGFHYF obtained for one of the tryptic peptides. A single amplicon of ∼1.2 kb was produced. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined and used for design of primers for inverse PCR to obtain the complete iga gene sequence. Combined, a sequence of 4242 nucleotides was determined. To correct for errors that may occur due to imperfect fidelity of the DNA polymerases in the PCRs and which would be carried over in the cloning procedures applied in the se"

An endoplasmic reticulum-type signal sequence followed by a plastid targeting sequence are required to target proteins to the apicoplast but the pathway by which proteins are transported to the organelle is unknown. By stage regulating the expression of transgenes we show that early (0–12 h) in the parasite’s development in red cells, newly synthesized green fluorescent protein that contains the plastid targeting sequence (plastid targeting sequence-green fluorescent protein (PTS-GFP)) is recruited into the parasite’s secretory pathway. PTS-GFP in 0–12-h parasites is found released into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and in apposition with the Golgi. However, import into the apicoplast and processing to GFP does not occur until 18–36 h in development. In intermediate, 18-h parasites PTS-GFP resides in the PV. Quantitative exit of PTS-GFP from the PV and its conversion to GFP is seen at 36 h. The data suggest that: (i) import into the apicoplast is stage regulated and (ii) the PTS can signal endomembrane targeting from the PV to the apicoplast.

These features make the apicoplast a good target for chemotherapy and inhibitors. Nonphotosynthetic plastids are also present in a variety of other parasitic and non-parasitic, single cell eukaryotes (1Roos D.S. Crawford M.J. Donald R.G. Kissinger J.C. Klimczak L.J. Striepen B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Schwartzbach S.D. Osafune T. Loffelhardt W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 247-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many plastid genes have invaded the host's nuclear genome. Thus resident plastid enzymes that are nuclear-encoded proteins must be targeted to the organelle, as is seen in choloroplasts and mitochondria. Three to four membranes surround secretory plastids. Thus they are believed to have arisen by secondary endosymbiosis when a progenitor cell engulfed a eukaryotic alga (7Palmer J.D. Delwiche C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7432-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In a four-membrane structure, the outer two membranes are expected to correspond to the endovacuolar membrane of the host and the plasma membrane of the engulfed cell. Loss of either membrane or their fusion may result in a three-membrane plastid. However, even in a three-membrane organelle, nuclear-encoded proteins targeted to this compartment have to cross one additional membrane compared with a primary endosymbiont. Studies in Euglena (which contains a three-membrane plastid), indicate that the LHCPII protein and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxgenase small subunit precursor destined for the plastid, contain at their N termini an ER1-type signal immediately followed by a chloroplast-like targeting sequence (8Sulli C.

In the apicomplexan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii and P. falciparum, a bipartite N-terminal signal comprised of an ER secretory signal sequence (SS) and a plastid targeting sequence (PTS) drives quantitative targeting of a reporter-like green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the plastid (4Jomaa H.

Thus the model for plastid targeting proposes that recruitment to the secretory pathway followed by cleavage of the signal sequence leads to exposure of the PTS, which then mediates transport into the plastid. Yet it has not been possible to reliably detect PTS intermediates associated with secretory structures such as the ER-Golgi membranes. Pulse-chase and immunoelectronmicroscopy studies in Euglena, suggest that there is transport from the Golgi to the plastid (8Sulli C. Schwartzbach S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13084-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Osafune T. Schiff J.A. Hase E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 320-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, a detailed electron microscopy study shows membrane-bound ribosomes in close apposition to the plastid (14Hopkins J. Fowler R. Krishna S. Wilson I. Mitchell G. Bannister L. Protist. 1999; 150: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be direct membrane connections between the ER and the plastid. Ribosomes have also been shown to decorate the outer membrane surrounding the plastid in some chlorophyte algae (15Gibbs S.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1981; 99: 49-99Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible SS-PTS-GFP may be recruited directly across the outer plastid membrane, rather than enter the ER. If ER recruitment is the preferred mechanism, it remains unknown if the proteins move through Golgi and/or other distal secretory structures en route to the apicoplast. Since the plastid is a target for antimalarial therapy, understanding how proteins are delivered there may present insights for drug development as well as organellar biogenesis in eukaryotes. The asexual life cycle of the P. falciparum malaria parasite in red cells, has four, distinct morphological stages (Fig.1A). Infection begins when the extracellular “merozoite” stage parasite enters the red cell to become an intracellular “ring” stage parasite for the first 24 h. From 24 to 36 h, parasites mature through the “trophozoite” stage. “Schizont” stage parasites (36–48 h) undergo active mitosis and cell division. At the end of schizogony, the infected red cell ruptures to release daughter merozoites that re-infect erythrocytes and thereby maintain blood stage infection. Using a promoter that is active only in the first half of the parasite’s asexual life cycle, we created a temporal separation between the synthesis of a transgenic form of PTS-GFP in ring stage parasites (0–12 h) and its uptake and processing to mature GFP in later ring, trophozoite (18–36 h), and schizont (36–48 h) stages. Our results show that PTS-GFP transits through the PV en route to the apicoplast, implicating a function for the PTS in endocytic targeting to the apicoplast. P. falciparum 3D7 was grown in vitro under standard culture conditions (16Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar, 17Haldar K. Ferguson M.A.J. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4969-4974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pDT.Tg23, pHRPGFP, and pHRPACPGFP and transfection conditions are described (18Kadekoppala M. Kline K. Akompong T. Haldar K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2328-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Steady state cultures of transformed cells were maintained at 25 ng/ml pyrimethamine. For detection by flow cytometry, live infected red cells were washed with RPMI 1640 without phenol red and subjected to flow cytometry on a BD PharMingen FACScalibur and analyzed by CellQuest version 3.1. Cell preparations were washed three times in RPMI 1640 and then resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml, and allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (for 30 min at room temperature). For standard indirect immunofluorescence assays, cells were then fixed in 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin, blocked with 0.2% fish skin gelatin (fsk), and probed with the relevant primary antibodies (diluted 1:100 to 1:500), secondary antibodies or Fab fragment in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% fsk. For all cells, parasite nuclei (blue) were stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst for 30 min. Where indicated, live cells attached to coverslips were incubated with 0.01% saponin to permeabilize the red cell membrane, TVN and PVM, then subsequently fixed and processed under standard conditions for immunofluorescence assays. Fluorescence microscopy and digital image collection were performed on a Olympus IX inverted fluorescence microscope and a Photometrix cooled CCD camera (CH350/LCCD) driven by DeltaVision software from Applied Precision Inc. (Seattle, WA). Twenty 200-nm optical sections were taken through the depth of the cell, and DeltaVision software (softWoRx) was used to deconvolve these images and construct three-dimensional volume views. DeltaVision softWoRx uses a Constrained Iterative Deconvolution algorithm to remove out of focus blur in fluorescence optical sections and was set for a minimum of 15 iterative cycles. The optical transfer function used in deconvolution was computed from a measured point spread function which in turn was obtained by optically sectioning a fluorescent bead, for all of the available objective lenses (×40, 60, and 100). For quantitative projections, the “Additive” method of data collection was used. Here, each ray collects and sums data from all the voxels in its path and scales it down to an appropriate intensity. This data can be used for comparison of intensity in various structures within the image data. The DeltaVision work station is based on a work station originally developed by Agard and Sedat (19Hiraoka Y. Swedlow J.R. Paddy M.R. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 153-165PubMed Google Scholar) for three-dimensional multiple wavelength fluorescence microscopy for structural analysis of chromosomes, microtubules, and nuclear lamins (19Hiraoka Y. Swedlow J.R. Paddy M.R. Agard D.A. Sedat J.W. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 153-165PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission was linear over the 100-fold range of emission signal, and the fluorescence detected with the parasite as well as the red cell was well within this range. Fluorescence quantification was carried out with low magnification objective (×40 NA 1.00) as well as with ×60 NA 1.4 and ×100 NA 1.35. Data from at least 200 individual ring-, trophozoite-, and schizont-infected red cells were analyzed and polygons were drawn to delineate the sites of interest in the infected red cell. Background (or nonspecific) signal was subtracted by imaging areas that had no cells. Autofluorescence and nonspecific fluorescence levels were determined by viewing control samples (either not expressing GFP or not probed with primary or secondary antibody), obtained under the same illumination and exposure conditions. Total fluorescence intensity, areas, and pixel densities associated with the parasite and red cell were determined in 0o projections of three-dimensional volume views. To normalize for the variability in the amount of GFP and ERD2 or BiP found between two different parasites, the data were also analyzed as a fraction of the ratio of GFP and each secretory marker in the parasite. A minimum of at least 10 cells centered on a given parasite size were used to compute mean values and error bars at any given stage. These procedures were carried out essentially as described by Haldar et al. (17Haldar K. Ferguson M.A.J. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4969-4974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, highly synchronized early ring-infected red cells (at 15–20% parasitemia) were incubated (at 5 × 107 parasites/ml) with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (EasyTag EXPRE 35S35S Protein Labeling Mix, from PerkinElmer Life Science containing 75% methionine and 25% cysteine) at a final concentration of 50 μCi/ml, in methionine-free RPMI in the absence of human serum, for 1 h. Metabolic labeling of trophozoite stage parasites was conducted at 350 μCi/ml as indicated in the text. Cells were chilled to 4 °C on ice, washed free of excess label in complete RPMI containing 5 mg/ml cold methionine. Where indicated, cells were chased for 24 h in complete RPMI 1640 containing 10% human serum under standard conditions of culture in the presence of 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (20Crary J.L. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or no additive, and then subjected to biochemical or immunolocalization studies. To permeabilize the red cell membrane, TVN and PVM, cells were treated with 10 volumes of 0.01% saponin in RPMI 1640 on ice for 30 min (20Crary J.L. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lysates were subject to centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant fractions were subjected to a second round of centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The final supernatant and pellet fractions of 5 × 106 parasite cell equivalents were subjected to Western blots to examine the distribution of the ER marker PfBiP. The fractions were also assayed for the parasite cytosolic enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) by measuring the change inA340 induced by conversion of NADPH to NADP+ (21Vander Jagt D.L. Intress C. Heidrich J.E. Mrema J.E. Rieckmann K.H. Heidrich H.G. J. Parasitol. 1982; 68: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Due to the presence of hemoglobin, a maximum of 5 × 106 cell equivalents of supernatant can be tested in a 1-ml incubation containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm α-ketoglutarate, and 0.1 mm NADPH. 5 × 106 equivalents of each fraction solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer were tested for GDH activity and expressed as arbitrary units/min/5 × 106 parasites. Final concentration of detergent in the incubations were not allowed to exceed 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.005% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.01% SDS. Standard curves were established using 0.05 units of commercially available glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma) and were shown not to be inhibited by the presence of either 0.01% saponin or 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.005% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.01% SDS, introduced by adding the indicated supernatant or pellet extracts. Trophozoite stage parasites contain 2-fold higher levels of GDH compared with rings. Extracts for immunoprecipitations were prepared by adjusting lysates at a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline and protease inhibitors (1 Roche Molecular Biochemicals “complete mini” tablet per 50 ml). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × gand supernatants were used to carry out the immunoprecipitations as follows. Lysates (containing parasite cell equivalents of 5 × 107) were diluted 1:10 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml BSA, anti-GFP, (2 μl of CLONTECH number 8372-2 for each 500-μl incubation) and incubated at room temperature (22 °C) for 60 min with shaking. Protein G-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnologies; 50 μl of a 50% suspension) was subsequently added and the incubation was maintained for a subsequent 60 min at room temperature. Samples were chilled and the beads were collected by centrifugation of samples in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 60 s. The supernatant was removed and the beads were subsequently washed twice in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml BSA, followed by another two washes with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. The beads were subsequently incubated with 50 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 10 min. The released proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. To analyze the total levels of PTS-GFP and GFP detected at the end of the ring and trophozoite stages, synchronized cultures were harvested at the late-ring stage (18 h) and late-trophozoite stage (36 h), treated with saponin as indicated above, and then 5 × 106 parasite equivalents of supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to Western blots using anti-GFP antibodies. Due to the presence of hemoglobin, a maximum of 5.0 × 106 cell equivalents of supernatant can be loaded in a single gel lane. Densitometric scans were obtained using a UMAX ASTRA 1200 U machine with scanner control program UMAX ULTRASCAN 3.5.4, and the bands were quantitated using IMAGE QUANT MAC version 1.2 (Molecular Dynamics). An average of three, scanned data sets were used for each quantitation. Synchronized P. falciparum (3D7 and ACPGFP) infected erythrocytes were fixed for 30 min at 0 °C with 2% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Fixed samples were washed, dehydrated, and embedded in LR White resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) as described (22Atkinson C.T. Aikawa M. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 351-368PubMed Google Scholar). Thin sections were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBTM). Grids were then incubated with Living Colors A.v. monoclonal antibody (JL-8, CLONTECH, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) diluted 1:40 in PBTM for 2 h at room temperature. Negative controls included normal mouse serum and PBTM applied as the primary antibody. After washing, grids were incubated for 1 h in 15-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBTB), rinsed with PBTB, and fixed with glutaraldehyde to stabilize the gold particles. Samples were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then examined in a Zeiss CEM902 electron microscope. We have shown recently that co-transfection of a P. falciparum line with two plasmids, one expressing a green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter and the other expressing a drug resistance marker (Tgdhfr-ts M23), allowed selection of a population in which about ∼30% of the parasites produce GFP (23Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P. Ji D. Catron D. Deitsch K. Wellems T.E. Seifert H.S. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), due to recombination of transfected plasmids into chimeric episomes that can be maintained under drug pressure. We placed the SS-PTS ofPfacp at the N terminus of GFP in the pHRPGFP plasmid under the control of the 5′hrp3 untranslated region generating the plasmid pHRPACPGFP (23Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P. Ji D. Catron D. Deitsch K. Wellems T.E. Seifert H.S. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This was then used with pDT.Tg23 at a ratio of 1:1 in a standard co-transfection assay (Ref. 23Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P. Ji D. Catron D. Deitsch K. Wellems T.E. Seifert H.S. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and Fig.1B). As for cytosolic GFP, within 7–14 days, ∼25% of pyrimethamine-resistant parasites were found to express GFP in continuous culture (for over 16 weeks). GFP-expressing cells were sorted by flow cytometery and cultures containing 90% fluorescent cells were maintained for long-termin vitro growth (23Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P. Ji D. Catron D. Deitsch K. Wellems T.E. Seifert H.S. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Episomal copy numbers of 1–2 per infected red cell was maintained by using the minimum drug concentration required to retain the exogenous plasmid (23Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P. Ji D. Catron D. Deitsch K. Wellems T.E. Seifert H.S. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). There was no detectable growth defect relative to transformants expressing cytosolic GFP (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1C, i, in early trophozoites (∼24 h), co-transfectants with pHRPGFP show a cytosolic fluorescence, while those with pHRPACPGFP display green fluorescence (Fig.1C, iii and iv) at a single perinuclear region (Fig. 1C, iii andiv). This co-localized with extrachromosomal DNA (Fig.1C, ii and iv), consistent with GFP being delivered to the plastid (24Wilson R. Williamson D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Development of transformed parasites through the schizont stage results in segmenters where every nucleus in a daughter merozoite has an associated green plastid (Fig.1D). Western blots of the transformed parasites confirmed the presence of 32- and 27-kDa bands that co-migrate with PTS-GFP and GFP, respectively (Fig. 1E). This suggests that the chimeric precursor is correctly delivered to the apicoplast and proteolytically processed there, consistent with a requirement for the PTS to target a protein to the apicoplast. Immunoelectron microscopy (Fig.1F) localized apicoplast-targeted GFP to a perinuclear structure surrounded by three membrane (indicated by red arrows), in P. falciparum-infected red cells. Hopkinset al. (14Hopkins J. Fowler R. Krishna S. Wilson I. Mitchell G. Bannister L. Protist. 1999; 150: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have shown by transmission electron microscopy that the P. falciparum plastid has three membranes. The primary difficulty in detecting the movement of secretory precursors in subcellular organelles en route to the apicoplast was thought to be due to the fact that biosynthetic transport was rapid and thus the intermediates of transport were difficult to capture (11Waller R.F. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in attempting to uncouple the synthesis of the precursors from apicoplast import. In previous studies we have shown that transgenes returned to the chromosome and regulated by 5′hrp3 are actively transcribed only in the early ring stages (18Kadekoppala M. Kline K. Akompong T. Haldar K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2328-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 2M. Kadekoppala and K. Haldar, unpublished data. Since transcription and translation appear to be linked in Plasmodium, the use of 5′hrp3 to drive SS-PTS-GFP expression offered the possibility of restricting the synthesis of the precursor form to ring stage parasites. This would effectively uncouple the synthesis of the precursor from its active import at the trophozoite stage. To determine the activity of the hrp3 promoter in the ACPGFP co-transformed line during blood stage development, we synchronized the parent and transformed cell lines and probed Northern blots containing RNA isolated from young ring (6–12 h) and trophozoite (24–36 h) parasites for transcripts of the transgene. As shown in Fig.2A, only rings from the transformed line contained significant amounts of RNA. We estimate that the rings contain at least 100-fold more SS-PTS-GFP transcript relative to trophozoite stages, confirming that 5′hrp3 expression is ring stage specific. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine-labeled protein (see “Experimental Procedures”) synthesized over 60 min confirmed that a 32-kDa protein that migrated as PTS-GFP was actively produced in ring stages, but was not processed to mature GFP at this stage (Fig. 2B). In contrast, low levels of both newly synthesized precursor and product (marked by asterisks) were detected at the trophozoite stage. Estimates based on densitometric analyses (see “Experimental Procedures”) suggested that PTS-GFP synthesis in rings is at least 10-fold greater than in trophozoites. When metabolically labeled 6–12 h ring stage parasites were chased into the (36 h) trophozoite stage (Fig. 2C), PTS-GFP was processed and a band corresponding to mature GFP was detected. The lack of processing of PTS-GFP to GFP in early ring stage parasites suggested that either the precursor was not imported into the plastid or that the protease responsible for PTS cleavage within the apicoplast was inactive at this stage of growth. However, PTS-GFP made in ring stage parasites can be processed to mature GFP in trophozoites, suggesting that the deficient, plastid-linked function is gained at a later stage of asexual development. This apparent stage-specific processing of PTS-GFP is not due to the absence of the apicoplast in early asexual stages of P. falciparum. The apicoplast 35-kb circular genome is an endogenous marker of the organelle and is visible by staining with Hoechst, in early or late ring and trophozoite stages ofPlasmodium (Fig. 2D) (24Wilson R. Williamson D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), as well as inToxoplasma (4Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M.

Science. 1997; 275: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs ofP. falciparum also confirm the presence of the apicoplast in early rings (Fig. 2E) (14Hopkins J. Fowler R. Krishna S. Wilson I. Mitchell G. Bannister L. Protist. 1999; 150: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) as well as later stages of growth (Ref. 14Hopkins J. Fowler R. Krishna S. Wilson I. Mitchell G. Bannister L. Protist. 1999; 150: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, and data not shown). We were interested in determining whether the stage-dependent processing of PTS-GFP to GFP, seen in Fig.2, reflected stage-dependent localization of green fluorescence to the plastid. As shown in Fig.3A, i–iii, PTS-GFP (green) and the ER marker PfBiP (red) both displayed peripheral and internal, perinuclear fluorescence, but there was little overlap between red and green signals (shown asyellow in Fig. 3A, iii). At the trophozoite stage (Fig. 3B, i–iii) when PTS-GFP was processed to GFP, green fluorescence concentrated at a single, perinuclear apicoplast distinct from the ER (shown in red). Control experiments indicated that the expression of the transgenedid not alter the organization of PfBiP or other secretory markers at any stage of asexual parasite development (not shown). These data suggested that the stage-specific, biosynthetic processing of PTS-GFP to GFP shown in Fig. 2, correlates with the delivery of green fluorescence to the apicoplast. As indicated in Fig. 3A, iii, PTS-GFP in rings did not show significant overlap with the resident ER marker PfBiP. Nonetheless, its tubular dis"

A recombinant protein termed EtsΔ138, which comprises of residues 1–138 of the transcription factor Ets-1 is an excellent substrate of ERK2 (Waas W. F., and Dalby, K. N. (2001)Protein Exp. Purif. 23, 191–197). The kinetic mechanism of ERK2 was examined, with excess magnesium, by initial velocity measurements, both in the absence and presence of products at 27 °C, pH 7.5, and ionic strength 0.1 m (KCl). The velocity data are consistent with a steady-state random-ordered ternary complex mechanism, where both substrates have unhindered access to binding sites on the enzyme. The mechanism and magnitude of product inhibition by monophosphorylated EtsΔ138 is consistent with, but does not prove, the notion that ERK2 forms a discrete interaction with EtsΔ138 in the absence of active site interactions, and that this “docking complex” facilitates intramolecular phosphorylation of the substrate. The approximation of the steady-state data to a rapid equilibrium model strongly suggests that the formation of ERK2·Ets138 complexes are transient in nature with dissociation constants of greater magnitude than the catalytic constant, of kcat = 17 s−1.

Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also activated, albeit more weakly, by a diverse range of general and cell type-specific stimuli, such as cell stresses, various cytokines, and insulin (1.Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK2 is some 85% identical in sequence (44 kDa) to ERK1 (2.Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar), which displays a similar profile of activation, activity, and expression. Both are associated with a myriad of biological processes, which include exit of cells from G0into the G1 stage of the cell cycle, proliferation, mammalian synaptic plasticity and learning, glycogen metabolism, and many events that are often specific to certain tissues (3.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). ERK2 is activated through a protein kinase cascade termed the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, usually by Ras, a small guanine nucleotide-binding protein that transduces extracellular signals to the cell nucleus. Mutations in the ras oncogene family are commonly found in both human and animal cancers and in particular tumors of the lung, thyroid, pancreas, colon, and some leukemias (4.Hernandez-Alcoceba R. del Peso L. Lacal J.C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When unregulated, Ras signaling can lead to the development of both primary tumors and metastases through the sustained action of downstream effectors such as ERK2. Events leading to the activation of the ERKs appear to be highly orchestrated, but while many proteins have been shown to interact with the major protagonists of the MAPK pathway the precise functions of protein-protein interactions within it are poorly understood (5.Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Defining and understanding protein-protein interactions mediated by MAP kinases has far reaching consequences for both the design of inhibitors and for the understanding of their catalytic mechanism and regulation. While many protein-protein interactions cover large surface areas, making 10–40 contacts throughout the interface of a complex (6.McCoy A.J. Chandana Epa V. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 570-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), protein recognition by signaling proteins is often modular in nature, where short strings (usually less than 10) of amino acids are recognized by specific domains. In this respect MAP kinases appear to be no different and in recent years several laboratories have identified MAP kinase-interacting sequences within cellular proteins that mediate their binding to cognate MAP kinases (7.Sharrocks A.D.

Kornfeld's recent classification places the known domains into two main categories termed the DEJL domain (docking site for ERK and JNK, LXL) (which has the consensus sequence; K/R-X-X/K/R-K/R-X(1–4)-L/I-X-L/I or K/R-K/R-K/R-X(1–5)-L/I-X-L/I) and the DEF domain (docking site for ERK, F XFP ) (which has the consensus sequence; F XFP) (14.Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Like all MAP kinases ERK2 catalyzes the transfer of the γ−phosphate of adenosine triphosphate to serine or threonine residues that precede proline (15.Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). While this specificity is critical, further specificity is thought to be conferred through substrate docking domains, such as the DEJL domain, where interactions are made between ERK2 and the substrate at sites on the enzyme that can lie a considerable distance (>30 Å) from the active site (10.Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Although progress in identifying these sequences and demonstrating their involvement in mediating specificity (17.Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Zoltoski A.J. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31588-31593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has advanced our knowledge considerably, precisely how they contribute to regulation and catalysis is still unclear. Recently, following work from Karin's group (9.Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) on JNK (Jun N-terminal protein kinases), Yang et al. (18.Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) proposed a “targeting” model for the phosphorylation of the etsdomain transcription factor Elk-1 by ERK2, where ERK2 is proposed to target Elk-1 by binding to the DEJL domain, to form a “docking” complex (labeled as D in scheme 1A), which is an intermediate in the catalytic mechanism. The essential points of this model are: that interactions between ERK2 and Elk-1, within a docking complex, are mediated exclusively by interactions that lie outside of the active site of ERK2 and that second, a docking complex is sufficiently long-lived to promote the “processive” phosphorylation of Elk-1 at multiple residues. While attractive as a possible means to facilitate efficient signal transduction, the processive mechanism of Scheme FS1A is not supported by kinetic evidence for the related enzyme p38 MAPKα, which phosphorylates Thr69 and Thr71 of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) in a distributive manner (see Scheme FS1B) (19.Waas W.F. Lo H-H. Dalby K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5676-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, because the kinetic mechanism of ERK2 has not been tested a processive mechanism remains a possibility for ERK2. To critically investigate the targeting model and the role of a docking domain in mediating protein-protein interactions with ERK2 during substrate turnover, we developed a kinetic assay for ERK2 using EtsΔ138 a protein substrate that contains several putative DEJL domains such as the sequence, 15KTEKVDLEL23near its N terminus. In the presence of excess magnesium at pH 7.5, ERK2 catalyzes the reaction shown in Scheme FS2. The mechanism of this ERK2 reaction was examined by initial velocity measurements in the absence and presence of products. This study defines, for the first time, the basic steady-state kinetic mechanism for ERK2 using a model protein substrate that contains a putative ERK2 docking domain. The velocity data are consistent with a steady-state random-ordered ternary complex mechanism, where both substrates have unhindered access to binding sites on the enzyme and support a transient docking mechanism shown in Scheme FS3 (upper pathway). To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a mechanism for a mitogen-activated protein kinase.Figure FS3Transient docking model (upper pathway) or “active site first” model (lower pathway) for the phosphorylation of EtsΔ138 by ERK2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The recognition of a modular docking sequence represents an interesting, but not unique solution to the problem of multiprotein substrate recognition by enzymes. A similar strategy is thought to be used by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (20.Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and the yeast prolyl isomerase Ess 1 (21.Myers J.K. Morris D.P. Greenleaf A.L. Oas T.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8479-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), while several other signaling enzymes including cyclin-dependent protein kinases (22.Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and various protein phosphatases (23.Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) employ targeting subunits to recognize substrates. The present work lays the foundation for future structure/function studies, which will elaborate on the mechanism of ERK2 and provide an interesting comparison with other enzymes that catalyze post-translational modifications of proteins. Trizma (Tris) base was purchased from EM Industries (Gibbstown, NJ). All other buffer components and chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Qiagen Inc. (Santa Clarita, CA) supplied Ni-NTA-agarose. Protein kinase assays were conducted with Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) special quality sodium adenosine triphosphate (Na4ATP) and [γ-32P]ATP from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The following buffers were employed. The assay buffer (A1) was 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 20 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm KCl. Storage buffer (S1) was 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm dtt, 50 mmMgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Lysis buffer (L1) was 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% (by mass) Brij-30, 1% (by mass) Triton X-100, 0.75 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1mm TPCK. The Wash buffer (W1) was 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% (by mass) Brij-30, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmTPCK. The elution buffer (E1) was 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% (by mass) Brij-30, 200 mm imidazole. The HPLC buffer (H1) was 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% (by mass Brij-30, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA. The activation buffer (P1) was 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.65, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA. A DNA sequence encoding Ets-1-(1–138), which was PCR amplified from the full-length murine ets-1 cDNA cloned into PET28 (Invitrogen) was used to express EtsΔ138 as an N-terminal, hexahistidine fusion protein, containing the sequence, GSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH, immediately N -terminal to the initiating methionine, in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3 pLysS) as described previously (24.Waas W.F. Dalby K.N. Protein Exp. Purif. 2001; 23: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To generate EtsΔ138 specifically phosphorylated on Thr38 for product inhibition studies, 50 μm EtsΔ138 (13.3 mg, 750 nmol) was incubated with 5 nm ERK2 (3.2 μg, 0.075 nmol) in assay buffer A1 (15 ml) containing a large excess of ATP (2 mm). After 40 min at 27 °C the reaction was quenched on ice by the careful addition of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 40 mm. The quenched reaction was dialyzed 500-fold into HPLC buffer H1 before it was applied to a Mono-Q HR 10/10 column pre-equilibrated in buffer H1. Using a gradient of 4.2 mm min−1 NaCl, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min−1, a single protein peak (A280), corresponding to EtsΔ138 (17,757 ± 2 kDa) eluted at 0.075 m NaCl. The protein (10.6 mg, 600 nmol, 80%) was dialyzed into 2 mm DTT and stored as described previously for EtsΔ138 (24.Waas W.F. Dalby K.N. Protein Exp. Purif. 2001; 23: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Its homogeneity was verified by LC-MS (compare Fig. 1, Aand B) and SDS-PAGE (not shown). Rat ERK2 was overexpressed under the control of the T7 promoter in E. coli. BL21 (DE3 pLysS) using the NpT7–5 His6 rERK2 expression plasmid as previously described (25.Zhang F. Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The resulting protein, which contains the sequence MAHHHHHHA immediately N-terminal to the initiating methionine (Met1) was expressed as the inactive enzyme. To be active ERK2 must be phosphorylated on Thr183 and Tyr185. Cells expressing inactive ERK2 were resuspended in lysis buffer L1 and sonicated to lyse the cells. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min), before the supernatant was incubated for 50 min with gentle rocking at 4 °C with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose beads (Qiagen), that had been pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer L1 (1 ml of beads per 10 g of wet cells). The beads were then transferred to a 25-cm3column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 20 column volumes of buffer W1. His6-ERK2 was eluted from the column with 5 ml of elution buffer E1 into a tube containing EDTA and EGTA at final concentrations of 0.1 mm. Following dialysis into buffer S1 the protein was concentrated to 2 mg ml−1 using a Centricon-10 spin column, before snap freezing in liquid nitrogen and storing at −80 °C in buffer S1. To specifically phosphorylate ERK2 on Thr183 and Tyr185, a mutant of MKK1 (MKK1G7B), its cellular activator was employed. This mutant was expressed in E. coli as a hexahistidine fusion protein and purified essentially as described previously (26.Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E. Manning M.C. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15529-15536Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Buffer H1 containing 0.05 mm NaCl, was pre-equilibrated in a 27 °C water bath. Frozen stocks of 2 mg ml−1 ERK2 (10 mg, 245 nmol) and MKK1G7B (1 mg, 10.5 nmol) were thawed rapidly at 30 °C, centrifuged briefly (2 min, 13,000 rpm), and added to activation buffer P1 (35 ml) to final concentrations of 7 and 0.3 μm, respectively. After 3 h, the mixture was applied to a 1-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer H1 containing 0.05 mmNaCl. Elution of ERK2 resulted after applying 10-ml aliquots of incremental concentrations of NaCl (50 mm increments) in buffer H1 to the column. Fractions (1 ml) were analyzed for protein using the method of Bradford (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). A major protein peak (8–8.5 mg protein) eluted at 200 mm NaCl, which corresponds to ERK2. The collected fractions were diluted 5-fold and loaded onto a Mono-Q HR 10/10 column equilibrated in buffer H1 containing 0.05 mmNaCl. A linear gradient of 4.2 mm min−1 NaCl at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min−1 resolved ERK2. Fractions associated with a single peak (A280) at 0.22–0.24 m NaCl (Fig. 2A) were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C into storage buffer S1. Following dialysis, the protein was concentrated to 2 mg ml−1 with a Centricon-10 spin column, before snap freezing in liquid nitrogen and storing at −80 °C. Typically 7–8 mg (70–80%) of active ERK2 was obtained, whose homogeneity was verified by LC-MS (not shown) and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). Peptides and proteins were analyzed by LC-MS with a Finnigan-MAT LCQ (Finnigan/ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA) electrospray, ion trap mass spectrometer coupled with a Magic 2002 microbore HPLC (Michrom BioResource, Auburn, CA). A 0.5 × 50 mm MAGIC MS C18 column (5-μm particle diameter, 200 Å pore size) with mobile phase A (acetonitrile:water:acetic acid:trifluoroacetic acid; 2:98:0.1:0.02) and B (acetonitrile:water:acetic acid:trifluoroacetic acid, 10:90:0.009:0.02) was used with 50% B at a flow rate of 20 μl min−1. Protein kinase assays were conducted at 27 °C in assay buffer A1, containing 2 nm ERK2, 5–300 μmEtsΔ138, 0.02–4.3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (100–1000 cpm pmol−1), and 0.5 μg ml−1bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 50–100 μl. Reaction dependence on substrate concentration was assessed by measurement of initial rates (28.Allison R.D. Purich D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rates were measured under conditions where total product formation represented less than 10% of the initial substrate concentrations. The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min before the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP. Aliquots (5–10 μl) were taken at set time points and applied to 2 × 2-cm2 P81 cellulose paper. The papers were washed for 3 × 10 min in 50 mm phosphoric acid (H3PO4), then in acetone and dried and the amount of labeled protein determined by counting the associated counts/min on a Packard 1500 scintillation counter at a ς value of 2. The A280 1 mg ml−1 of all proteins was determined by denaturing them in 6 m guanidine chloride following the method of Gill and von Hippel (29.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Reciprocal plots of 1/v against 1/s were checked for linearity, before the data were fitted to Equation 1 using a non-linear least squares approach, assuming equal variance for velocities, using the program Kaleidagraph 3.5 (Synergy software). The intercepts kcatmS and slopes KmSapp/kcatapp obtained from these fits were then plotted against either the inhibitor concentration (i) (for inhibition experiments) or the reciprocal of the non-varied substrate concentration (1/s) (for initial velocity experiments). These plots were used to determine the appearance of the overall kinetic equation. Values for kinetic constants were then obtained using the program Scientist (Micromath) by fitting the kinetic data to the relevant overall equation. Data conforming to a sequential initial velocity pattern were fitted to Equation 2, data conforming to linear competitive inhibition were fitted to Equation 3, and data conforming to linear mixed inhibition were fitted to Equation 4.vkcatapp=sKmSapp+sEquation 1 vkcat=abKiAKmB+KmAb+KmBa+abEquation 2 vkcatapp=sKmSapp(1+i/KiCapp)+sEquation 3 vkcatapp=sKmSapp(1+i/KiCapp)+(1+i/Kiuapp)sEquation 4 The polypeptide EtsΔ138 used in this study is an excellent model substrate for studies designed to critically examine the catalytic mechanism of ERK2. From a practical perspective it offers an excellent opportunity, because it can be expressed easily, purified to homogeneity, and assayed with high accuracy. From the biological perspective it is highly relevant, because it is a good substrate, which is a minimal model of the full-length transcription factor, Ets-1, which is a member of the ETS domain transcription factor family, several members of which are substrates of ERK2 in vivo(30.Sharrocks A.D. Brown A.L. Ling Y. Yates P.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1371-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). EtsΔ138, like several other transcription factors, contains at least one sequence that conforms to the DEJL domain consensus sequence, suggesting that aside from its practical advantages it provides an opportunity to critically examine the structure and function of protein-protein docking interactions within the context of the ERK2 catalytic mechanism. Rat ERK2 was expressed as the inactive polypeptide in E. coli with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. It must be phosphorylated on both Thr183 and Tyr185 to be fully active, which is achieved by incubating the inactive enzyme with the appropriate concentration of MgATP2− and an active form of the physiological activator of ERK2, MKK1 in activation buffer P1. Separation of excess MgATP2− and other salts on a DEAE column followed by a single high-resolution Mono-Q chromatography step is sufficient to separate the activated ERK2 from the MKK1 and several minor ERK2 phosphoforms (Fig. 2A). As expected, the activated enzyme ran as a single 41.4-kDa band on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, shifted by 60 Da from the inactive form that ran at 40.8 kDa (Fig. 2B). To confirm the stoichiometry and regioselectivity of phosphorylation, the activated enzyme was analyzed by LC-MS and tryptic analysis of a 32P-labeled preparation of ERK2, respectively. 3M. Rainey, manuscript in preparation. This analysis confirmed that the ERK2 used throughout these experiments was purified to homogeneity as the bisphosphorylated Thr183, Thr185 phosphoisoform. This preparation displayed a comparable activity to a previously reported preparation isolated from cells (31.Boulton T.G. Gregory J.S. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One of the most significant results of this work is the establishment of EtsΔ138 as a substrate suitable for detailed kinetic studies of ERK2, because prior to this work no reliable substrate was available. For meaningful mechanistic investigations of protein kinases, homogeneous protein substrates that correspond to in vivo substrates of the enzymes are essential. This is particularly important in the case of the MAPKs, which bind substrates at sites outside the active site. While ERK2 does have many substrates in vivo none have been developed for mechanistic and biophysical studies for a number of reasons. Probably the major reason is that protein substrates are often difficult to isolate in a pure form in high yield, but they are also often difficult to assay and often they contain more than one phosphoacceptor site, which complicates an accurate kinetic analysis. For example, the best substrate previously available to assay ERK2 was myelin basic protein, which due to several post-translational modifications is purified with a high degree of heterogeneity (32.Beniac D.R. Luckevich M.D. Czarnota G.J. Tompkins T.A. Ridsdale R.A. Ottensmeyer F.P. Moscarello M.A. Harauz G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and which is reported to be phosphorylated on both Thr94 and Thr97 under standard assay conditions (34.Sanghera J.S. Aebersold R. Morrison H.D. Bures E.J. Pelech S.L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). EtsΔ138 is based on the N-terminal pointed domain (35.Klambt C. Development. 1993; 117: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar) of the transcription factor Ets-1, a substrate of ERK2 in vivo (30.Sharrocks A.D. Brown A.L. Ling Y. Yates P.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1371-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It was chosen because its expression and purification had been reported by Macintosh's laboratory (36.Slupsky C.M. Gentile L.N. Donaldson L.W. Mackereth C.D. Seidel J.J. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12129-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), who had also solved the NMR structure of the polypeptide phosphorylated exclusively on Thr38. The purification protocol described here utilizes an nickel affinity purification/enrichment step to separate EtsΔ138 from the majority of the proteins present in E. coli, followed by ion exchange (Mono-Q) chromatography to separate it from proteolytically degraded forms of the protein. The procedure is reproducible, offering a highly pure preparation of homogeneous EtsΔ138 (see Fig. 1A) in a yield of 60 mg liter−1, which can be stored conveniently at 2 mm in a solution of 2 mm DTT (24.Waas W.F. Dalby K.N. Protein Exp. Purif. 2001; 23: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For product inhibition studies we needed to prepare EtsΔ138 stoichiometrically phosphorylated on Thr38. Previous studies had established that EtsΔ138 phosphorylation proceeds until about 1 mol/mol of phosphate is incorporated into the protein, however, EtsΔ138 has one other site, Ser26, that can also be phosphorylated by ERK2 if incubation proceeds for an extended length of time. 4W. F. Wass and K. N. Dalby, unpublished observations. The presence of the bisphosphorylated form can be detected routinely by SDS-PAGE, because it runs slightly slower than EtsΔ138 and EtsΔ138∼P. It also elutes later than the EtsΔ138 from a Mono-Q column and can also be detected easily by LC-MS. After incubating 13.3 mg of EtsΔ138 with 3.2 μg of ERK2 for 40 min in the presence of a large excess of MgATP2−, EtsΔ138∼P was identified. Contaminating phosphoisoforms of EtsΔ138 were separated by Mono-Q chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). After purification, ∼10.6 mg of EtsΔ138∼P was obtained with a yield of about 80%, whose purity was verified by LC-MS (Fig. 1B) and SDS-PAGE (not shown). Like EtsΔ138 this could be frozen in 2 mm DTT without loss of activity. To define the basic kinetic mechanism we examined the dependence of product formation on the concentrations of each substrate by the method of initial rates (28.Allison R.D. Purich D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments established that the P81 binding assay that we employed detected 97 ± 3% of the phosphorylated protein product (EtsΔ138∼P) in the presence of up to 300 μm substrate protein, EtsΔ138, and was therefore suitable for an extensive kinetic analysis (24.Waas W.F. Dalby K.N. Protein Exp. Purif. 2001; 23: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The appearance of product with time under initial rate conditions was linear under all experimental conditions and was highly reproducible, to within 10%. Figs. 3 and4 show that double reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[EtsΔ138] or 1/[MgATP2−] are linear and display a pattern of intersecting lines below the abscissa at a common vertical coordinate. This is consistent with a sequential mechanism where both substrates react before either dissociates from the enzyme (37.Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters were obtained"
https://openalex.org/W2004218824,"Our earlier studies of rat brain phospholipase D1 (rPLD1) showed that the enzyme could be activated in cells by α subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins G13 and Gq. Recently, we showed that rPLD1 is modified by Ser/Thr phosphorylation and palmitoylation. In this study, we first investigated the roles of these post-translational modifications on the activation of rPLD1 by constitutively active Gα13Q226L and GαqQ209L. Mutations of Cys240 and Cys241 of rPLD1, which abolish both post-translational modifications, did not affect the ability of either Gα13Q226L or GαqQ209L to activate rPLD1. However, the RhoA-insensitive mutants, rPLD1(K946A,K962A) and rPLD1(K962Q), were not activated by Gα13Q226L, although these mutant enzymes responded to phorbol ester and GαqQ209L. On the contrary, the PKC-insensitive mutant rPLD1(ΔN168), which lacks the first 168 amino acids of rPLD1, responded to Gα13Q226L but not to GαqQ209L. In addition, we found that rPLD2 was strongly activated by GαqQ209L and phorbol ester. However, surprisingly, the enzymatic activity of rPLD2 was suppressed by Gα13Q226L and constitutively active V14RhoA in COS-7 cells. Abolition of the post-translational modifications of rPLD2 did not alter the effects of GαqQ209L or Gα13Q226L. The suppressive effect of Gα13Q226L on rPLD2 was reversed by dominant negative N19RhoA and the C3 exoenzyme of Clostridium botulinum, further supporting a role for RhoA. In summary, Gα13 activation of rPLD1 in COS-7 cells is mediated by Rho, while Gαq activation requires PKC. rPLD2 is activated by Gαq, but is inhibited by Gα13. Neither Ser/Thr phosphorylation nor palmitoylation is required for these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2045864586,"Metazoan iron regulatory protein 1 is a dual activity protein, being either an aconitase or a regulatory factor binding to messenger RNA involved in iron homeostasis. Sequence comparisons and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have supported a structural relationship between mitochondrial aconitase and iron regulatory protein 1. The structural properties of human recombinant iron regulatory protein 1 have been probed in the present work. Although iron-free iron regulatory protein 1 displays a significantly larger radius of gyration measured by small-angle neutron scattering than calculated for mitochondrial aconitase, binding of either the [4Fe-4S] cluster needed for aconitase activity or of a RNA substrate turns iron regulatory protein 1 into a more compact molecule. These conformational changes are associated with the gain of secondary structural elements as indicated by circular dichroism studies. They likely involve α-helices covering the substrate binding cleft of cytosolic aconitase, and they suggest an induced fit mechanism of iron-responsive element recognition. These studies refine previously proposed models of the “iron-sulfur switch” driving the biological function of human iron regulatory protein 1, and they provide a structural framework to probe the relevance of the numerous cellular molecules proposed to affect its function.

The structural properties of human recombinant iron regulatory protein 1 have been probed in the present work. Although iron-free iron regulatory protein 1 displays a significantly larger radius of gyration measured by small-angle neutron scattering than calculated for mitochondrial aconitase, binding of either the [4Fe-4S] cluster needed for aconitase activity or of a RNA substrate turns iron regulatory protein 1 into a more compact molecule. These conformational changes are associated with the gain of secondary structural elements as indicated by circular dichroism studies. They likely involve α-helices covering the substrate binding cleft of cytosolic aconitase, and they suggest an induced fit mechanism of iron-responsive element recognition. These studies refine previously proposed models of the “iron-sulfur switch” driving the biological function of human iron regulatory protein 1, and they provide a structural framework to probe the relevance of the numerous cellular molecules proposed to affect its function. Iron regulatory proteins (IRP) 1The abbreviations used are: IRPiron regulatory proteinIREiron-responsive element 1The abbreviations used are: IRPiron regulatory proteinIREiron-responsive element are cytosolic trans-regulators of metazoan cells that bind to iron-responsive elements (IRE) on the untranslated regions of some mRNA to modulate the synthesis of the encoded proteins. Iron availability affects binding of IRP to IRE; iron withdrawal by strong chelators stimulates binding to IRE on the 5′-side of ferritin mRNA and the 3′-side of transferrin receptor with a consequent decrease and increase, respectively, in the synthetic rates of these proteins. This exquisite sensitivity of IRP to iron resources makes them prominent participants of metazoan iron homeostasis, but several other conditions (such as oxidative/nitrosative stress, hypoxia, hormone or cytokine production, or toxic metals) affect IRP activity. Most molecular and cellular properties of the IRP-IRE system have been recently and abundantly reviewed (1.Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Inorg.

The switch between these two activities is driven by the assembly/destruction of a [4Fe-4S] cluster that is required for binding aconitase substrates. These two activities are mutually exclusive as demonstrated by a wealth of independent methods (7.Philpott C.C. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, IRP1 can be a cytosolic aconitase that resembles its mitochondrial homolog as well as other Fe-S isomerases (13.Hentze M.W. Argos P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1739-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14.Rouault T.A. Stout C.D. Kaptain S. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D.

Indeed, these extensive sequence alignments convincingly show that the proteins of this family must share structural similarities under their active conformations. However, the probable similar folding of mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitases has never been experimentally probed. Moreover, IRP1 is an exception among Fe-S isomerases in that its metal-depleted conformation specifically binds to an RNA target. Therefore, the relevance of the mitochondrial aconitase model (16.Robbins A.H. Stout C.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17.Lloyd S.J. Lauble H. Prasad G.S. Stout C.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2655-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for the IRE-binding IRP1 conformation is doubtful in light of the diversity of folds exhibited by RNA-binding proteins (18.Leulliot N.

To improve the relatively crude model previously proposed to describe the structural changes affecting IRP1 when switching between its two activities (1.Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 494-499Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12.Basilion J.P. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3950-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), pure human recombinant IRP1 has been studied in the present work with methods affording valuable structural information in solution. Small-angle neutron scattering experiments have been combined with circular dichroism measurements to show that metal-depleted IRP1 adjusts to its RNA substrate or its [4Fe-4S] active center by locally folding around these elements. Comparison with the mitochondrial aconitase structure suggests some regions of IRP1 that may be involved in these processes. Recombinant human IRP1 was produced and purified as previously described (24.Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Moulis J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21625-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Aconitase activity of IRP1 was measured by following the decrease of cis-aconitate absorbance at 240 nm with a Hewlett-Packard 8452 spectrophotometer in air-tight cuvettes evacuated and filled with argon (24.Brazzolotto X.

The measurement of IRE binding activities was carried out (24.Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Moulis J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21625-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with a α-[33P]UTP-labeled RNA probe corresponding to the human H-ferritin stem-loop IRE with the following sequence: GAGACCGGAAUUCCUGCUUCAA CAGUGC UUGGACGGAUCCU in which the underlined bases are involved in the stem structure and the italicized ones build the loop. The unlabeled IRE used in structural studies had the same RNA sequence. Recombinant human IRP1 was depleted of its Fe-S cluster by treatment of the protein under anaerobic conditions with 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.2 m H2O2 for 1 h at room temperature. The reactants were then separated by filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, with 1 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol. This procedure afforded a fully active IRE-binding protein with no obvious signs of amino acid modifications (not shown). It has also been found more efficient than alternative methods involving oxidation with ferricyanide described for mitochondrial aconitase (25.Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8194-8198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), high concentrations of thiols, or low and high pH (6.Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7536-7540Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For neutron scattering experiments, recombinant human IRP1 samples were dialyzed overnight in a Microdialyzer System 100 (Pierce) against the required buffer prepared with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O inside an anaerobic chamber ensuring a deoxygenated atmosphere containing less than 2 ppm O2. These samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 125,000 × g (Airfuge, Beckman) before use. Neutron scattering experiments were carried out at Institut Laue-Langevin on beam line D11. Quartz cuvettes of 1-mm (H2O) or 2-mm (samples with D2O) optical paths containing the samples were kept at 20 °C. Two sets of conditions were implemented for recording data at small scattering angles or over a wider range. Low Q data (Q = (4π/λ)sinθ; 2θ = scattering angle, λ = neutron wavelength) were obtained with a wavelength of 10 Å with the two-dimensional detector located at 4 m from the sample, whereas a wavelength of 5 Å and a sample-to-detector distance of 2 m were used at higher Q. These data were treated as described (26.Ghosh R.E. Egelhaaf S.U. Rennie A.R. A Computing Guide for Small-angle Scattering Experiments, Report ILL98GH14T. Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France1998Google Scholar), and the scattering intensities of the protein solutions were corrected for those of the empty quartz cell and the buffer. Radii of gyration were calculated from low Q data by linear regression following the Guinier relationship. ln(I)=ln(I0)−(1/3)Rg2Q2Equation 1 The distance distribution function P(R) was calculated from the scattering data as implemented in the GNOM program (27.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrman H.B. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 798-802Crossref Google Scholar) and computed in CRYSOL (28.Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2747) Google Scholar) for mitochondrial aconitase. CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter at a scanning speed of 10 nm/min with a bandwith of 4 nm and a time response of 2 s. Five to 10 scans were summed up to provide convenient signal/noise ratios. Protein solutions were prepared in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. They were contained in argon-filled quartz cuvettes of 0.1-cm optical path in a nitrogen-flushed sample holder. Protein concentrations and other conditions are indicated in the legends to figures. The homology between IRP1 (cytosolic aconitase) and mitochondrial aconitase was recognized long ago (13.Hentze M.W. Argos P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1739-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14.Rouault T.A. Stout C.D. Kaptain S. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the structure of the latter protein from pig heart has been solved by x-ray crystallography at high resolution (16.Robbins A.H. Stout C.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 17.Lloyd S.J. Lauble H. Prasad G.S. Stout C.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2655-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions using the Jpred server (29.Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar) indicate that the proportions of α-helix and β-sheet in pig aconitase (29 and 16%, respectively) agree with those deduced from the tridimensional structures of the [3Fe-4S] (Protein Data Bank code 7ACN) or [4Fe-4S] (Protein Data Bank code 8ACN) forms of the enzyme (32 and 18%, respectively). Such values are close to those obtained for the human IRP1 sequence, 29% for α-helix and 15% for β-sheet. Moreover, secondary structure elements overlap significantly between the sequences of pig mitochondrial aconitase and human IRP1 with most of the discrepancies at the N terminus. These data validate mitochondrial aconitase as a structural model of human IRP1 that has been used in the present work as a structural framework when appropriate. The CD spectrum of human recombinant IRP1 purified as the aconitase enzyme (24.Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Moulis J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21625-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1. As expected from secondary structure predictions, the CD spectrum of [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 displays the general features of α/β proteins (30.Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 69-107Crossref Google Scholar). However, the protein contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster, the CD contribution of which is expected to be weak (31.Kyritsis P. Hatzfeld O.M. Link T.A. Moulis J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15404-15411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of the inorganic moiety has been estimated under the present experimental conditions by recording CD spectra of Clostridium pasteurianum 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin extending to 185 nm (not shown). C. pasteurianum ferredoxin is devoid of significant secondary structure (32.Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Sieker L.C. Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16065-16073Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and its CD spectrum, recorded at a concentration half of that of IRP1 to equalize the cluster concentrations (the ferredoxin has two such clusters), is within the base line above 230 nm. Below 230 nm, a weak positive band around 215 nm and a negative one around 195 nm are far less intense (not shown) than the features displayed by IRP1 in this region (Fig. 1), and they are reminiscent of spectra of unordered proteins (30.Venyaminov S.Y. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Press, New York1996: 69-107Crossref Google Scholar). These weak bands may arise from the ferredoxin peptide or from its clusters, and they are of inverted differential absorbance compared with the [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 spectrum of Fig. 1. These observations emphasize the very weak contribution of the cluster to the CD spectrum of [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 that has not been corrected for the potential contribution of the cluster in this study. The [4Fe-4S] cluster of human recombinant IRP1 can be removed in vitro as described above (see “Materials and Methods”) to give the form of the protein that is competent to bind the IRE motif. The CD spectrum of this form of IRP1 is displayed in Fig. 1. Compared with the aconitase form of IRP1, the changes are not large, but they are significant as is more easily seen on the difference spectrum (Fig. 1). The general shape with a negative band peaking at 222 nm with a shoulder around 210 nm and a positive band maximal below 200 nm indicates that secondary structure elements have been lost upon removal of the cluster, α-helices giving the largest CD contribution among them. Therefore, even without the presence of substrates, the switch between the two activities of IRP1 is paralleled by a change of the structure that we probed by a complementary method. Fig. 2 compares the Guinier plots (low Q) obtained with the aconitase and IRE-binding forms of IRP1. The calculated radii of gyration for data recorded without added D2O are 32 and ∼40 Å, respectively. The latter value was deduced in the 1 < QR < 2.2 range (Table I) that somewhat extends from the Guinier approximation because signs of aggregation can be seen at very low Q (Fig. 2). In fact, the likeliness of IRP1 devoid of metals to form highly scattering particles increases with the percentage of D2O added to the sample (Fig. 2), and this effect has impeded the measurement of the radii of gyration for this form. This problem is less important with [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 for which values have been calculated for three D2O concentrations (Table I). The slight decrease of Rg from 32 to 28.7 Å as a function of D2O in the 0–100% range reflects the non-uniform scattering density of IRP1, as observed with other proteins (33.Jacrot B. Rep. Prog. Phys. 1976; 39: 911-953Crossref Scopus (638) Google Scholar).Table IRadii of gyration calculated from small angle neutron scattering dataD2O[4Fe-4S]-IRP1apo-IRP1IRP1 · IRE (1:1)%032.0 (0.5)39.7 (0.7)aCalculated value cannot be compared because of the large IRE contribution.6230.6 (0.4)bAggregated sample.35.7 (1.2)10028.7 (0.2)bAggregated sample.bAggregated sample.Values are in Å with errors in parentheses.a Calculated value cannot be compared because of the large IRE contribution.b Aggregated sample. Open table in a new tab Values are in Å with errors in parentheses. The validity of the assumption that [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 is a globular protein, by similarity with the known structure of mitochondrial aconitase, can be checked with neutron scattering data. The pair distribution function P(R) has been plotted for [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 using the data recorded at 65% D2O over a wider Q range (Fig. 3). A similar plot can be calculated from the x-ray crystal structure of pig mitochondrial aconitase (Fig. 3). This plot displays the frequency of vector lengths connecting scattering elements within the particle. For [4Fe-4S]-IRP1, the pair distribution function is relatively symmetric around a maximum below 40 Å, a feature clearly revealing a single compact particle as expected for a globular protein. The slightly non-monotonous decrease to 0 at high R values may be assigned to the minor aggregation already observed on the Guinier plots (Fig. 2) and introduce some uncertainty in the maximal dimension of [4Fe-4S]-IRP1. However, comparison of the main parts of the curves agrees with both proteins being globular and with the larger (by about 15%) size of [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 compared with mitochondrial aconitase. A radius of gyration of 25.6 Å has been calculated for the latter, as compared with 32 Å for [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 (Table I). The difference between these two values indicates that most of the insertions found in IRP1 as compared with mitochondrial aconitase lie at the surface of the protein and strongly influence its hydrodynamic properties. The [4Fe-4S] cluster-depleted recombinant human IRP1 is fully activated to bind its RNA substrate, and the structural changes induced by IRE binding on IRP1 have thus also been probed with the same methods. The CD spectrum of the RNA fragment containing the human H-ferritin IRE motif used in this work is displayed in Figs. 4 and 5. The positive band around 270 nm and the negative one around 210 nm are typical of “single strand” nucleic acids (34.Tinoco Jr., I. Bustamante C. Maestre M.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1980; 9: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). At equimolar concentrations, the CD signal intensity of the IRE probe is far smaller than that of the IRP1 protein.Figure 5Evolution of the CD spectra upon building of the IRP1· IRE complex. Top, spectra were recorded as described under “Materials and Methods” for 0.5 μmIRE (spectrum of weak intensity, solid line), 0.45 μm apoIRP1 with ∼1.5 μm IRE before (dotted line) and after (solid line) heating at 37 °C. The difference between the last two spectra is drawn in the bottom panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon addition of IRP1 at a 1:1 molar ratio, the CD spectrum displays the general shape of the sum of the individual CD contributions of IRE and IRP1 (Fig. 4). However, when the experimental spectrum of IRE is added to that of IRP1 and the result is compared with the spectrum of the mixture, subtle differences are evidenced, such as the presence of a more intense negative contribution centered at 222 nm for the IRE·IRP1 complex as compared with the sum of the individual components (Fig. 4). The dissociation constant for the IRP1·IRE complex has been estimated at a few tens of picomoles in different laboratories (e.g. Ref. 9.Butt J. Kim H.-Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which implies that the concentration of this complex is several orders of magnitude above that of the free protein in the present experimental conditions. Fig. 5 shows the CD spectrum of a mixture of IRP1 with a slight (∼3-fold) excess of IRE. When this sample was kept at 21 °C, we observed some evolution of the spectra over the time needed to record them; the (dotted) spectrum in Fig. 5 is an average taken during the first hour after mixing. The sample was then heated at 37 °C for 15 min and returned to 22 °C. The resulting spectrum was stable over several hours, and it is also shown in Fig. 5. The difference spectrum between those recorded after and before heating to 37 °C is displayed in Fig. 5. As in the case of the difference spectrum of Fig. 4, a negative band around 222 nm is associated with the formation of a stable complex between IRE and IRP1. The evolution of the spectrum during the heating step at 37 °C indicates that both components do not interact very efficiently or specifically at lower temperatures, a drawback already noticed with IRE (35.Kohler S.A. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2401-2407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The difference spectrum of Fig. 5 also displays a negative band at 270 nm at the positive maximum of IRE. Therefore, the intensity of this band decreases when IRE binds to IRP1; this most probably reflects some change of the RNA structure upon interaction with the protein (34.Tinoco Jr., I. Bustamante C. Maestre M.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1980; 9: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The variations of the difference CD spectrum below ∼210 nm are more difficult to assign as they arise from a combination of changes affecting both IRP1 and IRE. Nevertheless, the positive difference between 190 and 200 nm may be mainly associated with the negative one at 222 nm due to the protein that has a larger spectral contribution than the RNA fragment in this region. The contribution of IRE binding to the hydrodynamic properties of IRP1 has been assessed by small angle neutron scattering. The Guinier plot from data recorded without D2O is of little value for direct comparison with that obtained for the protein alone (Fig. 2) because the RNA piece significantly contributes to the scattering intensity. More readily valuable data have been obtained at 62% D2O, close to the isopycnic value of RNA, where the contrast between solvent and IRE is near 0 (33.Jacrot B. Rep. Prog. Phys. 1976; 39: 911-953Crossref Scopus (638) Google Scholar), hence canceling the contribution of the latter. Under these conditions, free IRP1 shows signs of aggregation (see above), so that the IRE·IRP1 complex has been compared with [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 only (Fig. 6). As shown above for other D2O concentrations (Fig. 2), data obtained for [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 (Fig. 6) provide a linear Guinier plot over a wide Q2 range (0.6 < RQ < 1.8). In the case of the IRE·IRP1 complex the intensities at very low Q values do not properly align indicating that there is residual aggregation, but the linear approximation is as good as that for [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 for larger Q values. Therefore, the data for [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 and IRE·IRP1 can be compared over a narrower range (0.9 < RQ < 1.8). The resulting slope of the Guinier plot for the IRP1·IRE complex is consistently larger than that of [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 (Fig. 6). Still, this difference is smaller than that measured between metal-free IRP1 and [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 in the absence of D2O (Table I). Because the variations of Rg measured for [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 are relatively minor (Table I), the large increase of this value between [4Fe-4S]-IRP1 and metal-free IRP1 (+25%) is reversed in part by the binding of IRE to the protein. CD spectroscopy and neutron scattering experiments converge in showing that the globular compact structure of human cytosolic aconitase unfolds partly upon [4Fe-4S] cluster complete removal. Both a significant increase of the radius of gyration and the loss of secondary structure elements occur. These observations agree with the structural role the cluster may play in cytosolic aconitase besides its catalytic function. By analogy with mitochondrial aconitase, cytosolic aconitase is expected to be organized in four globular domains (I–IV), each lining the active site with a 24-amino acid linker between domains III and IV. Three of the irons are bound to cysteine residues, and there is a hydrogen bond between the side chain nitrogen of an asparagine residue of domain III and one of the sulfur atoms of the cluster (16.Robbins A.H. Stout C.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, several other residues of domain I interact with molecules, such as substrates or inhibitors, bound to the cluster (17.Lloyd S.J. Lauble H. Prasad G.S. Stout C.D.

The loss of these stabilizing contributions through destruction of the cluster led to the proposal that the cytosolic aconitase structure opens, possibly via the hinge region linking domain IV to the rest of the molecule, to accommodate the large IRE substrate (1.Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 494-499Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12.Basilion J.P. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tuazon P.T. Chen O.S. Kennedy M.C. Eisenstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3950-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The increased radius of gyration estimated for IRE-binding competent IRP1 (Fig. 2, Table I) agrees with this model. However, the conformational change is not limited to a movement of domain IV around the hinge because the linker does not display large secondary structure elements in mitochondrial aconitase, except for a few turns. The decrease of CD intensity between 190 and 222 nm observed on the spectra upon converting cytosolic aconitase into IRE-binding IRP1 (Fig. 1) must involve rearrangements of at least one of the main domains of the protein with loss of α-helices or β-sheets. Likely candidates include domains I and II with helices 147–152, 166–174, and 250–263 and strand 67–73 (the amino acid numbering is that used for the mitochondrial aconitase structure) that line the substrate binding cleft and lie close to the [4Fe-4S] cluster. When the IRE substrate binds to IRP1 the radius of gyration of the protein decreases (Fig. 6, Table I) and the CD intensity in the 190–225-nm region increases (Figs. 4 and 5). However, this form of IRP1 is less compact and it displays a slightly smaller proportion of secondary structure elements than cytosolic aconitase (Fig. 1). Because IRE is a larger molecule than the aconitase substrates, IRP1 is expected to adopt a more voluminous conformation to adjust to the RNA molecule, whereas cluster-depleted IRP1 lacks some of the interactions that help stabilize a compact structure. Nevertheless, such conformational changes do not necessarily imply that secondary structure should develop upon IRE binding as detected on CD spectra (Figs. 4 and 5). IRP1 is functionally and structurally quite remote from other RNA-binding proteins. Yet, upon binding IRE, IRP1 displays some features that are reminiscent of proteins or peptides interacting with RNA, such as the domain of the HIV-1 protein Rev that increases its α-helical content when bound to its RNA substrate (36.Battiste J.L. Mao H. Rao N.S. Tan R. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Recent surveys of RNA-protein structural interactions (20.Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 21.Jones S. Daley D.T.A. Luscombe N.M. Berman H.M. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) recognized the occurrence of two main classes of RNA-binding proteins, one that binds single strand RNA on β-sheet surfaces and another that inserts a secondary structural element (helix, loop …) into an RNA helix (groove binding). Because most of the IRE sequence involved in IRP1 recognition folds as a stem-loop RNA with a bulge (37.Addess K.J. Basilion J.P. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), both types of interaction modes may be relevant for the IRE·IRP1 complex. However, from the mitochondrial aconitase structure, hardly any strand covers the active site cleft that is expected to be strongly involved in IRE recognition as indicated by site-directed mutagenesis studies, protection from proteases upon substrate binding, and cross-linking experiments (7.Philpott C.C.

It is then likely that IRP1 binding to IRE involves groove binding to the stem structures of RNA with formation of secondary structure elements. On the basis of the residues identified as important for IRE binding (9.Butt J. Kim H.-Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Genet. 1989; 5: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), these elements may organize around residues of domain I, such as those belonging to the 80–187 fragment (human IRP1 numbering). Because the loss of secondary structure in domains I and II was associated above with loss of aconitase activity, it is proposed that IRP1 unfolds locally in domains I or II by removal of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and recovers some secondary elements in domain I upon IRE binding. An alternative or addition to the latter partial recovery of secondary structure may involve fragments of domain IV (those surrounding arginines 721, 728, or 732 for example (10.Kaldy P. Menotti E. Moret R. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6073-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) that do not correctly align with mitochondrial aconitase and for which no valid structural models exist. In combination with the above conformational changes of IRP1, the structure of IRE appears to be affected by its interaction with the protein, as witnessed by the negative band at 270 nm in Fig. 5. Such behavior occurs upon formation of many RNA-protein complexes (18.Leulliot N. Varani G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 19.Williamson J.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 7: 834-837Crossref Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In this induced fit mode of recognition where both partners experience structural changes, no major conformational rearrangements are expected for IRE, but some of the most disordered bases, such as the bulge or part of the loop (37.Addess K.J. Basilion J.P. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 38.Hall K.B. Tang C.

RNA. 1997; 3: 1159-1172PubMed Google Scholar), may interact with protein residues and decrease their contribution to the CD signal at 270 nm (through base stacking for instance). The exact location of the structural elements involved in protein-RNA recognition will certainly be clarified when high resolution structural data become available, but the present work provides an unprecedented view of how IRP1 responds to substrate binding and switch of activities. The previously proposed increase of the aconitase volume to accommodate the IRE substrate (1.Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 494-499Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12.Basilion J.P. Rouault T.A. Massinople C.M. Klausner R.D. Burgess W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some structural changes including α-helices or β-sheets affect the active site, and it seems likely that a subset of these secondary structural elements is important in substrate binding. For this reason, further work aiming at probing the mechanistic details of IRP1 conversion between its different active forms will certainly benefit from the spectroscopic signatures delineated herein. The structural data obtained in this work suggest that a relatively modest perturbation, such as that afforded by phosphorylation (23.Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Tuazon P.T. Chen O.S. Kennedy M.C.

Indeed, IRP1 efficiently responds to a large variety of cellular changes, but the molecular mechanism underlying these responses seem to involve complex signaling pathways (24.Brazzolotto X.

In addition, this part of the subunit also possesses the main immunogenic region, which stimulates the production and forms the binding site for autoimmune antibodies in sera of patients with myasthenia gravis (17.Tzartos S.J.

Recently, an ACh-binding protein (AChBP) from glial cells of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis has been crystallized (28.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). The molluscan AChBP is a soluble protein with 210 amino acids, which shares structural similarities with extracellular domains of the nicotinic AChR. Notably, 23.9% of residues in the protein were found to be identical to the α7 subtype neuronal AChR (29.Smit A.B. Syed N.I. Schaap D. van Minnen J. Klumperman J. Kits K.S.

However, the AChR-binding protein has much lower sequence identity with the α subunits of Torpedo and muscle AChR. In addition, the snail protein does not possess the main immunogenic region epitope for interaction with autoimmune antibodies, and structural attributes of the α-BuTx binding site on the AChR-binding protein remain unknown.Structural analysis of AChR at atomic resolution has been hampered by an insufficient supply of native receptor proteins and the difficulty in crystallizing membrane proteins.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we have made use of the yeast Pichia pastoris to generate large quantities of α211 as a soluble protein. The yeast-produced receptor domain includes the appropriate post-translational modifications and forms high affinity complexes with α-BuTx and the monoclonal antibody mAb35. Circular dichroism (CD) and NMR measurement further suggest that the protein was properly folded and hence amenable to structural determination by x-ray diffraction and multidimensional NMR techniques.RESULTSIn previous studies we have shown that α211, the entire amino-terminal extracellular domain of mouse AChR α subunit, is secreted as a soluble protein in transfected COS cells (39.Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27575-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40.Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When the receptor domain with its native signal peptide sequence was expressed in P. pastoris, α211 protein was not detected in yeast culture medium as measured by α-125I-BuTx binding activity. Immunoblotting of cell lysates using mAb210 indicated that the native receptor signal sequence was not cleaved off, and the protein was retained intracellularly. When the native signal peptide of the receptor protein was replaced by a signal sequence from α-mating factor of S. cerevisiae, however, low levels of α211 were secreted. A further increase in the secretion of α211 protein was detected when a Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala repeat was placed between the yeast signal peptide and α211 protein (data not shown and Ref. 44.Brake A.J. Merryweather J.P. Coit D.G. Heberlein U.A. Masiarz F.R. Mullenbach G.T. Urdea M.S. Valenzuela P. Barr P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4642-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Based on these results, the signal peptide of yeast α-mating factor and a Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala repeat were employed for the expression of α211 in all experiments described below.Minimal Extracellular Domain of AChR α SubunitIn a previous study using transiently transfected COS cells, we noted that the levels of secretion of truncated extracellular fragments of AChR α subunit were affected markedly by the length of subunits expressed (39.Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27575-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As the first step toward setting up the yeast expression system, we sought to define a minimal domain of α subunit which is able to fold efficiently and give maximal secretion in P. pastoris. In one set of the experiments, we tested a series of α subunit fragments whose carboxyl-terminal sequences were truncated. Thus, the constructs α210, α209, α208, and α207 encode amino-terminal extracellular domains terminated immediately after amino acid 210, 209, 208, and 207, respectively (Fig. 1A). Pichiatransformed with each of the mutant cDNAs was grown in BMMY and induced to express the proteins with methanol. 48 h after induction, the culture medium was collected by centrifugation, and total α subunit proteins secreted were detected by immunoblotting with mAb210 and protein G-Sepharose beads (39.Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27575-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, α211 protein was produced at the highest level, whereas other shorter fragments (α210, α209 and α208, and α207) were secreted at significantly lower levels. In contrast, α fragments with part (α216) or the entire first transmembrane domain (αM1) were hardly detectable in the culture supernatant. These longer proteins are presumably retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as integral membrane proteins. In fact, we have shown in a previous study that they are resistant to extraction by alkaline buffers from transfected COS cell membrane (39.Wang Z.Z. Hardy S.F. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27575-27584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To examine whether the yeast-secreted proteins folded properly to assume a native receptor-like conformation, we measured their binding activities to α-125I-BuTx. Among all of the fragments detected in yeast medium, α211 folded most efficiently as shown by its high toxin binding activity (Fig. 1C). Our data thus suggest that α subunit sequences up to proline at position 211 are indispensable for high level expression in Pichia.In another set of experiments, we examined the expression of α211 protein with truncation of the NH2-terminal sequence. The cDNA constructs α5–211, α10–211, and α15–211 encode proteins whose N terminus starts at amino acid 5, 10, and 15, respectively. The carboxyl termini of these constructs were terminated immediately after residue 211. As shown in Fig. 1B, truncation of the first five amino-terminal residues (construct α5–211) reduced the concentration of α211 protein in the culture medium dramatically. When more residues at the amino terminus were truncated as in the case of α10–211 and α15–211, little proteins were secreted, and α-125I-BuTx binding activity was virtually undetectable in the yeast supernatant. Thus, we conclude that amino acids 1–211 in the primary sequence of α subunit constitute the minimal ligand binding domain for efficient folding and secretion in Pichia. Accordingly, the α211 construct was employed for all experiments described below.Factors That Affect the Secretion of α211 ProteinBecause a major goal of our research is to obtain protein materials sufficient for NMR measurement and for crystallization, we examined conditions that are key to high level expression of the receptor domain in Pichia. Epitope tagging by adding hexahistidine residues at the carboxyl-terminal end of α211 protein had little effect on protein yield but facilitated its purification by metal-chelating chromatography. Virtually all receptor domains in the culture supernatant bound the Ni-NTA resin, and ∼95% of proteins eluted from the column appeared to be α211 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). In contrast, adding a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) to the amino terminus of α211 resulted in a remarkable increase in protein expression (Fig. 2A). Because the FLAG sequence is rich in charged residues, it may possibly enhance the overall solubility of the extracellular domain of the α subunit and thus account for the increased secretion of α211 in Pichia. For these reasons, we have employed the α211 construct with both FLAG and hexahistidine tags (see Fig. 2A) in all of the experiments described below (Figs. 2B through Fig. 9).Figure 9NMR study of the α211 protein in solution.Panel A, a two-dimensional sensitivity-enhanced TROSY-15N-1H HSQC.Panel B, a representative plane of a TROSY three-dimensional15N-separated NOESY spectrum of α211 protein measured at 25 °C. The spectra were measured on a Bruker 800 MHz spectrometer at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml (0.32 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 50 mm sodium chloride.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A major advantage of the Pichia expression system is more than one copy of foreign genes can be integrated into the aox1 loci on chromosome DNA by homologous recombination (57.Clare J.J. Romanos M.A. Rayment F.B. Rowedder J.E. Smith M.A. Payne M.M. Sreekrishna K. Henwood C.A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We have therefore introduced tandem expression cassettes containing several copies of the FLAG/hexahistidine-tagged α211 cDNA to Pichia genome by electroporation. The effect of cDNA copy number on the level of expression is depicted in Fig. 2B. Yeast with two copies of receptor cDNA secreted highest level of α211 protein. Adding more copies of the cDNA failed to enhance the expression of α211 further. In fact, protein yields started to decrease in cells carrying more than four copies of the expression cassette.Pichia containing two copies of α211 cDNA was then fermented in batch mode (see “Experimental Procedures”), and optimal conditions for the culture were determined. In BMMY, a standard rich medium used widely for protein expression in yeast, the cells secreted ∼1.4 mg/liter α211 protein. Surprisingly, the yield of receptor protein increased to 2.1 mg/liter when the cells were grown in diluted BMMY medium (1/4 strength). Presumably the diluted medium may help to prevent overproduction and aggregation of α211 in the ER of yeast cells and hence facilitate the secretion of folded proteins. To optimize conditions for 15N and13C labeling of α211 protein, we have grown Pichia in a protein-free minimal medium (pH 6.0). As shown in Fig. 2C, little receptor protein was generated (0.2 mg/liter) because of the sluggish growth of the cells (OD ∼2.0 at 48 h). Addition of sorbitol (0.5 g/liter) to the minimal medium stimulated the growth of Pichia (OD ∼14) and boosted α211 secretion (2.4 mg/liter). For many other recombinant proteins that have been successfully expressed before, the optimal pH for culture of Pichia was found to be 6.0 (57.Clare J.J. Romanos M.A. Rayment F.B. Rowedder J.E. Smith M.A. Payne M.M. Sreekrishna K. Henwood C.A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 105: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 58.Chen Y. Krol J. Cino J. Freedman D. White C. Komives E. J. Chem. Tech. Biotechnol. 1996; 67: 143-148Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This condition, however, was not favorable for the expression of α211 presumably because it is close to the pI value (5.8) of the protein. In fact, when the culture was carried out at pH 7.0, the amount of α211 secreted into the medium increased to >3 mg/liter (Fig. 2C).Biochemical and Pharmacological Characterization of α211 ProteinBecause P. pastoris secreted very low levels of yeast proteins, α211 thus comprised the vast majority of the secretory proteins in the minimal medium, thereby simplifying the purification procedures (Fig. 3A). It was readily purified to >95% purity using metal-chelating chromatography with a Ni-NTA column (Fig. 3A). IEF electrophoresis in the Rotofor apparatus further purified the protein to homogeneity (Fig. 3,A and B). At the end of purification, ∼75% of total receptor protein in the crude medium was recovered, and the final yield of α211 was 2.3 mg/liter culture. Amino-terminal sequencing of an aliquot of the sample confirmed that complete signal peptide cleavage had occurred in the yeast (data not shown). The purified α211 showed a pI value of 5.8 on IEF (Fig. 3B) and migrated as a 31 kDa single band on SDS-PAGE (Figs. 3A and4A). Treatment with Endo H reduced the size of the protein to ∼28 kDa, indicating that it was homogeneously glycosylated (Fig. 4A). When a glycosylation-defective mutant (Asn141 → Ala) of α211 was expressed in Pichia, we could not detect any receptor proteins in the yeast culture medium, suggesting that the N-linked glycosylation is essential for folding and secretion of the receptor domain (data not shown).Figure 4Folding of the purified α211 protein.Panel A, 2 μg of purified α211 protein was digested with Endo H, separated by SDS-PAGE, and revealed by Coomassie Blue staining.

First, purified α211 bound to α-BuTx-conjugated Sepharose 4B resin in a pull-down assay (Fig. 4B). Inclusion of excess free 0.5 μm α-BuTx prevented protein binding to toxin beads, suggesting that the interaction is specific. Second, the α211 protein could be immunoprecipitated by mAb35, a mononclonal antibody against a conformation-specific epitope in the amino-terminal extracellular domain of AChR α subunit (Fig. 4B and Refs. 42.Gullick W.J.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2621-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The antagonist binding affinity of α211 was determined quantitatively in an equilibrium binding assay using α-125I-BuTx as radioligand (Fig. 5A). The binding reaction was saturable with a KD value of 1.2 ± 0.2 nm. A Scatchard plot of the data showed that the purified receptor fragment contains a single class of equivalent and independent binding site. Based on the Bmax value of the binding reaction and the binding capacity curve (Fig. 5, A and B), we estimated that more than 95% of α211 protein employed in the assays bound 125I-BuTx, suggesting a stoichiometry of 1:1 for the toxin-receptor complex.Figure 5Saturation binding of125I-α-BuTx to purified α211 protein.Panel A, 1 nm purified α211 protein was incubated with various concentrations of α-125I-BuTx for 20 h. Bound toxin was separated by precipitation with Ni-NTA beads, and the radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by competition with a 1,000-fold excess of nonlabeled α-BuTx and was subtracted from the total binding. Each data point is the mean of triplicate determinations. A Scatchard plot of the data is shown in the inset. Panel B, linear relationship of α211 protein concentration and toxin binding at saturation concentration (500 nm) of α-125I-BuTx.

To determine the kinetics of dissociation, the binding reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium (90 min), and an excess of nonlabeled 20 μm α-BuTx was then added to initiate dissociation. The dissociation kinetics was of first order, yielding the rate constant koff = 0.21 × 10−3 s−1. The dissociation constant KD calculated from the association and dissociation rates (koff/kon) is 0.2 nm. This value is close to those obtained previously with the native AChRs (59.Blanchard S.G.

In the case of IκBα, stimulation of cells with agents that activate NF-κB-dependent gene transcription results in a phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36. This phosphorylation facilitates the interaction of IκBα with β-TrCP, which triggers the formation of a ubiquitin-ligase complex responsible for adding ubiquitin groups to IκBα on specific lysine residues. The ubiquitinated form of the IκBα is then targeted to the 26 S proteosome and degraded (2.Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar).

In addition, it has been reported that the mutation of Ser177 and Ser181 to glutamic acid in rhIKK-2 homodimer results in an enzyme with dramatically enhanced, constitutive IKK-2 activity (10.Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennet B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 2: 1526-1538Crossref Google Scholar). The apparent maximal turnover kcat of rhIKK-2 (Ser177-Glu and Ser181-Glu) was ∼10-fold higher than that of rhIKK-2, whereas rhIKK-2 displays a 3–4-fold greater kcat value than rhIKK-1 (10.Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennet B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 2: 1526-1538Crossref Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of rhIKK-2 also indicates that in the presence of NF-κB, the Km value for IκBα decreases from 2.2 to 1.4 μm, and the Vmax value increases by a factor of 4, indicating that rhIKK-2 phosphorylates IκBα bound to NF-κB more efficiently then it phosphorylates free IκBα (19.Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the isolated IKK complex from mammalian cells and the rhIKKs utilize all three isoforms of IκBs, α, β and ε, as substrates equally well (22.Heilker R. Freuler F. Vanek M. Pulfer R. Kobel T. Peter J. Zerwes H. Hofstetter H. Eder J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6231-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, there are differences in the kinetic data reported for the rhIKKs and IKK complex isolated from HeLa S3 cells (9.Burke J. Miller K. Wood M. Meyers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,10.Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennet B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H.

First, a wide range of binding constant values for IκBα and ATP (KIκBα and KATP) has varied in different publications, ranging from 0.12 to 1.4 and from 0.08 to 7.3 μm, respectively (9.Burke J. Miller K. Wood M. Meyers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13.Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32655-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Second, although the two substrates each bind in a cooperative fashion for the IKK complex isolated from HeLa S3 cells (α = 0.11 (9.Burke J. Miller K. Wood M. Meyers C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), kinetic analysis using rhIKK-1 homodimer and rhIKK-2 homodimer suggests that the binding of one substrate has no effect on the affinity of the other substrate (α value = 1.0) (14.Peet G.W. Li J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32655-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus the native complex, which can contain both IKK proteins, NEMO and various substrate proteins, has different kinetic properties than those reported for the separate purified protein components. The kinetic analysis of the rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 has not been described previously. Recently, two other family members of the IKK-related kinases have been reported, namely TBK-1 (also called NAK or T2K) and IKK-i (also called IKKε) (1.Peters R.T. Maniatis T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M57-M62PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S.

TBK-1 and IKK-i are 80- and 84-kDa proteins, respectively, that showed 67% identity to each other in their kinase domains but only 50% identity over their entire sequences. When compared with IKK-1 and IKK-2, IKK-i and TBK-1 exhibited 30% identity within the kinase domains but have similar domain structures consisting of an N-terminal kinase domain as well as leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix domains in their C terminus. IKK-i and TBK-1 have unique MAPK kinase activation loops containing only one of the two phosphoacceptor serines compared with the activation loops of IKK-1 and IKK-2. The upstream kinase(s) that activate TBK-1 and IKK-i have not been identified (1.Peters R.T. Maniatis T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M57-M62PubMed Google Scholar). IKK-i was identified in data bases from sequence homology to IKK-2 and was also cloned from a subtractive hybridization screen designed to identify LPS-inducible mRNAs (25.Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26.Peters R.T. Liao S. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Unlike IKK-1 and IKK-2 which are constitutively expressed in all cell types, IKK-i is highly expressed in thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood leukocytes (25.Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26.Peters R.T. Liao S. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and can also be induced in some cell types by various agonists and cytokines including LPS, TNF-α, and interleukin 1β (26.Peters R.T. Liao S. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). As mentioned, although IKK-1 and IKK-2 phosphorylate both Ser32 and Ser36 of IκBα, IKK-i is only able to phosphorylate IκBα on Ser36 and thus alone would not be able to initiate its degradation (25.Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26.Peters R.T. Liao S. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It has been suggested recently that IKK-i activates NF-κB by phosphorylating I-TRAF/TANK, leading to the release of TRAF-2 resulting in activation of downstream targets including IKK-2 (1.Peters R.T. Maniatis T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: M57-M62PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Shimada T. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Inoue J. Tatsumi Y. Kanamaru A. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26.Peters R.T. Liao S. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The other related kinase, TBK-1, was identified by its interaction with TANK (22.Heilker R. Freuler F. Vanek M. Pulfer R. Kobel T. Peter J. Zerwes H. Hofstetter H. Eder J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6231-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TBK-1 was also identified through degenerate PCR cloning using IKK-1/IKK-2 primers. Unlike IKK-i but similar to IKK-1 and IKK-2, TBK-1 was found to be expressed ubiquitously (23.Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TBK-1 like IKK-i phosphorylates IκBα only on Ser36. However, when TBK-1 is overexpressed in mammalian cells, it is able to phosphorylate IKK-2. Thus the physiological substrate(s) of IKK-i and TBK-1 may be unique but are unclear at this time. Finally, we have demonstrated recently (42.Kishore, N., Huynh, Q. K., Mathialagan, S., Hall, T., Rouw, S., Creekly, D. P., Lange, G., Caroll, J., Reitz, B., Donnelly, A., Boddupalli, H., Combs, R. G., Kretzmer, K., and Tripp, C. S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar) that recombinant proteins of hIKK-i and hTBK-1 are enzymatically more similar to each other and distinct from rhIKK-1, rhIKK-2, and rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer in terms of Km values for both IκB peptides and proteins as well as for ATP; likewise these various IKK isoforms have very different kcatvalues with respect to the IκBα peptide as substrate. Although we have cloned, isolated, and characterized rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer (28.Huynh Q.K. Boddupalli H. Koboldt C.M. Rouw S.A. Hall T. Sommers C. Hauser S.D. Pierce J.L. Combs R. Reitz B.A. Diaz-Collier J.A. Weinberg R.A. Hood B.L. Kilpatrick B.F. Tripp C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25883-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we have not yet reported data describing the kinetic mechanism for rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer. Likewise there is nothing known about the kinetic mechanisms of rhTBK-1 and rhIKK-i. In this paper we studied the kinetic mechanisms of the rhTBK-1 and rhIKK-i and compared them to those of rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer as well as to other published IKKs. The results indicate that each of these enzymes exhibit a random sequential kinetic mechanism. However, rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer exhibits an α = 1 which suggests that the affinity of ATP and IκBα for the free enzyme will be the same as the affinities for each of these substrates for the binary complexes. In contrast, rhIKK-i or rhTBK-1 exhibits an α value >10 which suggests that the affinity of each substrate for the free enzyme is higher than that of the binary complex, indicating a negative co-operativity exists between the two substrates. During the course of characterization of the rhIKKs, we also found that the dissociation constants of ATP for rhTBK-1 and rhIKK-i were between the suggested values for kinases, namely 0.1 to 30 μm (29.Bhatnagar D. Roskoski R.J. Rosendahl M.S. Leonard N.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6310-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30.LoGrasso P.V. Frantz B. Rolando A.M. O'Keefe S.J. Hermes J.D. O'Neil E.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However the dissociation constants of IκBα for rhTBK-l and rhIKK-i were significantly higher than that for rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer. Thus these results indicate that rhIKK-i and rhTBK-1 are similar to each other but distinct from rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer not only with respect to their substrate specificity but also with respect to their kinetic properties.

Cell lysates were stored at −80 °C until purification of the recombinant proteins was undertaken as described below. All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. The buffers used are as follows: buffer A, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mmmetabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1× Complete protease inhibitors; buffer B, same as buffer A except 150 mm NaCl; and buffer C, same as buffer A except 500 mm NaCl. The heterodimer enzyme was produced by co-infection in a baculovirus system (FLAG IKK-2/IKK-1 His; multiplicity of infection = 0.1 and time of expression = 72 h). Infected cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellet (10.0 g) was suspended in 50 ml of buffer A. The protein suspension was microfluidized and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min. The heterodimer enzyme was further purified to homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity resin as described previously (28.Huynh Q.K. Boddupalli H.

Cells from a 20-liter fermentation from baculovirus of N-terminal FLAG-tagged rhTBK-1 were microfluidized, and the pH was adjusted to 7.6 using NaOH. The sample was centrifuged for 1 h at 26,000 × g. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody resin, 50 ml, was added to the pool and allowed to mix overnight. The resin was batch-washed using 4 bed volumes of buffer A per wash. The resin slurry was then poured into a 26/20 column and washed with 15 column volumes of buffer B. The rhTBK-1 protein was eluted using an anti-FLAG peptide in buffer A. Dithiothreitol was added to the pool to make 5 mm and concentrated in a stirred cell using an Amicon YM30 membrane. BSA was added to the concentrated pool to make 0.1%, and the pool was aliquoted into 1-ml samples. The samples were frozen at −80 °C until ready for use. Cells from a 20-liter fermentation of baculovirus-expressed rhIKK-i with an N-terminal FLAG tag were microfluidized and centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected and the pH adjusted to 7.6 using NaOH. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, 25 ml, pre-equilibrated in buffer A was added to the supernatant pool and allowed to mix overnight. The resin was washed in batch using 4 resin volumes of buffer A per wash. The resin slurry was then poured into a 26/20-ml column and washed with 15 resin volumes of buffer B. The FLAG rhIKK-i was eluted using a FLAG peptide in buffer A. Dithiothreitol was added to the pool to make 5 mm followed by concentrating in a stirred cell using an Amicon YM30 membrane. BSA was added to the concentrated pool to make 0.1%, and the pool was frozen as 1-ml aliquots at −80 °C. SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis of the isolated enzymes indicated that they are homogeneous proteins (data not shown). When assayed using Iκβα as phosphoacceptor peptide, both rhIKK-i (395.0 units/mg of protein) and rhTBK-1 (339.0 units/mg of protein) had a dramatically higher specific activity compared with rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer (8.2 units/mg of protein) (42.Kishore, N., Huynh, Q.

However, because IκBα is a significantly better substrate for rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer with more than 100-fold lower Km compared with rhIKK-i and rhTBK-1, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is 8–12-fold higher for rhIKK-1/rhIKK-2 heterodimer (81.1 h−1μm−1) compared with rhIKK-i (9.7 h−1 μm−1) and rhTBK-1"

Lymphocyte development, self-reactivity, T cell homeostasis, and peripheral immune responses are importantly regulated by cytokines that utilize the common γ-chain (γc) 1The abbreviations used are: γccommon γ-chainmmouseRreceptorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterhhumanILinterleukinRTreverse transcriptionWTwild-typeX-SCIDX-linked severe combined immunodeficiency diseasemAbmonoclonal antibody 1The abbreviations used are: γccommon γ-chainmmouseRreceptorFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterhhumanILinterleukinRTreverse transcriptionWTwild-typeX-SCIDX-linked severe combined immunodeficiency diseasemAbmonoclonal antibody as a receptor subunit (1.He Y.W.

The IL-2 receptor (R) and IL-15R are heterotrimers comprised of unique α-chains and shared IL-2Rβ and γc subunits whereas the IL-4R, IL-7R, IL-9R, and IL-21R are heterodimers comprised of unique α-subunits and γc (3.Kondo M.

For each of these cytokine receptors, γc directly contributes to ligand binding through its extracellular domain and to signal transduction through the association of Jak-3 to its cytoplasmic tail (10.Ihle J.N.

In humans this disease is characterized by failed development of T and natural killer cells whereas B cell development is largely normal, but their function is impaired. In γc-deficient mice, severe impairment in T, natural killer, and B cell development occurs that is mainly due to lack of IL-7R and IL-15R signaling (14.Porter B.O. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5906-5912PubMed Google Scholar). A number of mutations in γc from X-SCID patients have been identified (15.Puck J.M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 507-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16.Puck J.M. Pepper A.E. Henthorn P.S. Candotti F. Isakov J. Whitwam T. Conley M.E. Fischer R.E. Rosenblatt H.M.

Many of these are nonsense mutations that lead to a premature stoppage in translation of γc, whereas several others are missense mutations. For the most part, however, it is not possible to deduce whether these latter mutations might selectively affect the ligand-binding function of γc or simply distort its tertiary structure. The structural basis by which γc functions in binding six distinct cytokines is still not defined. Recent structure-function analysis of the mouse γc (mγc) ectodomain by site-directed mutagenesis (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), guided by predictions of theoretical models of the γc structure (18.Bamborough P. Hedgecock C.J.

Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), identified four amino acids of γc that are necessary for binding IL-2 and IL-7 (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One of these residues, Tyr-103, may be directly involved in IL-2 and IL-7 binding. The other three residues, Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211 may indirectly function in ligand binding by maintaining the conformation of two proposed loops of γc. Somewhat surprisingly, none of the initial 25 mutations introduced into mγc substantially affected the binding of two well characterized antagonistic anti-mγc mAbs (4G3 and 3E12) (21.He Y.W. Adkins B. Furse R.K. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1596-1605PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that there remained other important ligand contact regions in γc. In the present report we have defined the epitopes on mγcfor the 4G3 and 3E12 mAbs. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids surrounding the putative 4G3 binding site led to the identification of a novel residue that is more critical for the binding of IL-7 than IL-2 or IL-15 and is not important for binding IL-4. In addition, the importance of mγc residues Tyr-103, Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211 was extended to IL-4 and IL-15 binding. Collectively, these data favor a model in which γcutilizes a common mechanism for its interactions with multiple cytokines. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using the GeneAmp PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 0.1–1 μg of rat spleen poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH Laboratories) was reverse transcribed for 15 min at 42 °C, in the presence of oligo(dT) primers. The cDNA was then amplified by AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, using two γc-specific primers (0.5 μm each). The primers corresponded to gene sequences of the mγc leader peptide (5′-AGATCCTTCT TAGTCCTNCAGC-3′) and the rat γc cytoplasmic region (5′-CACCACTCCAGGCCGAAAAGTTCCC-3′). Amplification reactions were performed in a PerkinElmer DNA thermal cycler, starting with a 2-min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s for melting at 95 °C and 45 s each for annealing/extension at 60 and 72 °C, respectively, and a final incubation of 7 min at 72 °C. The RT-PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the 800–900-bp major band was purified. The partial rat γc cDNA was subsequently digested with SacI and XbaI and was used to replace a corresponding fragment of the mγc gene in the pSI-mγc vector. Plasmids containing the longer γc inserts (see “Results”) were designated pSI-ratγc and encoded full-length γc protein with rat extracellular and transmembrane domains (residues 3–273) and the mouse carboxyl tail. Both the RT-PCR products and the rat γc inserts were analyzed by DNA sequencing. A conserved EcoRV site within the rat and mouse γc genes and a XhoI site in the pSI vector were used to digest the 5′ γc gene fragments from both the pSI-mγc and pSI-ratγc plasmids. These fragments, which encode the leader peptide and amino acids 1–99 of the γc, were then swapped between the two vectors, resulting in γccDNA that partially encodes rat and mouse sequences corresponding to the extracellular domains. Full-length cDNAs for the mγc, human IL-2Rβ (hIL-2Rβ), and mouse IL-7Rα (mIL-7Rα) were inserted into the pSI mammalian expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The pDC302 expression vector containing the full-length mouse IL-4Rα (mIL-4Rα) cDNA was described previously (22.Mosley B. Beckmann M.P. March C.J. Idzerda R.L. Gimpel S.D. VandenBos T. Friend D. Alpert A. Anderson D. Jackson J. et al.Cell. 1989; 59: 335-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) (provided by Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). Site-directed mutagenesis of the mγc gene was performed by the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as previously described (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. COS7 monkey kidney cells were maintained and transfected as previously described (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All assays were done 3 days post-transfection, using COS7 cells harvested with 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. Cytokine receptor surface expression in COS7 cells was analyzed as previously described using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD PharMingen) (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mAbs used were anti-mγc (4G3 and 3E12, Ref. 21.He Y.W. Adkins B. Furse R.K. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1596-1605PubMed Google Scholar; TUGm2; BD PharMingen), anti-IL-2Rβ (Mikβ3; BD PharMingen), or anti-IL-7Rα (A7R34; kindly provided by S. Nishikawa, Kyoto University, Japan) (23.Sudo T. Nishikawa S. Ohno N. Akiyama N. Tamakoshi M. Yoshida H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9125-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and mouse IL-4 (Immunex, Seattle, WA) were radiolabeled with 125I using IODO-GEN tubes (Pierce) to 15–60 μCi/μg. IL-2 and IL-7 binding was measured as previously described (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). IL-15 binding was measured on COS7 cells expressing hIL-2Rβ and mγc, as described for IL-2. γc-specific IL-2 and IL-15 binding was calculated as the cpm associated with COS7-hIL-2Rβ/mγc transfectants minus the cpm associated with control cells expressing hIL-2Rβ alone. γc-specific binding for IL-7 was calculated as the cpm associated with COS7-mIL-7Rα/mγc cells minus the cpm associated with COS7-mIL-7Rα cells. γc-specific ligand binding to COS7 cells bearing mutant receptors was expressed as percentage of the wild-type control. Nonspecific binding was always assessed by evaluating binding by mock transfected COS7 cells. This control was equivalent to that observed when blocking binding using an excess of unlabeled cytokine. COS7 cells (4–5 × 106 cells) expressing mIL-4Rα in the presence or absence of mγc were incubated with 1 nm125I-IL-4 for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 30–60 min at 4 °C with 1 mm dissucinimidyl suberate in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, the cells were extracted with 200 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as described previously (24.Saragovi H. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1918-1926PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 4G3 and 3E12 mAbs conjugated to Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C. Finally, the beads were washed three times with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. In some experiments, the precipitated material was eluted with 1% SDS, separated by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (24.Saragovi H. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1918-1926PubMed Google Scholar). The 4G3 and 3E12 mAbs to mγc recognize distinct epitopes (21.He Y.W. Adkins B. Furse R.K. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1596-1605PubMed Google Scholar), and their binding does not overlap with the epitope for TUGm2 (data not shown). 4G3 is a potent antagonist of IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 bioactivity, whereas 3E12 is most effective against IL-4 (21.He Y.W. Adkins B. Furse R.K. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1596-1605PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Malek T.R. Levy R.B. Adkins B. He Y.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As 4G3 and 3E12 are of rat origin, the epitopes recognized by these mAbs should reflect differences in the primary structure between mouse and rat γc. Therefore, our strategy to define the epitopes to these two mAbs relied on comparing the amino acid sequences of mouse and rat γc. This first required determination of the sequence of the rat γc ectodomain. Homology search of the nucleotide data bases with a mγcquery sequence returned two rat ESTs (GenBankTM accessionsAI172304 and AI178808) aligning with the mγc ectodomain and the mγc cytoplasmic tail, respectively. This sequence information was used to amplify a partial rat γc cDNA from rat spleen by using RT-PCR. The products appeared as a diffuse band of 800–900 bp on agarose gels and were later subcloned into the pSI mammalian expression vector. Interestingly, sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products and the subcloned inserts indicated the presence of at least two types of rat γc cDNA. Both appeared to be transcripts of the same gene; however, the shorter cDNA had a 97-bp deletion corresponding to putative exon 6 encoding the transmembrane region, suggesting that it was a splice variant of γc (Fig. 1A). As anticipated, all defining features of the type I cytokine receptor superfamily were conserved between rat and mouse (Fig. 1B). The deduced amino acid sequences of the mature rat and mouse γc ectodomains (residues 1–241) were 88% identical to each other (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal 34 amino acids of γc were much less conserved (9 mismatches) than residues 35–241, which correspond to the cytokine receptor homology region (18 mismatches). It is also noteworthy that a lysine inserted into the mouse sequence at position 158 corresponds to a position previously identified to contribute to the binding of the TUGm2 mAb (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because the number of mismatches between the rat and mouse γc ectodomain sequences was relatively large, we first assessed which segments of the mγc ectodomain contain the residues involved in the binding of mAbs by analyzing chimeric rat/mouse γc molecules. A conserved EcoRV site (Fig. 1A) was utilized for swapping cDNA fragments between the two species. After co-transfection of these chimeric cDNAs with the hIL-2Rβ into COS7 cells, the expressed proteins were examined for mAb and IL-2 binding (Table I). The latter assay was performed to ensure that the chimeric γc molecules were functional (Fig. 2). 4G3, 3E12, and TUGm2 mAbs readily stained cells transfected with wild-type mγc but not wild-type rat or mouse (amino acids 1–99)/rat (amino acids 100–241) chimeric γc molecules. By contrast, rat (aa 1–99)/mouse (aa 100–241) γc chimeras fully retained their ability to bind 4G3, 3E12, and TUGm2. Thus, all three mAb epitopes were mapped to the membrane-proximal 141-amino acid segment of the mγc ectodomain. Based on our past mutagenesis of mγc and that 5 of the 15 differences between positions 100 and 241 were conservative substitutions, six other mγc residues were replaced with their rat counterparts and then analyzed for their ability to bind mAbs to mγc after transfection into COS7 cells. The mutation V121E completely abrogated 4G3 binding, whereas staining with 3E12 and TUGm2 was unaffected (Fig. 2). Similarly, the R197L mutation dramatically reduced the binding of 3E12 but not the other mAbs to mγc. No other point mutations were found to inhibit the binding of 4G3 or 3E12. Thus, 4G3 likely recognizes an epitope near Val-121 in the first domain of mγc, whereas 3E12 may bind to a membrane-proximal part of domain 2. It is important to note, however, that whereas mutant V121E was defective in 4G3 binding, mutant V121A was not, suggesting that the side chain of Val-121 may not be directly involved in the mγc-4G3 interaction (Fig. 3A). Thus, this analysis may not have precisely defined the composition of these epitopes. We have previously established a ligand-receptor binding assay using transient transfected COS7 cells that distinguish mγc-dependent binding by IL-2 or IL-7 (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Under our binding conditions (0.3–1 nmof radiolabeled ligand), readily measurable binding by IL-2 is strictly dependent upon expression of both the hIL-2Rβ and mγcsubunits whereas mγc enhances the binding by mIL-7Rα. In the case of IL-2 binding, it was necessary to use hIL-2Rβ because co-expression of the mIL-2Rβ and mγc heterodimer does not detectably bind IL-2. In these experiments, the difference between the radioactivity bound to cells with heterodimeric receptors versus cells expressing only hIL-2Rβ or mIL-7Rα was considered as mγc-dependent ligand binding and was used for comparison of the mutant mγc chains to the wild-type. Because 4G3 efficiently blocks the detection of IL-7 and IL-2 cross-linked to mγc (21.He Y.W. Adkins B. Furse R.K. Malek T.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1596-1605PubMed Google Scholar) and its epitope is membrane-distal, we hypothesized that mutagenesis of mγcnear the 4G3 epitope may lead to the identification of novel contact residues involved in the binding of mγc-dependent cytokines. Using a structural model of γc as a guide (20.Kroemer R.T. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a number of amino acids in the vicinity of Val-121 were mutated to alanine. With the exception of the L124A mutant, which was undetectable, all the other mγc mutants were normally expressed on the cell surface (>70% compared with the wild-type control) after co-transfection into COS7 cells with either hIL-2Rβ or mIL-7Rα. (Fig. 3, A and B). These same cells were also used in125I-radiolabeled IL-2 or IL-7 binding assays (Fig. 3C). For all transfected COS7 cells that expressed cell surface mγc, there was a notable decrease (at least 2-fold) in mγc-dependent binding only for IL-7 when COS7 cells expressed mIL-7Rα and the mγcmutant N128A. Because the expression of hIL-2Rβ and mIL-7Rα was similar among these transfectants (data not shown), these results implicate Asn-128 in binding IL-7. Mutations of Tyr-103, Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211 of mγc have been previously shown to impair the binding of IL-2 and IL-7 (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the contribution of these residues as well as those surrounding the 4G3 epitope for binding IL-15 (Fig. 4). Similar to IL-2, IL-15 also readily binds to hIL-2Rβ and mγc but only in the presence of both subunits (8.Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2822-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Therefore, the same populations of transfected COS7 cells were examined for binding IL-2 or IL-15. This analysis indicated that COS7 cells expressing the Y103A or Y103R mutation of mγc were impaired in binding both IL-2 and IL-15 (Fig. 4A). IL-15 binding was consistently more sensitive to the Y103R mutation than IL-2, perhaps due to different surface properties of the two cytokines. The C161S, C210S, and G211R mutant mγc molecules also did not support IL-15 binding (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the mutations at Tyr-103 and Asn-128 that do not affect mγc expression, these other three mutations typically resulted in lower mγc surface expression (Ref. 17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; data not shown). However, based on our past work that established the relationship between expression of mγc as a function of IL-2 or IL-7 binding by their respective receptors (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the virtually complete loss of IL-15 binding cannot be due to this suboptimal expression of mγc. With respect to the mutations near the 4G3 epitope, only the N128A mutation somewhat inhibited IL-15 binding (Fig. 4B and data not shown). In these later experiments, COS7 cells were co-transfected with hIL-2Rβ, mIL-7Rα, and mγc to evaluate the effect of a given mγc mutation for IL-2, IL-7, or IL-15 binding on a single population of cells. To further assess the role of Tyr-103 and Asn-128 in binding these cytokines, mγc was mutated to contain both the Y103R and N128A mutations. After transfecting mγc containing either the individual or double mutations into COS7 cells with hIL-2Rβ and mIL-7Rα, ligand binding assays were performed (Fig. 4B). In this analysis, the binding of IL-2, IL-15, and IL-7 was decreased at least 2- to 3-fold by mutations at Tyr-103 whereas the N128A mutation caused a 2-fold decrease in the binding of IL-7 and a more modest decrease in IL-2 and IL-15 binding. However, the Y103R/N128A double mutation caused a 10-fold reduction in the binding of IL-2 and IL-7 and virtually abolished the binding of IL-15. Thus, these data indicate that both Tyr-103 and Asn-128 contribute to the binding of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, with Asn-128 playing a more critical role in the binding of IL-7. Collectively, our results indicate that IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 exhibit similar requirements for Tyr-103, Asn-128, Cys-161, Cys-210, and Gly-211 in the putative mγc ligand-binding interface. IL-4Rα/γc heterodimers have been reported to bind IL-4 with 3- to 5-fold higher affinity than IL-4Rα (3.Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). However, in our hands COS7 cells expressing only mIL-4Rα always bound similar amounts of radiolabeled IL-4 as cells expressing both the mIL-4Rα and mγc subunits (data not shown). Therefore, we assessed the contribution of mγc to the binding of IL-4 by the capacity to cross-link radiolabeled IL-4 to mγc after its association to the IL-4R. The amount of radioactivity precipitated with anti-mγc was used to represent mγc-dependent IL-4R binding. This included both covalently cross-linked mγc·IL-4 complexes and IL-4 noncovalently associated to its receptor, as shown by the presence of two major bands after SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitated material (Fig. 5A). This type of analysis revealed that the mγc mutations, K158A, which in part defines the epitope for TUGm2, and Δ(4–34), which lacks amino acids 4–34 of the mature protein, readily binds IL-4. Therefore, as previously shown for mγc-dependent IL-2 and IL-7 binding (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these regions of mγc are also not important for IL-4 binding. All mγc mutations implicated in the binding of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 were also analyzed for their ability to contribute to the binding of IL-4. COS7 transfectants expressing mIL-4Rα and wild-type or mutant mγc were subjected to both IL-4 cross-linking assays and FACS analysis with anti-mγc. mIL-4Rα expression did not significantly vary among transfectants as verified by Western blot analysis (data not shown). However, our past analysis has shown that some of these mutations cause low mγc cell surface expression (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This observation and the importance of mγc cell surface levels in this assay led us to first establish the relationship between the levels of cell surface wild-type mγc expression and the amount of125I-IL-4 precipitated from extracts of cross-linked transfected COS7 cells. As expected, the fraction of mγc-dependent binding was proportional to the expression of mγc (Fig. 5B). These data served as a standard curve for the comparison of IL-4 binding by mγc mutants to similarly expressed wild-type mγc. The poorly expressed mγc mutants C161S, C210S, and G211R, bound 3- to 8-fold less IL-4 than similarly expressed wild-type (dotted line) or Q163A mγc(Fig. 5B). These results correspond to the detection of minimal 125I-IL-4 for the C210A/G211A mutations when the precipitated material was analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A). Mutations at Y103A, Y103R, or N128A did not severely alter mγc expression, as measured by staining with 4G3. Nevertheless, both mutations of Tyr-103 caused a partial (2- to 3-fold) decrease in the binding of IL-4, whereas N128A did not have a readily detectable effect when tested either alone or in combination with Y103R (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that Cys-161, Cys-210, Gly-211, and Tyr-103 are required for IL-4 binding, whereas Asn-128 is not necessary. Our past work relied solely on molecular models of γc to identify regions and amino acids within γc that regulate ligand binding (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this report our strategy was to identify epitopes on mγc for the inhibitory mAbs 4G3 and 3E12 as a means to further explore the structural basis of mγc-cytokine interactions. Localization of these epitopes was first dependent upon determining the sequence of rat γc ectodomain. As expected, the rat- and mouse-deduced amino acid sequences were highly conserved. However, one unanticipated finding was that two forms of γc cDNA were amplified by RT-PCR from rat spleen mRNA, one of which encodes a protein that lacks the sequence corresponding to exon 6 and is predicted to be secreted. These two forms likely represent products of alternative splicing. We have identified an identical spliced form of mγc lacking the transmembrane domain for a variant of the mouse EL4 thymoma (Ref. 26.Malek T.R. Furse R.K. Fleming M.L. Fadell A.J. He Y.W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 2R. K. Furse and T. R. Malek, unpublished data. Although the overall biological relevance of this form of γc remains to be determined, it is noteworthy that soluble γc has been identified in human and mouse sera (27.Meissner U. Blum H. Schnare M. Rollinghoff M. Gessner A. Blood. 2001; 97: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this and a previous report (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we have analyzed the ligand binding function of 33 mutant mγc molecules harboring 39 distinct mutations. The extent and relative location of these mutations is displayed in Fig. 6A. Analysis of anti-mγc mAb binding to these mutant molecules has revealed their epitopes (Fig. 6B). The 3E12 epitope is located in a membrane-proximal portion of mγc near Arg-197 of domain 2. It is likely that 3E12 inhibits cytokine bioactivity by interfering with receptor-receptor interactions or by inducing a conformational shift in mγc that indirectly affects receptor function. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. By contrast, the 4G3 epitope was localized to the vicinity of residue Val-121 in domain 1 because mutation of Val-121 of the mγc to the corresponding rat residue (glutamate) abrogated 4G3 binding. However, Val-121 by itself does not define the 4G3 epitope as the V121A mutation did not interfere with 4G3 binding, and the surrounding sequences are almost identical between rat and mouse. Therefore, the 4G3 epitope likely depends on additional amino acids. One candidate region is located between amino acids 1 and 34 of mγc because the deletion of this poorly conserved sequence, which is not required for IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7 binding, slightly inhibited the binding of 4G3 (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The TUGm2 epitope, identified earlier (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), is centered around a unique lysine residue (Lys-158) of the mγc sequence. The predicted locations of these epitopes and the inhibitory properties of the mAbs (3.Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 7.Kimura Y. Takeshita T. Kondo M. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Van Snick J. Sugamura K. Int.

Immunol. 1995; 59: 225-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that it is highly likely that 4G3 and TUG2 antagonize γc-dependent cytokines by directly interfering with ligand-receptor interactions. Based on this hypothesis, our search for new ligand-interacting sites was restricted to mutagenesis of selected residues of mγcnear the putative 4G3 epitope. This analysis led to the identification of amino acid Asn-128 in the linker region of mγc that is necessary for the binding of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 but not IL-4. The N128A mutation caused a 2–3-fold reduction in mγc-dependent IL-7 binding while only modestly affecting the binding of IL-2 and IL-15. However, simultaneous mutation of Asn-128 and Tyr-103, a residue previously shown to contribute to IL-2 and IL-7 binding (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), essentially abrogated mγc-dependent IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 binding whereas the individual mutations had only a partial effect. This result clearly implicates both Asn-128 and Tyr-103 in mγc-dependent binding of all three of these cytokines. We cannot unambiguously distinguish by our assays whether this is an additive or synergistic effect. The amino acids of the linker region, including Asn-128, are highly conserved in mammalian γc, consistent with an important role of this region in γc structure and/or function. Although only one theoretical model of γc (19.Gustchina A. Zdanov A. Schalk-Hihi C. Wlodawer A. Proteins. 1995; 21: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) predicted a direct participation of Asn-128 in ligand binding, other residues of the γc linker region have been proposed to interact with IL-7 (20.Kroemer R.T. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The linker region of γc has also been implicated in ligand binding based on epitope mapping studies of the anti-human γc mAb PC.B8 (29.Raskin N. Jakubowski A. Sizing I.D. Olson D.L. Kalled S.L. Hession C.A. Benjamin C.D. Baker D.P. Burkly L.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3474-3483PubMed Google Scholar). Although no X-SCID patients have yet been identified with mutations at Asn-128, at least four neighboring mutations have been shown to cause X-SCID (15.Puck J.M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 507-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16.Puck J.M. Pepper A.E. Henthorn P.S. Candotti F. Isakov J. Whitwam T. Conley M.E. Fischer R.E. Rosenblatt H.M. Small T.N. Buckley R.H. Blood. 1997; 89: 1968-1977PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of these mutations, A134V, resulted in a selective defect in γc-dependent IL-4 and IL-7 but not IL-2 and IL-15 signaling (30.Kumaki S. Ishii N. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Cosman D. Sugamura K. Konno T. Blood. 1999; 93: 607-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding further supports the importance of this region in the binding of multiple cytokines and suggests that it may impart ligand specificity. Of the large number of residues mutated and analyzed (Fig. 6A), relatively few have been implicated to participate in ligand binding (Fig. 6C). These include Cys-161 and Cys-210 that were proposed to form a putative intrachain disulfide bond (20.Kroemer R.T. Richards W.G. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as well as Asn-128 and Tyr-103. It should be stressed that although mutations of these residues interfered with cytokine binding, they did not affect the binding of the conformationally sensitive 4G3 and 3E12 mAbs, indicating that the folding of mγc was not drastically changed (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Importantly, most of these sites were required for the mγc-dependent binding of each of the four cytokines that we tested. The only exception was Asn-128, which did not obviously contribute to IL-4 binding, as mentioned above. Thus, our data favor a model in which γc-dependent cytokines use overlapping binding surfaces that include at least three loops (EF1, BC2, and FG2) of the mγc ectodomain (Fig. 6C). Tyr-103 is analogous to a structurally conserved aromatic amino acid present in several other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily (31.Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar) and which has been shown to directly participate in the binding of growth hormone and erythropoietin (32.de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar, 33.Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jin R. McMahon F.J. Collins A. Tullai J. Gruninger R.H. Jolliffe L.K. Mulcahy L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14045-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34.Middleton S.A. Barbone F.P. Johnson D.L. Thurmond R.L. You Y. McMahon F.J. Jin R. Livnah O. Tullai J. Farrell F.X. Goldsmith M.A. Wilson I.A. Jolliffe L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14163-14169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, Tyr-103 is an attractive candidate to directly participate in the binding of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15. Furthermore, Asn-128 is modeled to be in a position where it is exposed to solvent and also might directly interact with the cytokines. The ability of the Y103R/N128A double mutation to almost completely prevent IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 binding is consistent with this view. The role of Cys-161 and Cys-210 in the binding of all four cytokines is less clear. As previously suggested (17.Olosz F. Malek T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30100-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these two cysteines may maintain the conformation of the BC2 and FG2 loops, contributing to the local structure of the ligand binding interface rather than directly contacting the cytokines. The IL-2R and IL-15R are also found as heterotrimers comprised of a unique α-subunit while sharing IL-2Rβ and γcsubunits. The trimeric forms of these receptors are the main physiological structures in vivo. In this study we have examined IL-2 and IL-15 binding to only IL-2Rβ and mγcheterodimers as this permitted a direct evaluation of the effect of a particular mγc mutation on IL-2 or IL-15 binding without complication from the substantial intrinsic binding by the α-subunits. We anticipate that these same structural elements, as discussed above, are required for binding or stabilizing mγc in the context of the heterotrimeric IL-2R and IL-15R, but this must be experimentally verified. Although there appears to be a conserved structural strategy by which mγc participates in binding multiple cytokines, our data clearly illustrate that there are some differences in the relative contribution of individual mγc residues to ligand binding. For example, mutations of Tyr-103 appeared to have a more severe effect on the binding of IL-15 than on IL-2. Similarly, the single mutation N128A had a more noticeable effect on IL-7versus IL-2 and IL-15 binding. Therefore, Tyr-103 may function as a structurally conserved anchor residue for cytokine binding whereas amino acids surrounding Asn-128 may be related to fine specificity in binding. The inability to detect a role for Asn-128 in binding IL-4 in mγc and the selective effect of the A134V mutation in human γc (30.Kumaki S. Ishii N. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Cosman D. Sugamura K. Konno T. Blood. 1999; 93: 607-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as discussed above, raise the possibility that there may be other yet undefined contacts on γc for these cytokines. A more precise view of γc-cytokine interactions awaits solving the crystal structure of γc in the context of a heterodimeric receptor with bound ligand.

These cofactors have no effect on the independent stable enzymes. Therefore, protein-protein interactions may give rise to new regulatory properties. 1,3 biphosphoglyceric acid phosphoribulokinase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase Enzymes do not exist as separate, independent entities in the cell but interact with many components, including membranes and other proteins, to form more complex structures. These supramolecular edifices are involved in many metabolic pathways (1.Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) such as the Benson-Calvin cycle, which is responsible for CO2assimilation in plants (2.Müller B. Z. Naturforsch. 1972; 27: 925-932Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3.Nicholson S. Easterby J.S. Powls R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4.Wedel N.

A. 1998; 95: 9699-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions can affect several of the enzymes belonging to this pathway. We have purified (6.Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) a bi-enzyme complex (460 kDa) from a green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This complex is made up of two tetramers of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC.1.2.1.13) and two dimers of phosphoribulokinase (EC.2.7.1.19). These two enzymes from the Benson-Calvin cycle do not catalyze consecutive reactions. The kinase catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of ribulose 5-phosphate to form ribulose 1,5-biphosphate, the CO2acceptor in photosynthetic organisms; the dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible reduction and dephosphorylation of 1,3-biphosphoglyceric acid (BPGA)1 to give glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and phosphate using NADPH or NADH (7.Leegood R.C. Lea P.J. Enzymes in the Calvin Cycle. 3. Academic Press, London1990: 15-37Google Scholar). We have also purified independent, stable, phosphoribulokinase (PRK) (8.Porter M.A. Milanez S. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which are not included in the complex. The main functional advantage of supramolecular structures is “channeling” (9.Ovadi J. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 152: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the direct transfer of intermediates from one active site to the next active site and so avoiding diffusion into the cell medium. Any functional advantage provided by the physical association of enzymes that do not catalyze consecutive reactions is likely to result from a change in their kinetic properties. For example, in the green alga, the association of two enzymes in a complex enables oxidized PRK to be active, although this enzyme is inactive in its stable, independent state (10.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In spinach, the specific catalytic activity of ribulose-biphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (EC.4.1.1.39) is about 10 times greater when it is within a five-enzyme complex than when it is alone (11.Gontero B. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Similarly, reduced thioredoxin can act on independent PRK and on the same enzyme within the five-enzyme complex, but the latter is activated 12 times faster than the enzyme in its independent state (12.Gontero B. Mulliert G. Rault M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These differences are linked to a transfer of information (13.Ricard J. Gontero B. Avilan L. Lebreton S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1231-1248Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) between the enzymes in supramolecular edifices. The dissociated or metastable enzymes produced by dissociating a multi-enzyme complex by dilution may retain for a while some features of the conformation they had in the associated form. This is the imprinting effect. It has been shown that PRK produced by dissociation of the complex from C. reinhardtii, transiently adopts a metastable conformation highly competent for catalysis as a consequence of the conformational constraints exerted on it by GAPDH (10.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14.Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A theory developed earlier describes in terms of statistical thermodynamics how the arrangements and mutual constraints of identical or different polypeptide chains may facilitate catalysis by PRK (15.Ricard J. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Gontero B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Conversely, PRK may be expected to exert an imprinting on GAPDH, and one of the aims of this work was to answer this question. The imprinting effects could also be modified by metabolites. NAD(P)(H) has been shown to regulate an oligomeric 600-kDa form of GAPDH in spinach (16.Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17.Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6456-6461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this form is absent from C. reinhardtii. Thus, one may wonder (i) if the GAPDH inserted in the complex we have purified could be regulated by these metabolites and (ii) if they alter the imprinting effects between these two enzymes. This report examines these questions using kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. The complex was purified to apparent homogeneity from C. reinhardtii (WM3−) cells as previously described (6.Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Stable PRK was purified according to Ref. 8.Porter M.A. Milanez S. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. The purified complex was reduced for 1 h with 20 mmdithiothreitol and dissociated. The resulting enzymes were applied to a DEAE-Trisacryl column (2.5 ×13 cm) equilibrated in 30 mmTris, 4 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NAD, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.9 (column flow rate of 40 ml/h). The washout fractions contained pure stable GAPDH. The purified enzymes were stored at −80 °C in 10% aqueous glycerol. The purified complex and the stable enzymes were incubated at 30 °C with different concentrations of NAD(P)(H) in the absence of any reducing agent. Aliquots were withdrawn after specific times and placed in the assay cuvettes at the same temperature. The assay cuvettes used to test NADH- or NADPH-dependent activities of GAPDH contained 2 units of pyruvate kinase, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm ATP, 0.17 mmNAD(P)H, 2 mm phosphoglyceric acid, 4.5 units of phosphoglycerate kinase, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (18.Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Scheibe R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PRK activity was coupled to NADH oxidation via pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The assay cuvette contained 3 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, 2 units of ribose isomerase, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm ribose 5-phosphate, 0.17 mm NADH, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (19.Gontero B. Cardenas M.L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All activities were recorded using a Pye Unicam UV2 spectrophotometer. The experimental data were fitted to theoretical curves using Sigma Plot 5.0. Protein concentration was assayed with the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). The dissociation or integrity of the complex in the preincubation mixture was checked by native PAGE performed on 4–15% minigels in a Amersham Biosciences Phastsystem apparatus. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schüll) by passive diffusion for 16 h. The filters were then immunoblotted with a rabbit antiserum directed against spinach PRK. Antibody binding was revealed using alkaline phosphatase (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18-76Google Scholar). The free energies of activation of a given chemical process catalyzed by free enzymes (stable forms) and by the same enzymes within a complex may be compared to determine the fraction of the energy transferred from one protein to another and thus used to alter the rate of the chemical process. The enzymes released when this complex dissociates (“metastable” forms) may retain some features of their conformation in the associated state. This is the “imprinting effect,” and it can be described thermodynamically as follows. ΔGμ≠=ΔGς≠+(Ψγ−Ψτ)Equation 1 kμ=kςexp(−(Ψγ−Ψτ)/RT)Equation 2 where ΔGμ≠ and ΔGς≠ are the free energies of activation of a given process performed by the metastable (μ) and stable (ς) forms of the same enzyme. The difference (ψγ − ψτ) is the fraction of energy that is stored after the dissociation of the supramolecular edifice, where ψγ and ψτ represent the stabilization/destabilization energies of the metastable form relative to the stable form in both its ground state (γ) and its transition state (τ). This difference may be positive or negative, and the rate of the chemical process may decrease or increase. Let us assume that a ligand X is mixed with the complex and that the activity of the metastable form released from this complex is modified. The free energy of activation ΔGμ′≠ of a given chemical process performed by this metastable form (μ′) and the free energy of activation ΔGμ≠ of the metastable form (μ) obtained in the absence of the ligand X may be compared.ΔGμ′≠=ΔGμ≠+ΔXEquation 3 kμ′=kμexp(−ΔX/RT)Equation 4 where ΔX is the fraction of energy attributed to the presence of the ligand X. This difference may be negative or positive, and the metastable form released from a complex incubated with this ligand X may have more or less activity (kμ′). Free energies of activation are given in the following equation. ΔGi≠=RT lnkBThkiEquation 5 where kB (1.38 × 10−23J·K−1) and h (6.63 × 10−34J·s) are the Boltzmann and the Planck constants, respectively, ki is the catalytic rate constant of the different forms, kμ is the catalytic rate constant of the metastable form released from the complex in the absence of ligand X, kμ′ is the catalytic rate constant of the metastable form released from the complex incubated with ligand X, and kς is the catalytic rate constant of the stable form. Biphasic curves that could be fitted to a pseudo-first order function or to an equation including a burst were obtained when NADH-dependent activity of GAPDH within the complex was assayed (Fig. 1). Because ECL experiments showed that the complex was dissociated at the beginning of the reaction and because the form resulting from the complex dissociated by dilution in the absence of substrates also displayed a kinetic transient (data not shown), the latter could not be linked to the dissociation of the complex in the reaction mixture. The curve being nicely fitted to a pseudo-first order function, we confirmed that the kinetic transient was correlated to an approach to equilibrium (22.Neet K.E. Ainslie G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 192-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) by measuring the NADH-dependent activity with enzyme concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 12 nm. The time curves normalized for enzyme concentration overlapped and had the same shape (data not shown), which confirmed that the kinetic transient was due to the approach to equilibrium. The initial linear part of the curves was therefore attributed to an average steady-state rate of the dissociated form of GAPDH, the so-called metastable form originating from the complex, of 147 ± 5 s−1. This average value was much higher than that obtained with stable GAPDH (33 ± 8 s−1). There was a lag on the onset of the NADPH-dependent activity of GAPDH within the complex (Fig. 2, top panel). The lag was not linked to pH or temperature jump. ECL experiments showed that the complex was not fully dissociated at the beginning of the reaction (data not shown). Moreover, the lag was still present when the complex was first dissociated in the medium without substrates (Fig. 2,bottom panel, curve 1) but was lost in the presence of BPGA (Fig. 2, bottom panel, curve 2). Therefore, the latent phase of the dissociated form is the consequence of an activation by BPGA (23.Frieden C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 471-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) of the GAPDH, with the conversion of a less active form into a more active one. The curves may be fitted to a Neet equation (22.Neet K.E. Ainslie G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 192-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).q/Et=p(1)×t+[(p(1)−p(2))/p(3)]×(e−p(3)t−1)Equation 6 where q is the observed product concentration at time t, p(2) is the rate constant at the beginning of the reaction of the less active form, p(1) is the steady-state rate constant of the BPGA-activated form, p(3) is the observed rate of the transition between the initial state and the activated state, and Et is the total enzyme concentration. Thus, the lag obtained with the complex was not only linked to the dissociation of the complex upon dilution but was also the consequence of an activation induced by BPGA. The linear part of the curves corresponds to the steady-state rate of a dissociated, BPGA-activated GAPDH, or metastable form. The complex was not fully dissociated at the beginning of the reaction, and the latent phase of the dissociated form was longer than the one obtained with the complex. It was thus likely that BPGA acted faster on the complex than on the dissociated form. Nonetheless, the BPGA-activated forms originating from the dissociated form or from the complex have similar activities. The average steady-state rates of these forms had a value of 340 ± 31 s−1. In contrast to the enzyme embedded in the complex, the stable GAPDH using NADPH displayed no lag, indicating that this form was not activated by BPGA. The average rate constant of this form was about 197 ± 27 s−1, which is lower than that obtained with the BPGA-activated form released from the complex. The above theory was used to describe thermodynamically how protein-protein interactions act via imprinting to modify the rate constant of a chemical process. Equation 5 can be used to calculate the free energies of activation of the metastable form ΔGμ≠ and of the stable form ΔGς≠ for the NADH- and NADPH-dependent GAPDH activities. The imprinting effects of PRK on GAPDH were quantified with Equations 1 and 2. The energy diagrams are reported in Fig. 3. The complex was incubated with 1 mm NAD(P)(H), and NADH-dependent GAPDH activity was monitored. Similarly to the control experiment (complex alone incubated at 30 °C), the reaction rates were not affected by incubation with 1 mmNAD(H) (data not shown). However, incubation with 1 mmNADP(H) decreased the steady-state reaction rates monoexponentially with time (Fig. 4). These data were thus fitted to the equation. y=y0+A×(e−λ×t−1)Equation 7 where A and λ are the amplitude and the time constant of the inhibition process, respectively, and y0is the steady-state rate (average value of 147 ± 5 s−1) of the metastable NADH-GAPDH before incubation of the complex. The reaction rate constants decreased with a mean time constant of 0.003 ± 4 × 10−4s−1, corresponding to a half-time of inhibition of about 4 min, whatever the cofactor used: NADP or NADPH. 1mm NADP gave 50% inhibition and a final average rate constant of 73 ± 5 s−1, whereas incubation with 1mm NADPH gave 20% inhibition and a final average rate of 117 ± 2 s−1. When following NADPH-dependent activity of GAPDH for the complex incubated at 30 °C, in the absence of any cofactor, the activity increased from 340 ± 31 s−1 to 435 ± 17 s−1. Because hydrophobic forces increase with temperature (24.Prat-Gay G. Paladini Jr., A. Stein M. Wolosiuk R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20913-20921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this activation might be linked to the enhancement of hydrophobic forces in the complex. Taking into account this temperature effect, 1mm NADPH did not significantly modify the rate of the metastable GAPDH. Only 1mm NADP increased this reaction rate to an average value of 687 ± 73 s−1. To determine for both NADH-and NADPH-dependent GAPDH activities whether the amplitude of the effects was dependent on the concentration of the cofactor used, we repeated the same experiments at NADP concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5mm and at NADPH concentrations ranging from 1 to 10mm(Fig. 5). Increasing NADPH in the incubation mixture results in an increase of NADPH concentration in the reaction mixture. As a consequence, NADPH-dependent activity interferes, whereas measuring GAPDH activity using NADH and the effects of NADPH concentrations higher than 1mm cannot be studied on NADH-dependent activity of GAPDH. On the contrary, the activation of NADPH-dependent activity of GAPDH may be followed. When increasing NADP concentration in the incubation mixture, the percentage of inhibition of the NADH-dependent GAPDH activity increased and reached a maximal value of 81 ± 6 with a K̃0.5 of 0.65 ± 0.18mm, whereas the percentage of activation of the NADPH-dependent GAPDH activity increased and reached a maximal value of 121 ± 1 with a K̃0.5 of 0.65 ± 0.02mm. The percentage of activation by NADPH of the NADPH-dependent GAPDH activity increased and reached a maximal value of 169 ± 7 with a K̃0.5 of 2.9 ± 0.9mm. When possible, to check whether the absence of effects observed after incubation with 1mm NAD(H) was linked to the concentration used, the complex was also incubated with 5mm NAD(H), and no effect was observed. The changes in the GAPDH catalytic rate constants upon incubation of the complex with NADP(H) were used to determine the effects of these cofactors on the imprinting of PRK on GAPDH. All of the calculations were done with 1mmNADP(H), because it was possible to quantify and compare the effects of all of the cofactors at this concentration. The free energies of activation obtained for the metastable GAPDH released from the complex incubated at 30 °C without cofactors (ΔGμ≠) or from the metastable GAPDH released from the complex incubated with NADP(H) (ΔGμ′≠) were obtained from Equation 5. The impact ΔX of NADP (H) on the imprinting effect was then determined using Equations 3 and 4 (Table I). Interestingly, ΔGς≠ remained constant, because none of these cofactors affected the rate constants of stable GAPDH.Table IImpact of NADP(H) on the imprinting effect of PRK on GAPDHNADH-GAPDHΔGμ≠(kJ·mol−1)61.7 ± 0.1(ΔGμ′≠)NADP(kJ·mol−1)63.5 ± 0.2(ΔX)NADP (kJ·mol−1)1.8 ± 0.2(ΔGμ′≠)NADPH(kJ·mol−1)62.3 ± 0.05(ΔX)NADPH (kJ·mol−1)0.6 ± 0.1NADPH-GAPDHΔGμ≠(kJ·mol−1)59.6 ± 0.2(ΔGμ≠)temperature(kJ·mol−1)59.0 ± 0.1(ΔGμ′≠)NADP(kJ·mol−1)57.8 ± 0.3(ΔX)NADP (kJ·mol−1)−1.2 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab When possible, ΔX was also calculated for the maximum percentage of inhibition or activation obtained when varying the concentration of cofactors in the incubation mixture. With NADP, the ΔX was multiplied by 2.3 and 1.7 for NADH- and NADPH-dependent activities, respectively. For NADPH-dependent activity, the effect of 1mmNADPH on the imprinting was negligible, but it had a value of −1.3 kJ · mol−1 for the estimated maximum percentage of activation. The time course of PRK activity within the complex showed a lag, which has been previously linked to the conversion of the PRK in the complex to a dissociated metastable form (10.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This curve may also be fitted to Equation 6. The parameter p(3) is the apparent dissociation rate constant of the complex, p(1) is the steady-state rate of the metastable form of PRK, and p(2) is the rate of the PRK within the complex. The reaction rates of PRK embedded in the complex and of the metastable form after incubation at 30 °C in the absence of any cofactor were constant, whereas the apparent dissociation rate constants tended to decrease monoexponentially as a consequence of enhanced hydrophobic forces. Incubation with 1 mm NAD(H) had no effect. The lag was still present, although affected, when the complex was incubated with 1 mm NADP(H). The initial rate (p(2)) remained constant, and PRK activity within the complex was not greatly affected (mean = 15 ± 3.2 s−1) (data not shown). On the contrary, the average steady-state rates p(1) of the metastable PRK increased from 118 ± 7 s−1without incubation to 179 ± 7 s−1 after incubation with 1 mm NADPH and 389 ± 35 s−1 after incubation with 1 mm NADP. The experimental data p(1) derived from Equation 6 were plotted against incubation time with the cofactors (Fig. 6A). These data may be fitted to the following equation.y=y0+A×(1−e−λ×t)Equation 8 where y0 is the initial rate constant of the metastable PRK before incubation of the complex and Aand λ are the amplitude and the time constant of the activation process, respectively. The mean time constant of activation by NADP or NADPH, λ, was 0.003 ± 8 × 10−4s−1, corresponding to a half-time of activation of about 4 min. The increase in the reaction rates p(1) as a function of incubation time with 1 mm NADP(H) was concomitant to an increase in the apparent dissociation rate constant p(3) of the complex. Thus, the complex probably underwent a conformation change leading to faster dissociation (Fig. 6B). This effect was confirmed by immunoblots of the complex mixed with 1 mmNAD(P)(H) for 1 h. The complex was slightly dissociated after incubation with 1 mm NAD(H), as was the control. There was greater dissociation after incubation with 1 mm NADP(H), although the complex was still detected. This dissociation may be due to weaker protein-protein interactions within the complex after incubation with NADP(H) (Fig. 6C). The imprinting effects of GAPDH on PRK have been established (10.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The estimated rate constants for the metastable PRK released from the complex incubated with NADP(H) were used to determine the impact of these cofactors on the imprinting. The free energy of activation of the reaction catalyzed by the metastable PRK released from the incubated complex (ΔGμ′≠) and the free energy of activation of the reaction catalyzed by the metastable PRK released from an untreated complex (ΔGμ≠) were calculated (Equations 1 and 2). We then determined from Equations 3 and 4 the fraction of energy attributed to the presence of NADP(H) that is responsible for altering the imprinting effect (Table II).Table IIImpact of NADP(H) on the imprinting effect of GAPDH on PRKPRKΔGμ≠(kJ·mol−1)62.3 ± 0.1(ΔGμ′≠)NADP(kJ·mol−1)59.3 ± 0.2(ΔX)NADP (kJ·mol−1)−3 ± 0.2(ΔGμ′≠)NADPH(kJ·mol−1)61.2 ± 0.1(ΔX)NADPH (kJ·mol−1)−1.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab As for GAPDH, the amplitude of the effects observed on the metastable PRK was dependent on the concentration of NADP(H) used in the incubation mixture (data not shown). The maximum ‖ΔX‖ reached were 1.3- and 3-fold higher after incubation with different concentrations of NADP and NADPH, respectively. The maximum percentage of activation reached with NADP was 367 ± 37 with a K̃0.5 of 0.75 ± 0.25 mm. After incubation with NADPH, the maximum percentage of activation was 274 ± 40 with a K̃0.5 of 2.9 ± 1 mm. Interestingly, these same cofactors had no effect on PRK activity when the stable enzyme was incubated (data not shown). We demonstrate here that PRK has an imprinting effect on GAPDH. We calculated and compared the free energies of activation of the reactions catalyzed by the metastable GAPDH and the stable enzyme to quantify the imprinting effect of PRK on GAPDH. We conclude that protein-protein interactions are responsible for decreasing the energy barrier of the reactions catalyzed by the metastable GAPDH when NADH-dependent activity (−3.8 ± 0.5 kJ·mol−1) or NADPH-dependent activity (−1.3 ± 0.3 kJ·mol−1) is monitored. This decrease is reminiscent of the one observed with PRK (10.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14.Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25.Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We find that NAD(H) has no effects on GAPDH when it is in the complex, whereas incubation of the complex with NADP(H) leads to activation of the metastable GAPDH when monitoring NADPH-dependent activity and to inhibition of the metastable GAPDH using NADH. None of these cofactors has an effect on the stable enzyme. Furthermore, the regulation of GAPDH within this complex and its activation by BPGA are very similar to that of the 600-kDa form of GAPDH in higher plants (17.Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6456-6461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18.Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Scheibe R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the complex can replace this 600-kDa form. This complex is all the more important because the independent stable GAPDH purified from C. reinhardtii is neither regulated by NAD(P)(H) nor activated by BPGA. We show that NAD(H) has no effect on the metastable PRK, whereas NADP(H) has a positive effect. The stable PRK is not regulated by either of these metabolites. The half-maximum activation of PRK or of NADPH-dependent activity or the half-maximum inhibition of NADH-dependent activity of GAPDH is obtained for the same NADP concentration (mean value of 0.68 ± 0.16 mm). The time required to obtain 50% of the effect of NADP on the metastable PRK or on the NADH-dependent activity of GAPDH is also the same (4 min). The half-maximum of activation for PRK and NADPH-dependent activity of GAPDH is obtained for a mean value of 2.93 ± 0.87 mm NADPH. The effects of 1 mm NADP(H) on the imprinting were quantified. These two cofactors significantly decrease the energy barrier of the reactions catalyzed by the metastable GAPDH using NADPH as cofactor (ΔXNADP of −1.2 ± 0.3 kJ·mol−1) and by PRK released from the incubated complex (ΔXNADP of −3 ± 0.2 kJ·mol−1). This effect is even greater at higher NADP (or NADPH) concentrations and reaches a ΔXmaxof −2 kJ·mol−1 (or −1.3 kJ·mol−1) for NADPH-dependent activity of GAPDH and −3.9 kJ·mol−1 (or −3.3 kJ·mol−1) for PRK. On the contrary, the energy barrier of the reaction catalyzed by the NADH-GAPDH released from an incubated complex is higher than the energy barrier of the reaction catalyzed by GAPDH released from an untreated complex (ΔXNADP of +1.8 ± 0.2 kJ·mol−1). This effect also increases with higher concentrations of NADP, and the ΔXmax reaches a value of +4.2 kJ·mol−1. The results obtained with GAPDH and PRK demonstrate how important protein-protein interactions are for the emergence of new regulatory properties of the enzymes involved in multi-enzyme complexes. First, the higher activities of the metastable enzymes compared with those of the stable enzymes are the consequence of information transfer within the complex. In this way, part of the energy stored during association between the enzymes is used to increase the rate of catalysis after disruption via imprinting. This information transfer corresponds to stabilization-destabilization energies that come from a conformation change in the enzymes within the complex. Second, the information transfer may also be modulated by the binding of a ligand, such as NADP or NADPH. The signal triggered by these two cofactors may thus have two targets within a single “control unit.” The extra 2′-phosphate present on NADP(H) compared with NAD(H) is probably responsible for the induced conformation change and the subsequent effect on enzyme activity. The extra positive charge on the nicotinamide ring of NADP might also be responsible for the greater efficiency of this cofactor compared with its reduced form, NADPH. Imprinting has also been demonstrated for copolymers and their ligands (26.Vlatakis G. Andersson L.I. Muller R. Mosbach K. Nature. 1993; 361: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 27.Andersson L.I. Muller R. Vlatakis G. Mosbach K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4788-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Some enzymes may also retain for a while the conformation they had before the release of the reaction product (28.Soulie J.M. Riviere M. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29.Storer A.C. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem.

How different conformational states can be dictated by the “history” of sample preparation has been widely described for lipase (35.Gonzalez-Navarro H. Bano M.C. Abad C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3174-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which retains an active conformation induced by high detergent concentration. Thus, there is no doubt that imprinting and memory effects are widespread in cell biology and that some of the functional properties of enzymes are due to these effects. Nonetheless, the physical nature of the forces involved in these processes (electrostatic, hydrophobic, and Van der Waal's interactions) remains to be elucidated.

The liver-specific MAT isoform, MAT III, is a homodimer of a 43.7-kDa subunit that organizes in three nonsequential α-β domains. Although MAT III structure has been recently resolved, little is known about its folding mechanism. Equilibrium unfolding and refolding of MAT III, and the monomeric mutant R265H, have been monitored using different physical parameters. Tryptophanyl fluorescence showed a three-state folding mechanism. The first unfolding step was a folding/association process as indicated by its dependence on protein concentration. The monomeric folding intermediate produced was the predominant species between 1.5 and 3m urea. It had a relatively compact conformation with tryptophan residues and hydrophobic surfaces occluded from the solvent, although its N-terminal region may be very unstructured. The second unfolding step monitored the denaturation of the intermediate. Refolding of the intermediate showed first order kinetics, indicating the presence of a kinetic intermediate within the folding/association transition. Its presence was confirmed by measuring the 1,8-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonic acid binding in the presence of tripolyphosphate.

The classical investigation of Anfinsen and co-workers (1.Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the sequence of amino acids that comprise a polypeptide encodes the information required to reach the correct three-dimensional fold of a protein. However, the mechanism by which the amino acid sequence directs the folding of a protein is still unknown. Typically, protein folding studies have concentrated on small, single domain proteins that fold rapidly and avoid aggregation (2.Creighton T.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 3.Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3147-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 4.Serrano L. Kellis Jr., J.T. Cann P. Matouschek A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 783-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, in living cells, most proteins have more than 100 residues with multiple folding domains and subunits. These large proteins are not likely to follow all of the folding principles established for smaller proteins. They probably have more complex folding rules so that models based on studies of small globular proteins may not fully explain their folding and assembly (5.Neet K.E. Timm D.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Folding of multidomain or multisubunit proteins usually involves the formation of partially folded intermediates. Although the basic principles governing protein folding are probably general, folding of oligomeric proteins may be a two-state process or involve monomeric or multimeric intermediates (6.Clark A.C. Sinclair J.F. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10773-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Doyle S.M. Braswell E.H. Teschke C.M.

Rudolph R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press (Oxford University, Press), Oxford1989Google Scholar). All these different mechanisms make it difficult to derive a global mechanism to describe the folding of oligomeric proteins, and consequently each protein must be studied individually. Defining the complete folding pathway requires the identification and characterization of all stable and transient conformational states that exist along the folding and unfolding pathways.S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMetS-adenosylmethionineANS1,8-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonic acidMATmethionine adenosyltransferaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMetS-adenosylmethionineANS1,8-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonic acidMATmethionine adenosyltransferaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight is an essential metabolite in all cells.

In all organisms studied so far, from Escherichia coli to humans, sequence homologies show that MAT is an exceptionally well conserved enzyme through evolution (17.Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P.

In mammalian tissues three different forms of MAT (MAT I, MAT III, and MAT II) have been identified that are the product of two different genes (MAT1A and MAT2A, respectively) (21.Okada G. Teraoka H. Tsukada K. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22.Sullivan D.M. Hoffman J.L.

The gene MAT2A encodes a 396-amino acid catalytic subunit (α2) expressed in all mammalian tissues (16.Kotb M. Geller A.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26.Mitsui K. Teraoka H. Tsukada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11211-11216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAT II consist of α2catalytic and β regulatory subunits, although the stoichiometry of the oligomer has not been yet established. The gene MAT1A is expressed mainly in adult liver and encodes a 395-amino acid catalytic subunit (α1) that organizes in dimers, MAT III, and tetramers, MAT I (17.Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 20.Kotb M. Mudd S.H. Mato J.M. Geller A.M. Kredich N.M. Chou J.Y. Cantoni G.L. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 51-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The reason for the presence of these two different isoenzymes in liver has not been yet elucidated, although it may be an adaptation to the metabolic requirements of the liver. The liver has the highest specific activity of MAT, which agrees with the observation that up to 85% of all methylation reactions and as much as 50% of methionine catabolism occur in this tissue (27.Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 29: 707-720Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 28.Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Based upon the different kinetic properties of MAT I and MAT III isoforms, MAT III has been considered the liver-specific enzyme. While MAT I, similar to MAT II in extrahepatic tissues, may maintain the basal AdoMet levels required by cells, MAT III would be responsible for the clearance of methionine after a load of this amino acid. E. coli and liver MAT have been crystallized and their structure solved, showing that the tetramer structure of both enzymes is essentially the same (29.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 300: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of three structural domains related to each other by a pseudo 3-fold symmetry. Pairs of subunits form dimers, and each dimer is a tight complex, with a wide interface area between subunits, that accommodate two active sites (29.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 300: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The active site of the enzyme is made by both subunits. However, no information about the folding mechanism of MAT is still available. We have characterized the folding-assembly pathway of MAT III, the specific liver isoform, by identifying the intermediates involved in the process. Our kinetic and equilibrium experiments indicate that the folding of MAT III involves the formation of two folding intermediates, which were identified by their intrinsic fluorescence, ANS binding capacity, and hydrodynamic volume.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsColumns and chromatography media were from Amersham Biosciences. Urea was from Invitrogen. All other reagents were from Sigma.Site-directed MutagenesisA 1.2-kilobase fragment containing the rat MAT1A coding region (32.Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sanchez-Gongora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a pET vector. The resulting plasmid includes a 5′ sequence that encodes for 6 histidine residues and a thrombin cleavage site in-frame with the rat liver MAT1A coding region. Mutants were obtained by inverse polymerase chain reaction according to the procedure of Pérez-Mato et al. (33.Pérez-Mato I. Castro C. Ruiz F.A. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17075-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutants were identified by sequencing the complete MAT cDNA.Expression and Purification of His-tagged MAT I/III R265H MutantMAT I/III R265H mutant was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as previously described (33.Pérez-Mato I. Castro C. Ruiz F.A. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17075-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recombinant MAT I/III R265H mutant protein was purified from the bacterial cytosolic extracts by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mNaCl, 75 mm imidazole following the procedures described by Pérez-Mato et al. (33.Pérez-Mato I. Castro C. Ruiz F.A. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17075-17080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). No changes in the fluorescence, CD spectra, oligomeric state, and enzymatic activity were observed after digestion of the recombinant proteins with thrombin (data not shown). Therefore all the assays were carried out using the His-tagged recombinant proteins.Purification of MAT from Rat LiverMAT III was purified from rat liver according to the procedure described previously (34.Sánchez del Pino M.M. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23476-23482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein purity was more than 95% as estimated by SDS-PAGE (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar).Size Exclusion ChromatographyProtein samples (4.6 μm) were analyzed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 in an AKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). After sample injection (100 μl), proteins were isocratically eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Protein elution was monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm. The elution volumes (ml) of the standard proteins were: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), 8.1; ferritin (440 kDa), 10.22; catalase (232 kDa), 12.11; ovoalbumin (43 kDa), 14.73; chymotrypsin A (25 kDa), 18; ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), 19. According to the elution volume of the standard proteins, the estimated molecular masses of native rat liver MAT III and R265H MAT I/III mutant were 90 and 41 kDa, respectively.Equilibrium Denaturation ExperimentsThe buffer composition in all equilibrium experiments was 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 3.6 mm dithiothreitol with different urea concentrations. All experiments were performed at 25 °C with the protein concentration indicated in the figure legends and incubated in the presence of urea for at least 2 h. Unfolding was monitored by recording the fluorescence emission spectra at each urea concentration from 300 to 450 nm emission wavelength using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm in a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. An emission wavelength of 321 nm is used in all plots, because this is the wavelength where differences were maximal. After recording the emission spectra, ANS was added from a 1 mm stock solution to make a final concentration of 10 μm. When required, tripolyphosphate/magnesium from a stock of 50 mm was added to make a final concentration of 500 μm. The fluorescence at 470 nm emission wavelength was recorded in both cases using an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. When unfolding was monitored by measuring the tripolyphosphatase activity, MAT III was incubated for 2 h at 25 °C in 990 μl of the above buffer. After this time, the reaction was started by addition of 10 μl of tripolyphosphate/magnesium to make the final concentration 2 mm. At different incubation times, aliquots of 100 μl were removed to determine the formation of inorganic phosphate according to the method of Lanzetta (36.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). For refolding experiments MAT III was unfolded in the same buffer with a final urea concentration of 8 m. After 2 h at 25 °C refolding was started by diluting unfolded MAT III 20 times to obtain the desired urea concentrations. Refolding proceeded for 2 additional hours. Fluorescence values were normalized by the protein concentration and expressed as arbitrary units per nanomolar MAT III monomers. Enzyme activity was expressed as min−1.Refolding Kinetic ExperimentsMAT III was partially unfolded for 2 h at 25 °C in the same buffer indicated above with a final urea concentration ranging from 1.4 to 2.6 m. Refolding was started by a 1/10 dilution of the MAT III solution to obtain a final urea concentration of 0.26 m. Intrinsic fluorescence was monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 321 nm, respectively. When ANS binding was monitored all solutions contained 10 μm ANS, and refolding was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 470 nm. The approximate dead time was about 10 s.Limited Proteolysis and Mass Spectrometry AnalysisLimited proteolysis was performed by incubation of MAT III (0.5 mg/ml) with trypsin (0.01 mg/ml) in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, at 25 °C for different periods of time. Protein fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometry analysis was carried out with a Micromass MALDI-TOF spectrometer. After digestion, reaction mixture was 5-fold diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then spotted (1.5 μl) onto the MALDI target, where it was mixed with an equal volume of matrix (cinnaminic acid). The analysis was performed using a laser energy of 70%, and Mr was calculated using adenocorticotropic hormone and trypsin autolysis fragments as near point and internal standards, respectively.Data AnalysisEquilibrium experiments were all fitted to a three-state model with a folding/association step and an additional folding step (Equation 1). As discussed below, the folding intermediate is assumed to be monomeric.N2↔K12I↔K22UEquation 1 where N, I, and U are native, intermediate, and unfolded protein, respectively. K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants for the folding/association and folding steps, respectively. If the species present at each urea concentration are expressed as fraction (f), then the conservation of mass and the equilibrium constants can be expressed as follows, fN+fI+fU=1Equation 2 K1=2fI2PfN;K2=fUfIEquation 3 where P is the total concentration of MAT III subunits. From Equations 2 and 3, and solving for the fraction of each species we get the following equation. fI=K1(1+K2)4P−1+1+8PK1(1+K2)2;Equation 4 fN=1−fI(1+K2);fU=fIK2 The dependence of the equilibrium constants on the denaturant (D) concentration can be obtained form the free energy of unfolding ΔGu ΔGu=−RT lnKu=ΔGuH2O−m[D]Equation 5 where ΔGuH2O is the free energy of unfolding in water, and m is the coefficient of dependence on the denaturant concentration.The measured signals (SD) depend on the species composition at each urea concentration according to the following equation, SD=SNfN+SIfI+SUfUEquation 6 where SN, SI, and SU are the specific signal of native, intermediate, and unfolded protein, respectively.The equilibrium experiments were fitted in the spreadsheet Microsoft Excel as follows. The equilibrium constants K1 and K2 were calculated for each denaturant concentration using initial estimate values of ΔGuH2O and m. Then, the fraction of each species was calculated using Equation 4. The specific signal of each species was then calculated as the regression coefficients of the fraction of the species in a multiple linear regression analysis between the calculated fractions and the measured signals at all urea concentrations, using a built-in function of the program. This is like solving Equation 6 for all urea concentrations. The theoretical signal was then calculated using Equation 6. The agreement between calculated and measured signal was then evaluated by least square. Changing only ΔGuH2O and m using an iterative procedure (quasi-Newton method) obtained the best fit. In this way, all the different types of signals measured could be fitted simultaneously to the same folding mechanism with only two variables per transition. When several conditions were evaluate at the same time, such as unfolding and refolding or different protein concentrations, average specific signals were used to calculate the theoretical signal. Sometimes the specific signal appeared to depend on the denaturant concentration. In such cases, a slope was introduced in the fitting process.Kinetic data were fitted to single first or second order rate equations, S(t)=S∞+Ae−ktEquation 7 S(t)=S∞+A1+PktEquation 8 where S(t) is the signal recorded at time t, S∞ is the signal at t = ∞, A is the amplitude of the signal, and k is the rate constant.RESULTSIntrinsic FluorescenceThe equilibrium unfolding and refolding in the presence of urea was monitored by changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of MAT III at 321 nm (Fig. 1A). The unfolding of MAT III was a completely reversible process with two transitions. The initial drop in fluorescence was the result of a decrease in intensity, whereas the second one reflected a red shift of the spectrum without a significant change in fluorescence intensity (inset in Fig. 1). These data indicate the presence of a stable folding intermediate whose tryptophan residues are still buried within the protein. The midpoints for the transitions were 1.10 and 3.82m urea using 0.28 μm MAT III monomer (see thermodynamic parameters in Table I).Table IFitting parametersThermodynamic parametersTransitionProteinmΔGuH2OD0.5kcal mol−1m−1kcal mol−1m1stR265H1.31−0.09−0.071stwtawt, wild type.5.556.121.102ndBoth1.154.413.82Global conformational stabilitywtR265HΔGu (kcal mol−1)14.934.32Physicochemical parametersParameterProteinFig.NIUIntrinsic fluorescencewt1A0.840.600.32R265H1A1.16wt1B0.890.610.22ANS fluorescencewt2A0.520.090.03wt2B0.500.09−0.01Activitywt2A3.600.17−0.13Elution volumewt314.2514.3813.07R265H315.3114.3613.10Kinetic parametersUrea[MAT]AmplitudekmnmAU/nmmin−12.329.60.1620.272.32960.2270.272.329600.1780.241.42960.1690.232.02960.1840.202.32960.1680.212.62960.1830.22a wt, wild type. Open table in a new tab Equilibrium experiments performed with the mutant R265H, which is a monomer (37.Mato I.P. Sánchez del Pino M.M. Chamberlin M.E. Mudd S.H. Mato J.M. Corrales F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13803-13809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also showed two transitions (Fig. 1A). The first transition took place at a lower urea concentration compare with wild type MAT III, whereas the second transition paralleled the one observed at 3.82 m urea. This result suggests that both proteins unfold via the same folding intermediate.The second transition, corresponding to the unfolding of the intermediate, must be a unimolecular process, since the R265H mutant is a monomer. Thus, we studied the protein concentration dependence of the first transition. As shown in Fig. 1B, the transition was shifted toward higher urea concentrations with increasing MAT III concentrations. This result suggests that the transition observed at about 1 m urea represents the folding/association process between native MAT III and a stable intermediate.Enzyme Activity and ANS BindingEquilibrium experiments were also monitored by measuring tripolyphosphatase activity as well as ANS binding capacity. Both parameters showed a single transition at about 1m urea (Fig. 2A). ANS binds to large patches of hydrophobic surface exposed to solvent and has been widely used to probe folding intermediates. However, ANS seemed to bind the native conformation of the enzyme rather than the intermediate. We have determined an apparent binding stoichiometry of 1 mol of ANS per MAT III subunit (not shown), suggesting that ANS binds to a specific site. Recently, the crystal structure of ANS bound to a single site of a protein has been solved (38.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Luger K. Kabsch W. Amrhein N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6345-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A similar environment was found in the MAT III structure at the entrance of substrates to the active site. Supporting the existence of such a binding site was the quenching of the fluorescence signal produced by the addition of the substrates of the enzyme (Fig. 2A). Thus, enzyme activity and ANS binding are both probably probing the conformation of the same structural domain of the protein. This would explain the parallel loss of activity and ANS binding upon unfolding of the native protein.Figure 2ANS binding. Unfolding and refolding of MAT III was monitored by its ANS binding capacity as well as by its tripolyphosphatase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, ANS fluorescence during unfolding, in the absence (○) and in the presence of tripolyphosphate (●), and refolding, in the absence (▵) and in the presence of tripolyphosphate (▴), of MAT III using a subunit protein concentration of 280 nm. The tripolyphosphatase activity during unfolding (♦) was also monitored using a subunit protein concentration of 296 nm. B, ANS fluorescence during unfolding of MAT III was monitored at different subunit protein concentrations: 290 nm (○) and 1.48 μm (▪). The solid lines represent the fit to Equation 6 performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fitting parameters are indicated in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hydrodynamic VolumeThe compactness of the species present at different urea concentrations was studied by gel filtration chromatography. In the absence of urea the elution volume of MAT III and R265H mutant corresponded to that of dimeric (14.3 ml) and monomeric (15.3 ml) forms, respectively (Fig. 3). However, as the urea concentration increased the elution volume of both proteins became closer until reaching the same intermediate value (14.4 ml) at about 1.25m urea. At higher urea concentrations the decrease in elution volume was the same for MAT III and R265H mutant until reaching the value of unfolded monomer (13.1 ml). These data also support the presence of a common folding intermediate in the unfolding pathway of both proteins. This folding intermediate had a less compact structure than the monomer as indicated by its larger hydrodynamic volume.Figure 3Hydrodynamic volume. The compactness of the species present at different urea concentrations was studied by gel filtration chromatography using a subunit protein concentration of 4.6 μm. The elution volume of MAT III (○) and the R265H mutant (●) at different urea concentrations is represented.

In the absence of urea MAT III was resistant to cleavage by trypsin for 1 h at 25 °C (Fig. 4). However, in the presence of 1m urea, a single proteolytic fragment was detected by SDS-PAGE. It was estimated to have about 3 kDa less than native MAT III. This is consistent with a single cleavage either at the N- or C-terminal end of the protein. The mass of the complementary fragment, as determined by mass spectrometry, was 3480.5 Da, which is consistent with a cleavage at the N-terminal side of lysine 33. This residue is located near the interacting interface between subunits. Thus, in order for this residue to become accessible to trypsin, a monomeric intermediate should be present.Figure 4Trypsin accessibility of MAT III folding intermediate. Limited proteolysis experiments were performed in the absence and in the presence of 1 m urea as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein subunit concentration was 11.4 μm. Protein fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (top panel). The formation of the complementary fragment from MAT III trypsin digestion as well as its Mrwas determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis (bottom panel). MAT III was incubated in the absence of urea for 60 min (trace a) or in the presence of 1 m urea for 0 (trace b), 30 (trace c), and 60 (trace d) min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2063046586,"Cyclin-dependent kinase subunit (CKS) proteins bind to cyclin-dependent kinases and target various proteins to phosphorylation and proteolysis during cell division. Crystal structures showed that CKS can exist both in a closed monomeric conformation when bound to the kinase and in an inactive C-terminal β-strand-exchanged conformation. With the exception of the hinge loop, however, both crystal structures are identical, and no new protein interface is formed in the dimer. Protein engineering studies have pinpointed the crucial role of the proline 90 residue of the p13suc1 CKS protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe in the monomer-dimer equilibrium and have led to the concept of a loaded molecular spring of the β-hinge motif. Mutation of this hinge proline into an alanine stabilizes the protein and prevents the occurrence of swapping. However, other mutations further away from the hinge as well as ligand binding can equally shift the equilibrium between monomer and dimer. To address the question of differential affinity through relief of the strain, here we compare the ligand binding of the monomeric form of wild-type S. pombe p13suc1 and its hinge mutant P90A in solution by NMR spectroscopy. We indeed observed a 5-fold difference in affinity with the wild-type protein being the most strongly binding. Our structural study further indicates that both wild-type and the P90A mutant proteins adopt in solution the closed conformation but display different dynamic properties in the C-terminal β-sheet involved in domain swapping and protein interactions.

Des. 2000; 8: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and all contained the conserved cluster of basic residues that form the potential anion-binding site. A recent NMR study has confirmed that those residues map to the interaction site with the phospho-(Ser/Thr)-Pro motif on the ligand (8.Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The conserved CKS fold further contains a four-stranded β-sheet flanked by two α-helices where the four-stranded β-sheet has on one side a patch of conserved hydrophobic residues that bind tightly to the C-terminal domain of the kinase as revealed by the crystal structure of the human CKSHs1·CDK2 complex (15.Bourne Y.

Several crystal structures have revealed that the CKS monomers can form a dimer by exchange of their respective C-terminal β-strands (β4) (9.Parge H.E. Arvai A.S. Murtari D. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A.

Structure. 2000; 8: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) of the S. pombe p13suc1 CKS monomeric protein suggest that dimerization occurs in the early events of the folding process via an intermediate state or even imply in vivo chaperone molecules not yet characterized. However, it is clear that this domain swapping requires only a minimal conformational change in the hinge region preceding the β4-strand. Moreover, the conservation of this H XPEPH motif among the different members of the CKS family argues for a biologically relevant role that might be related to a conformational control of the CKS association with the CDK complexes (19.Endicott J.A. Nurse P. Structure. 1995; 3: 321-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20.Pines J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, as this hinge region switches from a turn (in the closed globular form) to an extended conformation (in the open exchanged form), the protein in its dimeric form can no longer interact with the kinase (15.Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Very recently it was shown that single point mutations of residues as far as 20 Å from the hinge motif or, alternatively, ligand binding can equally shift the equilibrium between both forms toward the monomeric form (21.Schymkowitz J.W.H. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Friedler A. Itzhaki L.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whereas these last results suggest that the strain accumulated throughout the protein is actively used to enhance ligand binding, many questions remain, one of the most important being the uncertainty on the solution conformation of this β4-strand. Small angle x-ray scattering studies on the native S. pombep13suc1 CKS monomeric protein in solution yielded an unexpected large gyration radius, suggesting that CKS even in its monomeric form is at least partially in an open conformation with this C-terminal β-strand protruding in solution (22.Birck C. Vachette P. Welch M. Swaren P. Samama J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the same S. pombe p13suc1 CKS protein, mutation of the first proline residue of the hinge region to an alanine (p13P90A) has been reported to prevent the swapping process, to increase the protein stability, and to simplify the folding kinetics (23.Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Sánchez del Pino M. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To address the question of differential affinity through relief of the strain, here we compare the ligand binding of the monomeric form of wild-type S. pombe p13suc1 and its hinge mutant P90A in solution by NMR spectroscopy. We indeed observed a 5-fold difference in affinity with the wild-type protein being the most strongly binding. We therefore continued our NMR analysis to characterize structurally the CKS protein in solution and to investigate the role of the proline residue Pro-90 (bold underlined) in the hinge region (motif H X PEPH). We found that both wild-type and the P90A mutant proteins adopt in solution the closed conformation but display different dynamic properties in the C-terminal β-sheet involved in domain swapping and protein interactions. The flexibility imposed by the loaded molecular spring that is the hinge region can provide for the diversity in binding partners that the CKS protein has to recognize during the cell cycle. The p13suc1 gene was cloned at the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the T7 promotor-based vector pRK172 (3.Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The proline mutation into alanine at residue position 90 was obtained by PCR using primers containing a single point mutation converting the proline GCA codon into an alanine CCA codon. For production of uniformly 15N,13C-labeled p13suc1 proteins, BL21 cells hosting the plasmid were grown in M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl (1 g liter−1) and [13C]glucose (2 g liter−1) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) to A600 = 0.6–1.0 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. After centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 × g, the cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm MgCl2, and traces of DNase and RNase and disrupted with a French press. After centrifugation of the solution for 2 h at 4 °C at 17,000 × g, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the Tris-HCl buffer. Proteins were purified with a Q anion chromatography-Sepharose column equilibrated in the Tris-HCl buffer with a NaCl elution gradient (0–0.5 m) followed by a gel filtration step with a G75 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, NaCl buffer. At each step, fractions containing the pure monomeric form of p13suc1 proteins as checked by native and SDS-polyacrylamide gels were pooled together and concentrated. The dimeric fraction represented less than 5% of the wild-type protein and was separated from the monomeric fraction during the purification process. NMR samples were prepared by dialysis of the protein solution against 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4solution (pH 6.8) in 5%:95% D2O/H2O and concentrated by centrifugation to a final protein concentration of 2 mm (Vivaspin 5 kDa). NMR data were recorded at 20 °C on a Bruker DMX600 (Pasteur Lille) and on a Varian Inova 600 (Groningen) spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance 5-mm probe with a z gradient coil. Sequential backbone resonance assignments of p13suc1 and p13P90A protein were achieved using the following pairs of triple resonance experiments: HNCA/HN(CO)CA, HNCO/HN(CA)CO, CBCANH/CBCA(CO)NH, or HNCACB and combination of sensitivity enhancement versions of15N-edited HSQC-NOESY/HSQC-TOCSY (24.Grzesiek S. Bax A. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Tjandra N. Wingfield P.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1248-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For the1H/2D exchange studies, the 1H NMR sample was diluted by a factor of 2 in a deuterated phosphate buffer at 20 °C. A series of 15N HSQC spectra was acquired every 10 (four times), 40 (12 times), 80 (six times), and 160 (nine times) min. To identify the slowest exchangeable protons, a similar study was performed after a quick dialysis (2 h) against deuterated buffer. Three classes of exchange were defined: highly exchangeable protons (within 20 min), moderately protected (time of exchange <1 day), and highly protected residues (time of exchange >1 day). For the thermal studies, a series of 15N HSQC spectra was acquired at 50 μm protein concentration at different temperatures ranging from 5 °C to 50 °C in steps of 5 °C. All data were processed on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station with the program SNARF, version 0.8.9 (Frans van Hoesel, University of Groningen). For the titration experiments, a sample of the wild-type p13suc1 was prepared in a 50 mm Tris buffer as described previously (8.Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of unlabeled synthetic peptide of sequence EQPLpTPVTDL (where pT is phosphothreonine) (phospho-Cdc25 peptide) were added to a 0.50 mm15N-labeled p13suc1sample. Final concentrations were successively 0.5/0.125 mm, 0.5/0.25 mm, 0.5/0.50 mm, 0.5/1.0 mm, 0.5/1.5 mm, 0.5/2.5 mm, 0.5/5.0 mm, and 0.5/10 mm.1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured at each titration point. The binding constant was calculated as described previously (8.Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The good dispersion of the 15N HSQC spectrum indicates that the protein adopts a folded conformation in solution, justifying further efforts to the determination of the solution conformation (Fig. 1). We therefore attempted to assign the backbone resonances by heteronuclear NMR experiments. A complete backbone assignment, with the exception of the single residue Arg-39 in the anion-binding site, and the three first N-terminal residues was obtained. 2B. Odaert, I. Landrieu, K. Dijkstra, G. Schuurman-Wolters, P. Casteels, J.-M. Wieruszeski, D. Inzé, R. Scheek, and G. Lippens, manuscript submitted. A differential line broadening was observed for certain residues, especially those located near the β4-hinge region (see below). The 15N HSQC spectrum of the wild-type protein showed overall the same dispersion as the hinge mutant, suggesting that the mutation does not affect the overall structure. However, despite the use of an extensive set of triple resonance experiments, only a partial assignment was achieved with 12 of the expected 108 backbone amide bond cross-peaks missing in the15N HSQC spectrum (Table I). The missing resonances correspond to residues in the C-terminal β-sheet of the crystal structure (residues 84–97), some direct neighbors of this stretch on the β2-strand (residues 39 and 40), and residue 66 on a loop that is close in space according to the crystal structure (Fig. 2a). Line broadening was observed at the extremities of the C-terminal β-sheet (stretches 97–100 and 79–83), in the N-terminal β-sheet (stretches 27–31 and 38–43), and in the 63–68 segment interacting with the β3-strand and the β-hinge region. HSQC spectra at lower concentrations still showed this line broadening, excluding weak affinity dimerization as the dominant broadening mechanism (25.Korchuganov D.S. Nolde S.B. Reibarkh M.Y. Orekhov V.Y. Schulga A.A. Ermolyuk Y.S. Kirpichnikov M.P. Arseniev A.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2068-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26.Pfuhl M. Chen H.A. Kristensen S.M. Driscoll P.C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As the most severe line broadening was observed in the C-terminal β-sheet, we raised the hypothesis that the β-hinge region (88H XPEPH93), which was previously described to act as a loaded molecular spring (16.Schymkowitz J.W.H. Rousseau F. Irvine L.R. Itzhaki L.S. Structure. 2000; 8: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17.Schymkowitz J.W.H. Rousseau F. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 8: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), could be involved in a conformational exchange at the intermediate time scale. Small chemical shift perturbations were observed between both samples for the residues in the neighboring segment 61–67, potentially indicating subtle differences in local structure between the wild-type protein and its hinge mutant.Table IResidues whose correlation peak is missing in the HSQC spectrum of the wild type p13suc1 protein but is visible in the spectrum of the P90A mutantResidue numberResidue typeSecondary structureBinding site39Argβ2Phosphate66LeuLoop84Metβ385TyrHinge86GluHinge87ValHinge88HisHinge89ValHinge91GluHinge93HisHinge94Ileβ495Leuβ496Leuβ497Pheβ4Residue type and location in the different secondary structure elements are indicated. Open table in a new tab Residue type and location in the different secondary structure elements are indicated. Similarly to our previous interaction study involving the hinge mutant P90A (8.Landrieu I. Odaert B. Wieruszeski J.-M. Drobecq H. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1434-1438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we titrated a synthetic phosphorylated peptide of Cdc25 into a 15N-labeled p13suc1 sample and observed chemical shift changes in the corresponding HSQC spectra. The identified residues corresponded to those found for the mutant protein, confirming for both proteins a very similar binding pocket composed of residues Arg-30, Arg-39, Gln-78, Trp-82, and Arg-99 (Fig. 2b). However, when we performed a titration experiment with increasing amounts of phosphopeptide to determine an affinity constant, we found a value of 180 ± 20 μm, indicative of a 5-fold stronger binding of the phosphopeptide to the wild-type protein than to the hinge mutant (8.Landrieu I.

Even at the highest concentration of peptide, however, no additional peaks corresponding to those only present in the HSQC spectrum of the mutant protein could be observed. As the mutation allowed a complete assignment of the spectrum, we decided to first characterize the structure of the CKS protein in solution on the basis of the mutant NMR data. The secondary structure derived on the basis of the 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13CO, and 1Hα chemical shift index CSI (27.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar) was confirmed by characteristic sequential NOE contacts. NN(I, I + 1) and αN(I, I + 1) NOEs of, respectively, strong and weak intensity coincide with upfield shifts of the 1Hα/13Cα/13Co profile and downfield shifts of the 13Cβ frequencies in the segments 12–19, 45–49, 67–71, and 103–107. The three first segments correspond in the crystal structure, respectively, to the α1-, α2-, and α4-helices. The fourth segment, unsolved in the crystal structures due to dynamic disorder, adopts a helical conformation as observed for the CKS1 protein (14.Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Arvai A.S. Bernstein S.L. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of helical CSI pattern, the segment 53–56 probably does adopt the short 310 α3-helix observed in the crystal structure as suggested by strong sequential NN(I, I + 1), αN(52, 54), and αN(53, 55) NOE contacts. Strong αN(I, I + 1) NOEs, associated with a significant downfield shift of the1Hα/13Cα/13Co profile and upfield 13Cβ values defined a β-extended conformation for the strands β1 (residues 26–28), β2 (residues 36–43), and β4 (residues 94–99) of the four-stranded β-sheet. The segments (8–11 and 78–80) are equally extended but not involved in the formation of β-sheet, and the absence of any secondary CSI pattern between residues 82 and 85 confirmed that the strand β3 is not in a regular conformation in solution in agreement with the crystal structure. The C-terminal elongation of the α1-helix and the β1-strand is interrupted by the presence of the proline residues Pro-20 and Pro-29 as supported by the disruption of the CSI pattern in the vicinity of these residues. The presence of nonsequential backbone αα, αN, and NN connectivities supports the presence of a four-stranded β-sheet in the solution structure (Fig. 3). The numerous nonsequential NOEs between the β2- and β4-strands indicate that they participate in the formation of a regular antiparallel β-sheet. Finally the reversal of the protein chain in the β-hinge region of the C-terminal β-sheet is supported by strong sequential NN(89, 90), NN(90, 91), and NN(93, 94) NOEs and weak intensity αN(89, 91), αβ(89, 92), and βN(89, 92) NOEs. All these results support the view that the protein adopts in solution the overall global fold of the closed form of the zinc-mediated dimer described by x-ray studies (11.Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Brown N. Rasmussen B. Nurse P. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 1H/2D exchange experiments were used to detail the protection of the amide protons against the solvent in terms of accessibility and hydrogen bonding. As our working pH for the NMR experiments was relatively high (>6.3), we observed that most of the amide protons in the mutant protein exchanged within the first 20 min. The remaining 36 residues showed intermediate exchange rates with a time constant around 24 h or very slow exchange rates with a protection extending over 2 days. Mapping of the three exchange rate classes of the P90A mutant protein on the crystal structure (Fig. 2c) shows that most of the highly protected residues are located in the β2-strand (residues 37, 38, 41, 42, and 43) and β4-strand (residues 94–99). In contrast to the central β-strands of the β-sheet, moderate protection was observed for the external β1-strand (residue 26) and β3-strand (residues 82 and 83). A similar trend was observed for the residues of the α1- (residues 15, 18, and 22), α2- (residues 47, 51), and α4-helices (residues 70, 71, 72) and hydrophobic residues 55, 66, 74, and 76 implied in the formation of the core of the protein. An exchange experiment on the wild-type protein gave very similar results, indicating that both proteins are protected to the same extent and in the same regions. Especially protection of amide protons of residues 37, 41, 43, 98, and 99 showed that the β4-strand is in a regular conformation in the wild-type protein as well (Fig. 2c). For a better characterization of the line broadening observed for the resonances of the four-stranded β-sheet in the wild-type and mutant proteins, we studied the effect of temperature on the NMR parameters by acquiring a series of 15N HSQC spectra for both proteins between 5 °C and 50 °C (Fig. 4). To prevent aggregation, the thermal study was performed at low protein concentration (50 μm) and at temperatures well below the unfolding temperature (65 °C). Raising the temperature led to a line narrowing for the resonances of most of the residues, probably due to an accelerated overall tumbling of the molecules. In contrast, resonances of the residues at the N-terminal and C-terminal extremities disappeared at higher temperatures due to an increase of their exchange rates with water. The major difference between the two proteins resides in the behavior of those residues whose resonances were broadened or missing from the spectrum of the wild-type protein. An increase of temperature made those resonances reappear at the same chemical shift values as the corresponding resonances in the mutant protein at the same temperature. In particular, residues in the β4-strand (from 93 to 97) and in the neighboring region of the β3-strand (from 65 to 67) showed this behavior (Fig. 4). Residues in the β-hinge region (from Tyr-85 to Glu-91) could not be identified in the wild-type protein spectrum even at high temperatures. These thermal studies also allowed us to determine the amide thermal coefficients. High values in disordered or accessible parts of the protein are usually indicative of a significant degree of flexibility. We observed that some of the residues in the β-hinge region of the mutant protein, such as His-88, Val-89, and His-93, displayed even higher coefficients than those found for the flexible N- and C-terminal extremities, suggesting a high degree of internal flexibility for the β-hinge region. Such results are in accordance with the conformational heterogeneity observed in the crystal structures for this region. A similar trend is observed for the residue Tyr-27 interacting with the proline Pro-29, which introduces a bulge in the β1-strand. For the rest of the protein, no significant difference in thermal coefficients between the wild-type and the mutant proteins was observed. The small CKS protein is both functionally and structurally a remarkable protein module. A ubiquitous subunit of the CDK·cyclin complexes, it is essential for a correct progression of the cell cycle (3.Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D.

As for its structure, x-ray crystallography has identified two distinct conformations, each associated with a different assembly state: the monomer, in which the β4-"

The cell cycle is predominantly regulated by a group of protein kinases. These serine/threonine kinases are controlled by various mechanisms including proteins that act as kinase inhibitors. There are two known families of protein kinase inhibitors that comprise the p16Ink4 and p21Cip1families (1.Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K.

Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, p57Kip2 also known as Cdkn1c is the only member that maps to the human chromosomal locus at 11p15.5, a region implicated in both sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (5.Lee M.P. Hu R.-J. Johnson L.A. Feinberg A.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6.Engemann S. Strödicke M. Paulsen M. Franck O. Reinhardt R. Lane N. Reik W. Walter J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 18: 2691-2706Google Scholar). This locus is especially interesting because it contains several genes that correlate with cell proliferation, growth, and specific tumors. It maps close to a major region that is controlled by genomic imprinting. Paternal versus maternal imprinting via DNA methylation has opposite effects on expression of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-II) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-IIinsulin-like growth factor 2BREBel1 response elementCMVcytomegalovirusEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGSTglutathione S-transferaseHFVhuman foamy virusIPHFV internal promoterKip2cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2lucluciferasentnucleotide(s)CREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinP/CAFp300/CBP-associated factorEGR-1early growth response geneCNBPcellular nucleic acid-binding protein and the negative cell cycle regulator p57Kip2 (7.Reik W.

By virtue of viral trans-activators, such as Tax and Bel1, cellular transcription programs are specifically affected or even reprogrammed in a way favorable for viral replication (8.Bex F.

The Bel1trans-activator of the human foamy virus (HFV), also called spumaretrovirus, binds directly to DNA target sites with no or low sequence conservation located in both the 5′-long terminal repeat and the internal promoter (IP) (11.He F. Blair W.S. Fukushima J. Cullen B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3902-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trans-activator Tas of simian foamy virus type 1 also binds directly to corresponding DNA target sites that are not homologous to those of Bel1 (13.Zou J.X. Luciw P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DNA binding of Bel1 and full trans-activation activity depend on cellular factors that have not been identified so far. The DNA binding domain has been mapped to a central region of the 300-amino-acid-long HFV Bel1 (14.He F. Sun S.D. Garrett E.D. Cullen B.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1896-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain functions in transcriptional trans-activation and belongs to the acidic class of eukaryotic trans-activators with VP16 as one member (15.Blair W.S. Bogerd H. Cullen B.R. J.

Expression profiling by cDNA arrays, Northern, and immunoblot analyses were carried out to determine whether HFV infection or cotransfection with the Bel1 trans-activator alters the expression of defined human genes. Using these methods, we found that HFV infection and Bel1 strongly increased expression of distinct sets of cellular genes including IGF-II, p57Kip2, early growth response gene (EGR-1), COUP-TF1, and the tyrosine kinase receptor EPH3 (17.Wagner A. Doerks A. Aboud M. Alonso A. Tokino T. Flügel R.M. Löchelt M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While the induction of some genes appeared to be mediated by Bel1-independent mechanisms, the human p57Kip2 gene seemed to be directly activated by cotransfection of a Bel1 expression plasmid (17.Wagner A.

In the present study it was our aim to define the sequence elements that conferred Bel1 responsiveness to the p57Kip2 gene. Surprisingly the Bel1 DNA target site was found to be located in the second exon of p57Kip2. Binding of nuclear proteins from human cells transfected with Bel1 or of purified GST·Bel1 fusion protein to this DNA target site was specific. This response element showed an unexpected complex repeat structure. Human 293T cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids pUC18, pCMVβ-gal (18.Löchelt M. Muranyi W.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). In general, 3–6 μg of plasmid DNA were transfected into 293T cells grown in Petri dishes with a diameter of 6 cm. Nucleotide numbering of the human p57Kip2 gene (accession no. D64137, EMBL data base) was used according to Tokino (20.Tokino T. Urano T. Furuhata M. Matsushima T. Miyatsu S. Sasaki S. Nakamura Y. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA techniques were used as described previously (21.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell.

Reporter constructs containing parts of the p57Kip2promoter were constructed by PCR-mediated amplification of defined promoter fragments. Sense primers were: Ks1 (−983 to −964), 5′-GATGAGCTCGATCCCTCGATCCCGGGGCT-3′; Ks2 (−760 to −742), 5′-GATGAGCTCCCCGACTCGAGGGCCTTAG-3′; Ks3 (−600 to −582), 5′-GATGAGCTCCTCGTCAGCTGGCGCAGGA-3′; Ks4 (−456 to −438), 5′-GATGAGCTCGCCTGCAGACAAAGGAGCC-3′; Ks5 (−322 to −305), 5′-GATGAGCTCCCGCTCACCGCCCCCTTC-3′; Ks6 (−228 to −211), 5′-GATGAGCTCGGGTGTGCGCGCGGCCAA-3′; and Ks7 (−160 to −141), 5′-GATGAGCTCCGCCAATCGCCGTGGTGTTG-3′. The antisense primer was: Kas (+277 to +257), 5′-GATAGATCTCGTGGATGTGCTGCGGAGGGA-3′. The location of the primers relative to the position of the p57Kip2 cap site are schematically shown in Fig. 1A. PCRs using different sense primers and antisense primer Kas were done with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and pKip2 plasmid DNA (20.Tokino T. Urano T. Furuhata M. Matsushima T. Miyatsu S. Sasaki S. Nakamura Y. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PCRs were carried out with the buffer recommended by the supplier supplemented with 5% Me2SO at 1 min 96 °C, 1.5 min 55 °C, 5 min 72 °C for 35 cycles. The resulting blunt-ended PCR amplicons were digested with BglII and inserted into the BglII- and Ecl136II-digested reporter plasmid pGL2 basic (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The resulting reporter constructs were designated pGL2-K1 to -K7. Separately pGL3-promoter plasmids were constructed. These plasmids were designated pGL3-pro-kip2 derivatives as shown in Fig. 1C. The complete p57Kip2 coding sequences from plasmid pKip2 was excised with BamHI located within the vector (20.Tokino T. Urano T. Furuhata M. Matsushima T. Miyatsu S. Sasaki S. Nakamura Y. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and NheI and inserted into the NheI- and BglII-digested plasmid pGL3-promoter. The resulting luc reporter plasmid pGL3-pro-kip2s contains the p57Kip2 coding sequence in the sense orientation upstream of the luc gene. The PvuII-PvuII p57Kip2 fragment (+649 to +968) was inserted into the Ecl136II site of pGL3-promoter in the sense orientation. Sequences from +649 to +968 were deleted from the pGL3-pro-kip2s plasmid by PvuII digestion and religated. The oligodeoxynucleotide Kip2-BRE (Fig. 3) was mixed with the corresponding antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, heat-denatured, annealed, and inserted into Ecl136II-digested luc reporter plasmid pGL3-promoter in both orientations. Oligonucleotides Kip2-BRE-38, those containing three and four direct repeats of 14-mers, HFV-IP.BRE, and IP.BRE37 were synthesized as oligodeoxynucleotides, cloned into the pGL3-pro plasmid, and used for luc assays. To express p57Kip2 from the minimal SV40 promoter, plasmid pkip2 was digested with StuI and BamHI. The p57Kip2 sequence was used to replace the luc gene in plasmid pGL2-promoter. To this end, pGL2-promoter was digested with HindIII, blunt-ended, and digested with BamHI. The resulting plasmid pSV40pro-kip2s contains the p57Kip2 coding sequence in the sense orientation. Homologies shown in Table I were obtained by pairwise aligning of the genes in both orientations with the BESTFIT algorithm of the Wisconsin Package, Version 10.3 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI).Table ILocation of cellular BRE sites in HFV- and Bel1-activated human genes homologous to Kip2-BREHuman genesaGenes activated or repressed after HFV infection detected in cDNA array assays (17).Functional classRegionsNo. of octamer direct repeatsbNumber of direct repeats of 8-mers compared to Kip2-BRE (Fig. 3).HomologycGene sequences homologous to G pattern of viral IP-BRE as determined in methylation interference by Kang et al.

Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The probes used for EMSAs included the Kip2-BRE and IP-BRE (Fig. 3, lines 5 and 1). These oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The labeled probe was purified by electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23.Soto U. Das B.C. Lengert M. Finzer P. zur Hausen H. Rösl F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6420Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts (2 μg) were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature in a volume of 40 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, 5 ng/μl poly(dA·dT)·poly(dA·dT) (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled DNA probe (20,000 cpm) was added and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added in 200–300-fold molar excess at the preincubation period. Antibody against Bel1 or control preimmune serum used in supershift assays was added at a 1:200 dilution 30 min after addition of the labeled probe and further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. GST·Bel1-(1–228) fusion protein and GST protein were bacterially expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (12.Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J.

Plasmid pCMVβgal directing β-galactosidase expression from the CMV-IE promoter (25.Winkler I. Bodem J. Haas L. Zemba M. Flower R.P. Delius H. Flügel R.M. Löchelt M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6727-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. Luc reporter gene assays were performed and quantified as described previously (24.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6420Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) using a Luminoskan TL Plus luminometer (Labsystems, Frankfurt, Germany). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection by lysis in 1% SDS, and the protein concentration was determined using the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Identical amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, incubated with monoclonal serum directed against p57Kip2 (PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany), and detected by enhanced chemoluminescence as described previously (17.Wagner A. Doerks A. Aboud M. Alonso A. Tokino T. Flügel R.M. Löchelt M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To study whether the DNA target site of Bel1 is in the kip2 promoter region between −983 and +277, the reporter plasmids pGL2-K1 to -K7 were cotransfected with the eukaryotic expression plasmid pbel1s and pUC18 control DNA (Fig. 1A). None of the plasmids showed any Bel1-dependent enhancement of transcriptional activity of luc reporter gene expression (data not shown). This result indicates that a potential Kip2-BRE should be located further downstream of position +277 within the p57Kip2gene. To map the Kip2-BRE site, the complete p57Kip2 coding sequence (nt +14 to +2076) was placed in sense orientation into the luc reporter plasmid pGL3-promoter (Fig. 1C, line 2). Luc gene expression of the resulting plasmid pGL3-pro-Kip2s was 7-fold trans-activated by Bel1 (Fig. 1C, line 2). To define the location of the BRE more precisely, deletions were introduced into pGL3-pro-kip2s and analyzed for Bel1 responsiveness (Fig. 1C). Deletion of the PvuII-PvuII DNA fragment located between +649 and +968 nt relative to the p57Kip2 cap site within the first coding exon of p57Kip2 virtually abolished Bel1trans-activation (Fig. 1C, line 4). Consistent with this result, the PvuII-PvuII DNA fragment conferred a 7-fold enhancement of Bel1trans-activation to the minimal SV40 promoter (Fig. 1C, line 3). To select and define the Kip2-BRE more precisely, sequence alignments with the known viral BRE sequences were performed. A candidate Kip2-BRE sequence located about 750 nt downstream of the cap site and within the PvuII-PvuII insert identified above showed homology to the known minimal and functional IP-BRE (see below). To confirm unambiguously that a functional Kip2-BRE maps within the PvuII-PvuII insert and specifically confers Bel1 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, a 55-nt-long oligodeoxynucleotide, Kip2-BRE, was synthesized, cloned upstream of the minimal SV40 promoter of the pGL3-pro plasmid in both orientations, and analyzed for luc gene expression. The results shown in Fig. 1C, line 5 demonstrate that the synthetic Kip2-BRE oligonucleotide was capable of enhancing the transcriptional activity of Bel1 in sense orientation. In comparison, the corresponding antisense plasmid, pGL3-pro-Kip2.BREas, had only 50% of that activity (Fig. 1C, line 6). When the Kip2-BRE length was shortened from 55 to 38 bp and used in luc assays, a 3-fold enhancement of activation was found (Fig. 1C, line 7); the corresponding antisense plasmid had even less activity (Fig. 1C, line 8). A direct comparison of the level of transactivation between the HFV IP-BRE with Kip2-BRE revealed that the minimal viral IP-BRE had a lower activity (Fig. 1C, lines 11 and 5) since luc gene expression of plasmid pGL3-pro-kip2.BREs was 14-fold trans-activated by Bel1 (Fig. 1C, line 5). Apparently the minimal Kip2-BRE (Fig. 1C, lines 5 and 6) and the HFV IP-BRE (Fig. 1C, lines 11 and 12) seem to preferentially function in an orientation-dependent manner as the levels of transactivation of Kip2-BREas and of IP-BREas were relatively low (Fig. 1C, lines 6 and 12). This appeared to be similar to the complete viral internal enhancer-promoter that has been reported to transactivate in cis to higher levels in mammalian cells (26.Löchelt M. Aboud M. Flügel R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4226-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the level of activation of the plasmids that contained the HFV IP-BRE in the antisense orientation was critically dependent on the length of the enhancer (Fig. 1C, bottom line). We conclude that the long IP-BRE reached similar levels of transactivation in both orientations under the conditions used. In contrast, the Kip2-BRE predominantly acted in cis. To determine the expression of the authentic human p57Kip2 at the protein level, plasmid SV40pro-Kip2 that contained the complete coding sequence of p57Kip2 under the control of the heterologous SV40 promoter was transfected into 293T cells with and without the Bel1 expression plasmid pbel1s. Cell extracts were harvested 2 days after transfection, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed for p57Kip2 expression by immunoblot analysis. Bel1 induced p57Kip2 (Fig. 2, lane 2); without Bel1, enhancement of p57Kip2 expression was not detectable (Fig. 2, lane 1). This result confirms that the Kip2-BRE regulatory element required for p57Kip2expression should reside at an intragenic location. Controls were carried out by cotransfection of two unrelated expression plasmids that did not detect p57Kip2 expression (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). The sequence alignments in Fig. 3 revealed that the position and spacing of those G residues (in bold face) that had been shown to be crucial for Bel1 binding to the minimal IP-BRE (12.Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are completely conserved. The viral IP-BRE that had been previously determined in methylation interference experiments was almost fully conserved in the 14-mer kip2 sequence 5′-GGCTCCGGTCGCGG-3′ (Fig. 3, line 2, broken underlining), whereas the octamer (Fig. 3, line 4) is virtually completely conserved in both the viral and cellular BRE except for position 4 where T is replaced by a C base. Close and comparative inspection of the kip2 sequence revealed that the BRE is present as three direct repeats of partially overlapping 14-mers (Fig. 3, broken underlining). Each 14-mer repeat contains one 12-mer that does not overlap. The transcriptional activities of both the 5′- and 3′-halves, Kip2-BRE1 and Kip2-BRE2, of this site (Fig. 3, lines 6 and 7) were determined. The full-length DNA retained full trans-activation capacity in sense orientation (Fig. 1C, line 5); both subfragments Kip2-BRE1 and -2 conferred significantly lower Bel1 responsiveness to the pGL3-pro-luc plasmid (data not shown). We next sought to analyze whether oligomers of the 12- and 14-mer repeats of Kip2-BRE enhanced transactivation. Three different oligonucleotides were synthesized, cloned, and subjected to luc assays. The primary structures of the oligomers are shown in Fig. 3. Luc gene expression of plasmids pGL3-pro-Kip2.BRE38s and -38as that consist of three overlapping direct repeats of 14-mers (and nonoverlapping direct repeats of 12-mers) of the authentic Kip2-BRE was slightly activated above background levels in both orientations (Fig. 1C, lines 7 and 8). Moreover, the two plasmids that contain either three or four direct repeats of 14-mers did not yield any transactivation (Fig. 1C, lines 9 and 10). This result indicates that the three overlapping 14-mer direct repeats of Kip2-BRE seem to be essential for Bel1-mediated transactivation. To summarize this point, we have mapped the human Kip2-BRE to an intragenic kip2 DNA sequence that is located within the second p57Kip2 exon (Fig. 1, B and C). Kip2-BRE is partially homologous to the viral IP-BRE and displays a structure consisting of three identical and overlapping 14-mers or of three nonoverlapping 12-mer direct repeats. Thus, a first cellular BRE has been identified with a minimal length of 55 nt that contains three 14-mer repeats (Fig. 3, line 5). To determine whether the Kip2-BRE site is recognized by the viral transactivator, EMSA experiments were carried out. Nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected and nontransfected with Bel1 were prepared and incubated with the labeled Kip2-BRE oligonucleotide. In the extracts from Bel1-transfected cells a Kip2-BRE DNA·protein complex, C1, was clearly detectable (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Binding of proteins in the Bel1 protein-containing nuclear extracts decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–6). Additional bands observed in nuclear extracts from pUC18-transfected cells are considered to be unspecific (Fig. 4A, lane 2) as reported previously (11.He F. Blair W.S. Fukushima J. Cullen B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3902-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kang Y. Blair W.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 504-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Zou J.X. Luciw P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the Kip2-BRE interaction with Bel1, a polyclonal Bel1-specific antibody was used in supershift assays. The EMSAs shown in Fig. 4B indicate that in the presence of nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected with Bel1, the C1 complex was detectable as expected (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Incubation with antibody against Bel1 resulted in a supershift of the C1 complex to positions marked by two arrows, Cα1 and Cα2 (Fig. 4B, lane 4), indicating the presence of two bands. As a specificity control, preimmune serum and antibody against Bel1 did not show any effects (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). To directly compare the authentic viral IP-BRE binding with the cellular Kip2-BRE, supershift EMSAs were performed under the same conditions. The resulting gel shifts in Fig. 4C confirmed that treatment with antibody against Bel1 yielded two complexes for both labeled oligonucleotides (Cα1 to Cα4, arrows). The supershift bands migrated with similar mobilities, whereas the complexes without antibodies (C1 of Kip2-BRE, and C2 and C3 of IP-BRE) migrated to slightly different positions. An unrelated antibody did not supershift these complexes. To determine whether different oligonucleotides were able to act as"
