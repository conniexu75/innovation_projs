https://openalex.org/W2062398703,"CYP2E1, a cytochrome P-450 that is well conserved across mammalian species, metabolizes ethanol and many low molecular weight toxins and cancer suspect agents. The cyp2e1 gene was isolated, and a mouse line that lacks expression of CYP2E1 was generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Animals deficient in expression of the enzyme were fertile, developed normally, and exhibited no obvious phenotypic abnormalities, thus indicating that CYP2E1 has no critical role in mammalian development and physiology in the absence of external stimuli. When cyp2e1 knockout mice were challenged with the common analgesic acetaminophen, they were found to be considerably less sensitive to its hepatotoxic effects than wild-type animals, indicating that this P-450 is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolic conversion of the drug to its active hepatotoxic metabolite.

Cytochromes P-450 (P-450) 1The abbreviations used are: P-450cytochrome P-450kbkilobase pair(s)PGKphosphoglycerate kinase-1ESembryonic stem. are a superfamily of hemoproteins that carry out oxidative metabolism of many endogenous and foreign chemicals(1.Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 243-248PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, P-450s can be functionally segregated into two groups, those that participate in biochemical pathways leading to the synthesis of steroid hormones and those that primarily metabolize foreign chemicals or xenobiotics such as drugs. The latter enzymes are included in the CYP1, CYP2, CYP3, and CYP4 families(2.Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). Many of the hepatic xenobiotic-metabolizing P-450s also metabolize endogenous compounds, but the significance of these reactions is questionable. A clue to the lack of a critical role for many of the P-450s, particularly those in family 2, in development, reproduction, and longevity, is the marked species differences in their expression and catalytic activities(3.Gonzalez F.J. Nebert D.W. Trends Genet. 1989; 6: 182-187Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, some of the xenobiotic-metabolizing P-450s are well conserved, including those in the CYP1 family and CYP2E1, suggesting that they may perform an important physiological function. cytochrome P-450 kilobase pair(s) phosphoglycerate kinase-1 embryonic stem. CYP2E1 is the principal P-450 responsible for the metabolism of ethanol and is considered as a major component of the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system(4.Lieber C.S. DeCarli L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2505-2512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Koop D.R. Morgan E.T. Tarr G.E. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among xenobiotics metabolized by CYP2E1 are acetaldehyde, acetaminophen, acrylamide, aniline, benzene, butanol, carbon tetrachloride, diethylether, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethyl carbamate, ethylene chloride, halothane, glycerol, ethylene glycol, N-nitrosodimethylamine, 4-nitrophenol, pyrazole, pyridine, and vinyl chloride(6.Guengerich F.P. Kim D.H. Iwasaki M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1991; 4: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Many of these chemicals are known toxins, established chemical carcinogens, or suspected carcinogens. CYP2E1-mediated oxidation of a variety of substrates is also believed to liberate a substantial amount of reactive oxygen that can lead to membrane lipid peroxidation and cell toxicity(7.Coon M.J. Roberts E.S. Vaz A.D.N. Davies K.J.A. Oxidative Damage and Repair: Chemical, Biological and Medical Aspects. Pergamon, New York1991: 726-731Google Scholar). CYP2E1 is also capable of metabolizing endogenous chemicals including acetone and acetol, which are key metabolites in the methylglyoxal and propanediol pathways of gluconeogenesis(8.Casazza J.P. Felver M.E. Veech R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 231-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Koop D.R. Casazza J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13607-13612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CYP2E1 can also carry out the metabolism of arachidonic acid, resulting in the production of several hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids(10.Laethem R.M. Balazy M. Falck J.R. Laethem C.L. Koop D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some of which may have physiological and pharmacological properties(11.Fitzpatrick F.A. Murphy R.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 229-241PubMed Google Scholar). CYP2E1 is inducible by ethanol and other low molecular weight substrates(5.Koop D.R. Morgan E.T. Tarr G.E. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Koop D.R. Coon M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 494-501PubMed Google Scholar). This induction is primarily due to a postranscriptional mechanism where presence of the substrate stabilizes the enzyme from degradation(13.Song B.J. Matsunaga T. Hardwick J.P. Veech R.L. Yang C.S. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, transcriptional mechanisms have not been ruled out(14.Song B.J. Watson R.R. Drug and Alcohol Abuse Reviews, Vol. 6: Alcohol and Hormones. Human Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995: 192-277Google Scholar). This enzyme is also induced by starvation and in uncontrolled diabetes(15.Hong J. Pan J. Gonzalez F.J. Gelboin H.V. Yang C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16.Song B.J. Gelboin H.V. Park S.S. Yang C.S. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16689-16697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P-450s have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol), an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic that is commonly used worldwide as a substitute for acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin®) due to its lack of gastric ulceration and general low toxicity when used within the recommended dose range (17.Jollow D.J. Mitchell J.R. Potter W.Z. Davis D.C. Gillette J.R. Brodie B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 187: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Mitchell J.R. Jollow D.J. Potter W.Z. Davis D.C. Gillette J.R.

Ther. 1973; 187: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). Acetaminophen causes hepatotoxicity at a low frequency. It is metabolized to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, a metabolite that is capable of reacting with cellular nucleophiles. The bulk of this metabolite is either reduced back to acetaminophen or conjugated with glutathione. It was postulated that toxicity results from low cellular glutathione leaving an excess of active metabolite that can cause cell toxicity(19.Potter W.Z. Davis D.C. Mitchell J.R. Jollow D.J. Gillette J.R. Brodie B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 187: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Peterson F.J. Hollaway D.E. Erickson R.R. Duquette P.H. McCain C.J. Holtzman J.L.

The P-450s responsible for acetaminophen activation have been investigated. Ethanol was reported to increase the toxicity of acetaminophen in mice(20.Peterson F.J. Hollaway D.E. Erickson R.R. Duquette P.H. McCain C.J. Holtzman J.L. Life Sci. 1980; 27: 1705-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23.Snawder J.E. Roe A.L. Benson R.W. Roberts D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), thus suggesting the involvement of CYP2E1 in vivo. In vitro studies have also implicated human CYP1A2 in addition to CYP2E1 in acetaminophen metabolism, although the latter P-450 had a lower Km than CYP1A2(24.Raucy J.L. Lasker J.M. Lieber C.S. Black M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 25.Snawder J.E. Roe A.L. Benson R.W. Casciano D.A. Roberts D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The conservation across species in expression and catalytic activities of CYP2E1 and its ability to metabolize and be induced by chemicals that are generated endogenously, such as acetone and ethanol, suggests that it has an important physiological role in mammals. To investigate this possibility and to determine if this P-450 is involved in the hepatotoxicities and carcinogenesis potential of many of its substrates, mice lacking CYP2E1 expression were produced and characterized. Genomic clones corresponding to cyp2e1 were obtained by screening a 129/SV genomic library (Strategene) with a rat CYP2E1 cDNA(26.Song B.J. Veech R.L. Park S.S. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3568-3572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A clone spanning 14.2 kb and containing all nine exons of the gene was subcloned as a SalI fragment. To disrupt the gene, a 1.9-kb HindIII fragment containing exon 2 and spanning from intron 1 to intron 2 was deleted and replaced with the bacterial phosphoribosyltransferase II gene, under control of the phosphoglycerate kinase-1 promoter (PGK-NEO), that confers resistance to the neomycin derivative G418 (Life Sciences Inc.). This gene was derived from the plasmid pPNT(27.Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). The PGK-NEO cassette was inserted in the same transcriptional orientation as the cyp2e1 gene. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene was inserted at the 3′ end of the cyp2e1 gene as a negative selection against random integration of the construct(28.Bradley A. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinoma and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 133-151Google Scholar). The construct used for targeting (see Fig. 1A), contained 2.3 kb of 5′ and 3.6 kb of 3′ genomic DNA flanking the PGK-NEO cassette. The construct was made in six cloning steps (see Fig. 1 A). 1) The HindIII site in the polylinker region of pGEM-3Z (Promega) was destroyed by HindIII digestion, Klenow polymerase treatment, and religation. 2) An 8-kb SalI-SmaI cyp2e1 genomic fragment was subcloned into the same sites in the modified pGEM-3Z. 3) The plasmid made in step 2 was digested with HindIII, treated with Klenow polymerase, and ligated with XhoI linkers in order to remove the 1.8-kb fragment containing exon 2 and add a restriction site compatible with the PGK-NEO cassette. This 1.9-kb cassette was previously modified by changing the BamHI site at its 3′ end to an XhoI site by use of Klenow polymerase and XhoI linkers. 4) The XhoI fragment containing the PGK-NEO cassette was subcloned into the cyp2e1 gene at the XhoI site. 5) The cyp2e1 construct, containing the PGK-NEO cassette was digested with AflII, treated with Klenow polymerase, and ligated with HindIII linkers. 6) The cyp2e1 gene was released from this construct by digestion with SalI and HindIII and inserted into the corresponding sites of pMC1TK plasmid (29.Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. The resulting plasmid was used as a targeting vector. The plasmid DNA used for targeting was purified by banding twice on cesium chloride. After linearization with HindIII, 40 μg was electroporated into J1 embryonic stem (ES) cells (30.Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar) using conditions described previously (31.Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P. Wesphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). ES cell clones resistant to both G418 and ganciclovir (gift of Syntex) were selected and screened for homologous recombination, and clones having the expected Southern blot pattern for a homologous recombinant (see below) were regrown and injected into C57BL/6N blastocysts. The blastocysts were transferred into the uterus of a pseudopregnant recipient NIH Swiss mouse in order to produce an animal exhibiting chimerism(32.Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Male chimeras presenting greater than 95% 129/SV contribution, as determined by coat color, were bred with C57BL/6N females to determine if the trait was transmitted to the germ line. Southern blot genotyping performed on DNA extracted from tail clips, was used to score for the presence of the mutated cyp2e1 gene in the progeny. Homozygotes were produced by crossing the F1 generation. DNA was isolated from ES cells and mouse tail clips as described previously (33.Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) and digested with either BglII or SpeI. The digested DNAs were subjected to electrophoresis in 0.6% agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes (DuPont) using 0.4 N NaOH. The conditions for hybridization and washing were described previously (31.Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P. Wesphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). A 3′-flanking probe derived from a AflII-ClaI genomic fragment (see probe P5, Fig. 1A) was labeled with [32P]dCTP using random primers. This probe hybridizes with 5.9- and 3.2-kb BglII fragments and with a 6.3-kb SpeI diagnostic fragment for the wild-type cyp2e1 allele. The homologous recombinant allele generated fragments of 5.5 and 7.7 kb corresponding to digestions with BglII and SpeI, respectively (see Fig. 1, A-C). Mice homozygous for the disrupted cyp2e1 allele were designated cyp2e1-/-. Mice were killed by carbon monoxide asphyxiation, and 400 mg of liver tissue was disrupted using a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 3 ml of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 12 min at 500,000 × g in a Beckman Optima TL tabletop ultracentrifuge to recover microsomes. All operations were performed at 4°C. The microsome pellets were resuspended by homogenization in 0.1 M sodium potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and stored at −80°C until use. Protein concentrations were determined with the bichinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of microsomal protein. Proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes by semidry transfer. Immunoblotting was performed according to Towbin et al.(35.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against CYP1A2(36.Aoyama T. Gonzalez F.J. Gelboin H.V. Mol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 2787-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CYP2B1(38.Yamano S. Nhamburo P.T. Aoyama T. Meyer U.A. Inaba T. Kalow W. Gelboin H.V. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J.

Biol. 1986; 6: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) were produced as described earlier. Rabbit antisera against CYP2C6 was produced by Dr. Kiyoshi Nagata (Tohoku University, Sendai Japan). Antibody to CYP2E1, produced in goat, was obtained from the Gentest Corp. The secondary antibodies, labeled with horseradish peroxidase, were from Amersham Corp. Messenger RNA was analyzed by Northern blots using liver RNA and the rat CYP2E1 cDNA as a probe. Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue using guanidinium thiocyanate extraction (40.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar) and cesium trifluoroacetic acid centrifugation as described previously(31.Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P. Wesphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde (41.Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar) and blotted to GeneScreen Plus (DuPont) nylon membranes using 3 M NaCl and 0.15 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0. The CYP2E1 cDNA was labeled using random primers and [32P]dCTP. The conditions for prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were described previously(31.Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P. Wesphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). The protocol for dosing mice with acetaminophen was approved by the National Cancer Institute's Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol LMCE-023). Male cyp2e1-/- and wild-type strains, from 2 to 4 months of age, were administered acetaminophen by intraperitoneal injection at doses ranging from 0 to 800 mg/kg in alkaline saline solution. Each dose group consisted of 10 mice. To score toxicities, the number of surviving animals at 48 h were quantified. Two complete and independent experiments were conducted over the same dose range. From the remaining mice, blood was collected and serum was used to determine the levels of bilirubin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. These measurements were performed by the Diagnostic Services and Clinical Pathology Laboratory of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Clinical Chemistry Department using a Kodac Ektachem 250 automated plasma analyzer. The cyp2e1 gene was isolated from a 129/SV mouse genomic library. The genomic clone spanned 14.2 kb and contained the complete coding region (Fig. 1A). The gene was disrupted by the replacement of exon 2 with the PGK-NEO cassette. A diagnostic probe, designated probe P5 and shown in Fig. 1A, was generated that detects homologous integrations of the targeting construct into the gene. Mice having the wild-type allele are expected to yield a 5.9-kb BglII and a 6.3-kb SpeI fragments. A typical autoradiography of a Southern blot of DNA from the ES cell clone AY168 and control ES cells hybridized with the probe P5 is shown in Fig. 1B. Upon longer exposure of the blot, an expected 3.2-kb BglII fragment was also detected. Specific recombinants had diagnostic 5.5- and 7.7-kb fragments from BglII and SpeI, respectively. Screening of mice generated by breeding for heterozygotes for the disrupted cyp2e1 allele is shown in Fig. 1C. Heterozygous mice have the diagnostic fragments corresponding to the wild-type and disrupted alleles, whereas mice that have two copies of the disrupted allele yielded the 5.5- and 7.7-kb fragments after digestion with BglII and SpeI, respectively. Hybridization with the PGK-NEO gene as a probe revealed only a single hybridizing fragments of 2.3, 7.7, and 11.3 kb for the BglII-, SpeI-, and ApaI-digested DNA (data not shown), demonstrating that this clone did not contain any additional random integration of the targeting construct. Mice homozygous for the disrupted allele, designated cyp2e1-/-, were born normally and appeared indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts. No differences were found between litter size and growth rates for the cyp2e1-/- animals as compared with wild-type littermate controls. The expression of CYP2E1 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-rat CYP2E1 antibody. As expected, a complete absence of protein expression was found in the livers of cyp2e1-/- mice (Fig. 2). The liver is the primary site of expression of this P-450(16.Song B.J. Gelboin H.V. Park S.S. Yang C.S. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16689-16697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P-450s in the CYP1A, CYP2A, CYP2B, CYP2C, and CYP3A subfamilies were expressed in the cyp2e1-/- mice at similar levels to those found in control animals, thus indicating that the loss of CYP2E1 was not compensated by an increase in expression of other P-450s, although it remains a possibility that a P-450 not detected with our anti-rat P-450 antibodies is overexpressed. The expression of CYP2E1 mRNA was also analyzed in the cyp2e1-/- mice. Two transcripts were detected in the liver of normal mice and mice heterozygous for the disrupted allele (Fig. 3). In the cyp2e1-/- mice, neither of these two RNA transcripts were found. Instead, two lower abundance RNAs slightly smaller than the transcripts present in wild-type animals were detected. These may be transcripts from the disrupted allele that should be smaller than a transcript from the normal allele since exon 2 is deleted in the disrupted allele. The lower abundance of these RNAs, as compared with those from the wild-type allele, is not surprising since mRNAs that do not encode a normal protein are usually not stable. In any case, the protein and RNA establish with certainty that the cyp2e1 gene is not expressed in the knockout animals. The change in size and abundance of the high molecular weight transcript annealing with the CYP2E1 cDNA in the cyp2e1-/- mice suggest that it is not due to a cross-hybridizing mRNA derived from another gene but is most likely a read-through transcript of the cyp2e1 gene with an alternate polyadenylation signal. P-450s have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. To determine whether CYP2E1 influences the toxicity of this compound in mice, the cyp2e1-/- animals were administered the drug and compared with wild-type mice. Survival curves indicated that the cyp2e1-/- mice were more resistant to acetaminophen toxicity than wild-type animals (Fig. 4). Levels of 400 mg of acetaminophen/kg producing toxicity in wild-type mice in this study were similar to those that produced toxicity in other studies(20.Peterson F.J. Hollaway D.E. Erickson R.R. Duquette P.H. McCain C.J. Holtzman J.L. Life Sci. 1980; 27: 1705-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23.Snawder J.E. Roe A.L. Benson R.W. Roberts D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cyp2e1-/- mice survived at doses up to 400 mg/kg, whereas over 50% of wild-type animals died at these doses. To determine the mechanism of toxicity, levels of enzymes and other serum components, some of which are diagnostic for liver and kidney injury, were measured in serum of treated mice that survived in the experiments described above. At all doses, levels of creatinine, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were within the normal range for mice and were not significantly different between the cyp2e1-/- and wild-type mice. In contrast, liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were elevated at high doses of acetaminophen (Fig. 5). Elevation of these liver enzymes, which are considered a measure of liver cell death, were detected at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg in wild-type animals but were unchanged at these doses in the cyp2e1-/- mice. These data indicate that liver damage is involved in mediating the toxicity of acetaminophen. This was confirmed by analysis of liver histology of acetaminophen-treated mice (data not shown). At doses higher than 600 mg/kg, a significant level of toxicity was also found in the cyp2e1-/- mice. These data suggest that CYP2E1 mediates the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. Other P-450s such as CYP1A2 having a higher Km for acetaminophen may be responsible for the toxicity in cyp2e1-/- mice at high doses of the drug. The present study using mice lacking expression of CYP2E1 establish that although this P-450 is highly conserved in mammals, it does not appear to play a significant role in development, reproductive vitality, and physiology. Under conditions of exposure to certain chemicals, CYP2E1 accentuates toxicity. Efforts are underway to use this animal model to determine whether this enzyme is responsible for the carcinogenicity of a number of its chemical substrates including N-nitrosodimethylamine and phenacetin. CYP2E1 may also exert a role in alcoholic liver disease. Lipid peroxidation was found to be associated with alcoholic liver injury in humans and experiment animals(42.Shaw S. Rubin K.P. Leiber C.S. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1983; 28: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This could be the result, in part, of increased oxygen radical production by ethanol-induced CYP2E1(7.Coon M.J. Roberts E.S. Vaz A.D.N. Davies K.J.A. Oxidative Damage and Repair: Chemical, Biological and Medical Aspects. Pergamon, New York1991: 726-731Google Scholar). The cyp2e1-/- mice could be used to test this possibility. During fasting and diabetic ketosis, serum acetone, acetol, and 1,2-propanediol are elevated. CYP2E1 is concommitantly induced due to protein stabilization by acetone(16.Song B.J. Gelboin H.V. Park S.S. Yang C.S. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16689-16697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetone is primarily oxidized to acetol by CYP2E1. Acetol is further metabolized to 1,2-propanediol by the same P-450 in a pathway of gluconeogenesis, suggesting a physiological role for this P-450 during pathophysiological and dietary stress(8.Casazza J.P. Felver M.E. Veech R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 231-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cyp2e1-/- mice should be of use to determine if CYP2E1 plays an essential role in survival under conditions of starvation."

Thirty seconds after EGF was added to these cells Raf-1 began to appear in caveolae but not in non-caveolae membrane fractions. The maximum concentration was reached at 3 min followed by a decline over the next 60 min. During this time EGF receptors disappeared from the caveolae fraction while the concentration of Ras remained constant. The Raf-1 in this fraction was able to phosphorylate MAP kinase kinase, whereas cytoplasmic Raf-1 in the same cell was inactive. Elevation of cellular cAMP blocked the recruitment of Raf-1 to caveolae. Overexpression of Ha-RasV12 caused the recruitment of Raf-1 to caveolae independently of EGF stimulation, and this was blocked by the farnesyltransferase inhibitor BZA-5B.

Two domains of the kininogens expose major cell binding sites: domain D3 that is shared by H- and L-kininogen and domain D5H that is exclusively present in H-kininogen. Previously we have mapped the kininogen cell binding sites to 27 residues of D3 (“LDC27”) and 20 residues of D5H (“HKH20”), respectively (Herwald, H., Hasan, A. A. K., Godovac-Zimmermann, J., Schmaier, A. H., and Müller-Esterl, W. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 14634-14642; Hasan, A. A. K., Cines, D. B., Herwald, H., Schmaier, A. H., and Müller-Esterl, W. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19256-19261). The corresponding kininogen acceptor site(s) exposed by the cell surfaces are still poorly defined. Using a non-ionic detergent, Nonidet P-40, we have been able to solubilize kininogen binding sites from an endothelial cell line, EA.hy926, in their functionally active form. Affinity chromatography of the solubilized kininogen binding sites on HKH20, a synthetic peptide representing the D5H cell binding site, allowed us to isolate a 33-kDa protein (“p33”) that binds specifically and reversibly to H-kininogen with a KD (apparent dissociation constant) of 9 ± 2 nM. Preparative SDS electrophoresis followed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis identified the kininogen-binding protein p33 as the gC1q receptor (“gC1qR”), an extrinsic membrane protein that interacts with the globular domains of the complement component C1q. The purified p33 binds C1q with moderate affinity, KD = 240 ± 10 nM. Recombinant expression of the corresponding cDNA in Escherichia coli demonstrated that p33 binds H-kininogen, but not L-kininogen. Peptide HKH20 but not peptide LDC27 inhibited binding of H-kininogen to the recombinant p33 in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that H-kininogen binds to p33 via domain D5H. Recombinant p33 efficiently inhibited the binding of H-kininogen to EA.hy926 cells. Factor XII, but not prekallikrein, competed with H-kininogen binding to p33.

The kinin-generating pathway has been implicated in various physiological and pathophysiological processes, i.e. hypotension, edema formation, inflammation, and pain (1Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D.

Iwanaga S. Nakanishi S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 336-339Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Following their release from the kininogens by the action of kallikreins, the effector peptides, kinins, are rapidly degraded with a half-life of <15 s in the plasma (3Stewart J.M. Erdös E.G. Bradykinin, Kallidin and Kallikrein. Springer -Verlag, New York1980: 227Google Scholar). Hence the kinins are considered to be locally acting hormones; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying their regional release have remained elusive. Previous studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular cells such as platelets (4Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6863-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Meloni F.J.

Griffin J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The identity of the kininogen binding site(s) is still unknown; in the absence of biological signal(s) induced by the binding of their ligand, kininogen, their nature as “receptors” remains to be demonstrated. Binding studies have revealed that the copy number of kininogen binding sites varies extensively among the various cell types, i.e. from 103 on platelets to 106 to 107 on endothelial cells (4Greengard J.S.

At least two populations of kininogen binding sites seem to be present on cells, i.e. one site to which H-kininogen binds via its unique light chain (12Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and another site which accepts both H- and L-kininogen via their common heavy chain (13Herwald H.

It is presently unclear whether these sites correspond to two classes of proteins or whether they reflect distinct binding properties of a single protein. high molecular weight kininogen low molecular weight kininogen biospecific interaction analysis kininogen domain enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay receptor for globular domains of C1q high performance liquid chromatography human umbilical vein endothelial cell maltose-binding protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid diammonium 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate). Recent studies have demonstrated that the number of kininogen binding sites on endothelial cells may be up-regulated by kinins via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism (14Zini J.M. Schmaier A.H. Cines D.B. Blood. 1993; 81: 2936-2946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore the rate of bradykinin release from H-kininogen is modified by the presence of cell membranes (15Meloni F.J. Gustafson E.J. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have prompted the notion that the uptake of the circulating kininogens from the plasma by cells and the subsequent liberation of kinins on their surfaces may represent a general mechanism by which systemically available prohormones are recruited by their target cells followed by the circumscribed release of their cognate hormones (12Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By virtue of this mechanism short-lived peptide hormones such as kinins are locally released at or close to their site of action. Previously we have demonstrated that 125I-labeled H-kininogen binds to platelets and endothelial cells via domain D3 (16Jiang Y. Müller-Esterl W. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3712-3717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using an antibody-directed strategy we have precisely mapped the cell binding site of the kininogen heavy chain to a segment of 27 amino acid residues (“LDC27”) located in the carboxyl-terminal portion of D3 (13Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14634-14642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Screening a peptide library we have localized the cell binding site of the H-kininogen light chain to a segment of 20 residues (“HKH20”) present in the histidine-rich region of domain D5H (12Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19256-19261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The corresponding peptide, HKH20, bound specifically, reversibly, and saturably to endothelial cells with an apparent KD (apparent dissociation constant) of 230 nM. In line with these findings the intermediate domain D4, which separates D3 and D5H in H-kininogen, contributes to the optimum binding of kininogen to endothelial cells (17Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31822-31830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutual displacement of H- and L-kininogen from the endothelial cell surface indicates that the two proteins which share their NH2-terminal domains, D1 through D4, use common cellular docking structure(s) (5Meloni F.J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6786-6794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jiang Y. Müller-Esterl W. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3712-3717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand the specific displacement of H-kininogen by its unique light chain that is not shared by L-kininogen points to the existence of at least two distinct binding sites for the kininogens (15Meloni F.J. Gustafson E.J. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we set out to isolate, identify, and characterize a kininogen-binding protein from an endothelial cell line EA.hy926. Applying affinity chromatography on immobilized peptide HKH20 we have purified a cellular protein of 33 kDa (“p33”) to apparent homogeneity. NH2-terminal sequence analysis identified the endothelial p33 as a membrane protein previously recognized as the receptor for the globular heads of complement component C1q (“gC1qR”). The purified p33/gC1qR binds H-kininogen with high affinity, KD = 9 ± 2 nM, and C1q with moderate affinity, KD = 240 ± 10 nM. Recombinantly expressed p33/gC1qR binds H-kininogen, but not L-kininogen. Our data suggest that endothelial cells expose a binding protein that serves as a promiscuous docking structure for the plasma proteins, H-kininogen and C1q. H-kininogen was isolated from human plasma (18Salvesen G. Parkes C. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with modifications described previously (17Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Zhang J. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31822-31830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complement component C1q was purified from outdated human plasma (19Stemmer F. Loos M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 74: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized in their amide form on a 9050 Pep-Synthesizer (Milligen, Eschborn, Germany) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/HOBt chemistry and a Fmoc-amide polyethylene glycol polystyrene resin (Milligen). After cleavage from the resin the peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by sequence analysis and/or mass spectrometry.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were prepared according to the method of Jaffe (22Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 52: 2745-2756Crossref Scopus (6008) Google Scholar). Lyophilized H-kininogen (100 µg) was dissolved in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.0, containing 10 µg of biotin-ε-aminocaproyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide (biotin-X-NHS). After incubation for 4 h at 4°C, the mixture was concentrated using a Microcon-10 column (Amicon, Beverly, MA) with a 10-kDa cutoff. Peptides HKH20 and LLT27 (1 mg each) were dissolved in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.0, containing 100 µg of biotin-X-NHS. After incubation for 4 h at 4°C the mixtures were separated by HPLC. Biotinylation of the proteins and peptides was monitored by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serial dilutions (2n) of biotinylated H-kininogen, biotinyl-HKH20, or biotinyl-LLT27 were coated onto a microtiter plate and incubated with the preformed biotin-avidin-peroxidase complex (2 µg/ml). This step was followed by the substrate solution, 0.15% (w/v) diammonium 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), 0.012% (v/v) H2O2 in 100 mM citric acid, pH 4.5, for 30 min. The change of absorbance was read at 405 nm. The binding assay was done as described (13Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14634-14642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, EA.hy926 cells grown to confluence on 96-well microtiter plates (6 × 104 cells/well) were washed five times in 0.135 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 11.9 mM NaHCO3, 0.36 mM NaH2PO4, 14.7 mM HEPES, pH 7.35 (HEPES-Tyrode's buffer) containing 3.5 mg/ml dextrose and 50 µM ZnCl2. The cells were incubated with serial dilutions (2n) of biotinylated H-kininogen (starting concentration 100 nM in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer) or with biotinylated HKH20 (starting concentration: 1.2 µM) for 1 h at 37°C. Nonspecific binding was determined by coincubation of the biotinylated probes with 600 µM or 1.2 mM of unlabeled peptide HKH20, respectively. The cells were washed five times with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer. Cell-bound probes were detected by the preformed biotin-avidin-peroxidase complex (2 µg/ml) and the substrate solution, ABTS/H2O2, for 30 min. The change of absorbance was read at 405 nm. For competitive cell binding studies, the cells were incubated with serial dilutions (2n) of biotinylated H-kininogen (starting concentration: 100 nM) or with biotinylated HKH20 (starting concentration: 1 µM) in presence of 10 µM of unlabeled recombinant MBP-p33 fusion protein or unfused MBP as the controls. H-kininogen was iodinated by the IODO-GEN method of Fraker and Speck (23Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) with variations reported previously (24Abd Alla S. Buschko J. Quitterer U. Maidhof A. Haasemann M. Breipohl G. Knolle J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17277-17285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H-kininogen was dissolved in 100 µl of 10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 10 min with 0.5 mCi of Na125I (5 µl) in tubes coated with IODO-GEN (100 µg/tube). Unreacted iodine was separated by centrifugation over a LH-20 desalting column (3000 × g, 5 min, 4°C). EA.hy926 cells were grown to confluence in a 96-well tissue culture plate, cooled to 4°C for 30 min, and washed three times with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer. The cells were incubated with decreasing concentrations (20 nM, 10 nM, 2 nM, 200 pM, 20 pM, and 2 pM) of 125I-H-kininogen for 60 min at 4°C to achieve equilibrium. The cells were washed again, removed from the plate with 0.5% (w/v) NaOH, and the cell-associated radioactivity was determined in a γ counter (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). The controls were done by displacement of the radiolabeled probe with a 1000-fold molar excess of the unlabeled peptide HKH20. The binding data were analyzed by the method of Scatchard (25Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17796) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constant (KD) and the number of binding sites/cell (Bmax) were calculated by the nonlinear data-fitting program LIGAND (26Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). Confluent EA.hy926 cells were grown on 30 dishes (24-cm diameter), washed with ice-cold 20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), and removed from the plates by a hypotonic buffer, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mM EDTA containing 10 µg/ml benzamidine hydrochloride, and 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The detached cells were homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) twice for 30 s each. After centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The resultant pellet was washed three times in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 10 µg/ml benzamidine hydrochloride and 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). Solubilization of the membrane pellet was done in the same buffer including 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 4 mM CHAPS, or 10 mM CHAPS, 0.5% (w/v) desoxycholate for 60 min at 4°C. The solubilizate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and the clear supernatant removed and stored at −80°C until use. To affinity-purify the kininogen-binding proteins from the EA.hy926 cell solubilizates, peptide HKH20 and H-kininogen were covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The gel (2.0 ml bed volume) was washed with 10 ml of H2O at 4°C, 10 ml (2 ml) of a 1 mg/ml solution of HKH20 (H-kininogen) in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.0, was added, and the resultant suspension was incubated overnight at 4°C. Unbound polypeptides were removed by washing the gel with 100 ml HEPES-Tyrode's buffer. Free reactive sites were blocked by incubating the gel with 10 ml of 0.1 M ethanolamine for 2 h at room temperature followed by washing with 100 ml of HEPES-Tyrode's buffer. Two methods were used to isolate kininogen-binding proteins. A: ten ml of the membrane solubilizate of EA.hy926 cells in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 µg/ml benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer B) were added to the HKH20 affinity column and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing with 100 ml of the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of 30 mM HCl, and the pH of the eluate was quickly restored to pH 7.4 by adding 1.1 ml of 10-fold concentrated buffer B. The eluted proteins were subjected to a second affinity chromatography step by incubation with the H-kininogen matrix overnight at 4°C. After washing with buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted with 0.2 M NaSCN at pH 5.8. B: membrane solubilizates were added to the HKH20 affinity matrix overnight at 4°C. After washing with 100 ml buffer B, the column was eluted in a stepwise gradient of 10 ml each of 10 µM HCl, pH 5, 100 µM HCl, pH 4, and 1 mM HCl, pH 3. Binding studies were done by biospecific interaction analysis (BIA) employing surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIAlite, Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Freiburg, Germany) to follow the kinetics of interacting polypeptides (27Chaiken I. Rosé S. Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 201: 197-210Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). H-kininogen or p33 (100 µg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5) were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip using the amino coupling method according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the binding studies polypeptides were dissolved in PBS in serial dilutions (2n; starting concentration 100 µg/ml). Samples of 30 µl each were applied; a continuous flow rate of 10 µl/ml was maintained such that the contact time of the analyte with the sensor chip was 3 min. The dissociation of the bound proteins was measured for 3 min followed by a wash with 30 mM HCl to regenerate the uncomplexed proteins on the sensor chip. The kinetic data were analyzed by the BIAevaluation 2.0 program supplied by Pharmacia. Proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Analytical electrophoresis was performed on 10-20% (w/v) gradient or on 10% (w/v) continuous polyacrylamide gels in presence of 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 30 mA (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206983) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were visualized by the silver stain technique or by Coomassie Blue R-250. Western blotting of the resolved proteins on polyvinylidine difluoride membranes was done by the semidry technique (29Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Standard marker proteins were from Pharmacia. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Visible protein bands were excised and subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation using a 477A sequenator connected to a model 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Computer sequence analysis was done by blitz e-mail search at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, and a tblastn search at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Blast network server. SwissProt release 30, EMBL release 41, and GenBank™ release 88 were searched for homologous sequences applying program default parameters. For total cellular RNA isolation, 1-2 × 106 HUVECs were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 0.5% (w/v) sarcosyl, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and extracted by phenol/chloroform as described (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). The 5′-primer (5′-GCGAATTCCTGCACACCGACGGAGACAAAGC-3′) containing a flanking EcoRI restriction site corresponds to the first codon (nucleotide residue 220-222) of the nucleotide sequence encoding the mature gC1q receptor, accession number X75913) (31Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.-L. Peerschke E.I.B. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The 3′-primer (5′-TGTCTAGACTACTGGCTCTTGACAAAACTC-3′) corresponds to the nucleotide sequence comprising the translational stop codon of the gC1q receptor cDNA (nucleotide residue 849-851) flanked by a XbaI restriction site. The cDNA synthesis was performed in a total volume of 20 µl containing 1 µg of total cellular RNA, 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany), 1 mM dNTPs, 10 units of RNAsin (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), reverse transcriptase buffer, and 100 ng of oligo(dT)16 (Roth). Reverse transcription was performed at 37°C for 2 h. The reaction volume was adjusted to 1 ml with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. Five µl of the reverse transcription reaction mixture was added to 95 µl of a polymerase mixture that contained 2 units of Taq polymerase, 25 pmol each of the 5′- and 3′-primers (see above), 250 µM dNTPs, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. Samples were overlaid with 70 µl of mineral oil and amplified using the following protocol: 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 52°C, and 1 min at 72°C for 40 cycles on a thermal cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). To express p33, the pMAL-c2 expression vector (New England Biolabs) was used. The amplified DNA fragment encoding the isolated (i.e. mature) form of p33 was cleaved by EcoRI and XbaI, ligated into the pMAL-c2 vector, and fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP). The recombinant fusion protein was expressed in the E. coli XL1-Blue strain (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Exponentially growing bacteria were stimulated with 0.3 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h, harvested and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 10 µg/ml benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer C) and sonicated for 3 min in pulses of 15 s each. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed and transferred to an amylose resin column preequilibrated with buffer C. The column was extensively washed with buffer C until the washing solution was free of protein. The MBP-p33 was eluted fro"

To gain further insight into the role of Eps15-AP-2 association, we have now delineated their sites of interactions. AP-2 binds to a domain of 72 amino acids (767-739) present in the COOH terminus of Eps15.

Precipitation of proteolytic fragments of AP-2 with Eps15-derived fusion proteins containing the binding site for AP-2 showed that Eps15 binds specifically to a 40-kDa fragment corresponding to the ear of α-adaptin, a result confirmed by precipitation of Eps15 by α-adaptin-derived fusion proteins. Our data indicate that this specific part of AP-2 binds to a cellular component and provide the tools for investigating the function(s) of the association between AP-2 and Eps15.

https://openalex.org/W2010359331,"Cytokine-dependent production of nitric oxide (NO) by rat cardiac myocytes is a consequence of increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2) and, in the presence of insulin, depresses the contractile function of these cells in vivo and in vitro. Experiments reported here show that L-lysine, a competitive antagonist of L-arginine uptake, suppressed NO production (detected as nitrite accumulation) by interleukin (IL)-1β and interferon (IFN)γ-pretreated cardiac myocytes by 70%, demonstrating that NO production is dependent on L-arginine uptake. Cardiac myocytes constitutively exhibit a high-affinity L-arginine transport system (Km = 125 μM; Vmax = 44 pmol/2 × 105 cells/min). Following a 24-h exposure to IL-1β and IFNγ, arginine uptake increases (Vmax = 167 pmol/2 × 105 cells/min) and a second low-affinity L-arginine transporter activity appears (Km = 1.2 mM). To examine the molecular basis for these cytokine-induced changes in arginine transport, we examined expression of three related arginine transporters previously identified in other cell types. mRNA for the high-affinity cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) is expressed in resting myocytes and steady-state levels increase by 10-fold following exposure to IL-1β and IFNγ. Only cytokine-pretreated myocytes expressed a second high-affinity L-arginine transporter, CAT-2B, as well as a low-affinity L-arginine transporter, CAT-2A. In addition, insulin, which potentiated cytokine-dependent NO production independent of any change in NOS activity, increased myocyte L-arginine uptake by 2-fold and steady-state levels of CAT-1, but not CAT-2A or CAT-2B mRNA. Thus, NO production by cardiac myocytes exposed to IL-1β plus IFNγ appears to be dependent on the co-induction of CAT-1, CAT-2A, and CAT-2B, while insulin independently augments L-arginine transport through CAT-1.

Thus, the aim of the present work was to study the effect of passive transbilayer drug movement on the multidrug resistance and its modulation. Fluorescence quenching studies indicated that whereas the Pgp substrate rhodamine 123 traverses an artificial lipid membrane with a lifetime of 3 min, the transbilayer movement rate of the MDR modulators, quinidine and quinine, was too fast to be detected with present methods. Transbilayer movement rates of drugs and modulators were estimated from their equilibration rate throughout artificial multilamellar vesicles. The equilibration rate of five selected modulators was faster than the equilibration rate of five representative MDR-type drugs tested, which was comparable with the rate of rhodamine 123 equilibration. Moreover, the carrier-type peptide ionophore, valinomycin, which is freely mobile in the membrane, inhibited Pgp-mediated efflux of rhodamine 123 from MDR cells. In contrast, the channel-forming ionophore gramicidin D, a Pgp substrate that flip-flops slowly across the membrane, did not modulate cellular Pgp activity. Pgp, with a turnover number of about 900 min−1 can keep pace with the influx of an MDR-drug like rhodamine 123 exhibiting a transbilayer movement with a lifetime of minutes. On the other hand, Pgp would fail to protect MDR cells against cytotoxic drugs that are freely mobile through biological membranes and that re-enter cells faster than their Pgp-mediated active efflux rate.

H2A in HeLa cells was extensively and consistently phosphorylated at the same site throughout the cell cycle, and H3 was demonstrated to be phosphorylated at the mitosis-specific site Ser10.

Induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) by interleukin (IL)-1α or a phorbol ester increases this formation. HUVEC treated with aspirin lost their capacity to generate PGs but recovery occurred after 3- or 6-h induction of Cox-2 with phorbol ester or IL-1α.

The use of SC58125, a selective Cox-2 inhibitor, confirmed these findings in intact cells. Cyclooxygenase activity was related to the amount of Cox proteins present in the cells, but after induction of Cox-2, contribution of the latter to PG production was 6-8-fold that of Cox-1. Aspirin-treated or untreated cells were incubated in the absence or presence of SC58125 and stimulated by thrombin, the ionophore A23187, or exogenous arachidonic acid. The production of endogenous (6-keto-PGF1α, PGE2, PGF1α) versus transcellular (TXB2) metabolites was independent of the inducer, the source of arachidonic acid and the Cox isozyme.

A2 and prostaglandin (PG) I2 (prostacyclin) are the main products of arachidonic acid metabolism via the cyclooxygenase (Cox; also known as PGH synthase (EC 1.14.99.1)) pathway in platelets and endothelial cells, respectively(1.Smith W.L.

Biophys. 1992; 298: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and stored at −70°C until use. TX synthase activity was verified by the platelet microsomes' capacity to convert PGH2 into TX. For incubations, microsomes were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C and suspended in Hanks' buffer prior to addition to endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were prepared according to the method of Jaffe et al.(16.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Culture conditions were described previously(17.Habib A. Créminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Passage cells were subcultured on gelatin-coated plates (Costar), or in 100-mm2 culture dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark); they were seeded at 7.5 × 103/cm2 and allowed to grow to subconfluence. Heparin and endothelial cell growth supplement were removed 48 h before stimulation. Cells at first passage were incubated in culture medium containing 5% heat-inactivated normal human serum (NHS). Cultures were activated with IL-1α or PMA for different times prior to co-incubations with platelets, as described in the figure legends. Platelets in Hanks' buffer were incubated alone, with HUVEC activated by 20 nM PMA or 25 units/ml IL-1α, or with endothelial cells maintained in 5% NHS. Conditions are indicated in the figure legends. After activation, the medium was changed, and after 1-min preincubation at 37°C individual cells or co-incubates were stimulated by thrombin (2 units/ml) for 2 min unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. The reaction was quenched by transferring the supernatant to citric acid-containing tubes (final concentration, 50 mM). After neutralization with 1 M K2HPO4, the supernatants were analyzed by EIA. In some experiments, endothelial cells were incubated for 30 min with 100 μM ASA, SA, or vehicle (i.e. ethanol). After removal of the supernatant, cells were washed 3 times and maintained for 30 min in culture medium in order to remove any residual ASA or SA. The medium was changed and cells were activated with PMA (20 nM), IL-1α (25 units/ml), or medium alone (containing 5% NHS), for different times. Cells were either lysed for Western blot analysis (see below) or incubated with aspirin-treated platelets and stimulated by thrombin, arachidonic acid, or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 in the absence or presence of SC58125, a specific Cox-2 inhibitor(18.Seibert K. Zhang Y. Leahy K. Hauser S. Masferrer J. Perkins W. Lee L. Isakson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12013-12017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). The supernatant was assayed for TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1α. The stable metabolite of prostacyclin, 6-keto-PGF1α, TXB2, PGF1α, and PGE2 were determined in the supernatants using EIA with acetylcholinesterase-labeled 6-keto-PGF1α, TXB2, PGF2α, or PGE2 as tracers(19.Pradelles P. Grassi J. Maclouf J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Results are expressed in nanograms/ml and the cell concentration is indicated in the figure legends. Verification of cell counts revealed no major variation in number for a given setting throughout the experimental period. HUVEC in T-162 flasks (6 × 106 cells) were labeled for 18 h at 37°C with 74 kBq of arachidonic acid. The medium was changed and the cells were incubated in NHS for 6 h in the absence or presence of 20 nM PMA. After washing, the cells were incubated alone or with platelets (ratio of endothelial cell/platelet ratio, 1/125) and stimulated by thrombin. The reaction was quenched with citric acid and the sample neutralized by addition of K2HPO4. After addition of methanol (2 volumes), the samples were kept overnight at −20°C for protein precipitation. The supernatant was subjected to solid-phase extraction (C18, Bakerbond, Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) and analyzed by HPLC. After solid-phase extraction, the different compounds formed from [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled endothelial cells were resolved by HPLC using a C18 column (Ultrasphere Si, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was performed using a nonlinear gradient between solvent A (water/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 90:10:0.1, v/v) and solvent B (acetonitrile/acetic acid, 100:0.1, v/v). The column was equilibrated in 100% solvent A and the percentage of solvent B was 20% at 2 min, 45% at 12 min, 80% at 20 min, and 100% between 22 and 26 min. After 7-min re-equilibration in 100% solvent A, the system was ready for a new run. Fractions were collected every 20 s. Radioactivity was counted in each fraction by liquid scintillation counting (Packard 6000 SC). Each fraction was also analyzed by EIA for its content in 6-keto-PGF1α, PGF2α, and TXB2. In preliminary experiments, the specificity of the TXB2 determination by EIA was verified by purifying the samples by thin-layer chromatography or HPLC. In these experiments, [3H]TXB2 was added before solid-phase extraction to estimate the losses occurring during the various steps of purification. HPLC was done as described above. The fractions corresponding to TXB2 were pooled, evaporated to dryness, and EIA buffer was added. Thin-layer chromatography was performed after developing the plates in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (90:8:1:0.8, v/v). Authentic TXB2 (1-2 μg) was applied in a separate lane and visualized using a 3.5% phosphomolybdic acid spray. The corresponding lane was scraped and compounds were eluted by adding the silica to EIA buffer (0.1 M phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% sodium azide). Results after either purification technique corresponded to those obtained by direct EIA. After incubation, monolayers of HUVEC in 6-well plates (3-4 × 105 cells/well) were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min in ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mMn-octyl glucoside, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM benzamidine hydrochloride), scraped with a rubber policeman, and centrifuged at 4° C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Protein content was determined by a micro-bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described previously(17.Habib A. Créminon C.

Monoclonal antibodies Cox-2 29 (1/10,000) and 3 specific monoclonal antibodies against Cox-1 (02, 10, 11, at 5 μg/ml) were used for Cox-2 and Cox-1 analysis, respectively(17.Habib A. Créminon C.

Blots were further incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at 1/2,000 (0.1 ml/cm2) for 1 h at room temperature. ECL substrates were used to reveal positive bands according to the manufacturer's instructions and bands were visualized after exposure to Hyperfilm™ ECL (Amersham). Protein bands were quantified on the films by densitometry using an LKB Ultrascan XL laser densitometer (Pharmacia). HUVEC in a 60-mm2 culture dish were treated with 100 μM ASA, SA, or vehicle as described in the cell incubation section. After 3 (PMA) or 6 (IL-1α) h, control or activated HUVEC were lysed in solubilization buffer (see above). The lysates were immediately frozen and kept at −70°C. Cyclooxygenase activity was assessed after selective immunoprecipitation of Cox-2 using specific polyclonal anti-Cox-2 peptide antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose as described previously(17.Habib A. Créminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the reaction buffer consisted of Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM phenol and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After 1 min at 37°C in the presence of 1 μM hematin, the reaction was initiated by adding arachidonic acid (25 μM). After 10 min at 37°C, the reaction was quenched by adding 1 volume of ice-cold EIA buffer and the mixture was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge (5,000 × g, 1 min). PGE2 in the supernatant was measured by EIA(19.Pradelles P. Grassi J. Maclouf J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose coupled to IgG-bound Cox-2 was washed 5 times with 0.5 ml in the lysis buffer and mixed with Laemmli reagent under reducing conditions. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis as described above and Cox-2 protein was revealed under the same conditions. The different parameters were evaluated by means of a specialized software (Sigma-Statr, Jandel, CA). Co-incubation of aspirin-treated platelets with endothelial cells (2 × 105 cells in 12-well dishes, endothelial cell/platelet ratio, 1/25) stimulated by thrombin resulted in significant synthesis of TXB2 (3.9 ± 0.5 ng/ml, n = 4 compared to 0.5 ng/ml for aspirin-treated platelets) (Fig. 1A). An additional 3-fold increase in TX over control HUVEC (10.9 ± 0.7 ng/ml) was obtained with endothelial cells activated for 6 h by PMA prior to co-incubation. The production of 6-keto-PGF1α by endothelial cells was not modified by the presence of platelets, but the synthesis of PGE2 decreased (not shown). Addition of ASA (100 μM) to endothelial cells prior to co-incubation suppressed TX and 6-keto-PGF1α formation by more than 95%. The time for maximal formation of TXB2 after addition of thrombin was 2 min (not shown); subsequent incubations were performed at this time, unless indicated. HUVEC activated for 6 h by PMA and challenged for 2 min with 2 units/ml thrombin synthesized negligible amounts of TXB2 (0.4 ± 0.07 ng/ml, n = 5) compared to 6-keto-PGF1α (21.9 ± 4.5 ng/ml, n = 5). The identity of TXB2 was verified by EIA after purification of the samples by thin-layer chromatography or HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). The dependence of platelets was tested as a function of increases in the ratio of platelets to endothelial cells. The formation of TXB2 increased as a function of platelet number and a plateau was reached at 0.5-1 × 109 platelets/well (i.e. endothelial cell/platelet ratio of 1/250, Fig. 1B). No TX was formed in the absence of thrombin stimulation; TXB2, although, increased as a function of thrombin concentration (0-4 units/ml) (Fig. 1C). In subsequent experiments, respective platelet/endothelial cell ratios of 125 and 2 units/ml of thrombin were used. In order to demonstrate that endoperoxides liberated by HUVEC were responsible for the formation of TXB2, different sets of experiments were performed. In the first, PMA-treated endothelial cells were stimulated by thrombin for 2 min. The supernatant was transferred either to a platelet suspension (0.2 × 109 cells/ml) or to Hank's buffer. After 2 min, the reaction was quenched by citric acid and TXB2 was measured by EIA (Fig. 2A). Significant amounts of TXB2 were detected only in the supernatant transferred to the tube containing platelets (3 ± 0.2 versus 0.3 ± 0.04 ng/ml, mean ± S.E. n = 3). These results demonstrate that direct cell contact is not necessary for this reaction, although the net amount of TXB2 formed under these conditions was reduced 3-5-fold compared to co-incubates (compare Fig. 2A to Fig. 1, A or B). In another set of experiments, endothelial cells were stimulated for 2 min by thrombin and the supernatant was transferred to a tube. Aliquots were added at intervals to tubes containing platelets. There was a rapid time-dependent decrease in the capacity of the supernatant added to platelets to generate TXB2 which disappeared at later times (i.e. 30 min) (Fig. 2B). The apparent half-life of the unstable intermediate contained in the supernatant of endothelial cells stimulated by thrombin was calculated by plotting TXB2 values as a function of time. The half-life, calculated from five separate experiments, was t1/2= 92 ± 17 s, which is very similar to that described previously for PGH2(24.Maclouf J. Kindahl H. Granström E. Samuelsson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to confirm the identity of PGH2, we used IgGs directed against a PGH2 mimic, previously shown to decrease platelet aggregation and TXA2 generation after addition of PGH2(25.Fitzpatrick F.A. Gorman R.R. Bundy G.L. Nature. 1978; 273: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Addition of specific IgGs to platelet/endothelial cell co-incubations (25-150 μg/ml) resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition in the formation of TXB2, with a weaker effect on 6-keto-PGF1α (Fig. 2C). In contrast, nonspecific IgGs did not modify the production of TX compared to controls, even at the highest concentration (150 μg/ml). Addition of furegrelate, a TX synthase inhibitor(26.Gorman R.R. Johnson R.A. Spilman C.H. Aiken J.W. Prostaglandins. 1983; 26: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), to the co-incubation mixture concentration dependently inhibited the synthesis of TX (Fig. 2D). In the same samples, there was a symmetric increase in PGE2, whereas the synthesis of 6-keto-PGF1α was unchanged (not shown). These results support the involvement of a TX synthase catalyzing the transformation of PGH2 into TX. Finally, endothelial cells, labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid and activated by PMA, were stimulated by thrombin in the absence or presence of platelets. HPLC analysis of the supernatant of HUVEC alone showed radioactivity and immunoreactivity in the fractions corresponding to the retention time of 6-keto-PGF1α and PGF2α (Fig. 3A). In the presence of aspirin-treated platelets, an additional radioactive and immunoreactive peak of TXB2 was observed (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate transfer of PGH2 from endothelial cells to platelets and subsequent transformation into TX by a TX synthase.Figure 3:HPLC analysis of the supernatant of [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled endothelial cells in the absence (A) or presence (B) of aspirin-treated platelets. PMA-activated HUVEC (6 × 106 cells) grown in T-162 flasks were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were stimulated for 2 min by 2 units/ml thrombin in the absence or presence of platelets and analysis of samples by HPLC was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each fraction (0.33 min) was counted for radioactivity, and immunoreactivity was analyzed by EIA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to verify the importance of Cox-2 in the increased capacity of endothelial cells to generate PGH2, cells were activated under conditions known to modify the expression of Cox-2 but not that of Cox-1 (e.g. various concentrations of PMA or IL-1 for different times)(23.Créminon C. Habib A. Maclouf J. Pradelles P. Grassi J. Frobert Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In some experiments, Western blot analysis of HUVEC was performed (not shown) to assess the relation between the level of expression of Cox-2 and the amount of 6-keto-PGF1α formed upon thrombin stimulation(17.Habib A. Créminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The good correlation between 6-keto-PGF1α and the amount of TX generated in the co-incubate (r = 0.82, p < 0.001, n = 22) reflects the fact that the generation of PGH2 for constitutive and transcellular metabolism is related to the net cyclooxygenase activity(ies) of endothelial cells (Fig. 4). As shown previously (see Fig. 1A), endothelial cells treated with ASA lose their metabolic capacity to produce PGH2 and PGI2 (i.e. constitutive metabolism), but also TX by transcellular metabolism. The synthesis of Cox-2 induced by IL-1α was similar in endothelial cells treated with either ASA or SA as analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 5). Densitometric analysis of Cox-2 protein in cells pretreated with SA or ASA indicated respective values of 103 ± 12% and 130 ± 11% of those noted with control cells (n = 4). Similar results were obtained with PMA (not shown). The rapid recovery of PG formation was tested directly on cells pretreated for 30 min with SA or ASA and activated by PMA or IL-1α. Enzyme activity was measured in the immunoprecipitates of Cox-2 or Cox-1 from lysates using specific antibodies(17.Habib A. Créminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately after ASA treatment, activities of Cox-1 or Cox-2 were inhibited by more than 97% compared to SA (Fig. 6). Three hours after activation of endothelial cells by PMA (or 6 h with IL-1α), activity in the immunoprecipitate of Cox-2 from aspirin-treated cells was similar to that obtained from cells treated with SA (Fig. 6). In the absence of cell activation (i.e. cells incubated with NHS alone), immunoprecipitates from ASA- or SA-treated cells showed a lower, but similar activity (Fig. 6). The presence of 5% NHS was likely responsible for the induction of Cox-2(17.Habib A. Créminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no activity was detected in the immunoprecipitate of Cox-1 obtained from aspirin-treated cells (not shown). These results demonstrate that the rapid recovery of PGH2 generation in ASA-treated endothelial cells was due to de novo synthesis of Cox-2.Figure 6:Cox activities in the immunoprecipitates of Cox-2 obtained after 3 (PMA) or 6 (IL-1α) h activation of endothelial cells, following treatment of cells with ASA or SA. Incubations were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 5. After activation, the cells were lysed and Cox-2 was immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cyclooxygenase activity was evaluated by measuring PGE2 in the supernatant of the immunoprecipitates after addition of arachidonic acid (10 μM). The histograms on the left show the activity in immunoprecipitates of cells immediately after treatment with SA or ASA. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, in intact cells less TX was formed after activation of aspirin-treated endothelial cells (Fig. 7A). The specific Cox-2 inhibitor SC58125 was used in order to identify the enzyme responsible for the recovery in activity after treatment with ASA. This compound totally suppressed the synthesis of TX in cells treated with ASA, prior to activation. There was no difference in TXB2 formation in SA-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrate that: 1) after ASA treatme"

Nevertheless, most recombinant systems are not suitable for this purpose, as they do not have sufficient amounts of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. Pro-α1 chains of human type III collagen expressed in insect cells by a baculovirus vector are reported here to contain significant amounts of 4-hydroxyproline and to form triple-helical molecules, although the Tm of the triple helices was only about 32-34°C. Coexpression of the pro-α1(III) chains with the α and β subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase increased the Tm to about 40°C, provided that ascorbate was added to the culture medium. The level of expression of type III procollagen was also increased in the presence of the recombinant prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and the pro-α1(III) chains and α1(III) chains were found to be present in disulfide-bonded molecules. Most of the triple-helical collagen produced was retained within the insect cells and could be extracted from the cell pellet. The highest expression levels were obtained in High Five cells, which produced up to about 80 μg of cellular type III collagen (120 μg of procollagen) per 5 × 106 cells in monolayer culture and up to 40 mg/liter of cellular type III collagen (60 mg/liter procollagen) in suspension. The 4-hydroxyproline content and Tm of the purified recombinant type III collagen were very similar to those of the nonrecombinant protein, but the hydroxylysine content was slightly lower, being about 3 residues/1000 in the former and 5/1000 in the latter.

The collagens are a family of closely related but distinct extracellular matrix proteins. At least 19 proteins representing more than 30 gene products have now been defined as collagens, and at least another 10 proteins contain collagen-like domains. All collagen molecules consist of three polypeptide chains, called α chains, that are coiled around one another into a triple-helical conformation. In some collagen types all three α chains of the molecule are identical, while in others the molecule contains two or three different α chains. The most abundant collagens form extracellular fibrils and are hence known as fibril-forming collagens, while others form supramolecular aggregates of other kinds (for recent reviews on collagens, see (1.Kielty C.M.

Nevertheless, many of the recently discovered collagens are present in tissues in such small quantities that it has not been possible to isolate them for characterization at the protein level, and thus many important questions concerning their structure and organization are still open(1.Kielty C.M.

Some of the fibril-forming collagens are now in medical use, in applications ranging from biomaterials and drug delivery systems to trials for the potential of type II collagen as an oral tolerance-inducing agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis(8.Cavallaro J.F.

The collagens used in these applications have been isolated from animal tissues, and it is thus obvious that an efficient large scale recombinant system for expressing collagens would have numerous scientific and practical applications. Recombinant expression of collagens has proven difficult to achieve, as their biosynthesis requires processing by up to eight specific posttranslational enzymes(1.Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E.

Nevertheless, only one of these enzymes, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, which hydroxylates about 100 proline residues in each of the α chains in the case of the fibril-forming collagens, is an absolute requirement, as 4-hydroxyproline-deficient polypeptide chains cannot form triple helices that are stable at 37°C(6.Prockop D.J.

Post-Translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar). No attempts have previously been reported regarding the production of triple-helical collagens in insect cells, bacteria, or yeast, as insect cells are likely to have insufficient levels of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity, and bacteria and yeast do not contain this enzyme at all. Recombinant collagens have recently been produced in mammalian cells, however(7.Tillet E. Mann K. Nischt R. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Eur. J.

Baculoviruses have proven to be very efficient expression vectors for the large scale production of various recombinant proteins in insect cells. The proteins produced in this expression system are usually correctly processed, properly folded, and disulfide-bonded(16.Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 17.Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures & Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA _1993Google Scholar), but as described in this paper, our initial experiments indicated that recombinant collagen polypeptide chains produced in a baculovirus system do not form triple helices that are stable at 37°C. A recent success in producing a fully active human prolyl 4-hydroxylase α2β2 tetramer in insect cells by coinfection with two recombinant baculoviruses, one coding for the α subunit and the other for the β subunit(18.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggested that it might be possible to produce collagens with stable triple helices by using three baculoviruses, one of them coding for the recombinant collagen polypeptide chains and two coding for the α and β subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The present paper reports on the special features of such a system with human type III collagen as the test collagen and on the characterization of the recombinant collagen produced. A BglII site was created 16 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation codon to a full-length cDNA for the pro-α1 chain of human type III procollagen (19.Tromp G. Kuivaniemi H. Shikata H. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1349-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction, and the cDNA was digested with the BglII and XbaI restriction enzymes. The BglII-XbaI fragment was then ligated to pVL1392 (Invitrogen). The recombinant pVL construct was cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA using the BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen), and the resultant viral pool was collected, amplified, and plaque-purified(17.Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures & Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA _1993Google Scholar). The recombinant virus, termed rhproCIII, was checked by a polymerase chain reaction-based method(20.Malitschek B. Schartl M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 177-178PubMed Google Scholar). Insect cells (Sf9 or High Five; Invitrogen) were cultured in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) or in a serum-free HyQ CCM3 medium (HyClone), either as monolayers or in suspension in spinner or shaker flasks at 27°C. To produce recombinant proteins, insect cells seeded at a density of 5-6 × 105/ml were infected with the rhproCIII virus and with the viruses for the α subunit (virus α59) and β subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase(18.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the rhproCIII virus being used in a 5-10-fold excess over the other two. Ascorbate (80 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium daily. The cells were harvested 48-120 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02 M phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a 0.3 M NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.07 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The remaining cell pellet that was insoluble in the homogenization buffer was further solubilized in 1% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisN-propeptideamino-terminal propeptidepro-α1(III) chainpro-α1 chain of type III procollagen, a protein the molecules of which consist of 3 pro-α1(III) chainsα1(III) chainα1 chain of type III collagen, a protein produced from type III procollagen by the cleavage of the N and C propeptides. The cell culture medium was concentrated 10 times in an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) with a PM-100 membrane. Aliquots of the supernatants of the cell homogenates and the concentrated cell culture medium were analyzed by denaturing SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Western blotting with an antibody to the N-propeptide of human type III procollagen. Other aliquots were studied by a radioimmunoassay for the trimeric N-propeptide of human type III procollagen (Farmos Diagnostica) and a colorimetric method for 4-hydroxyproline(21.Kivirikko K.I. Laitinen O. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Still further aliquots were digested with pepsin for 1 h at 22°C(22.Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and the thermal stability of the pepsin-resistant recombinant type III collagen was measured by rapid digestion with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin (22.Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate(23.Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis amino-terminal propeptide pro-α1 chain of type III procollagen, a protein the molecules of which consist of 3 pro-α1(III) chains α1 chain of type III collagen, a protein produced from type III procollagen by the cleavage of the N and C propeptides. Sf9 cells were grown on glass slides and fixed in 100% ethanol at −20°C. Alternatively, cells in monolayer culture were detached, washed twice with a solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02 M phosphate, pH 7.4 (washing solution), suspended in cold ethanol, and spread on silanated (24.Maples J.A. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1985; 83: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) glass slides. They were then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02 M phosphate, pH 7.4, for 15 min, followed by incubation for 30 min in a 1:50 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antibody to the β subunit (5B5, Dako) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the α subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase in the above solution containing bovine serum albumin. The cells were subsequently washed 4 times for 20 min with the washing solution and incubated in a 1:10 dilution of a sheep anti-mouse Ig-rhodamine F(ab)′2 fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) and a sheep anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein F(ab)′2 fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) in the bovine serum albumin solution for 30 min, washed with the washing solution, rinsed with distilled water, and mounted in Glycergel (Dako). The samples were photographed using a Leitz Aristoplan microscope equipped with epi-illuminator and filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate and tetramethyl rhodamine B isothiocyanate fluorescence. Insect cells expressing the recombinant type III procollagen were washed with a solution of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02 M phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a cold 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4 (20 × 106 cells/ml), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Unless otherwise mentioned, all the following steps were performed at 4°C. The supernatant was chromatographed on a DEAE cellulose column (DE-52, Whatman) equilibrated and eluted with a 0.2 M NaCl and 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4, the void volume being collected. The pH of the sample was lowered to 2.0-2.5, and the sample was digested with a final concentration of 150 μg/ml of pepsin for 1 h at 22°C. The pepsin was irreversibly inactivated by neutralization of the sample followed by overnight incubation on ice. The recombinant type III collagen was precipitated by adding solid NaCl to a final concentration of 2 M and centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was dissolved in a 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M urea, and 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 day, and the sample was digested with pepsin as above a second time. The sample was then chromatographed on a Sephacryl HR-500 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), eluted with a solution of 0.2 M NaCl and 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.4, dialyzed against 0.1 M acetic acid, and lyophilized. The amount of purified type III collagen obtained was determined by Sircol collagen assay (Biocolor). Amino acid analysis of the purified type III collagen was performed in an Applied Biosystems 421 amino acid analyzer. The melting curve was determined in a Jasco J-500 spectropolarimeter, equipped with a temperature-controlled quartz cell of 1-cm path length (Gilford). The collagen concentration for the sample shown was 104 μg/ml in 0.05% acetic acid. Thermal transition curves were recorded at a fixed wavelength (221 nm) by raising the temperature linearly at a rate of 30°C/h using a Gilford temperature programmer. In order to ascertain whether it is possible to produce full-length pro-α1 chains of human type III procollagen in insect cells and whether the pro-α1(III) chains produced in these cells can form triple-helical molecules, a recombinant baculovirus coding for the pro-α1(III) chains was generated and used to infect Sf9 and High Five cells. The cells were cultured in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or in a serum-free medium if the cell culture medium was to be analyzed, harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. Samples of the Triton X-100 soluble protein fraction and the concentrated cell culture medium were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed either by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1A) or Western blotting with an antibody to the N-propeptide of type III procollagen (Fig. 1B). Some of the samples were digested with pepsin for 1 h at 22°C before the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes with odd numbers). The triple helix of collagens is resistant to proteolytic enzymes, whereas nontriple-helical pro-α1(III) chains and the propeptides of triple-helical procollagen molecules are digested. The level of pro-α1(III) chain expression was too low for these to be detected in the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8), but they could be seen by Western blotting in samples of the Triton X-100 soluble proteins (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 6) and cell culture media (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 8) in the case of both the Sf9 and High Five cells. After the pepsin digestion, α1 chains of type III collagen were seen in the High Five cells in the Coomassie-stained gel (Fig. 1A, lane 7). The pepsin-resistant α1(III) chains were not detected in the Western blot (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9), since the antibody used reacts only with the N-propeptides of pro-α1(III) chains, which were apparently digested by the pepsin. One possible explanation for the low level of expression of pepsin-resistant type III collagen could be that insect cells have insufficient amounts of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity. In order to study this possibility, insect cells were coinfected with three recombinant baculoviruses, one of them coding for the pro-α1(III) chain as above, and the other two coding for the α and β subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The cells infected with the three viruses were then cultured, harvested, and analyzed as above, the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE being shown in Fig. 2A and the Western blot in Fig. 2B. The addition of prolyl 4-hydroxylase-coding viruses increased the amount of pro-α1(III) chains present (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2 and 6) and that of pepsin-resistant α1(III) chains (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 7) in both the Sf9 and High Five cells. No pro-α1(III) chains (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 8) or α1(III) chains (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 9) could be detected in the medium samples in the Coomassie-stained gel, but a minor amount of pro-α1(III) chains was seen in the Western blot (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 8). The efficiency of multiple baculovirus infection was assessed by immunocytochemical staining of the insect cells. Sf9 cells were coinfected with two recombinant viruses coding for the α and β subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and immunostained with antibodies to these two subunits (Fig. 3). When the analysis was performed 48 h after infection, 87% of the cells were found to express at least one of the two types of subunit, with 90% of the cells expressing one type of subunit also expressing the other. The 0.2% Triton X-100 extracts of the cell homogenates were analyzed for prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity with an assay based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate(23.Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). As reported previously(25.Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a significant level of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was found in both the Sf9 and High Five cells, that in the High Five cells being distinctly greater than that in the Sf9 cells (Table 1). Infection of the cells with a virus coding for the pro-α1(III) chains had only minor effects on this activity, whereas the activity in the cells infected with the virus coding for the pro-α1(III) chains together with viruses coding for the two types of subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase was markedly higher (Table 1).Tabled 1 Sf9 and High Five cells were infected with the virus coding for the pro-α1(III) chains either with or without viruses coding for the two types of subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (Table 2). The level of expression of total type III procollagen was measured with a radioimmunoassay for the trimeric N-propeptide, and the amount of 4-hydroxyproline formed in the cells was determined by a colorimetric assay. Both values were used to calculate the amount of type III collagen produced, assuming that all the pro-α1(III) chains formed triple-helical molecules and that all the hydroxylatable proline residues in the pro-α1(III) chains had been converted to 4-hydroxyproline. Starting out from the known structure of type III procollagen and the amount of 4-hydroxyproline in type III collagen, the amount of type III collagen in the samples was calculated by multiplying the N-propeptide values by 7 and the 4-hydroxyproline values by 8. If all the pro-α1(III) chains are present in fully hydroxylated, triple-helical molecules, both assays should give identical values, whereas if some of the type III procollagen is converted to type III collagen and the propeptides are subsequently degraded, then the values calculated from the 4-hydroxyproline assay should be higher. All these measurements were made 72 h after infection.Tabled 1 A considerable variation was found in the values obtained in different experiments, as shown in Table 2, but a number of conclusions can still be made from the results. First, the amount of 4-hydroxyproline formed was distinctly higher in the cells infected with the prolyl 4-hydroxylase-coding viruses than in their absence in all the experiments. Second, the level of expression obtained in the High Five cells was consistently higher than that obtained in the Sf9 cells. Third, the level of type III collagen produced in the cells coinfected with the prolyl 4-hydroxylase-coding viruses was always higher when calculated from the 4-hydroxyproline values than from the radioimmunoassay values, suggesting either that some of the N-propeptides of type III procollagen had been degraded or that some of the fully 4-hydroxylated pro-α1(III) chains had remained nontriple-helical. The highest type III collagen expression values were seen in the High Five cells that also expressed prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the amount of cellular type III collagen in these cells being about 41-81 μg/5 × 106 cells (Table 2). The amount of type III collagen found in the culture medium, as measured with the radioimmunoassay, was about 25-50% of the total in the Sf9 cells and about 10-30% that in the High Five cells. Experiments were also performed in which High Five cells were grown in suspension in spinner or shaker flasks. A similar effect of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase-coding viruses was seen as above. The highest expression levels found in such experiments were approximately 40 mg of cellular type III collagen/liter of culture in 72 h, about 80-90% of the total collagen produced being found in the cell pellet and 10-20% in the medium (details not shown). Since the level of expression of type III collagen in the High Five cells was found to be about 3-10-fold relative to that in the Sf9 cells, High Five cells were selected for the subsequent experiments. The time course for the expression of hydroxylated type III procollagen was studied in High Five cells infected with the three recombinant viruses. The cells were harvested at 48, 72, 96, and 120 h after infection, and the amount of type III collagen produced was calculated from the radioimmunoassay and 4-hydroxyproline values as above. In three complete experiments the amount of cellular type III collagen was found to be highest at about 72 h, the value decreasing distinctly at 96 and 120 h (details not shown). The amount of prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in the cell homogenate was likewise highest 72 h after infection (details not shown). The radioimmunoassay showed the amount of type III procollagen in the medium to increase continuously, being about 30-45% of the total at 120 h. The amount of 4-hydroxyproline in the culture medium increased even more, but evidently most of that was present in collagen degradation products, as no band corresponding to the α1 chains of type III collagen was seen at 96 or 120 h by SDS-PAGE analysis (details not shown). Since the amount of cellular type III collagen appeared to be highest 72 h after infection, this time point was used in the subsequent experiments. Association of the pro-α1(III) chains into trimers was studied by SDS-PAGE analysis under nonreducing conditions. Essentially all the pro-α1(III) chains synthesized were found as disulfide-bonded trimers, judging from the disappearance of the band corresponding to monomeric pro-α1(III) chains and the appearance of a protein band of high molecular weight (Fig. 4, lane 2). After pepsin digestion, the band corresponding to the recombinant type III procollagen was converted to one corresponding to type III collagen, and the protein remained in the form of the trimer, thus indicating the existence of disulfide bonds between the α1(III) chains (Fig. 4, lane 3). Virtually all the type III procollagen expressed was soluble in the homogenization buffer containing Triton X-100, as no band corresponding to type III procollagen was seen in the Triton X-100-insoluble, SDS-soluble fraction (Fig. 4, lane 4). The thermal stability of the type III collagen expressed under different cell culture conditions was studied using digestion with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin after heating to various temperatures(22.Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), ascorbate being either added to the cell culture medium daily as usual or omitted during infection. The Triton X-100-soluble proteins were first digested with pepsin for 1 h at 22°C to convert the type III procollagen to type III collagen(22.Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and the trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion was then performed for aliquots of the pepsin-treated samples. When the pro-α1(III) chains were expressed in the absence of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and ascorbate, the Tm of the type III collagen was found to be about 32-34°C (Fig. 5A). The presence of either ascorbate or prolyl 4-hydroxylase without the other caused virtually no increase in thermal stability (Fig. 5, B and C), but when the pro-α1(III) chains were produced in the presence of both, the Tm was increased considerably, being about 40°C (Fig. 5D). Type III procollagen was expressed in High Five cells cultured either as monolayers or in suspension in shaker flasks. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged, and the supernatant of the cell homogenate was passed through a DEAE cellulose column to remove nucleic acids. The flow-through fractions containing the type III procollagen were pooled and digested with pepsin. This converted the type III procollagen to type III collagen and digested most of the noncollagenous proteins. The type III collagen was then concentrated by salt precipitation, solubilized, and treated with pepsin as above. The type III collagen was finally separated from pepsin and other remaining contaminants by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S500-HR column. The fractions containing the type III collagen were pooled, dialyzed, and lyophilized. The purified type III collagen was analyzed by 5% SDS-PAGE under reducing (Fig. 6, lane 2) and nonreducing (Fig. 6, lane 3) conditions. No contaminants were seen in the Coomassie-stained gel, and the α1(III) chains were disulfide-bonded. Amino acid and CD spectrum analyses were performed on the purified type III collagen. The amino acid composition corresponded well with that reported for the human protein (Table 3), although the 4-hydroxyproline content was slightly lower. A distinct difference was found in the amount of hydroxylysine, which was about 3 residues/1000 amino acids in the recombinant type III collagen rather than 5/1000 amino acids in the authentic human type III collagen. The Tm of the recombinant type III collagen was 40.8 ± 1.3°C (± S.D., n = 4), and virtually all of the recombinant protein was stable at 37°C (Fig. 7).Tabled 1Figure 7:Circular dichroism analysis of the denaturation of purified type III collagen.

The High Five cells gave consistently higher production rates than the Sf9 cells, the highest rates seen in High Five cells when cultured in monolayers being about 80 μg of cellular recombinant human type III collagen/5 × 106 cells, which corresponds to about 120 μg of type III procollagen. The largest amount of cellular type III collagen produced when the High Five cells were cultured in suspension in spinner or shaker flasks was about 40 mg/liter, corresponding to about 60 mg/liter of type III procollagen. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase plays a central role in the biosynthesis of all collagens, as 4-hydroxyproline residues are essential for the folding of the newly synthesized polypeptide chains into triple-helical molecules(6.Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 12.Kivirikko K.I. Myllyl ä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C.

When the pro-α1 chains of type III procollagen were expressed in insect cells alone, without recombinant prolyl 4-hydroxylase, considerable amounts of 4-hydroxyproline were generated in the cells and the pro-α1 chains formed triple-helical molecules, as indicated by the resistance of the collagenous domains of these chains to pepsin digestion at 22°C. However, the Tm of the triple helices of such molecules was about 6-8°C lower than of those produced in the presence of the recombinant enzyme. Also, the level of expression of type III collagen was lower in the absence of recombinant prolyl 4-hydroxylase than in its presence, probably because many of the partially hydroxylated polypeptide chains failed to form triple-helical molecules even at 27°C and were rapidly degraded. The insect cell system was found to resemble human fibroblasts (27.Prockop D.J. Berg R.A. Kivirikko K.I. Uitto J. Ramachandran G.N. Reddi A.H. Biochemistry of Collagen.

Acta. 1981; 675: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in that the presence of ascorbate in the culture medium was necessary to produce collagen molecules with stable triple helices. Previous experiments had demonstrated that a fully active human prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer can be produced in insect cells by infecting them with two recombinant baculoviruses, one of them coding for the α subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase and the other the β subunit (18.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the recombinant enzyme had on all previous occasions been extracted from the insect cell homogenates, and the assays had been performed in the presence of the polypeptide substrate and the various cosubstrates in vitro(18.Vuori K.

Although the findings suggested that the enzyme may also be active in insect cells in vivo, the present data constitute the first demonstration that this is indeed the case. Double-immunostaining experiments demonstrated that about 90% of the insect cells expressing one of the two types of subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase also expressed the other.

Although insect cells have a small amount of endogenous protein-disulfide isomerase activity, this activity is markedly increased when the cells are infected with a recombinant baculovirus coding for the human protein-disulfide isomerase/β subunit polypeptide(33.Vuori K. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the recombinant pro-α1(III) chains produced in insect cells expressing the two types of subunit of recombinant prolyl 4-hydroxylase were found to be properly disulfide-bonded when studied by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. A major difference between the insect cell system studied here and human fibroblasts is that most of the triple-helical collagens produced by the insect cells were found to be retained within the cells, whereas collagenous molecules are rapidly secreted from human fibroblasts after formation of their triple helices(27.Prockop D.J.

The low rate of secretion of triple-helical recombinant collagens from insect cells may be related to the finding that such cells often secrete secretory proteins poorly in comparison with many vertebrate cells(33.Vuori K.

The properties of the purified human type III collagen produced in insect cells were found to be very similar to those of type III collagen extracted from various tissues(1.Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I.

In particular, the 4-hydroxyproline content and the Tm of the triple helices, when determined by CD analysis, were found to be very similar to those of nonrecombinant type III collagen. Interestingly, the hydroxylysine content of the recombinant collagen was found to be about 60% of that of type III collagen extracted from various mammalian tissues even though no recombinant lysyl hydroxylase was coexpressed. This indicates that insect cells must have a considerable level of lysyl hydroxylase activity. We did not study the level of glycosylation of the 3 hydroxylysine residues formed per α chain, as even the α chains of type III collagen extracted from various tissues contain only about 0.1 residue of galactosylhydroxylysine and 0.8 of glycosylgalactosylhydroxylysine(36.Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Int. Rev. Connect. Tissue Res. 1979; 8: 23-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as insect cells appear to have relatively high levels of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase activity, they may well also have relatively high levels of collagen glycosyltransferase activities so that some of the hydroxylysine present in the recombinant α1(III) chains may be glycosylated. The insect cell system studied here should allow various recombinant human collagens to be produced for use in medical applications. Furthermore, the insect cell system should make it possible to produce large quantities of various collagens that are present in tissues in amounts too small to be characterized at the protein level.

The second-order rate constants for the inhibition of FXIa by C1 inhibitor, α1-antitrypsin, α2-antiplasmin, and antithrombin III, in the absence of glycosaminoglycans, were 1.8, 0.1, 0.43, and 0.32 × 103M−1 s−1, respectively. The rate constants of the inactivation of FXIa by C1 inhibitor and by antithrombin III increased up to 117-fold in the presence of glycosaminoglycans. These data predicted that considering the plasma concentration of the inhibitors, C1 inhibitor would be the main inhibitor of FXIa in plasma in the presence of glycosaminoglycans.

Glycosaminoglycans did not enhance the inhibition of α-FXIIa, β-FXIIa, or kallikrein by C1 inhibitor.

Stiles C.D. Guha A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7203-7212Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The above evidence, especially the fact that high level expression of the cellular form of the sis oncogene is sufficient for oncogenesis, implies that loss of its transcriptional regulation provides a contributory step in neoplastic transformation. In U2-OS, a human osteosarcoma cell line, coexpression of the PDGF-B gene as well as the PDGF receptor genes is associated with the constitutive activation of the PDGF receptors (Betsholtz et al., 4.Betsholtz C. Westermark B. Ek B. Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1984; 39: 447-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Studies of both v-sis and the PDGF-B gene in U2-OS and other cell types have implicated the presence of an intracellular, autocrine growth circuit in which PDGF-BB binds and activates the PDGF receptors within a cellular processing compartment prior to secretion (Graves et al., 16.Graves D.T.

Because these interactions may be inaccessible to therapeutic strategies such as extracellularly added PDGF antibodies or PDGF receptor antagonists, activation of the endogenous PDGF-B gene remains an important step within the PDGF-B autocrine loop, a step that could potentially be targeted to achieve suppression of the growth-promoting circuit. With regard to the regulatory mechanisms that underlie PDGF-B gene activation, earlier work from our laboratory (Jin et al., 19.Jin H.-M. Brady M.L. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7563-7567Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20.Jin H.-M. Robinson D.F. Liang Y. Fahl W.E. J. Biol.

Ablation of the CACCC motif results in a loss of promoter activity roughly equal to the loss associated with ablation of the TATA box. Such CACCC motifs (also called CA boxes or GT boxes) have been shown to be binding sites for Sp1 as well as other newly identified members of the expanding Sp family of transcription factors (Hagen et al., 17.Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5525-5591Crossref Scopus (525) Google Scholar; Kingsley and Winoto, 23.Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Studies with several promoters have begun to explore the functional contributions of the multiple Sp family members as activators or inhibitors of transcription (Hagen et al., 18.Hagen G. Müller S.

In the PDGF-B promoter, we have previously shown the binding of at least two nuclear factors to the CACCC motif within the SPE (Jin et al., 1994). One of these factors was shown to be Sp1, though the identity of the other factor(s) and the functional significance of their interactions to promoter activity was unknown. In this report, we now demonstrate that the two additional SPE binding species are isoforms of Sp3 with different electrophoretic mobilities. Both Sp1 and Sp3 are shown to require the intact CACCC motif for binding to the SPE, and their binding is necessary for efficient transcription of the PDGF-B gene. Using in vitro transcription assays, depletion of Sp1 and Sp3 binding activity from U2-OS nuclear extracts is associated with a >80% decrease in transcription. Production of recombinant Sp1 or/and Sp3 in U2-OS cells is associated with a substantial increase in PDGF-B transcription. Lastly, we show by nested deletion mutations that the full level of PDGF-B transcription requires multiple cis-acting elements within the 250-bp promoter region. The human osteosarcoma cell line, U2-OS, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were propagated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The PDGF-B luciferase reporter plasmid, RAluc, the linker substitution mutant, J13, and the TIluc-derived reporter plasmids have been previously described (Jin et al., 1994). pGL3-RAluc and pGL3-J13luc were created by cloning the 0.4-kilobase pair PDGF-B promoter fragments from RAluc and J13, respectively, into the pGL3basic vector (Promega). pGL3basic is a modified luciferase reporter plasmid with reduced background activity and enhanced reporter sensitivity for use in both in vitro and in vivo applications (Sherf and Wood, 33.Sherf B.A Wood K.V. Promega Notes. 1994; 49: 14-21Google Scholar). Vectors enabling expression of recombinant Sp1 or Sp3 in mammalian cells (CMV-Sp1 and CMV-Sp3) have been previously described (Hagen et al., 1994). NAluc was constructed by cloning an NcoI-HindIII fragment from the 0.4-kilobase pair PDGF-B promoter fragment into the luciferase reporter plasmid pSV0ALΔ5′. SDAluc, SPAluc, and SPCluc were constructed by cloning polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments from −103 to +75, −64 to +75, and −64 to +6 of the PDGF-B promoter into the HindIII site of pSV0ALΔ5′. Oligonucleotides used in the polymerase chain reaction reactions were: SDAluc, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCTCCTGGCGCTGACT-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTGGCTAGGGAG-3′; SPAluc, 5′-AGCTTCTCCACCCACCTCTC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGGAGCTTGGCTAGGGA-3′; and SPCluc, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTCCACCCACC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGAAGTTGCCAC-3′. All directed mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al.(11.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (Jin et al., 1994). In supershift assays, the binding reaction mixture was incubated with 1 μl of anti-Sp1 antiserum (Santa Cruz) or anti-Sp3 antiserum (Hagen et al., 1994) for 1 h on ice before loading onto the gels. Depletion of Sp1 from nuclear extracts was performed as follows. Nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-Sp1 antiserum for 1 h on ice, the antigen-antibody complex was cleared from the nuclear extracts by adding protein A-agarose and shaking the mixture at 4°C for 3 h, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected. U2-OS cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (Jin et al., 1994). 10 μg of reporter plasmid and 2 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid RSVβgal were used in each electroporation. For cotransfections, 1 μg of reporter plasmid, 10 μg of Sp1 or/and Sp3 expression plasmid, and 5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid BAPβgal were used in each electroporation. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (Jin et al., 1994). The luciferase activities were normalized for the transfection efficiency of each plasmid. The reaction mixtures for in vitro transcription contained 70 μg of U2-OS nuclear protein, 500 ng of circular template DNA, 4 mM MgCl2, 24 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 0.12 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 600 μM each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP in a final volume of 25 μl. When competitor oligonucleotides were added, the nuclear extracts were preincubated with the competitor oligonucleotides at room temperature for 1 h before being added to the reaction mixtures. Reactions were preincubated for 15 min at 30°C before the addition of the NTPs and then were allowed to proceed for 30 min after the addition of the NTPs. Reactions were terminated with 175 μl of stop solution (0.3 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 M sodium acetate, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2 mM EDTA, 3 μg/ml tRNA). Transcription products were analyzed by the primer extension method using a 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-TTACCAACAGTACCGGAATGCCAAG-3′) as a primer. The primer was hybridized to the in vitro transcription products at 50°C for 1 h and extended at 42°C for 45 min by the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml actinomycin D, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 1.0 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The primer extension reactions were terminated with 50 μl of stop solution (2.5 M ammonium acetate, 50 mM EDTA, 250 μg/ml tRNA). The primer extended products were analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel. Products were sized by comparison with a HinfI-digested ϕX174 DNA marker (Promega). In vitro transcription with adenovirus major late promoter was performed with 200 ng of HaeII-linearized template (Farnham and Cornwell, 14.Farnham P.J. Cornwell M.M. Gene Exp. 1991; 1: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar), 6 mM MgCl2, 200 nM ATP, 600 nM CTP and UTP, 25 nM GTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000Ci/mmol) and otherwise the same as described above at 24°C. The run-off transcript from the adenovirus major late promoter promoter was analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel. Nuclear extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × WSB (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glyceral, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), heated at 95°C for 5 min and separated on a 7.5% denaturing polyacylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. The filters were incubated with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaN3) overnight at room temperature. The filters were then incubated at 4°C overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antiserum (Santa Cruz). After three washes with TTBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1% Tween-20), the filters were incubated with goat anti-rabbit antiserum (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, Boehringer Mannheim) at 4°C overnight. The filters were washed three times in TTBS and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (SuperSignal(™)CL-HRP Substrate System, Pierce) and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak). To reprobe the blots, the filters were first stripped of the probes by shaking them in 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) at 50°C for 30 min. The stripped blots were then washed, blocked, and rehybridized with antiserum. In an initial gel shift study of nuclear proteins that bound to the SPE element in the PDGF-B promoter, we identified Sp1 as one of the protein components of the top (t) SPE binding complex (Jin et al., 1994). In this study, approximately half of the t as well as the entire bottom (b) SPE-binding complex remained after treatment of the nuclear extract with the anti-Sp1 antiserum. Yet, the addition of competitor oligonucleotides that contained either a consensus Sp1 binding site or a CACCC box could still completely abolish the remaining t and b complexes. Because two additional Sp family members, Sp3 and Sp4, have been shown to recognize the Sp1 consensus binding site and CACCC-box with affinities similar to Sp1 (Hagen et al., 1992; Kingsley and Winoto, 1992), we sought to determine whether Sp3 and/or Sp4 were the other component(s) of the t and b SPE-binding complexes. U2-OS nuclear extracts were first depleted of Sp1 by treatment with a presumed excess of Sp1-specific antiserum. When tested, this cleared extract still produced t and b complexes with an SPE probe, but they could no longer be supershifted by further addition of anti-Sp1 antiserum (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Separately, when anti-Sp3 antiserum was incubated with U2-OS nuclear extract, a portion of the t complex and the entire b complex were supershifted to the top of the gel, whereas the remaining portion of the t complex was not supershifted (Fig. 1A, lane 3). When both anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antisera were incubated with U2-OS nuclear extracts, both the t and b complexes disappeared, and correspondingly there were two supershifted complexes; one at the Sp3 supershift position and the other at the Sp1 supershift position (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). In these experiments, the antiserum against Sp1 did not cross-react with Sp3 and vice versa. These data indicate that the SPE is bound by two distinct members of the Sp family of transcription factors and that the Sp1:SPE complex forms a slightly faster migrating portion of the t complex, whereas the Sp3:SPE complex forms a slightly slower migrating portion of the t complex (Fig. 1A, lane 2 versus lane 3), as well as all of the b complex. The observation of two Sp3-containing complexes with different electrophoretic mobilities (i.e.,t and b) coincides with our observation of multiple Sp3 bands in Western blots of both U2-OS nuclear extracts (Fig. 1B) and HeLa nuclear extracts (Hagen et al., 1994). In U2-OS cells, the 97-kDa species of Sp3 is much more prominent than the other two smaller species (about 60 and 58 kDa), whose identities are unknown at this stage. However, the faster migrating Sp3-containing complex (i.e., b) observed in gel mobility shift assays seems to result from binding of the amino-terminal truncated form of Sp3. 3G. Suske, unpublished results. There was still a trace amount of the t complex remaining following the double supershift with both anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antisera (Fig. 1A, lane 5). It did not disappear upon further addition of either antiserum or addition of an anti-Sp4 antiserum (data not shown), leaving the identity of this residual 5% of the t complex unknown. Our previous study indicated that directed mutations of the CACCC motif within the SPE dramatically reduced the activity of the PDGF-B promoter, whereas sequences immediately flanking the CACCC motif were less sensitive to mutation (Jin et al., 1994). To determine the effect of these mutations upon binding of Sp1 and Sp3, we performed gel mobility shift assays using double-stranded oligonucleotides that contained the same base substitutions within the SPE as those in the luciferase reporter plasmids (Jin et al., 1994). Base substitutions within the CACCC motif abolished both the t and b SPE-binding complexes, whereas oligonucleotides containing mutations of nucleotides flanking the CACCC motif still formed both SPE-binding complexes but at reduced levels (Fig. 2, A and B). In summary, mutations that functionally impaired transcription from the PDGF-B promoter also eliminated or diminished binding of Sp1 and/or Sp3; this clearly suggested that Sp1 and/or Sp3 regulated transcription of PDGF-B through binding to the CACCC motif within the SPE. The contributions of Sp1 and Sp3 to transcription of the PDGF-B gene was evaluated using an in vitro transcription assay supported by U2-OS nuclear extracts (Fig. 3). The wild-type PDGF-B luciferase reporter plasmid (RAluc) gave a 112-nucleotide major in vitro transcript detected by primer extension analysis in this assay (Fig. 3, lane 1). The addition of an excess of either an Sp1 consensus or a wild-type SPE oligonucleotide to the incubation at concentrations known to abrogate Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the SPE produced an 85% decrease in transcript formation (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). No effect was seen when an equivalent amount of a nonspecific heterologous oligonucleotide was added (Fig. 3, lane 2). Likewise, the addition of the Sp1 and SPE oligonucleotides had no nonspecific inhibitory effect upon transcription initiated from the adenovirus major late promoter (Fig. 3, lanes 6-9). These results indicated that binding of one or both of these Sp factors was necessary for PDGF-B transcription to occur in U2-OS cells. To test the individual abilities of Sp1 and Sp3 to activate or repress PDGF-B transcription, we conducted cotransfection experiments in U2-OS cells using expression plasmids for human Sp1 or Sp3 (Fig. 4A). Cotransfection with either CMV-Sp1 or CMV-Sp3 significantly augmented the expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the wild-type PDGF-B promoter (pGL3-RAluc) 10- and 7-fold, respectively. An additive effect of 16-fold increase in the expression of the luciferase reporter gene was seen when both CMV-Sp1 and CMV-Sp3 were cotransfected, suggesting that Sp1 and Sp3 can simultaneously bind and activate the PDGF-B promoter. To determine what portion of this activation resulted from the CACCC motif within the SPE, we then cotransfected the Sp1 or/and Sp3 expression vectors with a luciferase reporter gene that contained a PDGF-B promoter with the CACCC motif within the SPE ablated (pGL3-J13luc). Expression from this reporter gene was also enhanced by CMV-Sp1 or CMV-Sp3 about 7- and 4-fold, respectively, and enhanced by cotransfection of both CMV-Sp1 and CMV-Sp3 about 13-fold (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that the SPE CACCC motif was not the only site within the PDGF-B promoter through which Sp1 and Sp3 exert their effects. Although the pGL3basic vector was designed to minimize or eliminate spurious Sp-like consensus sites from the vector, it was still possible that a significant part of the Sp1/Sp3-induced activation might be arising from Sp1/Sp3 interactions with vector sequences. To rule out this possibility, we constructed a minimal, synthetic promoter comprised of a 20-bp oligonucleotide containing either the wild-type SPE sequence or a J13 mutant SPE sequence. This 20-mer was inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in the reporter plasmid, TIluc, which consists of the adenovirus major late promoter TATA box and the murine terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase RNA initiation sequence (Jin et al., 1994). Overexpression of Sp1 enhanced SPE-TIluc expression approximately 5.0-fold, and overexpression of Sp3 enhanced SPE-TIluc expression approximately 3.7-fold. Overexpression of both Sp1 and Sp3 enhanced SPE-TIluc expression approximately 7.4-fold (Fig. 4B), consistent with the additive effect also seen on the PDGF-B promoter (Fig. 4A). That the observed additive effect was smaller than simple summation of the individual effects may reflect saturation of the binding sites by overexpressed Sp factors. Overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 alone or together had no significant effect upon either TIluc or J13-TIluc (Fig. 4B). This result supports the conclusion that activation of the mutation-containing PDGF-B promoter in pGL3-J13luc (Fig. 4A) upon Sp1/Sp3 overexpression was through GC or CACCC motifs outside of the SPE. This result also shows that both Sp1 and Sp3 can activate through the CACCC motif within the 20-bp SPE context alone as well as in a synthetic promoter, confirming that both Sp1 and Sp3 are activating transcription factors in U2-OS cells. Our previous studies indicated that the SPE and the TATA box were the most critical cis-acting elements in the PDGF-B promoter in U2-OS cells, whereas other sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the PDGF-B promoter individually had much less of a contribution, if at all, to PDGF-B promoter activity (Jin et al., 1994). However, these sequences might be required to cooperate with the SPE and the TATA box to produce the full level of PDGF-B promoter activity. To test this hypothesis, a series of nested deletion mutations were constructed from the RAluc reporter construct and used in transient transfection analysis (Fig. 5). Deletion of the most 5′ portion of the RAluc promoter, to −250 bp (construct NAluc, −250 to +75), had no effect upon promoter activity consistent with the notion that the −250 to +75 region of the PDGF-B gene contains all of the elements necessary to support transcription. Further 5′ deletion, to −103 bp (construct SDAluc, −103 to +75) and to −64 bp (construct SPAluc, −64 to +75), showed 56 and 94% reductions, respectively, in luciferase activities. To test whether sequences 3′ of the transcription start site might also contribute to PDGF-B transcription, the SPAluc construct was further deleted at the 3′ end to +6 bp (construct SPCluc, −64 to +6). The luciferase activity of SPCluc was 4-fold lower than that of SPAluc, and showed only 1.6% of the activity of the full-length promoter (RAluc). Therefore, the SPE is necessary but not sufficient for the full level transcription of the PDGF-B gene in U2-OS cells, which requires multiple elements both upstream and downstream of the SPE. In this work, we have characterized the proteins that bind to the SPE and determined their functional contributions in regulating transcription of the PDGF-B gene in human U2-OS osteosarcoma cells. We have shown by gel mobility supershift assays that a second protein component of the t SPE-binding complex and the only protein component of the b SPE-binding complex are two species of Sp3 with different electrophoretic mobilities. We have also demonstrated that the CACCC motif within the SPE, which is essential for PDGF-B promoter activity, is essential for binding both Sp1 and Sp3. Using an in vitro transcription assay with U2-OS nuclear extracts, we have shown the complete dependence upon Sp1 and/or Sp3 for transcription of the PDGF-B gene. By cotransfection assays in U2-OS cells, we have demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 can activate the PDGF-B promoter as well as a synthetic promoter through the SPE with Sp1 having a stronger activation potential than Sp3. Although the CACCC motif within the SPE is the dominant site through which Sp1 and Sp3 act, other GC and CACCC motifs in the PDGF-B promoter are likely to be responsible for part of the transcriptional activation by Sp1 or Sp3. Finally, our nested deletion analyses of the PDGF-B promoter have shown that multiple cis-acting elements are necessary for full level transcription of the PDGF-B gene in U2-OS cells. Four members of the Sp family of transcription factors have been identified so far: Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4. Except Sp2, all three of the other Sp factors bind to GC and CACCC box elements with comparable affinities. All three proteins contain a highly conserved DNA binding domain consisting of three zinc finger motifs at the carboxyl terminus. Sp3 and Sp4 also contain several putative functional domains homologous to those of Sp1. These include: (i) the amino-terminal glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich regions similar to the A and B transactivation domains of Sp1; (ii) the highly charged domain immediately 5′ of the zinc fingers, similar to the C transactivation domain of Sp1; (iii) the carboxyl-terminal domain similar to the D transactivation domain of Sp1 (Sp3). Although Sp4 is only expressed in limited cell types, Sp3, like Sp1, is ubiquitously expressed (Hagen et al., 1994). However, the function generally ascribed to Sp3 differs significantly from that of Sp1. Unlike Sp1, which is a potent activator for a wide variety of promoters, Sp3 has to date mainly been described as an inhibitory transcription factor (Hagen et al., 1994; Majello et al., 1994, 1995; Dennig et al., 1995). Sp3 can repress Sp1-mediated activation of responsive promoters, presumably by competition with Sp1 for their common binding sites. Our data indicate, however, that Sp3 can also act as an activator on the PDGF-B promoter as well as a synthetic promoter. Sp1 and Sp3 can both independently and additively activate the PDGF-B promoter through binding to the CACCC motifs within the SPE and to other GC and CACCC motifs within the PDGF-B promoter. However, functional interactions between the SPE and Sp1 or Sp3 do not appear to result in equivalent levels of activation; Sp1 appears to be a more potent activator than Sp3. This might reflect the intrinsic difference in the activation domains of Sp1 and Sp3 (Hagen et al., 1994) and/or differential regulation of Sp1 and Sp3 activity in U2-OS cells. Besides the CACCC motif, the 10-bp sequence substituted in the J14 mutant reporter plasmid is also important for the activity of the SPE, because any of the two nucleotide transversion mutations within the J14 domain reduced the formation of SPE-binding complexes (Fig. 2B) as well as the promoter activity, and an aggregate mutation of this sequence results in promoter activity comparable with that of the CACCC knock-out mutant J13 (Jin et al., 1994). This sequence does not contain any discernible transcription factor binding sites. One possible function of this sequence is that it may be required for the stabilization or correct conformation of Sp-SPE complexes formed on the adjacent CACCC site. Our previous linker-scanning mutagenesis across the entire 250-bp 5′ flanking sequence of the PDGF-B promoter identified the SPE and TATA box as the most critical cis-acting elements along with several minor ones (Jin et al., 1994). Our present nested deletion analyses demonstrated that the promoter sequence between the SPE (i.e., −64) and the +6 site of the PDGF-B promoter confers only 1.6% of the activity of which the full-length (i.e., −250 to +75) PDGF-B promoter is capable. Therefore, other cis-acting elements both upstream and downstream of the SPE, although individually not as critical as the SPE and TATA box, are required to cooperate with the SPE and TATA box to achieve full level PDGF-B promoter activity. This is consistent with the notion that synergy among multiple activators may enhance preinitiation complex formation by promoting stabilized binding of TFIID to the promoter and subsequent recruitment of other basal transcription factors, whereas a single molecule of activator is unable to do so (Chi et al., 6.Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar; Buratowski, 5.Buratowski S. Science. 1995; 270: 1773-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar; Sauer et al., 30.Sauer F. Hansen S.K. Tjian R.

Among the minor elements within the PDGF-B promoter are multiple GC and CACCC boxes that are potential Sp1/Sp3 binding sites. Our cotransfection experiments demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 could still augment luciferase expression from reporter constructs in which the CACCC motif within the SPE had been mutated, although to a lesser degree than with the wild-type reporter construct. This suggests that Sp1 and Sp3 also activate through these other GC or CACCC boxes and that this activation can partially compensate for the reduced expression resulting from mutation of the SPE. The loss of multiple GC and CACCC boxes in the SDAluc construct possibly accounts for the 56% reduction in its promoter activity. The 7-fold reduction in promoter activity of the SPAluc construct compared with that of the SDAluc construct might result from the combined effect of losing the SIS distal element, AP-1 and ETS sites. Finally, sequences 3′ to the transcription initiation site also seem to be important because deletion of this region further reduced promoter activity 4-fold. Careful analysis of this region by systematic linker-scanning mutagenesis should identify the putative cis-acting elements. In U2-OS osteosarcoma cells, we are now able to partially explain the activated expression of the PDGF-B gene by demonstrating the functional interaction of Sp1 and Sp3 with CACCC motifs within the PDGF-B promoter. More detailed understanding awaits the characterization of other cooperating elements and factors. Furthermore, other regulatory events such as DNA methylation of the endogenous PDGF-B promoter and nucleosome phasing at specific activation sites may confer higher level specificity and complexity of regulation of PDGF-B expression in vivo. Nevertheless, characterization of the SPE and its interactions with Sp1 and Sp3, which play essential roles in regulation of PDGF-B transcription, will help us to define the molecular interplay among multiple cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors in the regulation of PDGF-B transcription under various conditions. It is through a better understanding of the mechanism of activated PDGF-B transcription in U2-OS cells that we hope to further elucidate the contribution of aberrant growth factor synthesis to the neoplastic state of these human osteosarcoma cells.

The response profile of PC12-E2 cells to NGF and bFGF is similar to that observed for native PC12 cells pre-exposed (primed) to NGF, and such cells also respond to IL-6 in a fashion indistinguishable from PC12-E2 cells. Mechanistically, NGF and bFGF induce a sustained phosphorylation and activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in both cells, while IL-6 produces only a transient and weak tyrosine phosphorylation. However, it does stimulate a prolonged and biphasic tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3; at least 24 h) and, to a lesser extent, Stat1. Gel shift and supershift analyses confirm that IL-6 predominantly activates Stat3 (and some Stat1) and stimulates sis-inducible element binding activity. Other members of the same cytokine subfamily, including ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, also cause a transient initial phase of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat1 and Stat3 (up to 1 h) but fail to stimulate a second phase of response and do not produce significant neurites. These results suggest that sustained signaling of either STAT or ERK pathways in PC12-E2 cells leads to induction of neuronal differentiation. However, only the latter is effective in native PC12 cells as the activation of Stat3 and Stat1 in native PC12 cells by IL-6 fails to induce neuronal differentiation. Thus, the response of PC12-E2 cells to IL-6 suggests the constitutive expression of a required factor(s) for differentiation, that is induced in native PC12 cells by NGF or bFGF (possibly by ERK activation), but not by IL-6 via Janus kinase/STAT activation.

Co-precipitating with the InaD protein and eye-PKC are two other key components of the transduction pathway, namely the trp protein, which is proposed to form a Ca2+ channel, and the norpA-encoded phospholipase C, the primary target enzyme of the transduction pathway. It is proposed that the rise of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration upon visual excitation initiates the phosphorylation of the InaD protein by eye-PKC and thereby modulates its function in the control of the light response."

The two proteins are products of the same gene, as demonstrated by peptide sequencing. The corresponding cDNAs code for a product that contains an amino-terminal putative transmembrane domain, a domain related to the plant enzyme strictosidine synthase, and a mucin-like domain in the carboxyl-terminal part of the protein. The gene is expressed throughout development. In adult flies, high expression is found in hemocytes, in specialized regions of the gut, and in the ovary, where the protein is deposited onto the egg surface. In the gut, the mucin co-localizes with the peritrophic membrane. The cytogenetic location of the gene is on the third chromosome in the region 97F-98A.

To identify whether p85-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is a target molecule of wortmannin in this inhibitory process, we established a murine macrophage cell line (P388D1), inducibly expressing a dominant-negative p85, Δp85. Upon induction of Δp85 by isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, PAF still induced unaltered activation of MAPK, which was inhibited completely by wortmannin and 1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester in an additive manner. Thus, PAF activates MAPK in P388D1 cells via two distinct pathways, one calcium-dependent and another calcium-independent, but wortmannin-sensitive. The inhibition of calcium-independent activation of MAPK by wortmannin does not involve p85-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

The final preparation contained proteins of 48 and 36-38 kDa. All of these proteins had the same amino-terminal sequence and were enzymatically active. The smaller species represent proteolysis products with carboxyl-terminal truncation. The Km of the enzyme for inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate was 80 nM with a Vmax of 60 nmol of product/min/mg of protein. The amino acid sequence of the tryptic peptide HSKLLARPAGGLVGERTCNAXP matched the protein sequence encoded by a human expressed sequence tag clone (GB T09063) at 16 of 22 residues. The expressed sequence tag clone was used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library to obtain a cDNA clone of 1991 base pairs (bp) that predicts a protein of 46 kDa. The clone encodes the amino-terminal amino acid sequence obtained from the purified calf brain preparation, suggesting that it represents its human homologue. The cDNA was expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli and was found to have inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase activity. Remarkably, both the purified calf brain and recombinant proteins produced both inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate as products in a ratio of 2.3-5:1. This finding proves that a single kinase phosphorylates inositol in both the D5 and D6 positions. Northern blot analysis identified a transcript of 3.6 kilobases in all tissues with the highest levels in brain.

The composite cDNA isolated contains 3054 bp with a poly(A) tail, suggesting that 500-600 bp of 5′ sequence remains to be identified. The phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway involves a complex scheme in which cells use a series of kinases and phosphatases to interconvert the six known inositol lipids and the more than 20 inositol phosphates that exist in eukaryotic cells(1.Shears S.B.

Many of the reactions in this pathway are catalyzed by several different isoenzymes, most notably phospholipase C (5.Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev.

Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of water, and the samples were loaded onto a 400-μl Dowex-formate column equilibrated in water. Each column was washed with 8 ml of 0.8 M ammonium formate, pH 3.5 to elute the substrate. The product was eluted with 2 ml of 1.6 M ammonium formate and was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Activity was expressed as a first-order rate constant using the equation [S] = [S]oe-kt, as described previously(13.Caldwell K.K. Lips D.L. Bansal V.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18378-18386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen calf brains were ground using a Hobart vegetable shredder. The tissue was then homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer in homogenization buffer containing 20 mM MES, pH 6.1, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.1, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM benzamidine, 250 mM sucrose, 200 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor/ml, 40 μM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μM iodoacetamide, 1 μM pepstatin A, 10 μM bestatin, 1 mM DTT, 200 μl of diisopropyl fluorophosphate/L, 17 μg of calpain inhibitor I/ml, and 7 μg calpain inhibitor II/ml (1 ml of homogenization buffer/g of frozen tissue). This crude homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 40 min, and the resulting supernatant was used as the crude extract. The crude extract from 12 brains was filtered sequentially through 80-, 5-, and 1-μm filters prior to being applied to a 3.5-liter heparin-agarose column (45 × 10 cm) equilibrated in 20 mM Bis-Tris, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.2 (heparin buffer A). After washing with two column volumes of buffer A, the column was step eluted with heparin buffer A containing 0.2 M NaCl. The fractions containing Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity were pooled and precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was stored at −80°C until 36 calf brains were processed in the same manner. Between uses, the heparin-agarose column was washed with two column volumes each of 2 M NaCl and 8 M urea to remove residual protein. The ammonium sulfate pellets were combined, resuspended in homogenization buffer, and dialyzed against heparin buffer A containing 3 mM MgCl2 (heparin buffer B). The dialyzed samples were loaded onto a 500-ml heparin-agarose column (25 × 5 cm), equilibrated with heparin buffer B, and eluted with 0.3 M NaCl in heparin buffer B. The fractions containing Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity were pooled, precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate, and dialyzed against heparin buffer B. The sample was next applied to an 85-ml heparin-agarose column (48 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated in heparin buffer B. After washing with two column volumes of buffer B, the column was eluted with a 1.6-liter linear gradient of 0-1 mM inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) in heparin buffer B. Two pools of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity were collected from this elution and were dialyzed against 55% ammonium sulfate in heparin buffer B. After centrifugation, the pellets were dialyzed against heparin buffer B and applied separately to a 1-ml Mono Q column. Fractions were eluted using a 20-ml linear gradient of 0-0.3 M NaCl in heparin buffer B. Partially purified Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase was mixed with SDS gel loading buffer for a final concentration of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, and 50 mM DTT(14.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205447) Google Scholar), heated to 40°C for 5 min, and loaded onto two lanes of a 12% SDS gel. One lane containing 5/6-kinase was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein, and the other lane was sliced into 41 pieces, each of which was eluted into a volume of 200 μl of assay buffer (described above) containing 0.96 pmol of [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 18 h, and formation of product was determined as described above. Partially purified Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands corresponding to Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase were excised for solid phase amino acid sequencing on an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencer. Purified 5/6-kinase was digested with trypsin and lysyl endopeptidase as described previously(15.York J.D. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9548-9552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Peptides were isolated by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column and sequenced as described(15.York J.D. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9548-9552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Human EST clone GB T09063 (phagemid clone HIBB058) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. A 200-bp HindIII fragment from this clone was purified using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit and was labeled with [α-□P]CTP using a random hexamer labeling kit. Unincorporated label was removed using a Quick Spin(™) column. This probe was used to screen 0.7 × 106 plaques from a λ ZAP human fetal brain cDNA library. The primary screen yielded 21 clones. One of these (clone 15) was found to contain the entire open reading frame of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase including a possible initiation codon, as determined from the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified calf brain enzyme. Clone 15 was digested with EcoRI, and the resulting fragment was gel purified and ligated into the Xpress(™) System Protein Expression TrcHis vector as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). From a 25-ml culture having an A600 of 0.6 at the time of induction with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, 1 ml was removed at various time points, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Bacterial pellets were lysed by the addition of 50 μl of 20 mM MES, pH 6.1, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM benzamidine, 40 μM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μM iodoacetamide, 1 μM pepstatin A, 10 μM bestatin, 1 mM DTT, 17 μg of calpain inhibitor I/ml, 7 μg of calpain inhibitor II/ml, and 3 mM MgCl2, followed by freezing on dry ice and thawing. To each pellet suspension, 5 μl of 10 mg of lysozyme/ml in the above buffer was added, and samples were kept on ice until all time points were collected. Assays for 5/6-kinase activity were done as described above. The 200-bp HindIII fragment of the EST clone GB T09063 was labeled with [α-□P]CTP as described above. Hybridization was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Samples were applied to a 250 × 4.6-mm Adsorbosphere SAX column (Alltech/Applied Science, Deerfield, IL) and were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1.0 M ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, over 200 min at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, using a modification of the method of Hughes et al.(16.Hughes P.J. Hughes A.R. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions (480 μl) were collected, and radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. An internal standard of [□P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was prepared by phosphorylating [□P]Ins(1,4,5)P3 with recombinant Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase as follows. E. coli cultures (2 × 150 ml) expressing recombinant Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase were harvested 4 h after induction with 2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The bacterial pellets were combined and homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 μM leupeptin. A 10,000 × g supernatant from this homogenate was adjusted to 0.2 mM CaCl2 and loaded onto a 1.2-ml calmodulin-agarose column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 200 mM KCl, and 1 mM DTT (equilibration buffer). The column was washed with 15 ml of equilibration buffer, followed by a 6.5-ml wash of equilibration buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS. Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM EGTA. Fractions (1 ml) were assayed for 3-kinase activity using [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 as substrate. Partially purified Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase was incubated for 30 min at 37°C with [□P]Ins(1,4,5)P3 in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 5 mM ATP, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 μM calmodulin, 2.5 mM 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and 0.1 mM CaCl2. Product was separated from substrate using a 1.0-ml Dowex-formate column equilibrated in water. Ins(1,4,5)P3 was eluted with 0.8 M ammonium formate, pH 3.5, and [□P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was eluted with 1.6 M ammonium formate, pH 3.5. Pooled fractions containing [□P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were lyophilized prior to use. Extracts of fresh frozen bovine tissues were assayed for Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase to determine the best source for purification. Calf brain had the highest activity, with frozen calf brains from a commercial source (By Prod Corporation) having a specific activity of 25-30 min-1/mg protein and a freshly obtained calf brain frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen having a specific activity of 48 min-1/mg protein. Using supernatant from commercial calf brain as a reference of 100% activity, activities of other tissue supernatants were as follows: bovine brain (67%), rat brain (13%), bovine lung (10%), bovine thymus (5.7%), bovine kidney and liver (4.7%), bovine heart (1.1%), and bovine skeletal muscle (0.4%). The purification of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase exploited the finding that various conditions altered the position of elution of enzyme from heparin-agarose columns. In the absence of MgCl2, the Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity elutes from heparin-agarose with 0.2 M NaCl (Fig. 1A). Upon rechromatography in the presence of 3 mM MgCl2, Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity bound more tightly and was eluted with 0.3 M NaCl (Fig. 1B). Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity was further purified on another heparin-agarose column eluted with a linear gradient of IP6. In the absence of MgCl2, Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity elutes very early in the gradient (data not shown). In the presence of MgCl2, Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity elutes midway through the gradient at 0.4 mM IP6, as shown in Fig. 1C. At this point, the preparation was divided into two parts based on the specific activity of the fractions. Pool 1 contained fractions with a specific activity of 5000-18,000 min-1/mg, and pool 2 contained fractions with a specific activity of 18,000-52,000 min-1/mg (Fig. 1C). The two pools of enzyme activity were applied separately to a Mono Q column. Elution of pool 2 with a linear gradient of NaCl is shown in Fig. 1D. Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity elutes at 0.12 M NaCl with a small peak of coincident protein. The bulk of protein elutes later in fractions 13-15. The specific activity of the peak fraction was 3.7 × 105 min-1/mg. Application of pool 1 to the Mono Q column yielded an identical profile of protein and Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity, but with lower specific activities of the fractions (data not shown). SDS-gel analysis of the Mono Q fractions from pool 2 indicated that the peak fraction contains two discrete sets of protein bands. One protein has an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa, whereas the other is a triplet of proteins ranging in size from 36-38 kDa (Fig. 2). A summary of the purification is shown in Table 1. From 36 calf brains, a total of 53 g of protein was obtained from the 48,000 × g supernatant (crude extract). The final material (pool 2) had a specific activity of 3.7 × 105 min-1/mg protein. The overall yield for this fraction was 3%, with a 12,900-fold purification.Tabled 1 To determine which proteins on the SDS gel represented the Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase, an SDS gel renaturation assay was done using material from an IP6 affinity elution of a heparin-agarose column, with a specific activity of 12,000 min-1/mg protein. The enzyme had some residual activity under these conditions if the sample was heated at no more than 40°C and if the gel slices were resuspended in a volume of assay buffer no smaller than 200 μl in order to dilute the SDS. Fig. 3 shows the result of a gel renaturation assay. Fig. 3A shows the Coomassie-stained gel with molecular mass markers and the lane of the sample that was used for the enzyme assay. The slices made in the gel can be seen at the far right of the Coomassie-stained gel piece. In this assay, two peaks of activity were found, corresponding to the 48- and 36-38-kDa proteins obtained in the final preparation. Both the 48- and the 36-38-kDa proteins were also shown to have the same amino-terminal amino acid sequence (data not shown). Amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, obtained from sequencing excised bands from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes from early preparations of lower specific activity (350-550 min-1/mg protein), indicated that a predominant 36-kDa band was aldolase type C (17.Buono P. Mancini F.P. Izzo P. Salvatore F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which was a major contaminant of the preparations (data not shown). Under nonreducing conditions on a series of gel filtration columns, aldolase elutes as a tetramer with an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa, whereas Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity was found only in fractions of lower molecular weight (data not shown). It was recently shown by Baron et al.(18.Baron C.B. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. LaBelle E.F. Coburn R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20459-20465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that aldolase type C binds Ins(1,4,5)P3 and that this binding is inhibited strongly by Ins(1,3,4)P3, which may explain its copurification with Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase. Amino acid sequence was obtained from amino-terminal sequencing of the intact calf brain enzyme, from several partially degraded proteins, and from tryptic and lysyl endopeptidase peptides. One of the peptides obtained from trypsin digestion had the sequence HSKLLARPAGGLVGERTCNAXP and was found to match the protein sequence predicted by the DNA sequence of a human EST clone in Genbank at 16 of 22 residues. This clone (GB T09063) was used to isolate additional clones from a human fetal brain library (see “Experimental Procedures”). A schematic diagram of the EST clone GB T09063 and the overlapping human fetal brain clone is shown in Fig. 4. The consensus clone contains 3054 bp with an open reading frame of 1242 bp and 1700 bp of 3′-untranslated region. A polyadenylation signal is located 23 bp upstream from a poly(A) tail. There is no in-frame stop codon in the sequence 5′ of this, thus it is possible that initiation occurs in a 5′ site not yet obtained. There is a weak Kozak consensus sequence (19.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar) around bp 1 shown in Fig. 5. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 45.6 kDa with a pI of 6.1 (Fig. 5). The peptide sequences obtained from the calf brain preparation presumed to match the corresponding amino acids in the human protein are underlined. They were identical at 45 of 54 residues sequenced (83%).Figure 5:Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of human Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase.

Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68199) Google Scholar). The three regions are spaced throughout both the Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase sequence and the PKC∊ sequences (Fig. 6A). In the first conserved region, comprised of 12 amino acids, there is 50% identity and 75% similarity between the two PKC∊ isoforms and Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase. The second region contains 32% identity and 56% similarity, and the third region contains 72% identity and 81% similarity. In addition, the sequence obtained for Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase has similarity to the predicted amino acid sequences of two other ESTs in the Genbank. Fig. 6B shows a comparison between the predicted amino acid sequence of human Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase and the predicted amino acid sequences available for the EST clones GB Z25963 from Arabidopsis thaliana and GB D46351 from rice. The predicted amino acid sequence of the Arabidopsis partial cDNA is 44% identical to and 79% similar to Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase over 54 amino acids and contains a methionine near the putative initation methionine. The predicted amino acid sequence of the rice partial cDNA is 32% identical and 76% similar to Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase over 139 amino acids. Northern blot analysis of human tissues disclosed that there is a transcript of 3.6 kilobases that is most abundant in brain, followed by heart > skeletal muscle > kidney = pancreas = liver = placenta > lung (Fig. 7A). We also probed a Northern blot containing mRNA from various regions of the human brain and found expression of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase in all regions of the brain represented (Fig. 7B). In addition to the 3.6-kilobase transcript, a weakly hybridizing band of 5.3 kilobases was observed in some but not all of the regions of the brain. This may represent an alternatively spliced form or other isoform of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase. A bacterial expression construct was prepared using an EcoRI fragment of clone 15 containing the entire open reading frame inserted into a TrcHis vector with 6 histidine residues at the amino terminus. Bacterial lysates containing this construct were found to contain Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity, whereas bacterial lysates expressing Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase in an incorrect reading frame had no Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity. The time course for phosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 is shown in Fig. 8. The reaction is linear with time and is concentration-dependent. Previous analyses of phosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 by partially purified preparations of this kinase indicated two products, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, in a ratio of 5:1 (9.Abdullah M. Hughes P.J. Craxton A. Gigg R. Desai T. Marecek J.F. Prestwich G.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22340-22345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a ratio of 4:1 (11.Hughes P.J. Kirk C.J. Michell R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We repeated the product analyses using the more highly purified protein (3.7 × 105 min-1/mg) as well as the recombinant enzyme produced in bacteria. The result of HPLC analyses of the products of Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphorylation by purified calf brain Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase and by recombinant human Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase expressed in E. coli are shown in Fig. 9(A and B, respectively). The minor product co-chromatographed with the internal standard of [□P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and the major product eluted just before this in a position previously shown for Ins(1,3,4,6)P4(21.Balla T.

The same ratio of products (2.3:1) was observed using either highly purified calf brain or recombinant enzyme in this experiment. We have isolated an Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase from calf brain that phosphorylates Ins(1,3,4)P3. In bovine tissues the Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity is most abundant in calf brain, constituting 0.13% of total soluble protein, and is 20- and 200-fold less prevalent in liver and in skeletal muscle, respectively. In the case of skeletal muscle, the lower amounts of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase activity correlate with the low levels of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 in skeletal muscle reported by 5r and Thieleczek(25.Mayr G.W. Thieleczek R. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By contrast, inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase, which also utilizes Ins(1,3,4)P3 as a substrate, is present in relatively high amounts in skeletal muscle (26.Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), as is inositol 1,3-bisphosphate(25.Mayr G.W. Thieleczek R. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the product of Ins(1,3,4)P3 dephosphorylation by inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase(27.Bansal V.S. Inhorn R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9444-9447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative abundance of these enzymes may contribute to the low level of Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 found in this tissue. Our purification of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase employed chromatography in the presence and the absence of MgCl2 and affinity elution with IP6. The final preparation had a peak specific activity of 3.7 × 105 min-1/mg protein, with two sets of protein bands of apparent molecular masses of 48 and 36-38 kDa. Identification of these protein bands as Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase was accomplished by gel renaturation assays, in which bands excised from an SDS gel were shown to phosphorylate Ins(1,3,4)P3. The specific activity of the preparation reported here is greater than 200 times higher than that reported for the enzyme purified from rat liver(9.Abdullah M. Hughes P.J. Craxton A. Gigg R. Desai T. Marecek J.F. Prestwich G.D. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22340-22345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence of carboxyl-terminal proteolysis in the calf brain preparation, and the protein purified from rat liver has a molecular mass of 36 kDa, which is consistent with proteolysis in that preparation. A similar situation occurred in the isolation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase where early reports of purification found proteolyzed and relatively inactive enzyme compared with the full-length protein(28.Choi K.Y. Kim H.K. Lee S.Y. Moon K.H. Sim S.S. Kim J.W. Chung H.K. Rhee S.G. Science. 1990; 248: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A major contaminant of the calf brain Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase at early stages of the purification is aldolase type C. Because aldolase C is an inositol polyphosphate binding protein, it may also have contaminated the rat liver preparation. Using protein sequence obtained from the purified calf brain protein, we have cloned and expressed the human homolog of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase. The cDNA obtained encodes a 46-kDa protein with regions of similarity to human and rabbit PKC∊ isoforms. Only one of the three conserved regions, residues 237-273 of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase, lies in a defined domain of PKC∊ (reviewed by Hug and Sarre(29.Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar)). This region is in a loop that is very sensitive to proteolysis by calpain. The predicted amino acid sequence is also similar to the predicted amino acid sequence of two plant cDNA EST clones in GenBank. Although limited sequence identities are described here, complete sequencing of these genes may yield further regions of similarity. These proteins may therefore represent the plant homologs of human Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase. There is no sequence similarity to other inositol polyphosphate kinases or phosphatases including the phosphatases that utilize the same substrate as Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase. The cloning of Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase allowed definitive identification of the products of this enzyme. In enzyme preparations from tissues it was conceivable that two kinases were copurified that phosphorylated either the 5 or 6 position of Ins(1,3,4)P3. The demonstration of both 5- and 6-kinase activities toward Ins(1,3,4)P3 by the recombinant kinase rules out contamination of the protein preparation. This dual product formation from a single substrate makes Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase unique among the inositol polyphosphate kinases and phosphatases. There is a constant ratio of the two tetrakisphosphate products formed by the purified calf brain enzyme and the recombinant human enzyme, with a preference for the 6 position, which might result from the formation and ultimate hydrolysis of a cyclic phosphate intermediate. If the two products result from hydrolysis of a cyclic intermediate, it is possible that the product ratio is different in cells. Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase phosphorylates one of the two possible positions (i.e., IP5 is not a product). This finding would also be consistent with a cyclic 5/6 phosphate intermediate. Alternatively, the production of dual products may serve some as yet undiscovered cellular function. With Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase available as a recombinant enzyme, the mechanism of its dual phosphorylation and studies of formation of higher phosphorylated inositol polyphosphates may be carried out. We thank Dave Wilson and John York for helpful discussions, Cecil Buchanan for technical assistance, and Evan Sadler and Douglas Tollefsen for critiquing the final manuscript."

The effect of impermeant solutes such as NaCl was much less pronounced, whereas the permeant solute glycerol had no effect. In addition, this same sequence, minus the egr-1 minimal promoter, conferred urea responsiveness to a heterologous (thymidine kinase) promoter. Whereas deletion of two putative AP-1 sites from the sequence had no effect upon urea inducibility, elimination of the five putative serum response elements (SREs) abolished the urea effect. Progressive deletion of the SREs caused a corresponding diminution in urea effect. Two key tandem SREs (SRE-3 and SRE-4), in conjunction with their two adjacent clusters of Ets motifs, were sufficient to confer urea responsiveness to a reporter gene. This response was markedly attenuated in the absence of either cluster of Ets motifs and was abolished if both clusters were deleted. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, formation of the ternary complex was constitutive and was demonstrable in vitro despite the presence of 200 mosm urea or NaCl. Therefore urea-inducible egr-1 transcription in renal medullary cells is mediated through the SRE and adjacent Ets motifs; ternary complex formation is not inhibited even in the presence of physiological hyperosmolality.

We cloned two bcl-2-related cDNAs from a rat thymus cDNA library by low stringency hybridization with a rat bcl-2 fragment as a probe. One of these, designated bcl-xα, was a counterpart of the human bcl-xL reported previously as a bcl-2-related gene (Boise, L. H., Gonzalez-Garcia, M., Postema, C. E., Ding, L., Lindsten, T., Turka, L. A., Mao, M., Nunez, G., and Thompson, C. B. (1993) Cell 74, 597-608). The other, designated bcl-xβ, was novel and found to be generated by an unspliced mRNA, whereas bcl-xα was generated from a spliced transcript. The splice junction exactly corresponded to that found in the bcl-2 gene. bcl-xβ was specifically expressed in cerebellum, heart, and thymus. When bcl-xβ directed by a strong promoter was introduced into an interleukin-3-dependent promyeloid cell line, FDC-P1, DNA fragmentation was observed even in the growing state in the presence of interleukin-3 although not in the control transfectants. This finding suggests that the rat bcl-xβ gene product promotes apoptosis in the promyeloid cells."

https://openalex.org/W2171371444,"Since recent studies demonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induces vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation by stimulating polyamine synthesis, we examined whether the transcellular transport of L-ornithine, the cationic amino acid precursor of polyamines, could regulate the mitogenic response of PDGF. Treatment of SMC with PDGF stimulated DNA and putrescine synthesis, and this was enhanced further by increasing the extracellular concentration of L-ornithine. The potentiating effect of L-ornithine was reversed by the competitive inhibitor of cationic amino acid transport, methyl-L-arginine, or by preventing putrescine formation with α-difluoromethylornithine. Cationic amino acid uptake by SMC was Na+-independent and was mediated by both a high and low affinity carrier system. Treatment of SMC with PDGF initially (0-2 h) decreased basic amino acid transport, while longer exposures (6-24 h) progressively increased uptake. Kinetic studies indicated that PDGF-induced inhibition was associated with a decrease in affinity for cationic amino acids, while the stimulation was mediated by an increase in transport capacity. Endogenous PDGF released by collagen-activated platelets likewise up-regulated cationic amino acid transport in SMC. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detected the presence of mRNA encoding two distinct cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) proteins, CAT-1 and CAT-2B. Treatment of SMC with PDGF strongly induced the expression CAT-2B mRNA and modestly elevated the level of CAT-1 mRNA.

The capacity of PDGF to up-regulate the transport of L-ornithine by inducing the expression of the genes for CAT-1 and CAT-2B may modulate its mitogenic effect by providing SMC with the necessary intracellular precursor for polyamine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2082662350,"The proximal or core promoter of a typical eukaryotic protein coding gene comprises distinct elements, TATA and/or initiator (Inr). The existence of TATA or Inr at the core promoter suggests that the mechanism of transcription initiation mediated by these two genetic elements may be different. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional requirements for the TATA-containing, Inr-less (TATA+Inr-) promoters are different from the transcriptional requirements for the TATA-less, Inr-containing (TATA-Inr+) promoters. Although both types of promoters require the transcription initiation factor (TFIID) in addition to other common initiation factors, a TATA-Inr+ promoter requires accessory component(s). Here we have employed in vitro analyses to address the transcription factor requirements for a TATA-Inr+ promoter. We demonstrate that in addition to TFIID, a naturally occurring TATA-Inr+ promoter requires TFII-I, an Inr element-dependent transcription factor. Consistent with its Inr element-dependent activities, TFII-I is dispensable for a TATA+Inr- promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both TFII-I and TFIID activities in nuclear extracts are temperature-sensitive. However, TFII-I is heat-inactivated at temperatures lower than that required to inactivate TFIID. Therefore, differential heat treatment of nuclear extracts provides an assay to discriminate between transcriptional requirements at TATA+Inr- and TATA-Inr+ promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2090680720,"Although Ras-related small GTPases are believed to control cell proliferation and motility through activation of protein kinase cascades, little is known about the intracellular protein targets of activated kinases. Here we show that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) phosphorylates actin-binding protein (ABP-280) in intact rat 3Y1 fibroblasts. Growth factors such as fetal calf serum, epidermal growth factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and lysophosphatidic acid stimulate the phosphorylation of serine residues in ABP-280 in quiescent 3Y1 cells.

INTRODUCTIONProtein phosphorylation cascades are essential for many processes in mammalian cells. In particular, transmission of mitogenic signals to intracellular targets is mediated by the activation of protein kinases. One pathway is the Ras-dependent or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAPK kinaseRSKribosomal protein S6 kinaseSAPstress-activated proteinABPactin-binding proteinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorLPAlysophosphatidic acidPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferaseFPLCfast protein liquid chromtatographyCaMcalmodulin. signaling cascade (1.Marshall C.J.

In this pathway, binding of growth factors to their receptors activates the small GTPase Ras through the GRB2 adapter protein and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SOS). This is followed by a sequential activation of multiple protein kinases (raf-1, MEK, MAPK, and RSK). This protein kinase cascade leads to the phosphorylation of factors which initiate gene expression and modify metabolic and cytoskeletal processes to sustain or promote cell growth and differentiation. Hence, activation of the serine/threonine-specific protein kinases (i.e. MAPKs and RSKs) is believed to effect the phosphorylation of targets that play important regulatory roles in a variety of cellular processes(6.Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 7.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identification of intracellular protein targets and the effect of phosphorylation on the function of these proteins are poorly understood.ABP-280 is a member of a large protein family that shares the ability to cross-link actin filaments into orthogonal networks(8.Hartwig J. Kwiatkowski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). ABP-280 is an elongated dimer composed of identical 280-kDa subunits, each composed of long rod domains of repetitive β-sheet motifs that connect an amino-terminal actin-binding domain to a carboxyl-terminal self-association site(9.Gorlin J. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T. Kwiatkowski D. Hartwig J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 10.Hock R. Davis G. Speicher D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9441-9451Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).ABP-280 and its muscle isoform (filamin) are phosphorylated in intact cells(11.Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Ball E.H. Singer S.J. Cell. 1981; 24: 165-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 12.Carroll R. Gerrard J. Blood. 1982; 59: 466-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP kinase), protein kinase C, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylate ABP-280 and/or filamin in vitro(13.Wallach D.

Some effects of in vitro phosphorylation have been identified. ABP-280 phosphorylated by cAMP kinase has increased resistance to the calcium-activated protease calpain (14.Chen M. Stracher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14282-14289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and altered interaction with GTP and/or unidentified small GTP-binding protein(s)(17.Yada Y. Okano Y. Nozawa Y.

Biochem. 1992; 203: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ABP-280 in platelets is a substrate for cAMP kinase in vivo. Compounds, such as prostaglandins I2 and E1 or forskolin, which increase the intracellular cAMP levels, stimulate ABP-280 phosphorylation in platelets(14.Chen M. Stracher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14282-14289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, if protein kinases other than cAMP kinase phosphorylate ABP-280 in intact cells. Phosphorylation of filamin by CaM kinase II decreases filamin's actin filament cross-linking activity(16.Ohta Y. Hartwig J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6745-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In this study, we find that stimulation of quiescent 3Y1 rat fibroblasts by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) results in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of ABP-280 through serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. We identified one of these protein kinases to be the p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinases (RSK2).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphate (8500-9120 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, calpain, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and lysophosphatidic acid were purchased from Sigma. Mouse EGF was from Collaborative Research. Protein kinase C was from Lipidex. MAP kinase (ERK2), protein phosphatase 2A, p90 RSK2, anti-RSK1 kinase antibody, anti-RSK2 antibody, anti-p70 S6 kinase antibody, and S6 peptide (RRRLSSLRA) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Raf kinase, MEK, cdc2 kinase, casein kinase II, cDNA encoding epitope-tagged rat RSK1 protein kinase, and SAP kinase were gifts from Dr. Joseph Avruch (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Mediatech. Phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. XAR-5 x-ray film was from Eastman Kodak Co. ABP-280 was purified from human uteri as described previously (19.Hartwig J. Stossel T. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 563-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Cells3Y1 cells derived from Fischer rat embryo fibroblasts and Cos cells were grown at 37°C in tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.Labeling of Cells with [32P]Orthophosphate and Immunoprecipitation with Anti-ABP-280 AntibodiesCells were grown to confluence in 3.5-cm diameter plastic tissue culture dishes containing 2 ml of the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent monolayers of cells were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium for 24 h. Quiescent cells were labeled for 16 h in 0.9 ml of phosphate- and serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml). 32P-Labeled cells were then treated with or without the indicated concentrations of agents such as FCS, LPA, EGF, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, dibutyryl cAMP, or ionomycin at 37°C for various time periods. Activated cells were washed in saline, freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen, then solubilized with 0.15 ml of a solution containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2% aprotinin at 0°C. Cells were scraped from Petri dishes and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. ABP-280 in the soluble phase was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-ABP-280 IgG. Lysates (0.12 ml) were incubated with 20 μl of the antibody for 90 min at 0°C, followed by incubation at 4°C for 15 min with 0.1 ml of the solution containing 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.15 M NaCl. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with a buffer composed of 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 50 mM NaF. Bound protein was released from the particles by boiling for 2 min in 60 μl of SDS-sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The relative intensity of the 32P-labeled band was determined by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In some experiments, the Coomassie-stained ABP-280 subunit was excised, and its 32P content was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisThe phosphoamino acid composition was analyzed as described previously (20.Ohta Y. Ohba T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11540-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Polyacrylamide fragments containing 32P-labeled ABP-280 were excised, washed extensively with 25% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, then 10% (v/v) methanol, and lyophilized. The dried gel slices were incubated at 37°C for 24 h in 4 ml of 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, containing 100 μg/ml trypsin and 50 μg/ml chymotrypsin, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and lyophilized. Dried supernatant samples were dissolved in 200 μl of 6.0 N HCl and hydrolyzed for 1 h at 110°C. After acid hydrolysis, the samples were dried and dissolved in 20 μl of a solution containing phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (1 mg/ml each) as markers. Phosphoamino acids were separated by high voltage electrophoresis at 1.5 kV for 20 min on TLC plates (100 μm, 20 × 20-cm microcrystalline cellulose glass-backed plates without fluorescent indicators, E. M. Science, Cherry HIll, NJ) using pH 3.5 buffer of pyridine/glacial acetic acid/H2O (1:10:189, v/v). To analyze proteins labeled in vivo, two-dimensional electrophoresis was used (pH 1.9 buffer of formic acid/glacial acetic acid/H2O (50:156:1794, v/v), followed by pH 3.5 buffer). The positions of the phosphoamino acids were determined after ninhydrin staining. Radiolabeled amino acids were revealed by autoradiography.Phosphopeptide MappingFor one-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, ABP-280 was identified by Coomassie Blue staining and excised from gels. Excised gel fragments were soaked for 30 min with occasional swirling in 10 ml of a solution containing 0.125 M Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, and 1.0 mM EDTA and transferred to wells of 15% polyacrylamide slab gels. The ABP-280 polypeptides were digested with chymotrypsin (2 μg/lane) or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (2 μg/lane) and electrophoresed as described elsewhere(20.Ohta Y. Ohba T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11540-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. For two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, polyacrylamide fragments containing 32P-labeled ABP-280 were excised and digested with trypsin as previously described(21.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods. Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were spotted on TLC plates and separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 (acetic acid/formic acid/water, 15:5:80 (v/v)) for 60 min at 1.5 kV and 4°C. Chromatograms were dried and developed in a second dimension in 1-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/water, 32.5:25:5:20 (v/v), containing 7% 2,5-diphenyloxazole (w/v). Peptides were visualized by autoradiography.Preparation of Cell ExtractsRat 3Y1 cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm diameter plastic tissue culture dishes containing 10 ml of the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. After cells reached confluency, the medium was replaced with 9 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. After addition of test agents such as FCS, LPA, and EGF for varying lengths of time at 37°C, tissue culture dishes were transferred on ice, and the cells were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl) and removed by scraping with a rubber policeman into 0.4 ml/dish of cell extraction buffer (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 42 mM leupeptin, 1.0 mM benzamidine HCl, 12 mM aprotinin, and 2.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were disrupted by sonication for 10 s (model W185F, Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc.). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C using Beckman TL-100 centrifuge. Supernatants (∼0.8 mg/ml) were immediately used for experiments or stored frozen at −80°C.Ion Exchange Chromatography of Cell ExtractsFractionation of cell lysates by MonoQ anion exchange column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) was performed according to Ahn et al.(22.Ahn N.G. Weiel J.E. Chan C.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Samples of cytosolic extracts (∼10 mg of protein from 30 plates) were loaded onto a column equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and washed with 4 ml of Buffer A. Bound protein was eluted with an 80-ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.4 M NaCl. Column fractions of 1 ml were collected and stored on ice at 4°C.Phosphorylation AssaysCell extracts or fractions eluted from the MonoQ column (8 μl) were mixed with 12 μl of purified ABP-280 (0.16 mg/ml), and reactions were started by adding 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 75 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM EGTA, 0.15 mM Na3VO4, 1.5 mM dithiothreitol, 30 mM MgCl2 and 0.15 mM [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/tube). After 20 min at 30°C, the reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Phosphate incorporation was measured by scintillation counting of excised bands, or intensity of phosphorylated bands in autoradiogram was quantitated by NIH Image analysis or using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphorylation of S6 peptide (0.25 mM) was assayed as described above except the reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min and terminated by spotting 20 μl of the reaction mixture onto P81 phosphocellulose filter paper (2.5 cm × 1.4 cm, Whatman). The filter papers were washed four times with 150 mM phosphoric acid and counted. To measure the activation of ABP kinase activities by ERK, glutathione beads (Pharmacia) were coated with GST (control) or ERK-GST fusion protein. Bead-GST complexes (10 μl) were mixed with 10 μl of fractions from unstimulated 3Y1 cell extracts eluted from the MonoQ column and 10 μl of a buffer containing 75 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM EGTA, 0.15 mM Na3VO4, 1.5 mM dithiothreitol, 30 mM MgCl2, and 0.3 mM ATP. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 30°C, then 10 μl of a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml of human ABP-280 and 0.15 mM ATP (2.5 μCi/tube) were added and the incubation continued for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The autoradiogram was digitized using the NIH Image analysis program.ImmunoblottingProtein, separated by SDS-PAGE, was electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membrane binding sites were blocked with a solution of 5% dried milk in buffered saline (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 and 0.15 M NaCl) containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 30 min. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated for 60 min with the primary antibody in blocking buffer, rinsed for 30 min in a buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20, incubated for 60 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-primary immunoglobulin in the blocking buffer, and rinsed for 30 min with a buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. Bound horseradish peroxidase-IgG conjugates was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance, DuPont NEN). All steps were performed at room temperature.Other MethodsSDS-PAGE was performed on 5-15% gradient or 10% slab gels(23.Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard.RESULTSLPA and Growth Factors Induce Phosphorylation of ABP-280 in Intact Rat Fibroblastic CellsFig. 1A shows that treatment of confluent serum-deprived quiescent rat 3Y1 cells with LPA and EGF markedly increased the phosphorylation of ABP-280 in 3Y1 cells. Addition of dBcAMP, PMA, and FCS to cells also stimulated the phosphorylation of ABP-280. The time course of ABP-280 phosphorylation in fibroblasts exposed to FCS or LPA is shown in Fig. 1B. Incorporation of phosphate into ABP-280 was maximal after ∼10 min for both FCS and LPA. Phosphorylation remained constant for 60 min after the treatment of cells with LPA but the phosphorylation induced by FCS was transient. LPA stimulated the phosphorylation of ABP-280 in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal phosphorylation of ABP-280 was attained between 0.2 and 10 μg/ml LPA (data not shown).Phosphoamino acid analysis of ABP-280 immunoprecipitated from lysates of LPA-treated cells reveals serine as the major phosphate-containing residue (Fig. 2A), demonstrating serine/threonine-specific protein kinase(s) to phosphorylate ABP-280 in intact cells. The phosphorylation site(s) are in the carboxyl-terminal third of the ABP-280 polypeptide (Fig. 2B), which is easily dissected from the amino end of ABP-280 using the calcium-activated enzyme calpain. There are only two calpain sites in ABP-280, and the most rapidly cleaved site generates 190- and 100-kDa subfragments. The 190-kDa fragment contains the amino termini F-actin binding domain of ABP-280. The 100-kDa carboxyl-terminal piece contains the second calpain site, and upon extended digestion, is cleaved into 90- and 10-kDa subfragments. This 90-kDa calpain fragment was phosphorylated when cells were incubated with FCS, EGF, and PMA (Fig. 2B). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping analysis reveals that treatment with LPA (Fig. 5B) and other agents (data not shown) increases the phosphorylation of two major peptides of ABP-280 in intact cells. These results suggest that growth factors activate similar protein kinases which phosphorylate specific serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of ABP-280.Figure 2:Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide map of ABP-280 isolated from 32P-labeled 3Y1 cells. A, two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of ABP-280. 32P-Labeled 3Y1 cells were incubated with 10% FCS for 10 min at 37°C. Cell extracts were prepared and ABP-280 immunoprecipitated with anti-ABP-280 antibody. After SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, the phospho-ABP-280 subunits were excised and incubated with trypsin (100 μg/ml) and α-chymotrypsin (50 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37°C. The phosphoamino acids of the eluted peptides were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The directions of electrophoresis are indicated.

ABP-280 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate, the immunoprecipitates were washed and incubated with 0.01 unit/ml calpain in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphoproteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.

The autoradiogram is shown. The positions of the ABP-280 subunit and 40 S ribosomal polypeptide are indicated by arrows. B, comparison of two-dimensional phosphopeptide map of ABP-280 phosphorylated in quiescent, LPA-treated cells or by RSK2 in vitro. 32P-Labeled 3Y1 cells were incubated without (a) or with (b) 10 μg/ml LPA for 10 min at 37°C. The ABP-280 immunoprecipitate was displayed by SDS-PAGE. Purified ABP-280 was phosphorylated by RSK2 in vitro with [γ-32P]ATP and separated by SDS-PAGE (c). Phosphorylated ABP-280 was excised from the gels and incubated with trypsin (50 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37°C. After digestion, phosphopeptides were separated in two dimensions on cellulose plates and radiolabel detected by autoradiography. The orientation of electrophoresis (+, -) and the direction of chromatography are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LPA and Growth Factors Stimulate ABP Protein Kinase ActivitiesTo characterize the protein kinase(s) which phosphorylates ABP when 3Y1 cells are treated with growth factors, quiescent cells or cells stimulated for 5 min by LPA (2 μg/ml), FCS (10%), or EGF (100 ng/ml) were lysed and tested for their ability to phosphorylate human ABP-280 in vitro. Fig. 3 shows that a clarified extract isolated from cells treated with LPA has potentiated ABP protein kinase activity compared to an identical extract prepared from quiescent cells. Phosphorylation of the endogenous ABP-280 without exogenously added ABP-280 was low in extracts from quiescent as well as LPA-treated cells (Fig. 3, inset). Extracts prepared from FCS- or EGF-stimulated cells also contain increased protein kinase activity for human ABP-280 (Fig. 3). ABP kinase activity was 5-8-fold greater in extracts from stimulated cells than those from quiescent cells.Figure 3:Characterization of the ABP kinase activity present in extracts from LPA stimulated cells. Cytosolic extracts from quiescent 3Y1 cells (control) or cells treated with 2 μg/ml LPA, 10% FCS, or 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of exogenous purified human ABP-280 for 20 min at 30°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reactions were then stopped, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The amount of phosphate incorporated into ABP-280 in quiescent cell extracts is defined as 100%. Autoradiographs were scanned and quantitated using the NIH Image software program to determine their relative 32P content. The number of experiments is indicated. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. The inset shows the autoradiographs of 32P-labeled ABP-280 phosphorylated in vitro by cytosolic extracts from quiescent 3Y1 cells (control) or cells treated with LPA for 5 min (+LAP) in the presence (upper panel) or absence (lower panel) of exogenous ABP-280 with [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30°C.

The half-maximal activation of protein kinase activity occurred 2 min after the addition of 2 μg/ml of LPA to the cells; maximal stimulation (∼5-fold relative to untreated cell extracts) was reached in ∼5 min. ABP kinase activity declined thereafter and returned to near basal activity after 30 min. ABP kinase activity was not affected by the addition of specific inhibitors to protein kinase C or cAMP kinase (Table 1) and was reduced about 50% in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 or 50 mM NaF. Direct addition of LPA into the extracts from quiescent cells did not increase ABP kinase activity, showing that the activation of ABP kinase activity depends on the receptor-mediated signaling (data not shown).Figure 4:Characterization of the ABP kinase activity present in extracts from LPA stimulated cells. A, time course for the phosphorylation of exogenously added ABP-280 by ABP kinase activity in extracts. Cell extracts were prepared at the indicated time points after exposure to 2 μg/ml LPA, and ABP kinase activity was determined using purified human ABP-280 as substrate. ABP kinase activity was normalized to basal incorporation by subtracting background labeling without added exogenous ABP-280. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least three determinations.

https://openalex.org/W2021067501,"The sorting of the yeast proteases proteinase A and carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole is a saturable, receptor-mediated process. Information sufficient for vacuolar sorting of the normally secreted protein invertase has in fusion constructs previously been found to reside in the propeptide of proteinase A. We found that sorting of such a hybrid protein is dependent on the vacuolar protein-sorting receptor Vps10p. This was unexpected, as strains disrupted for VPS10 sort more than 85% of the proteinase A to the vacuole. Consistent with a role for Vps10p in sorting of proteinase A, we found that 1) overproduction of Vps10p suppressed the missorting phenotype associated with overproduction of proteinase A, 2) overproduction of proteinase A induced missorting of carboxypeptidase Y, 3) vacuolar sorting of proteinase A in a Δvps10 strain was readily saturated by modest overproduction of proteinase A, and 4) Vps10p and proteinase A interact directly and specifically as shown by chemical cross-linking. Interestingly, overexpression of two telomere-linked VPS10 homologues, VTH1 and VTH2 suppressed the missorting phenotypes of a Δvps10 strain. However, disruption of the VTH1 and VTH2 genes did not affect the sorting of proteinase A. We conclude that proteinase A utilizes at least two mechanisms for sorting, a Vps10p-dependent path and a Vth1p/Vth2p/Vps10p-independent path."

The expression of the β-like globin gene cluster in birds and mammals is regulated both by proximal elements, such as promoters, and a distal locus control region, or LCR. 1The abbreviations used are: LCRlocus control regionkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)HShypersensitive siteRSVRous sarcoma virusTricineN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine.

The DNA sequences within the cores are very well conserved, especially for HS2. In addition, prominent conserved blocks of sequence are also found outside the cores of the HSs(7.Li Q. Zhou B.

Numerous studies have examined the roles of individual HSs in various expression assays. HS1, −2, −3, and −4 will produce position-independent expression of linked globin genes in transgenic mice, each with a characteristic level of expression and a preferred developmental stage(20.Fraser P.

Jackson J. Mansberger J. Selifonova O. Grotch B. Biesecker J. Petrykowska H. Miller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HS4 has a much stronger effect in transgenic mice than in stably transfected MEL cells (17.Pruzina S. Hanscombe O. Whyatt D. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and will generate a DNase hypersensitive site in transgenic mice(18.Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HS5 has been implicated in insulation from some position effects(26.Yu Z. Bock J. Slightom J. Villeponteau B. Gene (Amst,). 1994; 139: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27.Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 1994; 84: 1399-1401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), analogous to the situation in the chicken β-like globin gene cluster (28.Chung J.H. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1993; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear how these individual activities lead to the full effect of the LCR, and it is likely that the HSs act together for some or perhaps all functions. Indeed, the quantitative effects of the individual HSs on expression in transgenic mice are markedly less than the effects of the entire LCR (e.g. Refs. 13, 17, 24, and 29), and Collis et al.(24.Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) have shown that restriction fragments containing the cores of three HSs, but not two HSs, are needed for levels of expression in stably transfected cells approaching that of the entire LCR. The full activity of a specific function, such as domain opening or enhancement, may require some combination of HSs, possibly including DNA sequences between the HS cores. In order to examine the effects of sequence elements both inside and outside the cores of the HSs on expression, restriction fragments of increasing lengths have been added to an ∊-globin-luciferase hybrid gene and tested in the human cell line K562, which produces ∊-, γ-, ζ-, and α-globins. Tests of expression of the reporter gene prior to integration (transient expression) reveal enhancement function, and measurement of levels of expression after integration into a chromosome (stable expression) should show the effects of enhancement, domain opening, and perhaps protection from some position effects. However, the use of a selectable marker in the stable transfection assays precludes the observation of strong negative position effects, since clones showing such negative effects would not express the drug resistance gene. Results reported here show that sequences outside the cores of HS2 and HS3 do increase the level of expression in stably integrated constructs. A large DNA fragment containing HS3 has a chromatin domain-opening activity. A striking synergism is seen between rabbit HS2 and HS3 when their natural spacing and LCR sequences between them are preserved, and this effect is dependent on sequences outside the cores. Only the HS5 region showed an appreciable effect on protection from position effects in these assays. Fragments from both human and rabbit β-globin LCRs were inserted 5′ to the hybrid ∊-globin-luciferase gene in pBS∊-luc (Fig. 1). This plasmid carries a PstI fragment containing the rabbit ∊-globin gene in which intron 1 through most of exon 2 are replaced by the coding region of luciferase. This expression vector contains 573 bp of 5′-flanking sequences, much of the internal sequences and 504 bp of 3′-flanking sequences. This ∊-globin gene fragment is larger than one used in other studies (23.Tuan D. Solomon W. London I. Lee D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and contains both positive and negative cis-acting sequences(30.Cao S.X. Gutman P.D. Dave H.P.G. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5306-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31.Hardison R. Chao K.-M. Adamkiewicz M. Price D. Jackson J. Zeigler T. Stojanovic N. Miller W.

Four different versions of pBS∊-luc have been used in this work. The first, pBS∊-luc.1(11.Hardison R. Xu J. Jackson J. Mansberger J. Selifonova O. Grotch B. Biesecker J. Petrykowska H. Miller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), retained multiple cloning sites between exon 1 of the ∊-globin gene and the luciferase coding region, which hampered the construction of new derivatives. Those cloning sites were removed and replaced with an NheI linker in the next generation of plasmids, pBS∊-luc.2 and pBS∊-luc.3. These plasmids differ only in the orientation of the ∊-luciferase genes, with pBluescript (Stratagene) cloning sites SacI through PstI located 5′ to the gene in pBS∊-luc.2 and KpnI through PstI located 5′ to the gene in pBS∊-luc.3. Translation of the hybrid ∊-luciferase mRNA from pBS∊-luc.1 requires internal reinitiation at the start codon of luciferase, because a translational terminator is located in-frame at the 5′ junction between the ∊-globin and luciferase genes. This termination codon is removed from pBS∊-luc.2 and pBS∊-luc.3, and thus mRNA from these constructs should be translated to make a hybrid ∊-luciferase protein. The vector pBS∊-luc.4 has almost all the pBluescript cloning sites 5′ to the ∊-luciferase gene, but the 5′ flank is slightly truncated to 544 bp (begins at a NsiI site) and the 3′ flank has 344 bp (ends at a BclI site). In all cases, the amount of activity from a given plasmid containing a fragment of the LCR was compared to the activity from the appropriate parental expression vector, pBS∊-luc.1, −2, −3, or −4. The amount of luciferase activity in transfected cells differs very little among these different plasmids. A map of the LCR indicating the positions of the fragments tested is shown in Fig. 1. Table 1 provides details about the restriction endonuclease cleavage sites used to add the LCR fragments to the expression vectors, along with an indication of the orientation of the insert in the expression plasmid. The sequenced regions of the rabbit β-globin LCR are very similar to those of the human(11.Hardison R. Xu J. Jackson J. Mansberger J. Selifonova O. Grotch B. Biesecker J. Petrykowska H. Miller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and Table 1 lists both the rabbit DNA positions and the aligning human sequence in GenBank™ file HUMHBB. The alignment allows one to refer to the LCR positions in terms of the human DNA sequence, even for DNA segments from other mammals(33.Hardison R. Chao K.-M. Schwartz S. Stojanovic N. Ganetsky M. Miller W. Genomics. 1994; 21: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 For tests of transient expression (prior to integration into the chromosome), 7 × 106 K562 cells were electroporated with 50 μg of total DNA that included increasing amounts (1.5-10 μg) of test DNA, 10 μg of pRSVlacZ, and 30-38.5 μg of pBluescript as a carrier plasmid. The plasmid pRSVlacZ contains the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene driven by an RSV long terminal repeat and serves as a control for transfection efficiency(34.Thompson J.P. Simkevich C.P. Holness M.A. Kang A.H. Raghow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2549-2556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each assay consisted of three independent transfections using a given DNA concentration of a particular construct, and most constructs were tested at a series of DNA concentrations. These triplicate assays were repeated multiple times, and the number of times they were repeated (n) is reported in the appropriate figures and tables. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% bovine calf serum, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml fungizone. Cells were harvested and lysed in 100 μl of 25 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 1.1 mM glycerol, 16 mM Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (from Promega Biotech). A 10 μl sample of cell extract was added to 100 μl of a reagent (from Promega) containing 20 mM Tricine, 1 mM magnesium carbonate, 2.7 mM magnesium sulfate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33 mM dithiothreitol, 270 μM coenzyme A, 470 μM luciferin, and 530 μM ATP at room temperature and assayed for luciferase activity for 10 s in a Berthold Lumat LB9501 luminometer. Using this reagent, the light output from the reaction is steady for at least 20 s. In addition, a 20-μl aliquot of the extract was assayed for β-galactosidase activity(35.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972: 352-355Google Scholar), and the luciferase activity (in relative light units per s) was divided by the A420 of the β-galactosidase reaction product, o-nitrophenol, to obtain a luciferase/β-galactosidase ratio. Results are reported as the arithmetic mean, with standard deviation and number of replicate assays. To produce individual stably expressing clones of K562 cells, 1 × 107 cells were electroporated with 100 μg of total DNA containing 90 μg of linearized test plasmid and 10 μg of linearized pM5neo as a selectable marker. The plasmid pM5neo contains the Tn5 phosphotransferase gene driven by the long terminal repeat of the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus, thereby conferring resistance to the drug G418 in hematopoietic cells(36.Laker C. Stocking C. Bergholz U. Hess N. De Lamarter J.F. Ostertag W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8458-8462Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). G418 (final concentration of 1.2 mg/ml) was added 24 h after electroporation to begin drug selection. Individual stably expressing clones were plucked from soft agar 2 weeks after electroporation and grown another 4-6 weeks until there were enough cells to prepare both cell extract and genomic DNA. Transgene expression was determined using luciferase assays as described above. Transgene copy number was determined by hybridizing a luciferase DNA probe to Southern blots containing 10 μg of genomic DNA from each clone digested with PstI plus EcoRV. Copy number standards containing the equivalent of 1, 10, and 100 copies of pBS∊-luc in 10 μg of λ-DNA were included on each blot. For each clone, the expression per copy of the transfecting gene was calculated by dividing the luciferase activity by the number of copies of the ∊-luciferase construct in the transfected cells. The test constructs are subject to strong positive position effects after integration, occasionally resulting in a small number of individual clones producing much more luciferase than do the rest of the clones. In order to reduce the impact of these outliers on the summary value for the group of clones, the geometric mean is reported in the appropriate tables and figures. The luciferase activity is a reliable indicator of the amount of RNA produced from these reporter constructs. The amount of ∊-luciferase RNA was measured by an RNase protection assay (37.James-Pederson M. Yost S. Shewchuk B. Zeigler T. Miller R. Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3965-3973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in several of the stably transfected clones whose level of expression of luciferase ranged from 4000 to over 1 × 106 relative light units per s. A plot of the amount of RNA versus the luciferase activity shows a strong, linear correlation between the amount of RNA and the luciferase activity over a this very wide dynamic range. The slope of the line is 0.66, showing that the increase in luciferase activity can exceed that in the amount of RNA only by about 2-fold. The role of individual HSs from the β-globin LCR was initially addressed by placing short restriction fragments containing each HS core, or a subfragment of it, upstream of a hybrid ∊-globin-luciferase reporter gene and assaying for transient luciferase activity in transfected K562 cells (prior to integration of the construct). The greatest effect on ∊-luciferase expression was from those constructs containing HS2. As shown in Fig. 2, a rabbit 110-bp AvaII to HindIII fragment containing a highly conserved subregion of the HS2 core, corresponding to positions 8642 to 8750 in the human sequence, enhances ∊-luciferase expression 17-30-fold at each DNA concentration tested. Similarly, the human HS2 core (the HindIII to XbaI fragment corresponding to positions 8486 to 8860 in the human sequence) enhanced ∊-luciferase activity 13-fold (Fig. 3). This fragment was equally effective in the reverse genomic orientation (data not shown). The effects of conserved regions outside the HS cores were examined by testing larger genomic fragments. As summarized in Fig. 3, two different rabbit DNA fragments containing HS2 (with varying amounts of 5′ or 3′ adjacent sequences) and a human 1.5-kb KpnI to BglII fragment gave about the same level of enhancement as did the HS2 core fragments. Thus, sequences flanking the HS2 core had no effect on enhancement in transient expression.Figure 3:Summary of the effects of LCR fragments on the transient expression of the ∊-luciferase gene in K562 cells. The bar graph shows average fold enhancement over expression of the parental ∊-luciferase. Average fold enhancement values for transiently transfected cells (arithmetic means) were obtained from multiple determinations at more than one concentration of test DNA. The average fold enhancement for sets of clones of stably transfected cells (geometric means) are derived from the data in Figure 5:, Figure 6:. Each LCR fragment was placed 5′ to ∊-luciferase in either the reverse or native genomic orientation and tested for level of expression. The effects of the 5.6-kb EcoRI to NsiI fragment containing both HS3 and HS2 was much greater than the effects of other sites, and hence it is plotted on a scale different from the others. Restriction sites defining each fragment are as follows: A = AvaII, Ac = AccI, B = BglII, Ba = BamHI, E = EcoRI, F = Fnu4HI, H = HindIII, Hp = HphI, K = KpnI, N = NsiI, Nc = NcoI, P = PstI, Pv = PvuII, Sc = ScaI, Ss = SspI, St = StuI, and X = XbaI. r = rabbit, h = human.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Some restriction fragments encompassing the HS3 core also enhanced transient ∊-luciferase expression, although not as much as HS2. As shown previously(11.Hardison R. Xu J. Jackson J. Mansberger J. Selifonova O. Grotch B. Biesecker J. Petrykowska H. Miller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a rabbit 504-bp StuI to ScaI fragment (corresponding to positions 4489 to 4993 in the human sequence) increased the expression of ∊-luciferase an average of 6-fold at all DNA concentrations tested (Fig. 2). Since others have not observed an effect on transient expression by human or mouse fragments containing HS3(22.Tuan D. Abelovich A. Lee-Oldham M. Lee D. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Developmental Control of Globin Gene Expression. A. R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 211-220Google Scholar, 25.Moon A.M. Ley T.J. Blood. 1991; 77: 2272-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined this effect in more detail. Indeed, the data in Fig. 4 show that the human 225-bp HphI to Fnu4HI that has been defined as the HS3 core (16.Philipsen S. Pruzina S. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) does not enhance expression in either orientation, nor does a larger 1.9-kb HindIII fragment, in agreement with previous results(22.Tuan D. Abelovich A. Lee-Oldham M. Lee D. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Developmental Control of Globin Gene Expression. A. R. Liss, Inc., New York1987: 211-220Google Scholar). However, the human 0.8-kb PstI to PvuII fragment encompassing the HS3 core does produce a modest enhancement, similar to that of the rabbit StuI to ScaI fragment. Additionally, a large 2.9-kb NsiI to HindIII fragment from rabbit will also enhance expression in transiently transfected cells. For all three fragments that show enhancement in this assay, the effect is greater in the reverse genomic orientation. Although most DNA fragments showed similar effects in the different versions of the ∊-luciferase reporter construct in various assays, these fragments containing HS3 placed into pBS∊-luciferase.4 showed enhancement only at lower concentrations of DNA (≤5 μg/transfection), whereas the fragments in pBS∊-luciferase.1 showed enhancement at higher DNA concentrations as well(11.Hardison R. Xu J. Jackson J. Mansberger J. Selifonova O. Grotch B. Biesecker J. Petrykowska H. Miller W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown on the map in Fig. 4, the rabbit and human DNA fragments that enhance expression contain a well-conserved sequence that matches the binding site for AP1, NFE2, and related proteins, whereas the 225-bp HS3 core HphI to Fnu4HI fragment does not contain this site. This site was removed from the rabbit fragment containing HS3 by cutting with NcoI, and the resulting 400-bp NcoI to ScaI fragment no longer showed enhancement in transiently transfected K562 cells (Fig. 4), supporting a possible role for AP1-like proteins in this ability to enhance expression transiently. The inability of the human 1.9-kb HindIII fragment to enhance in this assay suggests that a negative element may be located 5′ to the PstI site at position 4344. Tests of rabbit and human DNA fragments containing HS4 and HS5 showed no effect on ∊-luciferase expression in these assays (Fig. 2). Use of larger DNA fragments up to 2.4 kb containing HS4 had no effect on enhancement (Fig. 3). In contrast, a HindIII to NsiI fragment from the rabbit genome enhanced ∊-luciferase expression 6-fold (Fig. 3). This fragment contains HS4 and was originally thought to contain the homolog to human HS5, based on hybridization data and the expected distance between these hypersensitive sites in rabbit. However, analysis of recently determined DNA sequences 2J. Slightom, personal communication. shows that this region of the rabbit DNA does not match with human HS5. Thus, the small increase in expression achieved with this DNA fragment results from the inclusion of distal sequences that are not homologous to human. A rabbit 5.6-kb fragment containing both HS2 and HS3 was placed in the native genomic orientation 5′ to ∊-luciferase; use of this genomic fragment preserves the DNA sequence and spacing between these HS cores. This fragment corresponds approximately to positions 3300 to 9066 in the human sequence, based on extrapolations from the aligning segments. As shown in Fig. 3, this fragment caused an average of 140-fold enhancement at all DNA concentrations tested. This is much larger than the effect seen with either HS2 or HS3 alone, and it indicates that HS2 and HS3 together (in their natural context) have a synergistic effect on ∊-globin gene expression. The effects of individual HSs on ∊-luciferase expression after integration were tested in stable transfection experiments. Figure 5:, Figure 6: show the results obtained from several stably expressing K562 clones transfected with the same constructs analyzed above. In all cases, the measured ∊-luciferase activity was divided by the number of integrated copies of the construct to obtain the expression per copy of transfecting gene. The level of expression of ∊-luciferase in the absence of an LCR fragment was variable, with 11 of 15 clones having very low expression but four showing appreciable expression per copy (Fig. 5A). These higher expressing clones likely reflect strong positive position effects. The average expression per copy (geometric mean) for all 15 clones (1650 relative light units s-1 copy-1) was used as the base line for comparison with the activities of constructs containing LCR fragments.Figure 5:Expression of ∊-luciferase in sets of stably expressing K562 clones and effects of fragments containing HS4 and HS5.

INTRODUCTIONClassical neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles and storage organelles of secretory cells. Transport of the monoamines serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and histamine into storage organelles in a variety of cells is catalyzed by vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs). 1The abbreviations used are: VMATvesicular monoamine transporterrVMAT1rat vesicular monoamine transporter type I (previously CGAT)DEPCdiethyl pyrocarbonateΔH+electrochemical potential for H+TBZtetrabenazineDCCN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimidebis-tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. Accumulation of the neurotransmitter depends on the proton electrochemical gradient generated by the vesicular H+-ATPase and involves the VMAT-mediated exchange of two lumenal protons with one cytoplasmic amine (1Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 2Njus D. Kelley P.M. Harnadek G.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).A model of the mechanism of action of VMAT has been proposed based on a large body of biochemical data. In this model, the first step in the cycle is translocation of a single H+ that generates the binding form of the transporter (6Rudnick G. Steiner-Mordoch S.S. Fishkes H. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The energy invested in the transporter by H+ flux is released by ligand binding and is converted into vectorial movement of a substrate molecule across the membrane or directly into binding energy as measured with the high affinity ligand [3H]reserpine. In the case of a substrate, a second conformational change results in the ligand binding site being exposed to the vesicle interior, where the substrate can dissociate. The second H+ in the cycle may be required to facilitate the conformational change or to allow for release of the positively charged substrate from the protein (6Rudnick G. Steiner-Mordoch S.S. Fishkes H. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding occurs also in the absence of a proton electrochemical gradient (ΔH+) but many times slower (7Weaver J.A. Deupree J.D. Eur. J. Pharm. 1982; 80: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Scherman D. Henry J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar).A clue for the molecular basis of some of these processes was obtained using diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a reagent relatively specific for His residues (9Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12500-12503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Isambert M. Henry J. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The inhibition by DEPC was specific for His groups because transport could be restored by hydroxylamine (9Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12500-12503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). DEPC inhibited transport, although it had no effect on binding of reserpine, indicating that the inhibition of transport was not due to a direct interaction with either of the known binding sites. Interestingly, however, the acceleration of reserpine binding by ΔH+ was inhibited (9Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12500-12503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The results suggested that either proton transport or a conformational change induced by proton transport was inhibited by DEPC. Practically identical results were obtained with phenylglyoxal, a reagent specific for Arg residues.Cloning of VMAT (11Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N.

A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) made it feasible to try to identify the residue(s) modified by DEPC. Only one His (His-419) is conserved in the VMATs from different species and in the two subtypes (5Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Replacement of His-419 with either Cys (H419C) 2Site-directed mutants are designated as follows: the one-letter amino acid code is used followed by a number indicating the position of the residue in wild type rVMAT1. The sequence is followed by a second letter denoting the amino acid replacement at this position. or Arg (H419R) completely abolished transport as measured in permeabilized CV1 cells transiently transformed with plasmids coding for the mutant proteins. Reserpine binding to the mutant proteins in the absence of ΔH+ was at levels comparable with those detected in the wild type. However, ΔH+ did not accelerate reserpine binding to either H419R or H419C proteins. These results suggested that His-419 is associated with H+ translocation or in conformational changes occurring after substrate binding (13Shirvan A. Laskar O. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Aspartate residues have been implicated in recognition of the cationic amino group of the ligand in β-adrenergic receptors (14Strader C.

Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 17Kitayama S. Shmiada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D. Uhl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Four Asp residues are fully conserved in putative transmembrane segments I, VI, X, and XI of the various vesicular neurotransmitter transporters (5Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition, biochemical evidence was available that N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) inhibits VMAT mediated transport (18Schuldiner S. Fishkes H. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3713-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Gabay T. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6490-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Gasnier B. Scherman D. Henry J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). DCC reacts with a carboxyl residue whose availability is influenced by the occupancy of the TBZ binding site (19Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Gabay T. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6490-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reaction with the above carboxyl residue inhibits not only overall transport activity but also TBZ and reserpine binding. As with all chemical modifiers, indirect effects such as steric hindrance by the DCC moiety or indirect effect on the structure of the protein cannot be ruled out at present. Mutagenesis studies of the roles of these Asp residues on VMATs should elucidate this point. Edwards and collaborators have replaced in rVMAT2 Asp-33 (equivalent to Asp-34 in rVMAT1) with Glu and Asn (21Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whereas the D34E protein transports normally, the D34N is inactive. The D34N protein binds [3H]reserpine, and binding is accelerated by ΔH+. [3H]Reserpine binding, however, was inhibited only by high concentrations of serotonin, suggesting impaired substrate recognition by this mutant (21Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Two other conserved Asp residues (Asp-404 and Asp-431) are located in putative transmembrane segments nearby His-419 (transmembrane segments X and XI). In this work we present the results of mutagenesis studies of these two residues. Replacement of Asp-431 to either Glu or Ser abolishes transport activity while having no effect on either reserpine binding or its acceleration due to transport of the first H+ in the cycle. The results suggest that Asp-431 plays a role in one of the last steps in the transport catalytic cycle and even a small shift in the location of the carboxyl moiety (D404E) is not tolerated. Replacement of Asp-404 with Glu, on the other hand, shows a very interesting difference: the pH optimum of the transport reaction changes quite dramatically; it shifts about 1 pH unit to the acid side and becomes much narrower. In addition, the mutant protein D404E displays a higher sensitivity to TBZ than the wild type rVMAT1. These findings suggest that the small shift in position of the carboxyl at position 404 obtained by replacement of Asp with Glu modifies the pK of a group (maybe Asp-404 itself), which is involved in transport, possibly H+ translocation itself. This change brings also about, either directly or not, a change in the affinity to TBZ. The possible direct involvement of Asp-404 is supported by the fact that replacements in this position with either Ser or Cys inhibit all the VMAT-mediated reactions.RESULTSAsp-431 and Asp-404 residues are charged residues located in the middle of two putative transmembrane segments in rVMAT1, and they are fully conserved in all the vesicular neurotransmitter transporters sequences available (5Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Asp-431 and Asp-404 are located in the vicinity of His-419, a residue previously suggested to be involved in energy coupling (Ref. 13Shirvan A. Laskar O. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). In order to gain insight into the role of these two conserved Asp in energy coupling and substrate binding, they were mutagenized into either Glu, Cys, or Ser residues, and activity of the mutated protein was assayed.Replacement of Asp-431 with Either Glu, Cys, or Ser Completely Abolishes Transport Catalyzed by rVMAT1When Asp-431 is replaced with either Glu, Cys, or Ser the effect on [3H]serotonin transport activity is very dramatic. Fig. 2 shows the transport activity of cells transformed with Asp-431, D431E, D431C, D431S, or a mock transformation with vector that contains no insert (pTM1). Transport of [3H]serotonin into CV1 cells was measured following infection with recombinant vaccinia virus (encoding T7 polymerase) and transfection with the cDNA coding for either construct under the control of T7 promoter. Cells were permeabilized with digitonin as described by Erickson and collaborators (12Erickson J. Eiden L. Hoffman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). When cells were transfected with wild type rVMAT1 (Asp-431), [3H]serotonin was accumulated in a time-dependent fashion, and uptake was maximal at about 20-30 min and remained stable (Fig. 2). Transport is completely inhibited in the presence of 10 µM of the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone as expected from the well known properties of VMAT and by 1 µM reserpine, which is a potent competitive inhibitor of monoamine transport (data not shown). Cells transformed with either of the other constructs show practically no measurable activity above the background levels as measured in mock transformed cells.Fig. 2Replacement of Asp-431 with Glu, Ser, or Cys in rVMAT1 inhibits serotonin transport. CV1 cells were infected with vaccinia virus and transformed with the pTM1 plasmid bearing wild type rVMAT1 (▪), D431E (▴), D431S (▾), or D431C (•) mutants or no VMAT insert (*) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Transport was assayed in digitonin-permeabilized cells after incubation with [3H]serotonin (0.2 µM, 25.7 Ci/mmol). The error bars indicate standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To assess whether the mutants are able to catalyze partial reactions of the transport cycle, [3H]reserpine binding to membranes prepared from transformed cells was measured. In this experiment, membranes from CV1 cells transformed with the wild type VMAT, and the various mutants were allowed to bind [3H]reserpine for various times in the presence of ATP. Under these conditions (3 nM reserpine), the wild type protein binds [3H]reserpine in a time-dependent manner and reaches an apparent equilibrium after about 30 min of reaction (Fig. 3). A time-dependent increase is observed also with membranes from mutants D431S and D431E but not with D431C. The rates and steady state levels of [3H]reserpine binding in the mutant proteins D431E and D431S are very similar to those observed in the wild type protein (2.2, 2.2, and 1.9 pmol, respectively).

Therefore, addition of uncouplers such as carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone reduce the binding rates significantly. The results described in Table II show that the binding to the wild type protein and to D431E and D431S was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone to very similar levels. To assess the levels of expression of the various mutants, lysates of the cells transformed with the various constructs were tested by Western blotting with an antibody raised against a peptide whose sequence was derived from C-terminal sequences of rVMAT1 (24Liu Y. Schweitzer E. Nirenberg M. Pickel V. Evans C. Edwards R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1419-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that the antibody recognizes rVMAT1 synthesized in CV1 cells as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa with smaller amounts of a 95-kDa protein. This pattern is very similar to what is observed in Chinese hamster ovary and COS cells (21Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). No immunoreactive species is detected in lysates prepared from mock transformed CV1 cells (virus alone or together with pTM1). The mutant proteins D431E and D431S are expressed to levels very similar to those of the wild type. Surprisingly, mutant D431C is not present at detectable levels (Fig. 4). We have not tested whether the effect on the levels of D431C is due to an effect on its expression or on its stability. It is noteworthy that although two replacements (D431E and D431S) have practically no effect on expression levels, cysteine, which is isosteric to serine, causes such a dramatic effect.Table IIEffect of carbonyl cyanide M-chlorophenyl hydrazone on [3H]reserpine binding to wild type and mutant proteinsMutantControl activity+ CCCP, 10 µM%Wild type10023D431E100 (102)36D431S100 (78)33D404E100 (127)27 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Western blots of membrane preparations from CV1 cells transfected with various plasmids.

Fig. 5A shows the results of an experiment in which transport activity of cells transformed with Asp-404, D404E, D404C, D404S, or a mock transformation with vector that contains no insert (pTM1) was measured. When cells were transfected with wild type rVMAT1, [3H]serotonin was accumulated in a time-dependent fashion, and uptake was maximal at about 20-30 min and remained stable. In cells transformed with either D404C or D404S, no transport activity was detectable above the background levels. On the other hand cells expressing D404E show a slower but robust accumulation of [3H]serotonin. Thus, whereas wild type-transformed CV1 cells accumulate about 4.2 pmol of [3H]serotonin/well, the cells transformed with D404E accumulate about half (2.5 pmol/well). In the case of mutations in position 404, the binding activity of the various mutants as measured with [3H]reserpine displays a pattern very similar to that observed in transport (Fig. 5B); whereas D404S and D404C proteins do not bind this high affinity ligand to levels above the background, D404E binds to about wild type levels (1.4 and 1.8 pmol/mg protein, respectively). Although the activities of the various mutants differ significantly from one another, the levels of protein detected in Western blots are very similar to those detected in cells transformed with wild type plasmid (Fig. 4).Fig. 5Replacement of Asp-404 with either Ser or Cys but not with Glu inactivates transport and reserpine binding by rVMAT1. CV1 cells were infected with vaccinia virus and transformed with pTM1 plasmid bearing wild type rVMAT1 (▪), or D404E (▴), D404S (▾), or D404C (•) mutants as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, transport was assayed in digitonin-permeabilized cells after incubation with [3H]serotonin (0.2 µM, 25.7 Ci/mmol).

[3H]Reserpine binding after 30 min in the presence of ATP (Fig. 6B) and [3H]serotonin transport (Fig. 6A) after 15 min were measured at various pH values. In the wild type protein, the dependence of both activities is quite gradual, and the optimum activity is observed around pH 8.0-8.5, very similar to the pH optimum for both reactions previously observed in bovine chromaffin granules (2Njus D. Kelley P.M. Harnadek G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 237-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Scherman D. Henry J. Eur. J.

[3H]Reserpine binding activity of D404E is only slightly different in the wild type, showing a small inhibition (25-30%) at the alkaline pH values, which brings about a small shift in the pH optimum of the reaction to about pH 8.0. [3H]Serotonin transport is more dramatically altered, and the pH optimum is narrowed to a clear optimum at around pH 7.6 and a sharp decline on both sides.Fig. 6Replacement of Asp-404 with Glu modifies the pH sensitivity of r-VMAT1. A, transport was assayed in digitonin-permeabilized cells after incubation with [3H]serotonin (0.2 µM, 25.7 Ci/mmol) for 15 min at different pH values as indicated. The buffers used were Hepes (for pH range 7-8.5) and bis-tris (for pH 9). B, [3H]reserpine binding was tested in total lysates (70 µg of protein) prepared from each type of cell as indicated and assayed after 30 min of incubation with 3 nM of the drug (20Ci/mmol) at the indicated pH values.

Ligand recognition was estimated by the ability of other substrates to inhibit transport. The results in Table III summarize the results of such an experiment. The addition of an excess of unlabeled substrates serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine inhibits [3H]serotonin transport significantly and to levels very similar in cells expressing the wild type protein and mutant D404E. Also, ketanserin inhibits significantly both proteins. However, a significant difference is observed in the ability of TBZ (10 µM) to inhibit rVMAT1 and mutant D404E: 31 and 89%, respectively. This difference was further probed by testing the ability of various concentrations of TBZ to inhibit transport, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Under the given assay conditions, wild type-mediated transport is inhibited 50% at concentrations of above 20 µM, whereas D404E-mediated transport is similarly inhibited at about 5-7 µM drug.Table IIIEffect of various substrates and inhibitors on D404E-mediated [3H]serotonin transportAdditionsConcentrationsWild typeD404E(µM)%None100100 (75)Serotonin109 (±3)12 (±3)Norepinephrine5033 (±3)41 (±4)Dopamine2528 (±4)37 (±4)Ketanserine109 (±3)2 (±4)Tetrabenazine1069 (±3)11 (±3) Open table in a new tab Fig. 7Mutant protein D404E displays a higher sensitivity to TBZ.

Both Asp residues seem to be important for activity as hinted from the location of charged residues in putative tramsmembrane domains and their full conservation in all the vesicular neurotransmitter transporters (5Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In both Asp-404 and Asp-431, even conservative replacements have dramatic effects on [3H]serotonin transport activity. In the case of Asp-431, complete inhibition is observed in D431E. The mutant protein D431E binds [3H]reserpine and transports the first H+ as judged by the ability of ΔH+ to accelerate binding. Serine replacement (D431S) yields a protein functionally indistinguishable from D431E, suggesting that a carboxyl moiety in residue 431 situated in a very critical location is important in the ability of VMAT to catalyze one of the steps beyond substrate binding and translocation of the first H+. In addition, because [3H]reserpine binding and coupling to ΔH+ are normal in D431S as well as in D431E, it can be concluded that the overall structure of rVMAT1, as judged by this criterion, is not altered by the removal of a negative charge in the membrane domain, a quite unanticipated finding. A surprising effect of cysteine replacement at position 431 on the levels of detectable protein are reported in this work. Specifically, the presence of Cys at position 431 and not the lack of a negative charge at that position (compare with D431S) has a deleterious effect on either expression or protein stability.Replacement of Asp-404 with Glu (D404E) yields a particularly interesting protein with a modified pH dependence of the transport reaction. Although there is a slight effect on [3H]reserpine binding as well, the most dramatic effect is on [3H]serotonin transport. The effect is complex because it is not just a shift but also a sharpening of the optimum as well. We cannot therefore conclude at present whether the effect is due to a change in pKa of a single residue. A tempting speculation is that the small shift of location of the carboxyl moiety in the mutant protein as a result of the replacement of Asp-404 with Glu induces a change in its pKa because of the different interactions with other residues. The pKa of amino acids in the protein is dictated by the complex array of interactions with near neighbors and changes in pKa of carboxyl residues upon shift of their position in proteins have been well documented in several cases (for example in Ref. 27Lanyi J. Tittor J. Varo G. Krippahl G. Oesterhelt D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1099: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The involvement of Glu and Asp residues in H+ transfer has been well established in proton pumps in which high resolution structural information is available; the light-driven pump bacteriorhodopsin (33Lanyi J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) reaction centers from photosynthetic bacteria (34Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 861-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and the cytochrome C oxidase (35Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 36Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Here we discuss possible roles of Asp-404 and Asp-431 in the catalytic cycle of VMAT.Asp-431 is not required for substrate recognition as judged by the ability of various monoamines to inhibit the binding of the high affinity ligand reserpine to the Asp-431 replacements. Neither is it necessary for the transport of the first H+ or its coupling to the conformational changes leading to substrate binding, which are estimated from the ability of ΔH+ to accelerate reserpine binding. Therefore, the role of Asp-431 must be in steps of the catalytic cycle beyond substrate binding and transport of the first H+. Because of the ability of the carboxyl moiety to interact with H+, we speculate that Asp-431 is directly involved in the transport of the second H+ required by VMAT. A similar conclusion can be reached for the role of Asp-404 because of the effect of a replacement with Glu on the pH dependence of the overall transport reaction but not on the first steps. However, in this case, removal of the negative charge (D404S and D404E) results in complete inactivation of all the partial reactions measured.VMAT1 and VMAT2 are two distinct but highly similar subtypes of VMAT. The two subtypes are coded by genes located in different chromosomes (28Peter D. Finn J.P. Klisak I. Liu Y.J. Kojis T. Heinzmann C. Roghani A. Sparkes R.S. Edwards R.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and differ in their tissue and subcellular distribution (29Weihe E. Schafer M.-H. Erickson J. Eiden L. J. Mol.

Liu Y. Sternini C. de Giorgio R. Brecha N. Edwards R. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and in their sensitivity to TBZ (32Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y.J. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although TBZ is a potent inhibitor of VMAT2 activity, its effect on VMAT1 is much less pronounced (32Peter D. Jimenez J. Liu Y.J. Kim J. Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TBZ apparently binds to a site different from the substrate and reserpine binding site (8Scherman D. Henry J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, modification of a residue in VMAT1 that is conserved in both transporters, Asp-404, causes a change in the mutant's affinity to TBZ. The shift in position of the carboxyl moiety may indirectly induce a change in the conformation of the protein such that now it can recognize TBZ with higher affinity. The effect can also be due, as discussed above for the shift in the pH optimum, to a modification in the environment of the carboxyl moiety at position 404, which may be interacting directly with TBZ. The mode by which DCC inhibits VMAT-mediated transport (18Schuldiner S. Fishkes H. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3713-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Gabay T. Schuldiner S.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) is interesting in this respect. DCC reacts with a carboxyl residue whose availability is influenced by the occupancy of the TBZ binding site (19Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Gabay T. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6490-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether Asp-404 is the DCC-reactive carboxyl in rat VMAT1.The identification in this work and in a previous one (13Shirvan A. Laskar O. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of mutant VMAT proteins defective in catalysis of various steps of the catalytic cycle provide strong support to the model of the mechanism of action of VMAT that has been previously proposed based on a large body of biochemical data (6Rudnick G. Steiner-Mordoch S.S. Fishkes H. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This interaction between a mutagenic analysis and a biochemical one should provide an insight into the mode of action of the protein. INTRODUCTIONClassical neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles and storage organelles of secretory cells. Transport of the monoamines serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and histamine into storage organelles in a variety of cells is catalyzed by vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs). 1The abbreviations used are: VMATvesicular monoamine transporterrVMAT1rat vesicular monoamine transporter type I (previously CGAT)DEPCdiethyl pyrocarbonateΔH+electrochemical potential for H+TBZtetrabenazineDCCN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimidebis-tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. Accumulation of the neurotransmitter depends on the proton electrochemical gradient generated by the vesicular H+-ATPase and involves the VMAT-mediated exchange of two lumenal protons with one cytoplasmic amine (1Kanner B.I. Schuldiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 2Njus D. Kelley P.M. Harnadek G.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).A model of the mechanism of action of VMAT has been proposed based on a large body of biochemical data. In this model, the first step in the cycle is translocation of a single H+ that generates the binding form of the transporter (6Rudnick G. Steiner-Mordoch S.S. Fishkes H. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The energy invested in the transporter by H+ flux is released by ligand binding and is converted into vectorial movement of a substrate molecule across the membrane or directly into binding energy as measured with the high affinity ligand [3H]reserpine. In the case of a substrate, a second conformational change results in the ligand binding site being exposed to the vesicle interior, where the substrate can dissociate. The second H+ in the cycle may be required to facilitate the conformational change or to allow for release of the positively charged substrate from the protein (6Rudnick G. Steiner-Mordoch S.S. Fishkes H. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding occurs also in the absence of a proton electrochemical gradient (ΔH+) but many times slower (7Weaver J.A. Deupree J.D. Eur. J. Pharm. 1982; 80: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Scherman D. Henry J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar).A clue for the molecular basis of some of these processes was obtained using diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a reagent relatively specific for His residues (9Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12500-12503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Isambert M. Henry J. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The inhibition by DEPC was specific for His groups because transport could be restored by hydroxylamine (9Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12500-12503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). DEPC inhibited transport, although it had no effect on binding of reserpine, indicating that the inhibition of transport was not due to a direct interaction with either of the known binding sites. Interestingly, however, the acceleration of reserpine binding by ΔH+ was inhibited (9Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12500-12503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The results suggested that either proton transport or a conformational change induced by proton transport was inhibited by DEPC. Practically identical results were obtained with phenylglyoxal, a reagent specific for Arg residues.Cloning of VMAT (11Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 12Erickson J. Eiden L. Hoffman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) made it feasible to try to identify the residue(s) modified by DEPC. Only one His (His-419) is conserved in the VMATs from different species and in the two subtypes (5Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Replacement of His-419 with either Cys (H419C) 2Site-directed mutants are designated as follows: the one-letter amino acid code is used followed by a number indicating the position of the residue in wild type rVMAT1. The sequence is followed by a second letter denoting the amino acid replacement at this position. or Arg (H419R) completely abolished transport as measured in permeabilized CV1 cells transiently transformed with plasmids coding for the mutant proteins. Reserpine binding to the mutant proteins in the absence of ΔH+ was at levels comparable with those detected in the wild type. However, ΔH+ did not accelerate reserpine binding to either H419R or H419C proteins. These results suggested that His-419 is associated with H+ translocation or in conformational changes occurring after substrate binding (13Shirvan A. Laskar O. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Aspartate residues have been implicated in recognition of the cationic amino group of the ligand in β-adrenergic receptors (14Strader C.

Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 17Kitayama S. Shmiada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D. Uhl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Four Asp residues are fully conserved in putative transmembrane segments I, VI, X, and XI of the various vesicular neurotransmitter transporters (5Schuldiner S. Shirvan A. Linial M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 369-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition, biochemical evidence was available that N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) inhibits VMAT mediated transport (18Schuldiner S. Fishkes H. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3713-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Gabay T. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6490-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Gasnier B. Scherman D. Henry J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). DCC reacts with a carboxyl residue whose availability is influenced by the occupancy of the TBZ binding site (19Suchi R. Stern-Bach Y. Gabay T. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6490-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reaction with the above carboxyl residue inhibits not only overall transport activity but also TBZ and reserpine binding. As with all chemical modifiers, indirect effects such as steric hindrance by the DCC moiety or indirect effect on the structure of the protein cannot be ruled out at present. Mutagenesis studies of the roles of these Asp residues on VMATs should elucidate this point. Edwards and collaborators have replaced in rVMAT2 Asp-33 (equivalent to Asp-34 in rVMAT1) with Glu and Asn (21Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whereas the D34E protein transports normally, the D34N is inactive. The D34N protein binds [3H]reserpine, and binding is accelerated by ΔH+. [3H]Reserpine binding, however, was inhibited only by high concentrations of serotonin, suggesting impaired substrate recognition by this mutant (21Merickel A. Rosandich P. Peter D. Edwards R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Two other conserved Asp residues (Asp-404 and Asp-431) are located in putative transmembrane segments nearby His-419 (transmembrane segments X and XI). In this work we present the results of mutagenesis studies of these two residues. Replacement of Asp-431 to either Glu or Ser abolishes transport activity while having no effect on either reserpine binding or its acceleration due to transport of the first H+ in the cycle. The results suggest that Asp-431 plays a role in one of the last steps in the transport catalytic cycle and even a small shift in the location of the carboxyl moiety (D404E) is not tolerated. Replacement of Asp-404 with Glu, on the other hand, shows a very interesting difference: the pH optimum of the transport reaction changes quite dramatically; it shifts about 1 pH unit to the acid side and becomes much narrower. In addition, the mutant protein D404E displays a higher sensitivity to TBZ than the wild type rVMAT1. These findings suggest that the small shift in position of the carboxyl at position 404 obtained by replacement of Asp with Glu modifies the pK of a group (maybe Asp-404 itself), which is involved in transport, possibly H+ translocation itself. This change brings also about, either directly or not, a change in the affinity to TBZ. The possible direct involvement of Asp-404 is supported by the fact that replacements in this position with either Ser or Cys inhibit all the VMAT-mediated reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2039298598,"D1R1-545, an active subdomain of the large subunit of vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme possessing ATPase, RNA 5′-triphosphatase, and guanylyltransferase activities, was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to be functionally equivalent to the heterodimeric enzyme (Myette, J. R., and Niles, E. G. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11936-11944). A detailed characterization of the phosphohydrolytic activities of D1R1-545 demonstrates that, in addition to ATPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities, the capping enzyme also possesses a general nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity that lacks a preference for the nucleoside base or sugar. Nucleoside triphosphate and mRNA saturation kinetics are markedly different, with RNA exhibiting a Km and turnover number 100- and 10-fold less, respectively, than those values measured for any NTP. The linear competitive inhibition of RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity by ATP, and the relative manner by which both ATPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities are inhibited by specific oligonucleotides, kinetically demonstrate that each activity is carried out at a common active site. Direct UV photo-cross-linking of either 32P-radiolabeled ATP or 23-mer triphosphorylated RNA, followed by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the photo-linked enzyme, localizes the major binding site for both ATP and RNA to a region between amino acids 1 and 221. The inability of ATP to competitively inhibit either E∼GMP formation or the transfer of GMP to RNA kinetically differentiates the phosphohydrolase active site from the guanylyltransferase active site.

The inability of ATP to competitively inhibit either E∼GMP formation or the transfer of GMP to RNA kinetically differentiates the phosphohydrolase active site from the guanylyltransferase active site. The vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme catalyzes three of the four reactions required for cap I formation, including RNA 5′-triphosphatase(1.Tutas D.J. Paoletti E. J. Biol.

The RNA 5′-triphosphatase, nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase, and guanylyltransferase active sites have been mapped to a 60-kDa NH2-terminal domain of the D1R subunit(7.Shuman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), kinetic analyses demonstrated that the D1R1-545 subdomain expressed in Escherichia coli is functionally equivalent to the full-size capping enzyme with respect to RNA 5′-triphosphatase, ATPase, and guanylyltransferase activities, indicating that the methyltransferase domain exerts little influence on catalysis carried out at the active sites within D1R1-545. In addition to triphosphorylated RNA, the mRNA capping enzyme employs ATP and GTP as substrates for phosphohydrolysis(1.Tutas D.J. Paoletti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3092-3098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol.

In this report, we describe the kinetic properties of the RNA 5′-triphosphatase and nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activities of the vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme. Through competitive inhibition analyses, we demonstrate that both activities are carried out at a single active site. We also present UV photo-cross-linking mapping data which locates the phosphohydrolysis active site to the 25-kDa NH2-terminal region of D1R (amino acids 1-221). A kinetic argument is made for the separation of this active site from the guanylyltransferase active site, supporting a three-active site model for the mRNA capping enzyme. Triphosphorylated RNA substrate was synthesized by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmid DNA templates as described(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Linearization of either pGEM3Zf(+) or pGEM9Zf(+) plasmids at different restriction sites enabled the synthesis of RNA of discrete lengths. Diphosphorylated RNA was generated in vitro through the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity of the capping enzyme using triphosphorylated 23-mer RNA as substrate. D1R1-545 (100 pmol, specific activity 50 pmol of Pi/min/pmol of enzyme) was added to a 500-μl reaction containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 10 nmol of triphosphorylated RNA 23-mer. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Dephosphorylation of RNA was monitored by inclusion of a small amount of high specific activity [γ-32P]RNA 23-mer (>2000 cpm/pmol) in the reaction and assaying for the release of 32Pi by PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography as described for the RNA 5′-triphosphatase assay(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched and extracted by adding an equal volume of 24:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 3 volumes of 95% ethanol, washed, dried and resuspended in 300 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The sample was further desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Micron 3 concentrator (Amicon). ATPase, RNA 5′-triphosphatase, and guanylyltransferase assays were conducted as described elsewhere(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). D1R1-545 ATPase activity was measured in a standard assay containing 10 mM MgCl2, in the presence of varying concentrations of oligonucleotides (see below). In the measurement of triphosphorylated 23-mer RNA inhibition of ATPase activity, a 2-min reaction time was employed to ensure that less than 20% of the mRNA was dephosphorylated. Nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity was measured by a colorimetric phosphate assay as described elsewhere(13.Bayliss C.D. Condit R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1550-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A standard assay contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 5 mM nucleoside triphosphate (U. S. Biochemical Corp., ultrapure grade), and 100 nM enzyme, in a 50-μl reaction volume. Enzyme was added last to the chilled assay mixture, and the reaction was transferred to 37°C for 5 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and assayed for the release of phosphate using a molybdate-based colorimetric assay. Sterox was omitted from the color development reagent. Color development reagent (800 μl, malachite green:ammonium molybdate 3:1) was added to the enzyme assay mix at room temperature, gently vortexed, and developed for 1 min at room temperature. Development was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 34% sodium citrate (w/v), pH 8.5. Moles of phosphate were determined from the absorbance at 660 nm by use of a KH2PO4 standard curve. Absorbances were corrected for background phosphate generated by the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates. Absorbances were linear up to 1 mM phosphate and did not vary over the time course of the assay. The assay was linear for 15 min at an enzyme concentration between 20 nM and 150 nM. The standard photo-cross-linking reactions were carried out in a 96-well microtiter dish floating in an ice water slurry. Direct UV photo-linkage was achieved using a single GE G15T8 15-watt germicidal ultraviolet lamp held at a distance of 10 cm for 45 min. A standard reaction mixture of 30 μl contained 50 picomol of D1R1-545(K260M), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (w/v), 50 μM cold ATP, and 10-20 μCi of [α32P]ATP (DuPont NEN, 800 Ci/mmol). The reaction was quenched by adding 10 μl of 4 × SDS sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. on 10% acrylamide gels. Modified enzyme was visualized by autoradiography of dried gels and incorporated radiolabel quantified by Cerenkov counting. Approximately 1% direct photo-cross-linking product was achieved at saturating ATP concentrations. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. ATP photo-cross-linking was carried out in the presence of varying concentrations of oligonucleotide and nucleotide competitors. Oligonucleotide competitors included triphosphorylated RNA, diphosphorylated RNA, 5′-OH RNA (Oligos, Etc.), and DNA 23-mers, all of the sequence GGGCGAAUUAAUAUAUUUGAAUU (with uracil replaced by thymidine in DNA). Nucleotide competitors included ADP, AMP, adenosine, and the dinucleotides ApU and GpppA (a methyl acceptor in the methyltransferase reaction). In a parallel experiment, the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by these same reagents was also examined. ATPase activity was measured as described previously (12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) except a subsaturating concentration of 50 μM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2 were employed. Direct UV photo-cross-linking of triphosphorylated 23-mer RNA to D1R1-545 was conducted as described (12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) except 200 pmol of D1R1-545 were employed in a 200-μl reaction volume. D1R1-545 (200 pmol) were UV photo-cross-linked with 50 μM ATP or 1 μM 23-mer triphosphorylated RNA as described above. Cross-linking reactions were scaled up to a 200-μl reaction volume and split into four microtiter wells containing 50 μl each. Following cross-linking, samples were pooled and precipitated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were washed twice with 200 μl of acetone, dried, and resuspended in 200 μl of 70% formic acid containing 20 mg/ml CNBr (Pierce)(17.Higman M.A. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14982-14987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digestions were carried out for 18-20 h at room temperature while under nitrogen. Samples were then dried three times under a stream of nitrogen, each time resuspending in 200 μl of water. The final wash and concentration step was by Speed-Vac desiccation, after which samples were resuspended in 20 μl of 1 × peptide sample buffer and boiled, and the pH was adjusted when necessary by addition of 1-2 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1% SDS. Samples were resolved on Tricine gels(14.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10477) Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma), and dried. Radiolabeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography. To prepare cleavage products for microsequencing, 600 picomol of D1R1-545 were directly digested with CNBr. The dried cleavage products were resuspended in 45 μl of 1 × peptide sample buffer, and the peptides were resolved by electrophoresis on Tricine gels pre-run at a low voltage in the presence of 100 μM thioglycolic acid as recommended (Probe-Design Peptide Separation System Technical Manual, Promega, 1992). Approximately 200 picomol of protein were loaded per lane. The peptides were transferred to a Transblot (Bio-Rad) polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the peptides were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 45% methanol and 5% acetic acid). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the cleavage products was determined by the CAMBI Peptide Sequencing Facility (SUNY-Buffalo). Previous work demonstrated that the mRNA capping enzyme possesses the ability to hydrolyze ATP and GTP in addition to the 5′-terminal phosphate of triphosphorylated RNA(6.Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol.

To characterize the kinetic properties of the nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity and to determine whether the RNA 5′-triphosphatase and nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activities are carried out at a single active site, the following kinetic and biochemical studies were conducted. The magnesium ion concentration dependence of both ATPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities is presented in Fig. 1. Although both activities require MgCl2 for catalysis, the concentrations needed for optimal activity are substantially different. RNA 5′-triphosphatase shows optimal activity between 1 and 2 mM MgCl2, followed by a sharp inhibition at higher concentrations. ATPase requires a roughly 10-fold higher concentration of MgCl2 and reaches a stable plateau. Both activities exhibited a modest sensitivity to NaCl concentration, each being inhibited by 25% at 50 mM (data not shown). Substrate saturation kinetics for both RNA and ATP also demonstrate marked differences(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Fig. 2. For an RNA 23-mer substrate, the RNA 5′-triphosphatase Km is approximately 1 μM, roughly 1000-fold lower than the Km measured for ATP. Moreover, RNA turnover is considerably slower, 50 min-1 for RNA as compared to 500-600 min-1 for ATP. RNA substrates of defined lengths from 9 to 42 nucleotides exhibit similar kinetic properties which demonstrates that beyond 9 bases, RNA chain length has little influence on RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity.Figure 2:The effect of RNA chain length on RNA 5′-triphosphatase substrate saturation kinetics. γ-32P-Labeled RNA of defined lengths were synthesized by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmid DNA templates and employed as substrates in a standard RNA 5′-triphosphatase assay at 20 nM enzyme and 2 mM MgCl2. Substrate saturation kinetics were measured for the full-size capping enzyme. Kinetic values are obtained from initial velocities measured at varying concentrations of triphosphorylated RNA. The kinetic values for ATP hydrolysis, measured in parallel under standard ATPase assay conditions (100 nM enzyme, 20 mM MgCl2), are plotted as length = 1 nucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the mRNA capping enzyme is a general nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase, additional nucleoside triphosphates were tested as potential substrates. A broad substrate specificity was observed, Table 1. The kinetic properties were comparable for each substrate, exhibiting a range of Km values from 0.8 to 1.3 mM and turnover numbers from approximately 500 to 800 min-1. This enzyme is able to hydrolyze equally well both purine and pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates, containing either ribose or 2′ deoxyribose. However, the capping enzyme does not possess a general phosphatase activity, since phosphohydrolysis is specific for the β-γ-phosphoester bond (data not shown). In general, the D1R1-545 subdomain exhibited comparable nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase kinetics to the holoenzyme, demonstrating that this activity is not affected by the methyltransferase domain (12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 The fact that the mRNA capping enzyme possesses both RNA 5′-triphosphatase and general nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activities raises the question of whether the catalysis of each reaction is carried out at a common active site or at two independent sites. Two approaches were taken to investigate this issue. In the first, the ability of ATP to competitively inhibit RNA 5′-triphosphatase was assessed. ATP was shown to be a linear competitive inhibitor of RNA 5′-triphosphatase, Fig. 3, strongly suggesting that ATP binds to the RNA 5′-triphosphatase active site and prohibits the binding of the RNA 5′ terminus. The apparent Ki for this ATP inhibition was calculated from a Dixon plot to be approximately 1.4 mM. This value is comparable to the Km for ATPase activity (12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as would be predicted if both substrates are competing for the same active site. The minor variation in the Km and Ki values is a result of the different MgCl2 concentrations (Fig. 1) employed in the two measurements. In a second approach, the ability of various oligonucleotides to inhibit ATPase activity was assessed, Fig. 4. Inhibition was measured at 5 mM ATP while varying the concentration of the oligonucleotide present in the assay. The oligonucleotides employed were all 23 nucleotides in length and possessed the same nucleotide sequence but differed in the nature of their 5′ terminus, and in the case of single-stranded DNA, the substitution of thymidine for uracil. As expected, triphosphorylated RNA 23-mer was an effective inhibitor of ATPase, inhibiting activity by 50% at a concentration of approximately 35 μM. Diphosphorylated RNA, the product of the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity, also inhibited the hydrolysis of ATP, although to a lesser extent in comparison to the inhibition by triphosphorylated RNA. 5′-OH RNA was a relatively weak inhibitor of ATPase activity while single-stranded DNA did not significantly inhibit ATP hydrolysis. The inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by these oligonucleotides is consistent with their relative inhibition of RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although RNA 5′-triphosphatase and ATPase differed in the relative extent to which their activities were inhibited by these reagents, both activities were inhibited in a similarly graded fashion by the same oligonucleotides. The most effective inhibition of either ATPase or RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity was observed with a nucleic acid possessing either a triphosphorylated or diphosphorylated 5′ terminus. Taken together, these kinetic competition data argue for a common active site for RNA 5′-triphosphatase and ATPase. A close structural relationship between the RNA 5′-triphosphatase/nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase and guanylyltransferase activities is inferred from the relative levels of each activity measured in a set of carboxyl-terminal deletions of D1R which were used to delineate the D1R1-545 subdomain(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine the degree to which the nucleotide binding regions of each active site overlap, ATP was tested as a potential competitive inhibitor of guanylyltransferase activity. ATP is known not to be a substrate for guanylyltransferase (15.Martin S.A. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7313-7321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) since it can neither form a phosphoryl intermediate with the enzyme nor serve in the transfer of AMP to RNA. Inclusion of up to 5 mM ATP does not inhibit either E∼GMP formation (Fig. 5A) or the transfer of GMP to RNA at saturating concentrations of RNA (Fig. 5B). Under the conditions for E∼GMP formation, less than 1% of the 5 mM ATP is hydrolyzed by the ATPase activity in D1R1-545 (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the ATP is significantly depleted and therefore, unable to effectively inhibit guanylyltransferase activity. We conclude from this lack of inhibition that the ATP binding site in the RNA 5′-triphosphatase/NTPase active site does not overlap with either the GTP or the diphosphorylated RNA binding site in the guanylyltransferase active site. As a further indication of separate active sites, the catalytic lysine (lysine 260) of guanylyltransferase(16.Niles E.G. Christen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24986-24989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), required for formation of the phosphoryl GMP intermediate, is not required for ATP binding or hydrolysis since a mutation of K260 to methionine eliminates E∼GMP formation but does not affect ATPase activity (data not shown). In an attempt to localize the nucleoside triphosphate binding site within D1R1-545, we employed direct UV photo-cross-linking of ATP followed by the specific chemical cleavage of the covalently modified enzyme. The extent of ATP photo-cross-linking to D1R1-545 was found to be dependent upon the time of the reaction and enzyme concentration, and was saturable by ATP, Fig. 6. Spurious covalent linkage of ITP (a minor deamination product of ATP present in some preparations of [α-32P]ATP) to the guanylyltransferase active site was prevented by utilizing the mutant D1R1-545(K260M)(22.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which lacks the catalytic lysine 260 required for E∼GMP formation, but possesses wildtype ATPase activity (data not shown). The specificity of ATP photo-linkage was further assessed by testing the ability of either triphosphorylated RNA (a competing substrate) or various analogues to inhibit both cross-linking and ATPase activity at 50 μM ATP, Fig. 7. As expected, triphosphorylated RNA 23-mer was a good inhibitor of both ATPase and photo-cross-linking activities. In contrast, compounds such as single-stranded DNA, ApU, and GpppA which are poor inhibitors of ATPase activity were also poor inhibitors of UV photo-linkage. In comparison to 5′ triphosphorylated 23-mer RNA, 5′ OH RNA was a relatively poor inhibitor of ATPase activity and also a less effective inhibitor of the UV photo-linkage of ATP to D1R1-545.Figure 7:Parallel inhibition of both ATP UV photo-cross-linking and ATP hydrolysis by oligonucleotides. Both ATP cross-linking (•) and ATPase activity (○) were measured in the presence of varying concentrations of different oligonucleotides (A-E). ATPase was measured under standard conditions except reactions included 50 μM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2. Both ATP cross-linking and ATPase activity are plotted as a percentage of activity relative to the control (no inhibitor).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an attempt to localize the site(s) of ATP photo-linkage, D1R1-545 photo-labeled with ATP in the presence or absence of triphosphorylated RNA 23-mer, was cleaved with CNBr and the cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis on Tricine gels, Fig. 8. The products obtained were assigned to the D1R primary sequence, Fig. 8A, according to their apparent molecular weights. This assignment was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the isolated peptides, generated by CNBr cleavage of D1R1-545 in the absence of UV photo-linkage. Based on the location of methionine residues in D1R1-545 primary sequence, complete digestion by CNBr should yield six fragments whose respective molecular weights and location are depicted in Fig. 8A. The typical cleavage products, including some partial digestion fragments, are represented by the Coomassie-stained Tricine gel in Fig. 6B. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the 15-kDa fragment demonstrates that this peptide is a partial cleavage product (denoted by the P2 in Fig. 8B) corresponding to the 10.0- and 5.2-kDa fragments. On the basis of size, we also conclude that P1 is a partial cleavage product comprised of the 25.1 and 2.1 fragments. The persistence of these partial cleavage products indicate that the respective methionines at positions 221 and 410 in the primary sequence are less efficiently cleaved by CNBr. A low cross-linking efficiency (less than 1% ATP cross-linked to D1R1-545 at saturating ATP) prohibited the isolation of a specific radiolabeled peptide in sufficient amounts for sequencing. However, an analysis of the distribution of radiolabel in the CNBr cleavage products of ATP photo-linked enzyme was informative, Fig. 8C, lanes 4 and 5. Greater than 75% of the radiolabeled nucleotide typically cross-linked to the amino-terminal 25.1-kDa peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-221 (Fig. 8C, lane 4) with additional radiolabeled peptides also resolved by gel electrophoresis. These additional cleavage products always represented a minor portion of the total radioactivity. The labeling of each peptide was competed by including 10 μM triphosphorylated RNA in the cross-linking reaction prior to cleavage by CNBr (Fig. 8C, lane 5). Inclusion of RNA in the reaction diminished the extent of ATP cross-linking and not the pattern of radiolabeled cleavage products obtained. From these analyses, we conclude that the major ATP binding site resides within the first 221 amino acids of D1R. In an attempt to localize the RNA binding site in D1R1-545, 32P-radiolabeled RNA was UV photo-cross-linked to D1R1-545, the modified enzyme was treated with RNase A and was then subject to CNBr cleavage. The resulting cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis on Tricine gels, Fig. 9. As was the case for ATP, RNA was cross-linked primarily to the 25.1-kDa NH2 terminus of D1R, Fig. 9B, lanes 4 and 5. Additional radiolabeled peptides of lower molecular weight (not evident in Fig. 9B) were also detected in longer autoradiographic exposures. The percentage of radioactivity present in these fragments somewhat varied between experiments. However, these bands always represented less than 25% of the total radiolabeled peptide present. Prominent photo-linkage to the 25.1-kDa region of D1R was observed whether the RNA employed as a cross-linking reagent was radiolabeled at internal guanosines located primarily in the 5′ region (Fig. 9, A and B, lane 4) or exclusively in the γ phosphate at the 5′ terminus, Fig. 9B, lane 5. This latter result demonstrates that RNA binding to this region of D1R is specific to the 5′ terminus of RNA and presumably at the phosphohydrolysis active site. We have investigated the RNA 5′-triphosphatase and nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activities of the mRNA capping enzyme. In the previous report(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that both activities, along with the guanylyltransferase, reside entirely within the fully active D1R1-545 subdomain. We report here that the kinetic properties of the two phosphohydrolytic activities vary markedly. First, the two activities differ in the MgCl2 concentration at which maximal catalysis is achieved: 2 mM MgCl2versus 20 mM MgCl2 for RNA 5′-triphosphatase and ATPase, respectively. Second, the capping enzyme exhibits an approximately 1000-fold lower Km for RNA compared to the Km for ATP and an approximately 10-fold slower turnover of RNA compared to ATP, indicating substantive binding differences for the two substrates. Catalytically relevant binding of RNA at the RNA 5′-triphosphatase active site must occur in a region of the RNA downstream from the 5′ terminus. The ability of a 5′ OH RNA oligonucleotide to inhibit RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity (12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reflects this fact. Based on the influence of RNA chain length on RNA 5′-triphosphatase kinetics, this binding site resides within 9 nucleotides from the 5′ terminus. The ability of the mRNA capping enzyme to employ ATP, GTP, and triphosphorylated RNA as a substrate for phosphohydrolysis raises questions related both to substrate specificity and to the presence of a single or multiple phosphohydrolysis active site(s). In regard to the question of substrate specificity, the capping enzyme exhibits comparable substrate saturation kinetics for a broad range of nucleoside triphosphates. The ability of each NTP to serve equally as substrates indicates that the enzyme exhibits little specificity based on sugar or base. In regard to the number of phosphohydrolase active sites, we conclude, based on two kinetic observations, that a common active site exists. First, ATP is a linear competitive inhibitor of RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity. The calculated Ki of 1.4 mM is comparable to the Km measured for ATPase activity(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), consistent with ATP acting as a competing substrate at the RNA 5′-triphosphatase active site. Second, ATPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities (12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are inhibited in a similarly graded manner by the same set of oligonucleotides. The degree of competition of ATPase activity by these oligonucleotides reflects the need for either a tri- or diphosphorylated 5′ RNA terminus. The concentration at which triphosphorylated 23-mer RNA effectively inhibits ATPase (with 50% inhibition occurring at approximately 35 μM) is substantially higher than the approximately 1 μMKm measured for RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, this inequivalence may be explained by an inhibition of RNA binding at the high MgCl2 concentration present in the kinetic competition assay; at 10 mM MgCl2, RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity is inhibited approximately 70% (Fig. 1). The apparent Km for 23-mer triphosphorylated RNA under such conditions is greater than 10-fold higher than the Km measured under optimal divalent cation conditions (data not shown). Nevertheless, the inhibition measured is both valid and specific. These competition data, taken together with the differential kinetic properties of the two activities, indicate that within this active site, triphosphorylated RNA preferentially binds. The strong substrate bias toward RNA reflects the fact that the primary function of this active site is the dephosphorylation of mRNA prerequisite to mRNA cap formation. A major goal in our study of the mRNA capping enzyme is to identify the amino acid residues present in the active sites catalyzing each of the three reactions in the cap formation pathway. The straight-forward method of direct UV photo-cross-linking specific substrates to the methyltransferase domain has permitted the preliminary localization of the S-adenosylmethionine and GTP binding regions of the methyltransferase active center(17.Higman M.A. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14982-14987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Niles E.G. Christen L. Higman M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9898-9903Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Using this same general approach, we attempted to localize the phosphohydrolase active site in the D1R1-545 subdomain. Specific UV photo-cross-linking of ATP to D1R1-545 was achieved as evidenced by several criteria. First, the extent of cross-linking was found to be dependent upon time and enzyme concentration, and was saturable by ATP. Second, the cross-linking of ATP to D1R1-545 was effectively inhibited by triphosphorylated 23-mer RNA in a manner which paralleled the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by this RNA. In contrast, reagents such as single-stranded DNA, and the dinucleotides ApU and GpppA (a substrate for methyltransferase) which were poor inhibitors of ATPase activity were likewise poor inhibitors of ATP cross-linking. Direct photo-linkage of ATP to D1R1-545, coupled with the specific chemical cleavage of this subdomain by CNBr, has identified a major ATP binding site in a 25 kDa amino terminus of D1R from amino acids 1-221. The minor but specific labeling of other peptides indicate, however, that other regions in D1R1-545 interact with ATP. The observation of multiple radiolabeled cleavage products is not surprising given the approach taken. Direct photo-cross-linking of nucleotides to proteins is likely to result in a covalent linkage to any amino acids in juxtaposition to the nucleotide with a most efficient linkage to those residues that are most proximal to the adenine base. Using this same experimental approach, the major RNA binding site was also localized to the same NH2-terminal 25-kDa region of D1R to which ATP binds. RNA cross-linking to this region represents specific binding to the RNA 5′-triphosphatase active site based on the following observations. First, photo-linkage to the same NH2-terminal 25-kDa fragment occurred when either α- or γ-32P-radiolabeled 23-mer RNA was employed as a ligand. This result clearly indicates that D1R is binding to the 5′ terminus of RNA and protecting this region of RNA from RNase digestion. Second, kinetic competition data demonstrate that both ATPase and RNA 5′-triphosphatase activities share a common active site. Therefore, the observation that both ATP and RNA cross-link to the same region of D1R is consistent with both substrates binding at the same phosphohydrolysis site. The identification of specific residues involved in nucleotide binding was not possible by the photo-cross-linking method as a low cross-linking efficiency prohibited the isolation of a modified peptide in amounts sufficient for sequencing. Moreover, an evaluation of the D1R amino acid sequence failed to reveal any consensus sequences in D1R1-545 for nucleotide binding. However a few sequences which show some homology to nucleotide binding sequences should be noted. In particular is the sequence GSGAQSKS located at position 167-174. This sequence falls within the 25-kDa amino-terminal CNBr peptide representing the major ATP (and RNA) cross-linking product and loosely fits the Walker A NTP binding motif GXXXXGK(S/T) (19.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4250) Google Scholar). Another sequence in D1R which partially matches this motif is at position 434-443 and consists of the sequence GX5GXGK. This sequence lacks the typical S or T at the carboxyl terminus. However, following this sequence is a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids comprising a sequence motif reported for some herpesvirus proteins possessing ATPase functions(20.McGeogh D.J. Dalrymple M.A. Dolan A. McNab D. Perry L.J. Taylor Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 444-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other consensus sequences for nucleotide binding including the Walker B type, (R/K)X3GX3L-hydrophobic-D (19.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4250) Google Scholar), and the GTP binding motif, NKXD(25.Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2688) Google Scholar), are not present in D1R1-545. This is not surprising given that the preferred substrate for phosphohydrolysis is RNA and not single nucleoside triphosphates. An RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity for the West Nile virus has been reported(21.Wengler G. Wengler G. Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The authors have suggested the amino acids ILRPRW as comprising the putative RNA 5′-triphosphatase active site and note its homology to the vaccinia virus mRNA capping enzyme sequence LKPR starting at position 492. This sequence is based entirely on homology to other flaviviruses in a region of the viral genome to which no functional predictions had been previously made. No structure-function correspondence has actually been demonstrated. By analysis of D1R carboxyl-terminal deletion mutations, both the guanylyltransferase and ATPase activities have been mapped to the same 60 kDa amino-terminal domain. This fact suggests a close structural linkage between the two activities(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the inability of ATP to inhibit either E∼GMP formation or the transfer of GMP to RNA clearly demonstrates that the two active sites do not overlap. This conclusion is noteworthy given that GTP is a substrate for both reactions. Based on the apparently rate-limiting kinetics for the transfer of GMP to RNA(2.Venkatesan S. Gershowitz A. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 903-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), one would also expect some degree of inhibition by any nucleotide binding which interferes with this transfer. Clearly ATP does not inhibit this step. Two additional lines of evidence also argue for separate active sites. First, ATP does not effectively cross-link to the 14.2-kDa CNBr fragment containing the lysine 260 required for E∼GMP formation. This result demonstrates that the major ATP binding site is not proximal to this lysine, at least not in the primary sequence. Second, the mutation of this lysine to methionine, while eliminating E∼GMP formation(9.Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16424-16429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Niles E.G. Christen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24986-24989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on ATPase activity, indicating that this lysine is not required for phosphohydrolase activity. Employing a 23-mer triphosphorylated RNA substrate in vitro, D1R1-545 exhibits a 50-fold greater RNA 5′-triphosphatase than guanylyltransferase activity(12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); 50 dephosphorylations occur for each nucleotidyl transfer event. This observation implies that the probability of dissociation of diphosphorylated RNA from the RNA 5′-triphosphatase active site is 50-fold greater than the transfer of GMP to the RNA 5′ terminus. Since guanylyl transfer measured in vitro is linear with respect to time at the earliest time points analyzed (data not shown), the diphosphorylated RNA must serve as an acceptor for this transfer without dissociating from the enzyme. The poor coupling of guanylyltransferase to RNA 5′ triphosphatase in vitro demonstrates, however, that the capping enzyme lacks the ability to effectively retain the nascent diphosphorylated RNA product and transfer it to the guanylyltransferase active site. It is believed that nascent RNA is capped in vivo without the release of the intermediate products. This presumed greater in vivo catalytic efficiency is likely to be due to the existence of a ternary complex containing the capping enzyme, nascent RNA, and the RNA polymerase(26.Broyles S.S. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27.Hagler J. Shuman S. Science. 1992; 255: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A tethering of the nascent RNA to the RNA polymerase rather than to a site in the mRNA capping enzyme (12.Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) would retain the intermediate products and ensure a proximity of substrate RNA to each capping enzyme active site. In turn, this favorable arrangement would increase the efficiency of catalysis by physically coupling each reaction in the cap formation pathway. We thank Drs. Cecile Pickart and Dan Kosman for a critical evaluation of this manuscript."

An NF-κB/Rel binding site within the GM-CSF promoter, termed the κB element appears to be important for controlling expression in reporter gene assays in response to a number of stimuli in T cells. We investigated oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation across this regulatory sequence as a potential tool to inhibit GM-CSF gene transcription. A 15-base oligonucleotide, GM3, was targeted to a purine-rich region in the GM-CSF proximal promoter, which overlaps the κB element. Gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting demonstrated that GM3 formed a sequence-specific collinear triplex with its double-stranded DNA target. Triplex formation by GM3 blocked recombinant and nuclear NF-κB proteins binding to the GM-CSF element. GM3 also caused selective inhibition of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax transactivator-induced luciferase activity from a reporter construct driven by the GM-CSF promoter in Jurkat T cells. Finally, GM3 greatly reduced the concentration of endogenous GM-CSF mRNA induced by different stimuli in Jurkat T cells but did not affect interleukin 3 mRNA levels in the same cells. We conclude that the κB element in the GM-CSF promoter plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of the endogenous GM-CSF gene.

Overexpression of class 1 ALDH (ALDH-1) has been observed in cells selected for survival in the presence of OAPs. We used transfection to induce de novo expression of human ALDH-1 in V79/SD1 Chinese hamster cells to clearly quantitate the role of hALDH-1 expression in OAP resistance. Messenger RNA levels correlated well with hALDH-1 protein levels and enzyme activities (1.5-13.6 milliunits/mg with propionaldehyde/NAD+ substrate, compared to < 1 milliunit/mg in controls) in individual clonal transfectant lines, and slot blot analysis confirmed the presence of the transfected cDNA. Expressed ALDH activity was closely correlated (r = 0.99) with resistance to mafosfamide, up to 21-fold relative to controls. Transfectants were cross-resistant to other OAPs but not to phosphoramide mustard, ifosfamide mustard, melphalan, or acrolein. Resistance was completely reversed by pretreatment with 25 μM diethylaminobenzaldehyde, a potent ALDH inhibitor. Alkaline elution studies showed that expression of ALDH-1 reduced the number of DNA cross-links commensurate with mafosfamide resistance, and this reduction in cross-links was fully reversed by the inhibitor. Thus, overexpression of human class 1 ALDH alone is sufficient to confer OAP-specific drug resistance.

The multiple ALDH isoforms are classified according to their amino acid sequence homology as either class 1 (cytosolic), class 2 (mitochondrial), or class 3 (cytosolic and microsomal)(2.Lindahl R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 283-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The class 1 ALDH isozyme has also been implicated in the metabolic inactivation of activated metabolites of the widely used anti-cancer and immunosuppressive agent cyclophosphamide (CPA) and other members of the oxazaphosphorine (OAP) class of DNA alkylating agents(4.Sladek N.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1988; 37: 301-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The inactive prodrug CPA requires activation to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4-OH-CPA) by cytochrome P450-2B6 in humans(5.Chang T. Weber G.F. Crespi C.L. Waxman D.J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5629-5637PubMed Google Scholar), primarily in the liver(4.Sladek N.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1988; 37: 301-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Aldophosphamide (ALDO) is a membrane-permeable ring-opened tautomer of the activated 4-OH-CPA that is the major metabolite present in the blood of patients treated with CPA(4.Sladek N.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1988; 37: 301-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This unstable aldehyde species undergoes spontaneous cleavage to yield the cytotoxic DNA cross-linking agent phosphoramide mustard (PM), and also the highly reactive side product acrolein(4.Sladek N.E.

In order to quantitatively examine the effect of variable ALDH expression on OAP-specific resistance and also to clearly establish that expression of ALDH-1 alone is sufficient to cause resistance, we have developed transgenic cell lines that express a broad range of activities of either class 1 or class 3 ALDH, via transfection with mammalian expression vector constructs that contain the respective cDNAs encoding each isozyme. This report details direct testing of the ability of the cytosolic class 1 ALDH to confer oxazaphosphorine-specific resistance in transgenic cell lines expressing transfected human ALDH-1. This approach has an inherent advantage over comparison of drug-selected and parental cells, or comparison of different cell lines, in that expression of the transfected gene product should be the sole variable. In contrast, cell lines subjected to cytotoxic drug selection may have multiple phenotypic differences from control cells, and this would also be true for comparison of different cell lines. We have demonstrated in the present study that fold-resistance to mafosfamide (up to 21-fold in the highest activity clone) was linearly correlated with ALDH activity in several clonal transfectant lines that express low, intermediate, or high levels of class 1 ALDH. Resistance was completely reversed in the ALDH-expressing transfectant lines by the pretreatment of cells with the potent ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), which had little effect on the drug sensitivity of the control (empty vector-transfected) cell line. Interestingly, the ALDH-1-expressing transfectant lines exhibited lower levels of resistance to other OAPs (4-hp-CPA, 4-hp-IF). However, no resistance was conferred to the non-OAP alkylating agents PM, isophosphoramide mustard, L-phenylalanine mustard, or acrolein. Finally, the degree of protection from cytotoxicity was shown to be quantitatively correlated with both class 1 ALDH activity and the reduction in levels of DNA interstrand cross-links.

Alcoholism. 1993; 17: 828-831Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because the cDNA provided was cropped for use in a bacterial expression vector, having only the coding region but lacking 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions, we added sequences to both the cDNA and the expression vector to create a 5′-UTR that would support translation in a mammalian system. The mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen, Inc.) was first modified to remove the sequences required for episomal replication in mammalian cells, in order to allow for selection of clonal transfectant cell lines expressing hygromycin resistance with the vector stably integrated into cellular DNA. The 4,280-bp sequence containing the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen and oriP viral replication origin was released by digestion with ClaI and EcoRV, followed by blunt ligation of the remaining 6,130-bp gel-purified vector fragment. This nonepisomal parent vector, designated “ΔpCEP4,” retained the Hygr and AMP resistance genes, the multiple cloning site, the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, and the 3′-polyadenylation signal sequence. A second modification to the vector was the introduction from position −29 to −47 bp (relative to the ATG start of translation) of a 19-bp sequence derived from the proximal 5′-UTR of the human GSTM1-1 cDNA (17.DeJong J.L. Chang C.-M. Whang-Peng J. Knutsen T. Tu C.-P. D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8541-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This was the shortest 5′-leader sequence that we knew to be capable of supporting high level translation of the downstream cDNA (18.Townsend A.J. Tu C.P. Cowan K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 230-236PubMed Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides, consisting of a 28-mer and a 20-mer, (5′-AGCTTGGTTGGTGCGGATTCCGCGGTAC-3′) and (5′-CGCGGAATCCGCACCAACCA-3′), were annealed to form an insert with KpnI- and HindIII-compatible overhangs, with a 19-bp sequence corresponding to bases no. 1-19 of the 5′-UTR from the human GSTM1-1 cDNA (pGTH4) (17.DeJong J.L. Chang C.-M. Whang-Peng J. Knutsen T. Tu C.-P. D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8541-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in between. The annealed insert was ligated at high vector, insert ratio into a KpnI- and HindIII-digested, gel-purified ΔpCEP4 vector. The resulting vector, designated “ΔpCEP4Δ,” was transformed, amplified, and purified on ion-exchange columns (Qiagen). Prior to incorporation into the vector, the cDNA was modified by polymerase chain reaction amplification to include a translation initiation leader sequence CCACC (19.Kozak M. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) immediately 5′ to the ATG start codon, since this sequence is present in the 5′-UTR of the human GSTP1-1 cDNA(20.Kano T. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5626-5630PubMed Google Scholar), and is known to support high levels of expression of GSTP1-1 in V79 cells. 3W. Fields and A. Townsend, manuscript in preparation. An XhoI restriction endonuclease cleavage site was included in the UTR of the 5′-primer, and a BamHI cleavage site in the UTR of the 3′-primer. The primers were, amino-terminal end: 5′-TTTCTCGAGCCACCATGTCATCCTCAGGCACG-3′, and carboxyl-terminal end: 5′-GAGGGATCCTTATGAGTTCTTCTGAGAGAT-3′ (restriction sites and the ATG start codon are underlined). Cycle parameters for amplification were: 94°C/60 s denaturation, 50°C/30 s annealing, and 72°C/120 s extension, for 30 cycles. The 1.5-kilobase pair cDNA product was gel-purified, digested with XhoI and BamHI restriction endonucleases and directionally subcloned into the XhoI/BamHI digested and dephosphorylated ΔpCEP4Δ expression vector. The final product is henceforth referred to as the ΔpCEP4Δ/hALDH-1 expression vector. Partial DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the cDNA was identical to the reported human class 1 ALDH sequence and also confirmed insertion of the human GSTM1-1 5′-untranslated region into the the vector (data not shown). Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (V79/SD1), previously transfected with a cytochrome P450IIB1 expression vector, were generously provided by Dr. Johannes Doehmer(21.Doehmer J. Dogra S. Friedberg T. Monier S. Adesnik M. Glatt H. Oesch F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5769-5773Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These cells were chosen as the recipient line in order to allow for activation of labeled CPA by cytochrome P450 IIB1 in situ. However, because of concerns about the nonpharmacologically high concentrations of CPA required to induce cytotoxicity in control cells and especially in high activity ALDH-expressing clones, we elected to utilize the hydrolytically activated OAP analogs MAF, 4-hp-CPA, and 4-hp-IF so that meaningful comparisons of IC90 values could be drawn. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells (5 × 105) were transfected with the ΔpCEP4Δ/hALDH-1 expression vector (10 μg) by a calcium phosphate precipitation procedure(22.Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and selected for resistance to hygromycin B (0.7 mg/ml) conferred by the vector Hyg resistance gene. Another population of V79/SD1 cells was similarly transfected with the empty ΔpCEP4Δ vector and selected for hygromycin resistance to serve as a transfected control cell line. This cell line, designated SD1/Hyg-1, had very low ALDH activity equal to the parental SD1 cell population. Colonies representing clonal transfectant lines were picked, expanded, characterized (see below), and cryogenically stored at −80°C. The doubling times were determined to be similar (11.7-12.9 h) in all cell lines at early passage (data not shown). Since different clonal lines exhibited variable fractions of the ALDH expression that was stable in the absence of hygromycin selection, cells were grown under continuous selective pressure in order to maintain optimal activity. In order to control for this stress, the SD1/Hyg-1 empty vector-transfected cells were also selected and maintained in hygromycin. The lack of significant differences in growth (not shown) or IC90 for MAF between the SD1/Hyg-1 and V79/SD1 parental cell lines suggests that this selection did not affect sensitivity to the OAP analogs. Nevertheless, cells were cultured without hygromycin for 24 h prior to experiments, and cell stocks were replaced with a fresh aliquot of cryopreserved early-passage cells every 3-4 weeks in order to minimize any effect of hygromycin selection. Forty-eight clones that survived hygromycin selection were expanded, and the cytosolic fractions were prepared and assayed for enzyme activity and protein by a modification of the method described by Manthey and Sladek(23.Manthey C.L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), as described previously(24.Bunting K.D. Lindahl R. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One additional change in the assay was the time over which the activity rate was determined. We found that ALDH-1 activity measured repeatedly in the same reaction mixture gradually increased by 1.5-2-fold over a 30-min period before leveling off, possibly reflecting slow elimination of an inhibitor or exhaustion of an opposing reaction that reoxidized the NADH chromophore measured in the ALDH kinetic assay. Thus, all components of the reaction mixture were routinely preincubated for 30 min at 25°C prior to spectrophotometric determination of the ΔA340/min. Under these assay conditions, less than 10% of substrates were converted to product. One milliunit of activity was defined as the amount of activity that oxidized 1 nmol of substrate/min at 25°C. Transfected cells growing in 0.7 mg/ml hygromycin were harvested by scraping into cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were stored at −80°C. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. This lysate mixture was incubated for 18 h at 50°C followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, chloroform/butanol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Digestion of RNA with 1 μg/ml DNase-free RNase was carried out for 1 h at 37°C followed by an additional phenol/chloroform extraction. DNA (10 μg/slot) was denatured in 0.35 N NaOH for 1 h at 65°C, then neutralized with 1 M ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. DNA was blotted onto a MagnaGraph nylon membrane (Micron Separations, Inc.) using a MilliBlot-S vacuum blotter (Millipore Systems, Inc.), and cross-linked to the blot by exposure to 254-nm UV light (Stratalinker, Stratagene Inc.). Gel-purified human class 1 ALDH cDNA was 32P-labeled by the random priming method using the Prime-a-Gene kit (Promega), denatured, and hybridized to the blot according to the manufacturer's instructions, with two final washes in 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS at 60°C and 65°C for 1 h each. The blot was exposed to autoradiography film (DuPont) for 90 h. Transfected cells were grown and harvested as described above. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol™ Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA (25 μg/lane) was fractionated on a 1% agarose gel in 20 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mM sodium acetate, 0.22 M formaldehyde, and 1 mM EDTA. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (5 μg/ml), photographed to verify even loading of undegraded RNA, and blotted to MagnaGraph Nylon membrane by capillary blotting. The blot was then hybridized to 32P-labeled human class 1 ALDH cDNA as described above for DNA analysis but with a single high stringency 60°C wash for 1 h. The blot was exposed to autoradiography film for 17 days. Cytosolic protein (100 μg/lane) was prepared as for enzyme activity assay, electrophoresed on a 14% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred by semidry electroblotting at 200 mA for 1 h onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed as described previously (24.Bunting K.D. Lindahl R. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-rat class 1 ALDH antisera, generously provided by Dr. Ronald Lindahl (University of South Dakota). This antisera was cross-reactive with the human ALDH-1 homolog. A 1:2000 dilution of a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) was used as secondary antibody, and blots were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium + 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate chromophore (Bio-Rad), as described previously(24.Bunting K.D. Lindahl R. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of the percent of cytosolic protein expressed as ALDH, a separate gel stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 was scanned with a digital densitometer (PDI, Inc.). The percent of total protein expressed in the 56-kDa hALDH-1 protein band was calculated by subtracting the percent total protein in the SD1/Hyg-1 control lane from that in the hALDH1-28 lane in the same selected (∼55 kDa) regions to eliminate the background absorbance due to similar molecular weight proteins. The protocol for the clonogenic survival assay was modified from that of Sreerama and Sladek(14.Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2487-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured without hygromycin 24 h prior to drug treatment. The ALDH activities determined from cells growing in hygromycin versus cells growing in hygromycin-free medium for 24 h were not significantly different (data not shown). On the day of the experiment, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in fresh medium, counted, and diluted into 5 ml of drug exposure medium (neutral 0.9% NaCl + 10% fetal bovine serum) in sterile tubes at a concentration of 50,000 cells/ml. The drug was then added to separate tubes at the concentrations indicated. Cells were incubated for 30 min in a 37°C water bath with inversion of the tube every 5 min, then chilled on ice for 5 min and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g. Cells were resuspended in 37°C medium and diluted to 10,000 and 1000 cells/ml. One-ml aliquots of cells were added to 60-mm2 plates containing 3 ml of medium (10,000 cells/plate for the two highest concentrations, and 1000 cells/plate for all concentrations). Cells were allowed to grow for 6-7 days, stained, and counted as described previously(24.Bunting K.D. Lindahl R. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning efficiency under these conditions was approximately 60-70%. The relative survival was expressed as the percentage of the colonies (≥50 cells) formed in the presence of the drug compared to the colonies formed in control wells containing no drug. For ALDH inhibition studies, 25 μM DEAB was preincubated with the cell suspension for 10 min followed by drug incubation also in the presence of 25 μM DEAB for 30 min. This DEAB concentration was completely nontoxic (data not shown) but well above the Ki (0.04 μM) (6.Russo J. Hilton J. Colvin O.M. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. 2. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar) of this inhibitor for class 1 ALDH. Transfected cells were trypsinized, suspended (6 × 105 cells/ml), and treated as described above for cytotoxicity. Following a 30-min exposure to MAF, cells were washed and replated in 60-mm dishes for 5 h to allow accumulation of DNA damage. Cells were then placed on ice, irradiated with 400 rad of γ radiation from a cesium-137 source, and loaded onto the membrane manifold of each channel in saline A solution (per liter, NaCl 8 g, KCl 0.4 g, D-glucose 1.0 g, NaHCO3 0.35 g, Na2EDTA 1.86 g, pH 7.3). Following lysis in Sarkosyl solution (0.04 M Na4EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.2% Sarkosyl, pH 10) and proteinase K digestion (0.5 mg/ml, 1 h), DNA was eluted in 2% tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (pH 12.3) for 15 h through a 75-mm diameter, 2-μm pore size polycarbonate filter (Nucleopore). The DNA in eluted fractions and filter fractions was quantitated by a fluorometric assay as described by Cesarone et al.(25.Cesarone C.F. Bolognesi C. Santi L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Proteinase K-resistant DNA cross-linking was determined from a plot of DNA remaining on the filter versus elution volume at an elution volume of approximately 28 ml. Rad equivalents of DNA cross-links were calculated according to the formula: cross-linking coefficient (pc) = kc•pbr•(SQR ((1 - R0)/(1 - R1) - 1) where pbr = 400 rad, kc = constant (=1), R0 = the retention of DNA in control cells treated only with 400 rad, and R1 = the retention of DNA in cells treated with 400 rad + MAF. For DEAB reversal studies cells were treated with 75 μM DEAB for 10 min prior to and during a 30-min exposure to 100 μM MAF. The human class 1 ALDH expression vector was constructed by subcloning a human class 1 ALDH cDNA (16.Zheng C.F. Wang T. Weiner H. Alcoholism. 1993; 17: 828-831Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with added translation initiation concensus sequence (19.Kozak M. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) into the ΔpCEP4Δ mammalian expression vector, which was modified to allow stable integration into cellular DNA. This expression vector or a control vector without any cDNA insert was transfected into the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast V79/SD1 cell line. The transfection efficiency with the ΔpCEP4Δ expression vector in V79/SD1 cells was very high. Initial screening of 48 clonal cell lines revealed that almost every transfected clonal cell line expressed class 1 ALDH, spanning a broad range of activity levels. Three cell lines were chosen for further analysis representing the low and the high limits of ALDH expression obtained, and one intermediate level. Using propionaldehyde as substrate, a range of class 1 ALDH activity from 1.5 to 13.6 milliunits/mg was detected in the ALDH-transfected cell lines, compared to very low activity (<1 milliunit/mg) in the parental and the empty vector transfected lines (Table 1). Thus the cytomegalovirus promoter upstream of the hALDH-1 cDNA in the modified ΔpCEP4Δ mammalian expression vector appears to be highly active in V79 cells, consistent with a previous report of efficient transcription driven by this promoter in rodent cells(26.Pasleau F. Tocci M. Leung F. Kopchick J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 38: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The doubling time for all cell lines was similar (∼12 h), indicating that the growth rate was not a factor in any of their differences in alkylating agent sensitivity.Tabled 1 The ALDH-transfected cell lines growing in the presence of 0.7 mg/ml hygromycin and the parent V79/SD1 line were analyzed to determine the amount of class 1 ALDH DNA, RNA, and protein present. The DNA slot blot analysis under high stringency conditions demonstrated the presence of the transfected DNA in each of the transfected cell lines (Fig. 1, lanes 3, 4, and 5) and only weak hybridization in SD1/parental cells (lane 1) or in the control transfected V79/SD1 cell line (SD1/Hyg-1, lane 2). The ALDH-1 DNA content appears to increase linearly with increasing ALDH-1 activity for these cell lines as determined by densitometric quantitation with a scanning densitometer (PDI, Inc.) (data not shown). This does not necessarily have to be the case, since the site of incorporation may have a greater effect on expression than the number of copies(18.Townsend A.J. Tu C.P. Cowan K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 230-236PubMed Google Scholar). The human ALDH-1 mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA from each of the five cell lines (Fig. 2). The results demonstrate the presence of an approximately 1.9-kilobase pair mRNA band that hybridized to 32P-labeled human class 1 ALDH cDNA in all three transfected cell lines (lanes 4, 6, and 8). As expected, neither the V79/SD1 parental nor the SD1/Hyg-1 control cell lines exhibited a band of this size (lanes 1 and 2). The mRNA levels analyzed by densitometry also correlate well with the relative levels of propionaldehyde/NAD+ ALDH activity (r = 0.98) (data not shown). The expression of the 55-kDa human ALDH-1 protein was confirmed by Western (immuno-) blot analysis, using antisera raised against rat class 1 ALDH (Fig. 3). The parental SD1 cells and SD1/Hyg-1 cells did not express detectable levels of the class 1 ALDH protein (lanes 1 and 2) and thus were good recipient cell lines for these studies. A wide range of ALDH protein expression was seen in the three cell lines with elevated ALDH activity (lanes 3, 4, and 5). Densitometry of a separate Coomassie Blue-stained gel (corrected for control background density) indicated that in the highest activity cell line obtained, the hALDH-1 band accounted for 0.72% of the total cytosolic protein expressed (data not shown). These cell lines were then analyzed for sensitivity to a range of oxazaphosphorine and non-oxazaphosphorine antineoplastic alkylating agents by colony forming assay.

https://openalex.org/W2055531366,"Expression of class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH-3) has been associated with acquired or inherent resistance to oxazaphosphorine (OAP) antineoplastic alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide). We previously demonstrated that expression of transfected rat ALDH-3 can confer OAP-specific resistance in human MCF-7 cells (Bunting, K. D., Lindahl, R., and Townsend, A. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23197-23203). However, the aldophosphamide intermediate inactivated by human class 1 ALDH (hALDH-1) has not proven to be a good substrate for the purified hALDH-3. We have examined the ability of transfected human or rat ALDH-3 to confer OAP resistance in V79/SD1 cells. Clones expressing elevated human (386-5938 milliunits/mg) or rat (4-597 milliunits/mg, benzaldehyde/NADP+ substrate) ALDH-3 activity were 1.3- to 12-fold resistant to mafosfamide relative to control cells (<1 milliunit/mg). Resistance was correlated with hALDH-3 activity, and was reversed by pretreatment with the ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde. Transfectants were cross-resistant to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and 4-hydroperoxyifosfamide but not to phosphoramide mustard, ifosfamide mustard, melphalan, or acrolein. DNA interstrand cross-links were reduced commensurately with the fold resistance to mafosfamide in the highest activity clone. A key finding was the detection of a metabolite, most likely carboxyphosphamide, that is formed only by cytosols from cells expressing either class 3 or class 1 ALDH.

In contrast, the role of class 3 ALDH in OAP resistance is still unclear due to the lack (or low level) of ALDO oxidation by purified human class 3 ALDH (hALDH-3) in vitro(14.Sreerama L. Sladek N.E.

Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14.Sreerama L. Sladek N.E.

Although purified human ALDH-3 had weak catalysis with ALDO as a substrate in enzymology studies, we have previously shown that MCF-7 cells induced to express rat class 3 tumor-associated ALDH (tALDH-3) by stable transfection of a plasmid expression vector were resistant to OAP analogs(17.Bunting K.D. Lindahl R. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resistance was OAP-specific and closely correlated with tALDH-3 activity, and it was reversible by pretreatment with the ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). Since the rat and human class 3 ALDH share significant sequence homology (81%) and similar substrate preferences, and because expression of a human class 3 ALDH has been strongly implicated as a causative factor in OAP-resistant cell lines, it was important to determine whether expression of the human cytosolic ALDH-3 would also be sufficient to confer resistance. We have utilized transfection to produce genetically modified clonal derivative cell lines that should differ only in their levels of expression of ALDH activity. Using this transgenic model system, we were able to assess the capacity and activity dependence of this resistance mechanism over a very broad range of ALDH expression and to compare the rat and human class 3 ALDH with the human class 1 ALDH. The results indicated that the rat and human class 3 ALDH confer comparable levels of OAP-specific resistance at similar expression levels, but the absolute resistance with the class 3 isozymes was less than that conferred in this model system by the transfected human class 1 ALDH (28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resistance was correlated with class 3 ALDH activity, but the relationship was hyperbolic rather than the linear correlation observed with class 1 ALDH-mediated resistance. Importantly, the degree of protection from cytotoxicity was shown to be quantitatively similar to the reduction in levels of DNA interstrand cross-links. Protection against both cytotoxicity and DNA cross-links was abolished by preincubation with the ALDH competitive inhibitor DEAB. Finally, we were able to directly demonstrate metabolism of labeled activated cyclophosphamide by cytosol extracted from transfectant lines expressing hALDH-3 or hALDH-1, but not by extract from nonexpressing control cells. Sources of chemical and pharmacologic materials are described in our companion study that reports resistance conferred by hALDH-1(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The chloroethyl-3H-labeled CPA was custom-synthesized by Amersham Corp. and generously provided by Dr. James P. Kehrer (University of Texas-Austin) for these studies. The cDNA for human class 3 ALDH was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from human stomach cDNA (Clontech), under the following cycle parameters: 45-s denaturation at 94°C, 30-s annealing at 42°C, and 150-s extension at 72°C for 35 cycles followed by a 10-min incubation at 72°C to allow the polymerase to fully extend to the end of the sequence (to ensure that engineered XhoI restriction sites were intact). A 43-base pair oligonucleotide forward primer (5′-CAGCTCGAGCACAGGAAACGCCACCATGAGCAAGATCAGCGAG-3′), synthesized to contain an XhoI site in the 5′ end, and a 27-base pair oligonucleotide reverse primer (5′-GTGCTCGAGTCAGTGCTGGGTGATCTT-3′), with an XhoI site in the 5′-end were used to amplify an approximately 1.4-kilobase pair cDNA product containing the complete coding region of the class 3 ALDH. The product did not include any native 5′- or 3′-untranslated sequence, but the leader was modified to contain an added sequence motif in the 5′-end for correct initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells (CCACC) (18.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for prokaryotic ribosome binding (AGGA) (19.Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar) to facilitate enzyme production in bacterial expression systems. The cDNA product gave correct size fragments following restriction enzyme digestion (data not shown). DNA sequence analysis of approximately the first 150 base pair indicated a match of the sequence with that previously reported by Hsu et al.(20.Hsu L.C. Chang W.-C. Shibuya A. Yoshida A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3030-3037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA was subcloned into the XhoI site of the ΔpCEP4Δ mammalian expression vector, a derivative of the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) that was modified to prevent episomal replication and favor host integration(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rat class 3 ALDH cDNA was excised from the pMTP-3H expression vector previously used to transfect MCF-7 cells (17.Bunting K.D. Lindahl R. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, and then gel purified and ligated into an EcoRI and BamHI digested and dephosphorylated pGEM-7Z(-) plasmid (Promega). The rat class 3 cDNA was then released with XhoI and BamHI, gel-purified, and directionally ligated into an XhoI and BamHI-digested and dephosphorylated ΔpCEP4Δ vector. Expression vectors were amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) with ampicillin selection and purified using Qiagen Maxi Prep ion exchange columns. Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (V79/SD1), generously provided by Dr. Johannes Doehmer (21.Doehmer J. Dogra S. Friedberg T. Monier S. Adesnik M. Glatt H. Oesch F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were transfected, selected for resistance to hygromycin B (0.7 mg/ml), and maintained as described in our companion study(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The empty vector-transfected cell line (designated SD1/Hyg-1), had very low ALDH activity (equal to parental V79/SD1 cells). The transfection efficiency with the ΔpCEP4Δ expression vector in V79 cells was high, resulting in a large number of resistant colonies. Forty-eight clones that survived hygromycin selection were expanded and processed for protein and activity assays as described in our companion report(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Aliquots of crude cytosol, with benzaldehyde (1 mM) as substrate and NADP+ (1 mM) as cofactor were utilized to determine enzyme activity by a modification (17.Bunting K.D. Lindahl R. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the method described by Manthey and Sladek(10.Manthey C.L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One milliunit of activity was defined as the amount of activity that oxidized 1 nmol of substrate/min at 25°C. Western blot analysis, and densitometric analysis of a parallel Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel were performed essentially as described in our companion study(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-rat class 3 ALDH antisera (generously provided by Dr. Ronald Lindahl, University of South Dakota) that was cross-reactive with human ALDH-3 was used as primary antibody to probe the blots at 1:3000 dilution. The protocol for the clonogenic survival assay was modified from that of Sreerama and Sladek(3.Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2487-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), with slight modifications as described in our companion study(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were processed for alkaline elution and analyzed for rad equivalents of DNA interstrand cross-links as described in our companion study(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A washed rat liver S9 fraction (MOLTOX, Inc.) prepared from rats treated with phenobarbital and 5,6-benzoflavone to induce cytochrome P-450 expression was used to activate chloroethyl-3H-labeled CPA to the 4-hydroxy intermediate that tautomerizes to yield ALDO, the putative ALDH substrate. The microsomes were first pelleted from the S9 fraction at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C and then resuspended in half the original volume of buffer (10 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 10 μM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM EDTA, total volume 250 μl) by brief sonication on ice. This wash step was essential to remove cytosolic protein including endogenous ALDH activity presumed to be present in the S9 fraction, in order to prevent artifactual oxidation of ALDO by the activation premix itself. A 100-μl aliquot of resuspended microsomes was incubated with 20 μCi of labeled CPA and 1.0 mM NADPH in a final volume of 2.5 ml buffer (100 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2) for 10 min at 25°C. Aliquots (500 μl) of this activation premix were adjusted to contain 1 × ALDH assay buffer, 5 mM mercaptoethanol, 100 μl of cell cytosols (12,000 × g supernatant, approximately 5 mg/ml), and either 1 mM NAD+ (for class 1 and control extracts) or 1 mM NADP+ (for class 3 extracts) in a final volume of 1.0 ml, and the incubation was continued for an additional hour at 25°C. Protein was precipitated by addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile, and the 12,000 × g supernatant of this precipitate was evaporated to dryness in a warmed Speedvac (Savant, Inc.). The residues were redissolved in 10 μl of methanol, spotted onto aluminum-backed silica TLC plates (60 F254, 20 × 20 cm, E. Merck, Inc., which had been preeluted twice with methanol), dried, and chromatographed in a mixture of butanol:water (20:3). The TLC plate was dried in an oven at 160°C, and then analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using a 3H-sensitive cassette exposed overnight. Finally, after analysis on the PhosphorImager, regions in each lane corresponding to the carboxyphosphamide band were scraped from the dried plate, and total counts/min were determined by scintillation counting. Class 3 ALDH-expressing cell lines were generated by calcium phosphate transfection of rat or human class 3 ALDH expression vector constructs into V79 cells. The rat class 3 ALDH cDNA used previously to transfect MCF-7 cells (17.Bunting K.D. Lindahl R. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was included in these studies with the V79 recipient cells in an effort to obtain higher levels of expression with the modified vector, and to determine whether rat ALDH-3 could serve as a surrogate model for human drug resistance. While both rat and human class 3 ALDH were efficiently expressed in most hygromycin resistant transfectants, the absolute range of activities, and absolute protein expression was higher using the human ALDH-3 vector. Three each of the rat class 3 and human class 3 ALDH transfectants were chosen to span the range of activity obtained, thus providing a wide range of expression as well as a rigorous way to directly compare protection by rat versus human class 3 ALDH at similar ALDH expression. Doubling times (approximately 12 h) in class 3 ALDH transfectants and in control lines were similar. Transfected cell lines exhibited elevated ALDH activity relative to SD1 parental and SD1/Hyg-1 (empty vector-transfected) control cell lines (<1 mU/mg) (Table 1). Rat class 3 ALDH transfectants (designated tALDH-X) showed increased activity ranging from 4 to 597 milliunits/mg and human class 3 ALDH transfectants (designated hALDH-X) showed increased activity ranging from 386 to 5938 milliunits/mg (Table 1).Tabled 1 Transfected cell lines were assayed to determine relative levels of class 3 ALDH DNA, RNA, and protein by Southern, Northern, and Western blotting, respectively. Southern blot analysis revealed that the hALDH-3 transfectant lines, which had higher ALDH activities, contained more total ALDH-3 cDNA than did the tALDH-3 transfectants (data not shown). However, in contrast to the results reported for class 1 ALDH expression(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), no direct correlation of cDNA content with ALDH activity was seen within each group. This may be due to variable incorporation into transcriptionally active or inactive sites(22.Townsend A.J. Tu C.P. Cowan K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 230-236PubMed Google Scholar). Expressed mRNA levels were compared in rat and human ALDH-3-transfected cell lines by Northern blot analysis with specific 32P-labeled ALDH cDNA probes (data not shown). The V79/SD1 parental and SD1/Hyg-1 cells contained no detectable class 3 ALDH mRNA, consistent with the undetectable activity in these lines. In clonal lines expressing rat or human class 3 ALDH, the range of mRNA transcripts detected was well correlated with ALDH-3 activities, as quantitated by densitometry (r = 0.96; data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed a broad range of expression of rat ALDH-3 (Fig. 1A) and human ALDH-3 (Fig. 1B) in the three transfected clones of each (lanes 3-5) while no expression is detectable in any of the control cell lines (lanes 1 and 2). Densitometric analysis of a separate SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel stained with Coomassie G250 indicated that human class 3 ALDH accounted for 2.3% of the cytosolic protein expressed in hALDH-3-26 cells (data not shown). Transfected cell lines were screened for sensitivity to oxazaphosphorine and non-oxazaphosphorine alkylating agents. Mafosfamide cytotoxicity experiments indicated that class 3 ALDH can provide a potent protective effect, as illustrated by the rightward shift in the dose-response curves corresponding with the relative levels of ALDH activity (Fig. 2A). The IC90 values were determined for V79/SD1 parental and SD1/Hyg-1 (empty vector transfected) cell lines and were found to be 29 and 31 μM, respectively. Rat class 3 ALDH-transfected cell lines showed increasing resistance to MAF with IC90 values of 41 μM for tALDH-8, 66 μM for tALDH-9, and 137 μM for tALDH-3 (Table 1). Human class 3 ALDH-transfected cell lines showed even higher MAF IC90 values, commensurate with their higher ALDH-3 expression: 94 μM for hALDH-3-31, 193 μM for hALDH-3-35, and 383 μM for hALDH-3-26 (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). The highest level of MAF fold resistance (relative to the SD1/Hyg-1 transfected control cell line) was calculated to be 4.4-fold in tALDH-3 cells and 12.4-fold in hALDH-3-26 cells (Table 1). In contrast to the linear correlation between expression of class 1 ALDH and resistance, the composite plot of rat and human class 3 ALDH activity versus MAF IC90 in these cells (Fig. 2B) exhibited a nonlinear relationship between class 3 ALDH expression and resistance, leveling off at very high levels of activity. This indicates that in this model system the class 3 ALDH-mediated MAF resistance appears to be a self-limiting mechanism at high levels of expression. The highest activity rat and human class 3 ALDH transfected cell lines were chosen to determine sensitivity to a range of OAP and non-OAP drugs (Table 2). A lower level of resistance was seen to 4-hydroperoxy CPA analogs (4-hydroperoxy-CPA, = 2.7-fold; 4-hydroperoxyifosamide, = 5.1-fold) in hALDH-3-26 cells. No resistance was seen in either tALDH-3 or hALDH-3-26 to non-oxazaphosphorines phosphoramide mustard, ifosfamide mustard, melphalan, or acrolein. These data indicate that resistance conferred by class 3 ALDH expression is OAP-specific.Tabled 1 The ALDH inhibitor DEAB was utilized to determine whether the protective effects could be reversed. This potent inhibitor has previously been shown to be a substrate for class 3 ALDH enzymes (Km∼6 μM; data not shown); hence, for inhibition studies we utilized 25 μM DEAB. The results indicated that the MAF sensitivity of either tALDH-3 or hALDH-3-26 cells in the presence of DEAB was indistinguishable from that in SD1/Hyg-1 cells (Table 3). Further, control SD1/Hyg-1 cells, which have very low ALDH activity, were not sensitized to MAF by DEAB treatment, and DEAB alone showed no cytotoxicity in control cells at concentrations as high as 500 μM (data not shown). Importantly, DEAB did not potentiate cytotoxicity to the non-OAP compound PM (Table 3). These results support the conclusion that catalytic activity, and not merely protein binding, of ALDH-3 is required to confer oxazaphosphorine-specific resistance to cells which are normally very sensitive to OAP drugs.Tabled 1 A significant protection (13-fold) against formation of DNA interstrand cross-links was seen in hALDH-3-26 cells relative to SD1/Hyg-1 control cells (Fig. 3), strongly suggesting that expression of hALDH-3 lowered formation of phosphoramide mustard. Cross-link formation was restored to the level observed in control cells when hALDH3-26 cells were pretreated with 75 μM DEAB for 10 min prior to and during a 30-min incubation with 100 μM mafosfamide (data not shown). Catalysis of oxidation of ALDO to carboxyphosphamide by human ALDH-3 preparations purified from stomach tissue has to date been undetectable or extremely weak. However, the OAP-specific resistance, the reduction in DNA cross-links, and the reversibility of both by the ALDH inhibitor DEAB all point toward a function for hALDH-3 in direct catalytic inactivation of ALDO. Thus, we wished to determine whether the hALDH-3 expressed in the cell lysate of hALDH3-26 cells could catalyze this reaction. A rat microsomal activation system was used to oxidize [chloroethyl-3H]CPA to the labeled 4-hydroxy-CPA metabolite, which in turn tautomerizes to form labeled ALDO, the putative ALDH substrate. This activation system was mixed with the hALDH3-26 lysate, and the labeled reaction products were separated by TLC. A band was formed in the class 3 ALDH-containing reaction that was also present in the class 1 ALDH-containing reaction, but not in either the reaction with control lysate or no lysate (Fig. 4, arrow). The calculated Rf value for this band (0.29) corresponded well with the Rf value for carboxyphosphamide (0.26) previously reported with a similar TLC analysis method(23.Hadidi A.-H. Idle J.R. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 427: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Regions including the band were scraped from each lane, and the silica powder was mixed with scintillation fluid and counted. The reaction with the hALDH3-26 cytosol (hALDH-3) yielded 7,385 cpm, compared with 12,372 cpm with the hALDH1-28 cytosol (hALDH-1). The SD1/Hyg-1 (control cytosol, no ALDH) and reagent blank (no cytosol) lanes yielded 2914 and 3012 cpm, respectively. Thus, the net catalysis by hALDH3 (4,373 cpm) was approximately half of that by hALDH1 (9,360 cpm) after subtraction of the blank lane value, under the conditions of this coupled assay. This metabolite analysis provides strong evidence that oxidation of ALDO to carboxyphosphamide is catalyzed by the human class 3 ALDH, albeit at a lower rate than with the class 1 isozyme. An important role for the class 1 aldehyde dehydrogenase isozyme in resistance to the anticancer drug cyclophosphamide has been well supported by both cellular expression and enzymology studies. Elevation of either class 1 or class 3 ALDH have been found in OAP-selected resistant cell lines(1.Hilton J. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5156-5160PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Koelling T.M. Yeager A.M.

Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2487-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ALDH-1-mediated resistance was accompanied by increased formation of carboxyphosphamide(1.Hilton J. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5156-5160PubMed Google Scholar), the inactivated product of ALDH oxidation of aldophosphamide, and decreased DNA cross-linking was also found(24.Hilton J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 1867-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The role of ALDH-1 in OAP resistance has also been directly supported by enzymologic studies that demonstrated favorable kinetics for ALDO oxidation by the purified enzyme(9.Russo J.E. Hilton J. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2963-2968PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Manthey C.L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2781-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13.Dockham P.A. Lee M.O.

The validity and high capacity of resistance conferred by hALDH-1 has been firmly established our companion report (28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in which we demonstrated that expression of transfected class 1 ALDH indeed confers high level OAP-specific resistance. The ability of the class 3 ALDH to confer OAP resistance has been less clear than that of the class 1 isozyme. Several studies indicated association of increased hALDH-3 expression with OAP resistance(3.Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2487-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4.Rekha G.K. Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem.

Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although most purified human class 3 ALDH isozymes have consistently exhibited low or absent activity for ALDO oxidation(3.Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2487-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4.Rekha G.K. Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem.

Cancer Lett. 1994; 76: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), evidence has been presented that class 3 ALDH purified from human tumor cells exhibited a measurable, albeit low ALDO oxidation activity(4.Rekha G.K. Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5.Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Adv. Exp. Med.

Since class 3 ALDH is expressed de novo in rat hepatoma cells(25.Lindahl R. Feinstein R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26.Lin K.H. Leach M.F. Winters A.L. Lindahl R. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1986; 22: 263-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is elevated in some human primary breast carcinoma samples (27.Sladek N. Sreerama L. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1995; 35: 325Google Scholar) and carcinoma cell lines2(4.Rekha G.K. Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the intriguing possibility exists that ALDH-3 expression may constitute a tumor-associated intrinsic resistance mechanism in a subset of malignancies. A limitation of the above-mentioned correlative studies is the use of drug selection to obtain OAP-resistant cell lines, an approach that can result in cells that differ from drug sensitive parental cells in other respects in addition to increased expression of class 3 ALDH. Similarly, while studies with inducers or inhibitors have shown a correlation between ALDH-3 expression and OAP-specific resistance, such agents are often pleiotropic and can affect the expression or efficacy of resistance mechanisms other than, or in addition to ALDH. With these considerations in mind, we have attempted to address the role of ALDH isozymes in OAP resistance by utilizing transfected cell lines that should differ only in the level of expression of ALDH isozymes. The control lines used included both the original parent cell lines and empty vector-transfected and hygromycin-selected clonal lines to be sure that selection for antibiotic resistance did not affect OAP sensitivity. The results of these studies clearly demonstrate that elevated expression of human or rat class 3 ALDH can confer relatively high-level OAP-specific resistance in V79 cells. The capacity of increased ALDH-3 activity to confer increasing levels of MAF resistance is limited, however, approaching an asymptotic limit with diminishing increments in resistance above approximately 2000 milliunits/mg activity. While the mechanism is not yet fully understood, reversal of resistance by the competitive inhibitor DEAB strongly suggests that catalysis of ALDO oxidation is the mechanism of resistance. The OAP specificity of human ALDH-3-mediated resistance and reversibility with ALDH inhibitors is consistent with results of analogous studies using high ALDH-3-expressing drug-selected (3.Sreerama L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23197-23203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cell lines, and those results also supported direct oxidation of ALDO as a likely mechanism of protection. Indeed, the specificity of class 3 ALDH-mediated resistance only for OAP analogs that can give rise to an aldehyde-containing intermediate has provided the best evidence to date that catalytic oxidation of ALDO to carboxyphosphamide is the most likely mechanism of resistance. The analysis by TLC of metabolites formed by hALDH-3 from activated labeled CPA has provided new and compelling evidence in support of direct catalysis of ALDO oxidation as the primary mechanism of OAP-specific resistance conferred by this isozyme. A metabolite corresponding to the expected Rf value for carboxyphosphamide (23.Hadidi A.-H. Idle J.R. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 427: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was detected in reaction mixtures that contained cytosols derived from either the class 1 or class 3 ALDH-expressing cells (but not with control cell cytosol). The relative amount of this metabolite produced by cytosol containing hALDH-3 was nearly half of that produced by cytosol containing hALDH-1, which is consistent with the higher level of resistance conferred by expression of transfected hALDH-1 (21-fold versus 12-fold for hALDH-3). Although the human cytosolic ALDH-3 appears to catalyze ALDO oxidation, it remains to be explained why the measured activity with this substrate was absent with enzyme preparations purified from human stomach(15.Sreerama L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16.Von E.U. Meier T.D. Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Cancer Lett. 1994; 76: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One possible reason for the lack of activity toward ALDO with purified stomach ALDH could be a selective modification during purification that abrogates hALDH-3 activity with ALDO but leaves intact activity with the standard assay substrate benzaldehyde. This could be due to chemical modification, conformational changes, or loss of activity modulators during purification. We have found that hALDH-3 activity is much more labile than hALDH-1 activity in crude cytosol, with most of the benzaldehyde/NADP+ activity lost within 10 min at 37°C (data not shown). A second potential reason for the poor ALDO activity with purified hALDH-3 may relate to the extreme sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by acrolein, a secondary product of the spontaneous β-elimination of PM from ALDO. The hALDH-3 isozyme may be relatively well protected in intact cells, where acrolein would likely react rapidly and nonspecifically with many competing nucleophiles such as glutathione and other non-protein or protein sulfhydryls. However, in a purified enzyme preparation the ALDH would be the sole target protein and hence would potentially be much more vulnerable to inhibition and/or covalent modification by acrolein. Consistent with this possibility, we have found that the human class 3 ALDH was also inherently severalfold more sensitive to acrolein inhibition than the human class 1 isoform, when measured with a constant amount of cytosolic protein in the assay mixture.2 The greater sensitivity of the hALDH-3 to inhibition by acrolein may also play a role in the nonlinear relationship between the degree of resistance and the level of expression of this isozyme. Whereas resistance increased linearly with hALDH-1 expression in transfected V79/SD1 cells(28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the relationship was asymptotic in cells expressing transfected hALDH-3, and thus indicates that some factor is limiting for protection by this isozyme. The greater sensitivity to acrolein inhibition is one possible reason, since this by-product would be present in increasing amounts at the higher IC90 concentrations of OAPs required to kill the higher expressing clones. Since glutathione is protective against acrolein, progressive depletion of this thiol pool at higher MAF concentrations might also result in a nonlinear resistance response by increasing the susceptibility of hALDH-3 to inhibition by acrolein. Another possible reason for the nonlinearity of resistance could relate to the sensitivity of hALDH-3 to inhibition by other OAP metabolites at high drug concentrations, including carboxyphosphamide, the product of ALDH oxidation of ALDO. We have shown that both the hALDH-1 (28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and hALDH-3 isoforms are potentially major determinants of cellular sensitivity to cyclophosphamide during chemotherapy treatment. The class 3 isoform represents a potentially tumor-specific target for adjuvant chemotherapy treatment due to its increased expression in certain types of neoplasia. However, targeting by the use of an inhibitor would need to be selective for class 3 and not class 1 ALDH, since the relatively modest marrow toxicity of CPA appears to be at least partly due to the high levels of hALDH-1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells. An alternative gene therapy approach, that would take advantage of the OAP resistance conferred by class 1 or class 3 ALDH expression, could be to use expression vectors to engender constitutive ALDH expression in marrow stem cells. While ALDH-1 activity normally decreases with differentiation, stable expression of high hALDH-1 activity could enhance the ability of cells to survive CPA chemotherapy throughout the hematopoietic cascade, rather than only in stem cells. Alternatively, the resistance could be augmented in both stem cells and their downstream progeny by transfection of class 3 ALDH, which is normally low in hematopoietic cells. The studies described in this report and in our companion study (28.Bunting K.D. Townsend A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11884-11890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) provide a rational basis for these strategies to take therapeutic advantage of the effect of ALDH expression on cellular sensitivity to oxazaphosphorine anticancer alkylating agents.

Ultraviolet irradiation promotes specific and efficient cross-linking of the RecA protein to poly(deoxythymidylic) acid. Cross-linked peptides remaining covalently attached to the polynucleotide following proteolytic digestion with trypsin correspond to amino acids 61-72, 178-183, and 233-243 of the RecA protein primary sequence. Their location and surface accessibility in the crystal structure, along with the behavior of various recA mutants, support the assignment of the cross-linked regions to the DNA binding site(s) of the RecA protein. Functional overlap of amino acids 61-72 with an element of the ATP binding site suggests a structural mechanism by which nucleotide cofactors allosterically affect the RecA nucleoprotein filament."

Consistent with the hypertrophic response is increased cellular content of β-myosin heavy chain and cytochrome oxidase subunit Va messages, as well as increases in cytochrome oxidase activity in the stimulated cardiac myocytes. Myocyte contractile capacity is associated with increased expression of the muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-I) isoform as measured by Northern analysis, immunoblotting, and altered sensitivity of CPT-I activity to malonyl-CoA in the stimulated cells. The data suggest that a switch from the liver isoform of CPT-I, prominent in the neonatal rat heart, to the muscle CPT-I which predominates in adult rat heart, takes place in the neonatal cardiac myocytes over the same time period as the hypertrophic-mediated changes in myofibrillar assembly and increased contractile activity.

Cardiac myocytes adapt to hemodynamic stress by compensatory hypertrophy which increases cell mass, but not cell number. As a result of increased energy demand due either to pathological or physiological sequellae, gene expression was altered, mediating the expression of the adaptive process. The signaling mechanisms by which the cardiac myocytes translate the increase in hemodynamic stress to activate intermediate early gene and contractile protein gene expression are not well understood, but may involve production of growth factors expressed not only by myocytes but also by non-myocytic cells in the intact heart. Demonstration that some of these growth factors, e.g. transforming growth factor-β, insulin-like growth factor, endothelin, and angiotensin, are present in cardiac myocytes (see (1.Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) for review) suggests that autocrine pathways may mediate, in part, the hypertrophic response. The ability of mechanical stimuli applied to cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes in the absence of serum to enhance c-fos expression (2.Komuro I. Kaida T. Shibazaki Y. Kurabayashi N. Katoh Y. Hoh E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that increases in contractile activity of the cardiac myocyte in culture may lead to the hypertrophic response by an autocrine pathway. Although the alterations in contractile protein content and expression and their role in ventricular remodelling have been extensively studied in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, the role of contractile stimulation of cardiac myocytes in the nuclear transcription of mitochondrial-specific proteins has not been described. It is reasonable to anticipate that alterations in energy supply and demand would require compensatory proliferation of mitochondrial proteins involved in energy transduction. Following electrical stimulation of primary ventricular myocytes in culture, increased myofibrillar content and organization is accompanied by increased expression of cardiac myosin light chain-2 and atrial natriuretic factor(4.McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.McDonough P.M. Stella S.L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, this valuable model has not been explored for effects of electrical stimulation on cardiac mitochondrial gene expression. Mitochondrial protein expression is known to increase in skeletal muscle with exercise training and chronic electrical stimulation of intact muscle (see (6.Booth F.W. Thomason D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 541-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) for review). In multicellular organisms, encoding of nuclear respiratory genes is under both developmental and metabolic control as demonstrated by coordinate expression of several proteins of the electron transport chain(7.Williams R.S. Garcia-Moll M. Mellor J. Salmons S. Harlan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2764-2767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, tissue specific isoforms representing different mechanisms of regulation or catalysis within an organ have been described for the adenine nucleotide translocase (8.Matsuda C. Endo H. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24950-24958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as for cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase subunits(9.Hennig B. Eur. J.

The level of mRNA encoding for these isoforms is likely growth-regulated as shown by stimulation of mRNA levels by the presence of serum and growth factors(11.Battini R. Ferrari S. Kaczmarek L. Calabretta B. Chen S. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An enzyme system crucial to the energy metabolism of the heart via oxidation of long-chain fatty acids is the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I) 1The abbreviations used are: CPT-Icarnitine palmitoyltransferase-Ibpbase pair(s). (12.Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13.Awan M.M. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, this protein exists in two isoforms recently described as the liver and muscle isoforms(14.Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins differ from each other in their affinities for both substrate and for the metabolic inhibitor, malonyl-CoA. The liver isoform contributes ∼25% to total CPT-I activity in the neonatal heart, this level then decreasing to comprise only 2-3% of CPT-I activity in the adult(15.Brown N.F. Weis B.C. Husti J.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8952-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, the growth related expression of mitochondrial protein and of the heart isoforms of CPT-I was investigated in this model of electrical stimulation where hypertrophic growth and maturation of the cardiac myocyte occur after prolonged increases in mechanical activity. carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I base pair(s). Neonatal (1-3 day old) cardiac myocytes were isolated and plated in 12-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% Hyclone calf serum at a plating density of 4 × 105 cells/21 cm, as described previously by this laboratory (16.McMillin J.B. Hudson E.K. Buja L.M. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 2: 301-309Google Scholar). After 24 h, the serum-containing medium was removed and the cells were washed and subsequently maintained for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of serum, containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). The medium was exchanged for fresh serum-free medium at 2 days. After four days in culture (24 h + serum, 72 h - serum), three wells containing myocytes were stimulated for 72 h using the method of Brevet et al.(17.Brevet A. Pinto E. Peacock J. Stockdale F.E. Science. 1976; 193: 1152-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as modified by McDonough and Glembotski (4.McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a GRASS stimulator, Ag:AgCl electrodes, and agarose gel cross-bridges that link the wells in parallel. Stimuli are 80 V with a pulse duration of 10 ms at a pacing frequency of 5 Hz. A cyclic polarity reversal, installed in the circuit by Dr. Craig Hartley, Baylor College of Medicine, reverses the output from the stimulator every 20 s. Three additional wells in the dish were maintained in the same medium as the stimulated cells, but in the absence of contractile stimulation. During the experimental period, the medium bathing the control and stimulated cells was changed after 48 h to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were cultured on laminin-coated (10 μg) glass coverslips inserted into the multiwell dishes. After 72 h electrical stimulation (80 V, 5 Hz), the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (Tousimis Research Corp., Rockville, MD), and stained for actin with BODIPY FL phallacidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The fluorescent images of the control and stimulated cells were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm with emission at 510 nm, using a Molecular Dynamics 2001 Scanning Laser Confocal microscope. The size of the cells was measured by planimetry of the two-dimensional images. Cells plated on laminin-coated glass coverslips were placed in the wells and cultured for 72 h under control and stimulating conditions. Contractility measurements were performed on the cells on coverslips in a Sykes-Moore chamber filled with 1 ml of medium, inserted into a heated microscope stage. A video edge detector system from Crystal Biotech (Boston, MA) was used to measure changes in contractile parameters. The cells were paced at 50 volts for 5 ms and 90 pulses/min. Raster lines were attached to cell edges (60 × lens) and the analogue motion signal was digitized and analyzed. Calcium content was measured on control and stimulated cells on laminin-coated glass coverslips following 72 h, as described above. The calcium-specific dye, Fluo-3 AM (2 ng/ml) (Molecular Probes, Inc.), which fluoresces only upon chelation of the dye with calcium, was used to monitor averaged cell calcium levels using the Molecular Dynamics 2001 Scanning Laser Confocal microscope with an argon ion laser set for excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm. Cardiac myocytes were cultured and stimulated as described above. After 72 h, the control and stimulated cells were stained with 1000 nM MitoTracker (Molecular Probes, Inc.) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide by incubation for 15 min under serum-free culture conditions. The loading solution was then replaced with fresh medium and cell fluorescence was visualized using the Molecular Dynamics 2001 Scanning Laser Confocal microscope with excitation set at 514 nm and emission at 535 nm. For comparison of relative fluorescent intensities in the cells, a three-dimensional “fishnet plot,” generated by the Molecular Dynamics Image Space software was employed. CPT-I and CPT-II activities were measured in the cardiac myocytes as described previously by this laboratory(16.McMillin J.B. Hudson E.K. Buja L.M. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 2: 301-309Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μM digitonin was used to permeabilize the cells for assay of CPT-I by incubating the cells for 10 min in 0.5 ml of a permeabilizing medium (“Medium J,” (18.Rogers T.B. Gaa S.T. Massey C. Dosemeci A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4302-4308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) containing digitonin, 40 mM Hepes, 140 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.566 mM CaCl2, 5 mM ATP, 6 μg/ml oligomycin, and 5 μM NaN3. Following permeabilization, fresh Medium J (0.5 ml) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) was added for assay of CPT-I. The CPT-I reaction was carried out for 20 min at 37° C in the presence of 30 μM palmitoyl-CoA and 0.4 mM [14C] -carnitine, specific activity = 2600 dpm/nmol. The sensitivity of CPT-I to inhibition by malonyl-CoA was determined after 3 min preincubation over a final concentration range of malonyl-CoA from 20 nM to 60 μM prior to initiation of the reaction by [14C]carnitine. The reaction was terminated with butanol-saturated 1 N HCl and the radioactive product extracted and washed as described previously (19.McMillin J.B. Wang D. Witters L.A. Buja L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CPT-II was measured by addition of Triton X-100 (0.1%) to the cells in Medium J, a condition which fully expresses CPT-II and inactivates CPT-I(16.McMillin J.B. Hudson E.K. Buja L.M. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 2: 301-309Google Scholar). The assay was then carried out as described for CPT-I except that no digitonin-permeabilization step was required. Cellular protein was measured by the Lowry method(20.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following permeabilization of the cardiac myocytes with 1% octyl glucoside, cytochrome oxidase activity was measured by following oxidation of reduced cytochrome c at 550 nm(21.Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernsteri L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). The [3H]etomoxir-labeled protein in mitochondria was reported to represent the malonyl-CoA sensitive catalytic subunit of CPT-I(22.Declercq P.E. Falck J.R. Kuwajima M. Tyminski H. Foster D.W.

Chem. 1987; 262: 9812-9821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the ∼80-kDa protein being characteristic of the muscle isoform present in cardiac and skeletal muscle(14.Weis B.C. Cowan A.T. Brown N. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26443-26448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies prepared to an etomoxir-labeled 79-kDa protein from rat heart was kindly provided by Dr. Loran Bieber, Michigan State University. Cellular protein was suspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mM EDTA) in the presence of protease inhibitors (40 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg each of leupeptin and aprotinin). The supernatant (100-150 μg of protein) was denatured in sample buffer and electrophoresed at 200 V on 10% polyacrylamide gels. After transfer onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane at 30 V overnight, the membrane-bound protein was incubated in blocking solution containing 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 250 mM NaCl), rinsed in TBS + 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated in 1:2500 dilution of CPT-I muscle isoform antibody with 1% non-fat dry milk overnight. After washing, the blot was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated peroxidase antibody (1:1500 in 1% non-fat dry milk) for 1 h. The membrane was again washed with TBS and developed using a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham, ECL blotting kit). Only one band at 79 kDa was observed(23.Kerner J. Zaluzec E. Gage D. Bieber L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8209-8219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequences of oligonucleotides used to generate the cDNA probes for this study were as follows.

DNA and protein homology searches were performed with BLAST, using GenEMBL and/or SWISS-PROT data bases. The probes for CPT-I, β-myosin, and cyclophilin were obtained using total RNA from neonatal liver (CPT-I liver isoform, 738 bp), neonatal skeletal muscle (CPT-I muscle isoform, 428 bp), and neonatal rat heart (β-myosin, 408 bp and cyclophilin, 402 bp) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCT-100™, Watertown, MA) and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction kit from Promega Corp. The cDNA probes were sequenced by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method and sequence analysis was performed using the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis package, version 7.2 (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The 650-bp cDNA fragment of cytochrome oxidase subunit Va was purified from the vector pOC 1318/Eco (provided by Dr. E. A. Schon, Columbia University) after digestion with EcoRI. 28 S rRNA cDNA was a gift from Dr. K. Chien. 18 S rRNA cDNA was provided by Dr. Sue-Hwa Lin (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center) and purchased from Ambion, Inc. The cDNA was purified from pT7 RNA 18 S using EcoRI and HindIII resulting in a 150-bp cDNA fragment for use with cyclophilin as internal standards of RNA loading. The cDNA probes were purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis where the uv detected bands were cut from the gels and isolated by electrical elution. The cDNA probes were labeled to high specific activity using random primer labeling (Promega Corp.). RNA was isolated from the cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and from various neonatal rat tissues by using the Ultraspec™ RNA isolation system (Biotex Laboratories, Houston, TX). Total RNA and RNA purity were quantitated spectrophotometrically using absorbance at 260 and 260/280 nm ratios. For Northern blotting, 10 μg of total cellular RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose containing 0.6% formaldehyde at 45 V for 3 h. Fractionated RNA was transferred to a Duralon-UV nylon membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by capillary action for 24 h. After blotting, the RNA was cross-linked to the filter by uv irradiation. Following prehybridization overnight at 42° C, the blot was hybridized in the same prehybridization solution containing 1% dextran sulfate as well as the labeled cDNA of choice. After washing, the blots were visualized by autoradiography following storage at −70° C for 24-72 h. The significance of the changes reported was determined using Student's t test for paired and non-paired variates. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. To confirm the hypertrophic effects of electrical stimulation, cardiac myocytes were stained with the immunofluorescent probe, BODIPY phallacidin (data not shown). Dramatic differences between the control and the stimulated myocytes were seen, not only in cell size, as described previously(4.McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also in the organization of actin from punctate cores of actin characteristic of the immature cardiac myocyte (29.Hilenski L.L. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 264: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) into striated arrays of well organized myofilaments. The effects of electrical stimulation were assessed using planimetry, for changes in cell area, and for cellular protein and RNA content. Cell size increases almost 4-fold, from 253 ± 45 μm2 to 970 ± 88.5 μm2 (p < 0.005). The alteration in size was accompanied by significant increases in both protein (124 ± 3.2 to 162 μg ± 7.4/4 × 105 cells, p < 0.01) and RNA content (1.57 ± 0.2 to 2.5 μg ± 0.8/4 × 105 cells, p < 0.01) in the control versus stimulated cells, respectively. The increases observed were consistent with the magnitude of changes observed in other models of neonatal cardiac myocyte hypertrophy(30.Simpson P. J. Clin.

With pacing, the contractility parameters of the control cells were significantly depressed when compared to cells which were exposed to 72 h of electrical stimulation. In the stimulated myocytes, time to peak contraction was abbreviated to 32.3 ± 9% of control values and percent shortening was dramatically increased by 7.85-fold from 6.6 ± 1 to 52.2 ± 2.7% (p < 0.01) in the stimulated cells. The peak calcium fluorescent intensities also increase in parallel with the enhancement in cellular contractility from relative peak fluorescence intensities of 42.6 ± 5.8 to 87.8 ± 9.3 in the stimulated cells. Subsequent studies were designed to monitor the effect of the hypertrophic response, and accompanying increases in contractile function, on the cellular capacity for oxidative metabolism and energy production. Mitotracker labels mitochondria within living cells where it was oxidized as a fluorescent product(31.Whitaker J.E. Moore P.L. Haugland R.P. Haugland R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A perinuclear distribution of fluorescence was easily discerned in the control myocyte and the relative fluorescent intensity of the dye was displayed in the “fishnet” plot (Fig. 1A). There was a dramatic increase in both mitochondrial content and fluorescent intensity in the cells which were electrically stimulated for 72 h (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the increased mitochondrial content in the stimulated cells was a 1.7-fold increase in cytochrome oxidase activity (Fig. 2). This increase in cytochrome oxidase activity was accompanied by a 2.38-fold (densitometry units) increase in cytochrome oxidase (subunit Va) mRNA content in the stimulated cells (Fig. 3). The level of β-myosin heavy chain mRNA was also significantly elevated after 72 h of stimulation (Fig. 3). The re-expression of embryonic contractile protein isoforms was characteristic of the hypertrophic growth response in neonatal cardiac myocytes(32.Waspe L.E. Ordahl C.P. Simpson P.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Figure 3:Increased content of β-myosin heavy chain and cytochrome oxidase (subunit Va) mRNA in control and stimulated neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture. Following stabilization of the cells in serum-free medium, control and stimulated cells were maintained in culture for an additional 72 h. Northern blot hybridization was carried out using the cDNA probes described under “Experimental Procedures” for β-myosin, cytochrome oxidase, subunit Va, and cyclophilin. The hybridization signals for β-myosin heavy chain and for cytochrome oxidase are shown in the top two panels of total RNA from control (C) and stimulated (S) neonatal cardiac myocytes. The lower panels are the hybridization signals obtained from cyclophilin, 28 and 18 S RNA, used as internal standards for RNA loading. The Northern blot shown is representative of blots obtained with RNA preparations from four different cell cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tissue-specific isoforms of mitochondrial proteins provide regulatory and/or catalytic properties which were uniquely responsive to metabolic signaling pathways of the organ. The heart contains two CPT-I isoforms, the liver isoform which decreases and the muscle isoform which increases in content with cardiac development(15.Brown N.F. Weis B.C. Husti J.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8952-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To confirm the presence of message for these two proteins in the neonatal heart cells, Northern blots of the total RNA extracted from liver, heart, and muscle were probed with the cDNA sequences for the liver and skeletal muscle CPT-I isoforms. Liver CPT-I cDNA hybridizes with liver and neonatal heart RNA, but no signal was obtained from muscle total RNA (Fig. 4). Conversely, the cDNA probe for the muscle CPT-I hybridizes with RNA from heart and muscle, but not with liver RNA (Fig. 4). After 72 h of stimulation, the mRNA content of the liver isoform appears to decrease in the cardiac myocytes, whereas the mRNA content of the muscle isoform was increased in the stimulated cells (Fig. 4). The relative intensity of the signals from the control and stimulated cells was quantitated by densitometry. The mRNA content for the CPT-I liver isoform in the stimulated myocytes was approximately half the content that was present in the control cells (Fig. 5). Conversely, the mRNA for the muscle isoform increases 2.5-fold in the stimulated cells when compared to control (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Content of liver and muscle CPT-I mRNA in control and stimulated myocytes. The Northern blot data from the experiments described in the legend to Fig. 4 were scanned using densitometry (Imagemaster, Pharmacia) to quantitate the differences in levels of mRNA in the control and stimulated neonatal cardiac myocytes. The autoradiograph scans were normalized for exposure time (n = 5) where: ∗, p < 0.01 and∗∗, p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether there was increased expression of the muscle CPT-I protein, immunoblotting of the control and stimulated cell lysates was carried out using the antibody against the etomoxir-binding protein from rat heart. A 2.8-fold increase, determined by densitometric scanning, in the amount of immunoreactivity representing the predominant cardiac CPT-I isoform was detected in the stimulated myocytes (Fig. 6). This increase in the lower molecular weight isoform of CPT-I, which has been identified as the muscle isoform (33.Weiss B.C. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18712-18715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was accompanied by a 3-fold increase in CPT-I activity in the stimulated cells (Fig. 6). The CPT-I activity in the control and in the stimulated cells display differing affinities of the enzyme for its inhibitor, malonyl-CoA. The serum-deprived control cells display a lower CPT-I activity and an IC50 for malonyl-CoA which was in the range observed for the liver isoform of CPT-I, i.e. low μM (Fig. 7). The stimulated cells have a prominent high affinity inhibitory response to malonyl-CoA with an I50 of approximately 90 nM which resembles the sensitivity of the adult cardiac muscle with its predominant muscle CPT-I isoform(14.Weis B.C.

CPT-I activities were measured in digitonin-permeabilized cells from control and electrically stimulated cell cultures maintained in the absence of serum for 72 h following stabilization in serum-free medium. CPT-I activity in the electrically stimulated cells was measured in the absence and presence of a range of malonyl-CoA concentrations (• = mean ± S.E., n = five separate cultures). The I50 value was determined after subtracting out the contribution of the low affinity component.

Ferrari S. Kaczmarek L. Calabretta B. Chen S. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), similar to other growth-regulated genes, e.g. c-fos and c-myc(34.Kelly K. Cochran B.H. Stiles C.D. Leder P. Cell. 1983; 35: 603-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 35.Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1994; 311: 433-438Crossref Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). The adenine nucleotide translocase mRNA appears to increase in direct response to a growth factor signal(11.Battini R. Ferrari S. Kaczmarek L. Calabretta B. Chen S. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This response of mitochondrial proteins to serum was consistent with the increased energy demands of proliferating cells (11.Battini R. Ferrari S. Kaczmarek L. Calabretta B. Chen S. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear promoter sequences as well as the cognate nuclear factors for these sequences have been characterized for cytochrome c by Evans and Scarpulla(36.Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological affector molecules which interact with the promoter elements were potentially important to the modulation of respiratory gene expression as energy demands of the cell were changed. This is the first report that documents mitochondrial proliferation in response to contractile stimulation in the absence of exogenous growth factors as evidenced by the higher levels of cytochrome oxidase mRNA and enzyme activity as well as the increased numbers of mitochondria observed microscopically in the stimulated cells. In addition, the effects of contractile stimulation on expression of the muscle-specific isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I in the cultured cardiac myocytes is the first model system where a tissue-specific production of a mitochondrial protein can been “switched on” in the absence of serum factors. A change in the expression of CPT-I isoforms has been documented in the developing rat heart where liver CPT-I was reported to contribute ∼25% to total cardiac CPT-I activity at birth(15.Brown N.F. Weis B.C. Husti J.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8952-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This value declines to 2-3% as the rat pups mature to adulthood(15.Brown N.F. Weis B.C. Husti J.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8952-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recently, a cDNA clone encoding the muscle isoform of heart CPT-I has been identified as distinct from the liver CPT-I cDNA sequence (25.Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and expressed(26.Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), thus providing the molecular basis for the biochemical findings. Confirmation that both the liver and the muscle isoforms for CPT-I may be present to varying degrees in the neonatal heart myocyte cultures suggests that both proteins are important to cardiac development and to the energy metabolism of the contracting heart. The physiological importance of early expression of the liver CPT-I may relate to its low Km (30 μM) for carnitine, in keeping with the low cardiac carnitine content at birth (15.Brown N.F. Weis B.C. Husti J.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8952-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the serum-free cell cultures, we have evidence suggesting that the predominant CPT mRNA expressed is the liver isoform, implying that serum withdrawal leads to a less active contractile state in which muscle-specific gene expression is diminished. In response to contractile stimulation and activation of transcription of the muscle CPT-I isoform, an increase in CPT-I activity is observed, as well as an increase in the amount of immunoreactive 79-kDa protein which corresponds to the dominant adult rat cardiac etomoxir-binding protein (muscle CPT-I). Enhanced expression of this protein in the stimulated cells was further supported by a dramatic alteration in the high affinity binding properties for malonyl-CoA, with an approximate 40-fold decrease in the I50 for malonyl-CoA after 72 h of electrical stimulation. A double reciprocal plot of CPT-I activity versus carnitine concentration was also carried out (data not presented). Whereas the stimulated cells demonstrated a single slope with high activity and a Km which was consistent with cardiac CPT-I activity, the control myocytes exhibit kinetic behavior consistent with the presence of two different isoforms, i.e. two distinct linear regions with differing affinities for carnitine. These results were consistent with the presence of both isoforms of CPT-I in the cardiac myocyte, with the liver isoform being in high enough concentration in the control neonatal cells to contribute significantly to the velocities measured. Tissue-specific isoforms have been described for other mitochondrial proteins including cytochrome c(9.Hennig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 167-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the γ subunit isoform of mitochondrial ATP synthase(37.Matsuda C. Endo H. Hirata H. Morosawa H. Nakanishi M. Kagawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), as well as the adenine nucleotide translocase(38.Houldsworth J. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It might be anticipated that the kinetic properties and metabolic regulation of the isoforms should reflect the physiological demands of that tissue as has been reported for mitochondrial ATP synthase(39.Matsuda C. Muneyuki E. Eudo H. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The predominance of the high Km muscle isoform for CPT-I in skeletal muscle and heart probably reflects the higher carnitine concentrations endogenous to these organs(40.McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes/Metabolism Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Still unresolved, however, is the adaptation required by the heart that results in such a profound difference in the I50 values for malonyl-CoA. Since measured malonyl-CoA concentrations in heart may exceed the I50 values for malonyl-CoA in that tissue by as much as 1000-fold, investigators have hypothesized that the majority of the malonyl-CoA in heart was compartmentalized away from the inhibitory site for malonyl-CoA on the outer mitochondrial membrane(40.McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes/Metabolism Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that the presence of the liver isoform in heart may have a role in facilitating basal rates of fatty acid oxidation when malonyl-CoA was in an inhibitory range for the muscle isoform(15.Brown N.F. Weis B.C. Husti J.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8952-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Unlike the liver CPT-I, the activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the muscle (cardiac) isoform was not influenced by diabetes and starvation, conditions which alter the sensitivity of the liver CPT-I for its inhibitor(41.Cook G.A. Gamble M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2050-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms which act to regulate the expression of nuclear genes during mitochondrial proliferation with subsequent differentiation to reflect tissue-specific expression include transcription, message stabilization, and activation of translation rates(42.Izquierdo J.M. Ricart J. Ostronoff L.K. Egea G. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10342-10350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The two mRNAs which encode the muscle and liver CPT-I isoforms may be the product of different genes, as has been suggested for the adenine nucleotide translocase(38.Houldsworth J. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This possibility was strengthened by the observations that the liver and muscle CPT-I proteins were immunologically distinct (43.Kolodziej M.P. Crilly P.J. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that there is tissue specificity exhibited by the two cDNA probes(25.Yamazaki N. Shinohara Y. Shima A. Terada H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the liver and muscle CPT-I proteins may be products of the same gene by either different transcriptional or post-transcriptional processing. It is possible that the nuclear encoded CPT-I muscle isoform, like the subunit Va of cytochrome oxidase, responds directly to electrical stimulation as a consequence of growth factor activation of cardiac myocyte calcium channels (44.Merle P-L. Feige J-J. Verdette J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17361-17367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or to other endogenous intracellular signals which promote cell growth in the absence of serum. In this regard, we have reported a potent mitogenic effect of insulin growth factor-1 (10 ng/ml) on CPT-I and CPT-II expression in the neonatal cardiac myocytes in the absence of serum(45.Hudson, E. K., Wang, D., Bieber, L. L., Buja, L. M., McMillin, J. B. (1996) Am. J. Physiol. (Heart and Circulatory), in pressGoogle Scholar). Significantly, transient expression of insulin growth factor-1 occurred and increased insulin growth factor-1 mRNA levels were seen with pressure overload hypertrophy(46.Donohue T.J. Dworkin L.D. Lango M.N. Fliegner K. Lango R.P. Benstein J.A. Slater W.R. Catanese V.M. Circulation. 1994; 89: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, the model of electrical stimulation provides an excellent tool to assess the role of mitochondrial proteins and the energy-producing mechanisms of the cell in the development of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and in the physiological adaptation to increased energy demands as part of the mitogenic response. The role of c-fos oncogene expression in the mediation of this pathway during electrical stimulation is currently under investigation.

The MAP kinases, on the other hand, are pleiotropic, phosphorylating many substrates throughout the cell (reviewed in (3.Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Kinase cascades containing a MEK and an ERK/MAP kinase are present in multiple pathways in yeast and have been reiterated in mammalian cells(1.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E. J. Biol.

Because of their exquisite specificity, MEK1 and MEK2 are not able to phosphorylate other MAP kinase-related enzymes such as Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) or p38 MAP kinase, even though the phosphorylation sites are in comparable positions in the sequence(1.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the protein kinase ERK3. It was cloned in the same cDNA library screen as ERK1 and ERK2 (16.Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar) and has greater sequence identity to ERK1 and ERK2 than do the JNK/SAPKs or p38 MAP kinase. However, three important features distinguish ERK3 from the other family members. First, it lacks the tyrosine phosphorylation site that is absolutely conserved among those other related kinases. Second, ERK3 is a constitutively nuclear protein kinase(17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Third, it apparently has a very restricted substrate specificity, because it does not phosphorylate any of the known MAP kinase substrates. As no ERK3 substrates are known, its regulation has been difficult to define. To understand more about the regulation of ERK3, we have examined the phosphorylation of ERK3 by MEK family members, and find that ERK3 is a poor substrate for MEK1, MEK2, MKK4, and MEK5(18.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have identified a novel protein kinase activity in nuclear and cytosolic extracts that binds very tightly to the catalytic domain of ERK3 and phosphorylates it selectively. This ERK3 kinase phosphorylates a single site on ERK3, Ser189, which is comparable to Thr183, one of the activating phosphorylation sites of ERK2.

T183S ERK2 and the double mutant T183S,Y185G ERK2 were constructed using methods described earlier(15.Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant Y185G ERK2 was made using the Chameleon double-stranded DNA mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Extracts from rabbit muscle and from NGF-stimulated PC12 cells were prepared according to the method of Seger et al.(14.Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14373-14381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for analysis of ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylating activities. PC12 cells and 293 cells were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions as described by Dignam et al.(19.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with modifications described previously(17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ERK3 was highly enriched in the nuclear fraction. Extracts were fractionated by chromatography on Q Sepharose, S Sepharose, Mono Q, or Mono S. Protein kinase activities in fractions eluted with a 0-0.4 M NaCl gradient in MEK purification buffer (14.Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

For affinity chromatography, GST-ERK3 or GST-ERK3ΔCt bound to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with either crude cell extracts or fractions of the ERK3 kinase, partially purified from rabbit muscle or NGF-treated PC12 cells, for 2 h at 4°C with shaking. The glutathione-agarose beads were washed 5 × with 1 ml of 1 M NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA and once with 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0. The ability of bound kinase to phosphorylate ERK3 was measured by in vitro phosphorylation assays (see below). In vitro protein kinase assays were performed in 30 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 μM ATP ([γ-32P]ATP to achieve 5-15 cpm/fmol), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml ERK3, ERK2, or mutants, and the ERK3 kinase at 30°C for 30-60 min. Reactions were stopped with 5 × electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography(20.Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). MEK1 and MEK2 immunoprecipitated from NGF-stimulated PC12 cells were assayed as described elsewhere(21.Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6808-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The ERK3 kinase adsorbed to GST-ERK3ΔCt on glutathione agarose beads was washed once with 1 ml of phosphatase assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM dithiothreitol). Aliquots of beads were then mixed with 2.5 or 5 μg/ml of PP2A in phosphatase assay buffer either without or with okadaic acid (5 μM, Moana Bioproducts) at room temperature with shaking for 45 min. The reactions were stopped with 10 mM sodium phosphate and 5 μM okadaic acid and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The ERK3 kinase activity on the beads was measured as described above. Antibodies to ERK3 and isoform selective antibodies recognizing MEK1 and MEK2 were reported previously (17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21.Xu S. Robbins D. Frost J. Dang A. Lange-Carter C. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 1992; 3: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of PP2A was purified from bovine heart(23.Mumby M.C. Green D.D. Russell K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13763-13770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C was partially purified from rat brain as described previously (24.Kikkawa U. Minakuchi R. Takai Y. Nishizuka Y. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) which yields a mixture of isoforms. Recombinant protein kinase Cα purified from Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus was kindly provided by B. Singer (University of Texas Southwestern). Rabbit muscle extracts, a source of activated MEK1 and MEK2 (25.Wu J. Michel H. Rossomando A. Haystead T. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Sturgill T.W. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were fractionated on Q Sepharose and the resulting fractions were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate ERK3 and ERK2 (Fig. 1A). The predominant peak of kinase activity phosphorylating ERK3 was found in fractions 42-52, and lacked activity toward ERK2. An activity with similar specificity and chromatographic behavior was also detected in Mono Q fractions 12-17 from extracts of NGF-stimulated PC12 cells (Fig. 1B). Q Sepharose fractions 47-53 containing ERK3 phosphorylating activity from rabbit muscle extracts, referred to hereafter as the ERK3 kinase, were pooled and the kinase was further purified on Mono S (Fig. 1C). A single peak of activity was detected. Q Sepharose fractions 20-42, which contained the major peak of activity phosphorylating ERK2 from rabbit muscle extracts, also displayed a small amount of activity toward ERK3. Other studies indicated that MEK1 and MEK2 were both contained in the major peak of activity phosphorylating ERK2 (26.Wu J. Harrison J.K. Dent P. Lynch K.R. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4539-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 2S. Xu, A. Dang, S. Witt, E. Zhen, and M. H. Cobb, manuscript in preparation. However, these enzymes contributed little of the ERK3 phosphorylating activity because MEK1 and MEK2 immunoprecipitated from extracts of NGF-stimulated PC12 cells phosphorylated ERK2 but not ERK3 (data not shown). The activities in Q Sepharose fractions 32-40 from rabbit muscle extracts that phosphorylated ERK3 were not further characterized, but may have been due to protein kinase C, because protein kinase C eluted in this region of the gradient and was found to phosphorylate ERK3 in vitro (data not shown). The ERK3 kinase could be distinguished from other protein kinases based on its tight binding to the catalytic domain of ERK3 (Fig. 2A). GST-ERK3 or GST-ERK3ΔCt bound to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with the ERK3 kinase activity from rabbit muscle that had first been partially purified on Q Sepharose and S Sepharose. The bound protein kinase activity was measured by its ability to phosphorylate GST-ERK3 or GST-ERK3ΔCt on the beads (Fig. 2A). The ERK3 kinase activity was not eluted with concentrations of NaCl up to 1 M, with 1% Triton X-100 or with 1 M MgCl2. The ERK3 kinase did not bind to GST-ERK2. The tight association of the ERK3 kinase with ERK3 has a parallel in the binding of JNK/SAPK to c-Jun. The binding requires only the kinase domain of ERK3 as deleting the C-terminal domain did not eliminate binding to the ERK3 kinase. Because protein kinase C was able to phosphorylate ERK3 in vitro, we tested its capacity to bind to GST-ERK3. Neither rat brain protein kinase C nor recombinant protein kinase Cα bound to GST-ERK3 (data not shown), indicating that protein kinase C is not the ERK3 kinase. Because it was difficult to elute the ERK3 kinase from the GST-ERK3 on glutathione-agarose beads, we ascertained if the activity that was bound to GST-ERK3 on beads would phosphorylate exogenously added ERK3. As shown in Fig. 2B, the ERK3 kinase bound to GST-ERK3ΔCt on beads phosphorylated not only bound GST-ERK3ΔCt but also added His10-ERK3ΔCt, which is different in size from GST-ERK3ΔCt. It seemed unlikely that the ERK3 kinase was ERK3 itself because ERK3 autophosphorylation is intramolecular not intermolecular (17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, it was possible that the protein bound to ERK3 was not an ERK3 kinase but an activator that accelerated ERK3 autophosphorylation. To demonstrate that the ERK3 kinase was not ERK3 or an activator of ERK3 autophosphorylation, a catalytically defective mutant, D171A ERK3, that neither autophosphorylates nor is phosphorylated by wild type ERK3 in vitro(17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was tested as a substrate for the ERK3 kinase. The ERK3 kinase bound tightly to GST-D171A ERK3ΔCt and it phosphorylated GST-D171A ERK3ΔCt or added His10-D171A ERK3ΔCt as well as the wild type protein (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that the protein bound to GST-ERK3 is an ERK3 protein kinase. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the ERK3 kinase phosphorylated ERK3 on serine (Fig. 2C). Because ERK3 is primarily in the nucleus(17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the subcellular distribution of the ERK3 kinase was examined. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts from multiple cell types were tested for the ERK3 kinase activity by binding to GST-ERK3ΔCt on beads and assay of the bound material by phosphorylation of GST-ERK3ΔCt. Activity that bound tightly to ERK3ΔCt and phosphorylated it was found in both cytosolic and nuclear extracts of PC12 and 293 cells (Fig. 3), and in extracts of other cell lines such as NIH3T3, Cos, and Jurkat T cells (data not shown). The distribution of the activity between cytosolic and nuclear fractions was not changed by extracellular stimuli including epidermal growth factor, NGF, or phorbol ester. These agents activate ERK1 and ERK2 and cause their translocation to the nucleus (27.Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but may not be physiological regulators of ERK3. To test the possibility that the ERK3 kinase, like MEK1 and MEK2, is regulated by phosphorylation, its activity was measured before and after treatment with PP2A. The initial rate of ERK3 phosphorylation by the ERK3 kinase was reduced 85-90% by a 45-min treatment with PP2A (Fig. 4). Preincubation of PP2A with okadaic acid blocked the inactivation of the ERK3 kinase, demonstrating that loss of activity is due to dephosphorylation of the ERK3 kinase preparation. We determined previously that ERK3 autophosphorylated in vitro and was phosphorylated in intact cells on Ser189(17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the residue comparable to Thr183, one of the two activating phosphorylation sites in ERK2 (Fig. 5A). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of ERK3 by the ERK3 kinase was 0.7 mol phosphate/mol ERK3, consistent with a single site of phosphorylation. In comparison, incorporation due to autophosphorylation was never greater than 0.04 mol of phosphate/mol of ERK3 even after overnight incubation. To determine if Ser189 was the site phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase, this residue was mutated to alanine (S189A ERK3) or glutamic acid (S189E ERK3) (Fig. 5A). The ERK3 kinase bound to GST-S189A ERK3 and GST-S189E ERK3 on beads as determined by its ability to phosphorylate added His10-ERK3ΔCt (data not shown). However, it no longer phosphorylated GST-S189A ERK3 or GST-S189E ERK3 to which it was bound (Fig. 5, B and C). The ERK3 kinase also did not phosphorylate added His10-S189A or S189E ERK3ΔCt (data not shown). These data support the conclusion that Ser189 is the site phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase. To confirm that the ERK3 kinase phosphorylated the same site on ERK3 that was phosphorylated in intact cells, tryptic phosphopeptide maps of ERK3 and ERK3ΔCt phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase were compared to a map of ERK3 phosphorylated in intact cells. Each map revealed a major phosphopeptide (Fig. 6A-C) that migrated as a single spot if tryptic phosphopeptides from ERK3 phosphorylated in vitro were mixed with those from ERK3 phosphorylated in intact cells (Fig. 6D). This major phosphopeptide was absent from S189A ERK3 phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase (Fig. 6E). The incorporation into S189A ERK3 was about 1-2% of that incorporated into wild type ERK3. The addition of tryptic phosphopeptides from phosphorylated wild type ERK3 to those from phosphorylated S189A ERK3 restored the major phosphopeptide (Fig. 6F). These data indicate that Ser189 of ERK3, the site phosphorylated in intact cells, is the major site phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase.Figure 6:Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of phosphorylated ERK3.

Equal counts/min were loaded onto each plate for mapping.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The specificity of the ERK3 kinase was characterized. For these experiments, the ERK3 kinase was partially purified from rabbit muscle and then affinity purified on GST-ERK3ΔCt bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Similar results were obtained with the ERK3 kinase prior to binding to GST-ERK3ΔCt on beads. His10-ERK3ΔCt was phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase but less efficiently than bound GST-ERK3ΔCt (Fig. 7A). In ERK2, Thr183 and Tyr185 are the activating phosphorylation sites. These residues were interchanged with Ser189 and Gly191, the comparable residues in ERK3. The double mutant His10-S189T, G191Y ERK3ΔCt was phosphorylated by the ERK3 kinase primarily on threonine and to a lesser extent on serine but not on tyrosine (Fig. 7, A and B). Thus, unlike MEK1 and MEK2, the ERK3 kinase did not phosphorylate tyrosine in the phosphorylation lip at a position equivalent to Tyr185 of ERK2. Further, the ERK3 kinase did not phosphorylate His6-K52R ERK2 or the ERK3-like mutants T183S ERK2, Y185G ERK2, and T183S,Y185G ERK2 (Fig. 7A). A concept that has developed from studies in yeast and mammalian cells is that of the MAP kinase module(1.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 9.Levin D.E. Errede B. J. NIH Res. 1993; 5: 49-52Google Scholar, 28.Neiman A.M. Stevenson B.J.

Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). A MAP kinase module is a three-kinase cascade including a MAP kinase or ERK, a MEK, and an activator of MEK, MEK kinase or MEKK. Thus far, studies indicate that the MEK component has the greatest substrate specificity of enzymes in the cascade(1.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 14.Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The known MEK family members selectively activate their designated MAP kinase family members, by phosphorylating a threonine and a tyrosine that are arranged with a single intervening residue. The three-dimensional structure of the MAP kinase ERK2 contains the two-domain organization characteristeric of the protein kinases(11.Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 30.Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

The active site is formed at the interface of these two domains. The two regulatory phosphorylation sites in ERK2, Tyr185 and Thr183, are in a surface loop known as the phosphorylation lip, that lies at the mouth of the active site. The phosphorylation lip is an important but highly variable regulatory element of the protein kinase family. Structural and biochemical studies indicate that mutation of Tyr185 in ERK2 changes the conformation of the phosphorylation lip and dramatically decreases ERK2 activity(33.Zhang J. Zhang F. Ebert D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 299-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); thus Tyr185 is essential for correct folding of this lip in both low and high activity forms. In ERK2, Tyr185 faces the active site and can be partially autophosphorylated. Unlike any other ERK/MAP kinase homologs, ERK3 lacks this tyrosine residue, in spite of the significant similarities of the ERK3 phosphorylation lip in sequence and length to the phosphorylation lip of ERK2. A single residue, Ser189 comparable to Thr183 of ERK2, is phosphorylated on ERK3 in intact cells(17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The essential nature of Tyr185 in ERK2 indicates that major differences in folding of the lip may occur in ERK2 and ERK3. Replacement of Gly191 of ERK3 with tyrosine changes the autophosphorylated residue from serine to tyrosine(17.Cheng M. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8951-8958.Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This suggests that tyrosine may also face the active site in this ERK3 mutant. This mutant is a poor MEK substrate, however, suggesting that portions of the protein that lie outside of the phosphorylation lip are important determinants of MEK-ERK recognition. A protein kinase that phosphorylates ERK3 and may serve as an activator or MEK for ERK3 has been partially purified and is characterized by its ability to bind to the catalytic domain of ERK3. The ERK3 kinase is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of several cell types, unlike MEK1 and MEK2 which are reported to be exclusively in the cytoplasm (34.Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like known MEKs, this ERK3 kinase is inactivated by dephosphorylation and is highly specific as demonstrated by its inability to phosphorylate ERK1, ERK2, or ERK2 mutants that more closely resemble ERK3 in the phosphorylation lip. Unlike known MEKs, the ERK3 kinase will not phosphorylate tyrosine when tyrosine is introduced into the appropriate position of the phosphorylation lip of ERK3. Importantly, this ERK3 kinase phosphorylates Ser189 of ERK3, the site phosphorylated in intact cells. Thus, the ERK3 kinase identified here may be the upstream regulator of ERK3. From a primarily cytosolic location when inactive, ERK1 and ERK2 are translocated in part to the nucleus upon activation, while the activating MEKs are believed to remain cytosolic(27.Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, ERK3 is found primarily in the nucleus and the ERK3 kinase is present in both cytosolic and nuclear extracts. This suggests a regulatory mechanism in which the ERK3 kinase may receive signals from membrane bound or cytoplasmic cues and shuttle into the nucleus to phosphorylate ERK3 (Fig. 8). We thank David Robbins (University of California, San Francisco) for his input during the early stages of this work, Clark Garcia and Peiqun Wu for preparation of some of the bacterial proteins and cell extracts, Alphonsus Dang for MEK1 and MEK2 immunoprecipitation, and Jo Hicks for preparation of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2005074871,"A concerted translational control is responsible for maintaining an iron level in the cytosol that is both adequate for the synthesis of iron-containing proteins and does not represent a danger to the cell. However, little is known about how iron level is controlled in the nucleus. Nuclei of rat liver take up iron from ferric citrate by a process that is dependent on ATP. This system shares several properties with known P-type ATPases, suggesting that a P-type ATPase in the nuclear membrane is responsible for iron transport. (i) Adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminodiphosphate), a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, does not support iron uptake; (ii) the uptake is strongly inhibited by vanadate; (iii) there is an absolute requirement for Mg2+; and (iv) reagents that oxidize SH groups inhibit uptake, and this inhibition can be prevented by dithiothreitol. The energy of activation for the uptake (11.5 kcal/mol) and the Km for ATP (0.4 mM) are similar to values for other known cation transport ATPases. Inhibitors of Na+,K+-ATPase, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, proton V-ATPase, and nuclear Ca2+-ATPase have no effect on uptake. Ferric citrate can be replaced by Fe-ATP as a source of iron for the transport system; however, two other stronger iron chelators, Tiron and desferrioxamine, completely inhibit the uptake.

Because iron ions are efficient generators of high reactivity oxygen radicals, a balanced cellular control should exist between iron uptake and iron storage in ferritin, a non-reactive iron complex (1O'Connell M. Halliwell B. Moorhouse C.P. Aruoma O.I. Baum H. Peters T.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This enables the cell to maintain a pool of free iron adequate for the synthesis of iron-containing proteins but low enough not to cause cell damage. The orchestrated actions that the cells use to achieve this balance in the cytosol have been recently uncovered (2Kuhn L.C. Hirling H. Henderson B. Emery-Goodman A. Neupert B. Kaldy P. Hershko C.E.

However, a nuclear membrane Ca2+-ATPase, responsible for calcium transport into the nucleus, has recently been found in rat liver (11Nicotera P. McConkey D.J. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 12Bachs O. Agell N. Carafoli E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1113: 259-270Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the possible existence of a process of ATP-driven iron transport into the nucleus. Nuclei were isolated as described previously (11Nicotera P. McConkey D.J. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), except for some minor modifications. Male Wistar albino rats (200-300 g, fed ad libitum) were killed by brain concussion. The liver was cannulated and perfused in situ with 50 ml of deionized ice-cold water to remove blood. The liver was removed, cut into small pieces, and homogenized with a Potter homogenizer (15 strokes) in 40 ml of ice-cold TKM solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2). The homogenate was filtered through three layers of cheesecloth, and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min. The pellets were homogenized (9 strokes) in 40 ml of the TKM solution supplemented with 0.25 M sucrose and centrifuged again at 700 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 24 ml of the same solution by homogenization (5 strokes), and 6 ml of the resulting suspension were added to each of four tubes containing 12 ml of TKM solution supplemented with 2.3 M sucrose. The tubes were gently mixed, and a 6-ml cushion (TKM containing 2.3 M sucrose) was carefully layered in the bottom of each tube. The tubes were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 40 min. The upper layer and the sucrose cushion were removed with an aspirator. The resulting pellet (nuclei) was resuspended in TKM containing 0.25 M sucrose and sedimented at 700 × g for 10 min. The pellet of nuclei was resuspended in HKM solution (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 125 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2) and centrifuged again at 700 × g for 10 min. The purified nuclei were gently resuspended in HKM. All steps were performed at 0-4°C. Contamination of the nuclear fraction by plasma membrane fragments was <1%, by microsomes was <2%, and by mitochondria was <2%, as measured by assaying the activities of 5′-nucleotidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and succinate-cytochrome c reductase, respectively. Isolated nuclei (1800 µg of DNA or 3 × 108 nuclei) were incubated in 1 ml of HKM containing 630 µM55Fe-citrate (Amersham Corp., 3 × 10−5 Ci/ml, 4.7 Ci/mmol) at the indicated temperatures and with the indicated additions. At predetermined times, aliquots of 100 µl were withdrawn, diluted to 1 ml with HKM, and centrifuged at 13,600 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge (model 5402) for 3 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of medium and centrifuged again at 13,600 × g for 3 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of 1 M perchloric acid and incubated at 80°C for 30 min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 13,600 × g for 3 min. The supernatant (40 µl) was withdrawn, and the 55Fe radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. The molar concentration of 55Fe was estimated from the counts/min values, and the final results were referred to as the amount of nuclear DNA in terms of mol of deoxynucleotides. In experiments in which the uptake rate is plotted, the time course was first carried out for up to 100 min; the uptake rates were then calculated from the total uptake in 60 min, a time that falls within the linear range. In the case of uptake of Fe(III)-ATP, the time course was carried out for up to 20 min. This was determined by the method of Gornall et al. (13Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using albumin as a standard. All biochemical reagents were from Sigma except 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone, which was from Aldrich. 55FeCl3 (3 × 10−5 Ci/ml, 4.7 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK). The complex 55Fe-citrate was made by mixing 10 µl of 63 mM (3 × 10−5 Ci/ml) 55FeCl3 in 0.1 M HCl with 10 µl of 0.1 M Na+-citrate and was used immediately after preparation. In most of the experiments reported here, Fe(III)-citrate was used as a source of iron uptake by nuclei because citrate is considered to be an important iron carrier in the cell, together with ATP and ADP (14Bakkeres D.L. De Ieu-Jaspars C.M.H. Van der Hanl I.C. Van Eijk H.G. Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Aisen P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 356: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rat liver nuclei take up iron from 55Fe(III)-citrate in a process that is dependent on ATP and is affected by temperature (Fig. 1). At 0°C or in the absence of ATP, no iron uptake is observed. At 37°C and in the presence of 1 mM ATP, a strong stimulation of iron uptake occurs. Kinetic analysis of iron uptake shows an initial lag followed by a steep increase, which plateaus after 100 min of incubation at a level corresponding to a ratio of approximately 1 mol of 55Fe to 100 mol of deoxynucleotides. The effect of temperature on iron uptake was investigated in more detail (Fig. 2). In the absence of ATP, there is no visible change in the uptake rate with increasing temperature. However, in the presence of ATP, the dependence is very clear. The Arrhenius plot (Fig. 2B) obtained from the uptake rates in the presence of ATP makes it possible to calculate an Ea 1The abbreviations used are: Eaenergy of activationAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminodiphosphate)Ap5AP1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)pentaphosphate. of 11.3 kcal/mol.Fig. 2Effect of temperature on iron uptake.

Fig. 3 shows the dependence of 55Fe uptake on Fe(III)-citrate concentration. In the absence of ATP, there is no change in iron uptake with increasing concentrations of Fe(III)-citrate. In the presence of ATP, the uptake rate increases sharply in the 0-100 µM range and then levels off. The curve does not fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This is possibly due to the complexity of the system that may have at least two distinct components, namely, the removal of Fe(III) from citrate, which is a kinetically slow process (16Faller B. Nick H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3860-3865Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the iron transport across the membrane, both of which are dependent on Fe(III) concentration. The maximum 55Fe uptake rate is 140 µmol iron (mol deoxynucleotide)−1 (min)−1, which is reached at approximately 150 µM Fe(III)-citrate. Iron uptake is completely dependent on the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4). At 1 mM ATP, the kinetics fits a Michaelis-Menten process with a Km of 0.5 mM MgCl2. The dependence of iron uptake on ATP concentration is shown in Fig. 5, where it can be seen that optimal conditions are reached at approximately 1 mM ATP. The half-maximal rate was achieved at 0.4 mM ATP.Fig. 5Effect of increasing ATP concentrations on iron uptake. Isolated nuclei were incubated with the indicated ATP concentrations and 315 µM55Fe(III)-citrate for 100 min at 37°C. The uptake rate was measured as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Data presented are the means ± S.E. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A comparison of the effectiveness of ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, and AMP-PNP (a non-hydrolyzable analogue of ATP) to support nuclear 55Fe accumulation is shown in Table I. Clearly, ATP provides the strongest stimulus for iron uptake. The low stimulus provided by AMP-PNP suggests the need for ATP hydrolysis. Table I also shows the effects of several specific inhibitors of ATPases on iron uptake. Oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and antimycin A, inhibitors of mitochondrial ATP synthetase (17Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), showed only a slight inhibitory effect (16%) when added together to the incubation medium. Other ATPase inhibitors were ineffective on the ATP-driven iron uptake. This was the case for 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone, a microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor (11Nicotera P. McConkey D.J.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 92-94Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this iron uptake system involves sulfhydryl groups, as in the case for other ATPases (28Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Anner B.M. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), N-ethylmaleimide was added to the incubation medium. In this case, 33% inhibition of iron uptake was observed that could be prevented by the simultaneous addition of dithiothreitol. The N-ethylmaleimide concentration employed was 5 mM, which is reported to inhibit other P-ATPases (28Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Anner B.M. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Table I also shows that Tiron and desferrioxamine, two strong Fe(III) chelators, fully inhibited iron uptake. ATP is also considered to be a cellular iron chelator (15Aisen P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 356: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effectiveness of the complex Fe(III)-ATP in supporting iron uptake by nuclei (Fig. 6). The uptake rate reaches 380 µmol iron (mol deoxynucleotide)−1 (min)−1 at approximately 250 µM Fe(III). The complex Fe(III)-AMP-PNP was much less effective in supporting iron transport across the nuclear membrane, indicating that the process requires ATP hydrolysis. The inclusion of 100 µM vanadate inhibited uptake by over 40% (not shown), similar to that which was observed when Fe(III)-citrate was used as a source of iron. The uptake from Fe(III)-ATP is also completely dependent on Mg2+, and the kinetics of uptake differs from that of Fe(III)-citrate in that there is no initial lag and the plateau is reached at 20 min (not shown). The effect of up to 2.5-fold concentrations of several metal ions on iron uptake from Fe(III)-citrate is shown in Fig. 7. No uptake inhibition was observed for Ni(II), Pb(II), Mn(II), and Co(II). Slight inhibitions of 20 and 30% were observed for Cu(II) and Al(III), respectively, and they seem to keep inhibitions steady at this level. Catalase was added in these assays because it was possible that auto-oxidation of some of these ions gives rise to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. We describe here that rat liver nuclei accumulate iron in an ATP-dependent manner when the external source of Fe(III) is provided in the form of Fe(III)-citrate or Fe(III)-ATP, two iron complexes thought to be physiologically important (14Bakkeres D.L. De Ieu-Jaspars C.M.H. Van der Hanl I.C. Van Eijk H.G. Int. J. Biochem. 1985; 17: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Aisen P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 356: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been shown that approximately the same amounts of chelatable Fe(II) and Fe(III) are present in rat liver cells (30Kozlov A.V. Yegorov D.Y. Vladimirov Y.A. Azizova O.A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In separate experiments (not shown) carried out under the same conditions but using non-radioactive Fe(III)-citrate, the nuclear iron content, determined spectrophotometrically, increased 20-fold in 40 min from 0.29 to 6.0 mmol iron (mol deoxynucleotide)−1. Evidence strongly suggests that ATP-driven iron accumulation in the nucleus is supported by a P-type ATPase. (i) The uptake does not occur in the absence of ATP. Other nucleotides like ADP, AMP, and GTP support iron accumulation, although with a low efficiency. The partial sustenance of cation transport by nucleotides other than ATP has been reported for other ATPases (11Nicotera P. McConkey D.J. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 24Hechtenberg S. Beyersmann D. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 31De Meis L. Bittar E.E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Transport and Energy Transductions, Willie Series, Transport in the Life Sciences. 1980Google Scholar) and in some cases attributed to a loss of specificity due to experimental conditions. (ii) The non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP was poorly effective in sustaining uptake, strongly indicating the need for ATP hydrolysis. (iii) The transport is completely dependent on Mg2+, indicating that the true substrate for the ATPase is MgATP. It is a characteristic of the ATP-driven cation transport cycle of P-type ATPase to use MgATP as a substrate (22Skou J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31De Meis L. Bittar E.E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Transport and Energy Transductions, Willie Series, Transport in the Life Sciences. 1980Google Scholar, 32Bingham M.J. Burchell A. McArdle H.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 583-587Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). (iv) The uptake is strongly inhibited by 100 µM vanadate, a phosphate analogue. Vanadate binds to the phosphorylation site of P-type ATPase and appears to lock the enzyme in the E2 state. In the present case, inhibition was not total. This has also been observed in the case of other P-type ATPases (11Nicotera P. McConkey D.J. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 27Macara I.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 92-94Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 32Bingham M.J. Burchell A. McArdle H.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 583-587Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that phosphate in the medium competes with vanadate for the phosphorylation site (27Macara I.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1980; 5: 92-94Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This might well be the case in our experimental conditions since we have detected a strong ATP hydrolysis by what seems to be an apyrase activity. 2S. Gurgueira and R. Meneghini, unpublished results. This has, so far, hampered investigations on the correlation between iron uptake and ATP hydrolysis in this system. (vi) At 5 mM, N-ethylmaleimide inhibited ATP-dependent iron uptake, the inhibition was abolished by dithiothreitol, indicating the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in the process and agreeing with what has been reported for other P-type ATPases involved in cation transport (28Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Anner B.M. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The Ea for ATP-driven iron uptake was 11.3 kcal/mol. The Ea for Ca2+ uptake by vesicles of the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been reported to be 15-17 kcal/mol, while the Ea for ATP hydrolysis in the same system was 14-17 kcal/mol (31De Meis L. Bittar E.E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Transport and Energy Transductions, Willie Series, Transport in the Life Sciences. 1980Google Scholar). However, if these vesicles were treated with detergents, the Ea increased to 16-27 kcal/mol (31De Meis L. Bittar E.E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Transport and Energy Transductions, Willie Series, Transport in the Life Sciences. 1980Google Scholar, 33Inesi G. Millman M. Eletr S. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 81: 483-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), indicating that the conformation of the enzyme is correlated with Ea values. It is possible that the low Ea value obtained for iron transport is connected with the use of intact nuclei in which the ATPase conformation is close to the native form. Another parameter of the ATP-dependent iron uptake in nuclei that can be compared with that of other P-type ATPases is the Km for ATP, which is 0.4 mM. This value compares with those of Na+,K+-ATPase, 0.45 mM (22Skou J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), Ca2+ uptake by rat liver microsomes, 1.8 mM (34Moore L. Chen T. Knapp Jr., H.R. Landon E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4562-4568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the second apparent Km for ATP hydrolysis of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, 0.05-0.2 mM (31De Meis L. Bittar E.E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Transport and Energy Transductions, Willie Series, Transport in the Life Sciences. 1980Google Scholar). A higher value, 4.7 mM, was recently found for a presumptive Cu2+-ATPase (32Bingham M.J. Burchell A. McArdle H.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 482: 583-587Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The kinetics of iron uptake from Fe(III)-citrate shows an initial lag that we presume to be due to the low rate with which Fe(III) is transferred from the Fe(III)-citrate to the putative iron binding site of the ATPase. Indeed, Fe(III)-citrate is a spherical polymer of molecular weight 2.1 × 105 from which desferrioxamine and pyridone derivatives remove iron with very slow kinetics (16Faller B. Nick H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3860-3865Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The pseudo-first order constant indicates that the limiting step is not dissociation of Fe(III)-citrate complex but rather the formation of the intermediate ternary complex Fe(III)-citrate-ligand (16Faller B. Nick H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3860-3865Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If such a complex has to be formed between Fe(III)-citrate and the putative iron binding site of the ATPase, it would explain the initial lag. The same lag was not observed in the iron uptake kinetics from Fe-ATP (not shown), suggesting that iron transfer from ATP to the putative iron binding site of the ATPase is much faster. The complete inhibition of iron uptake by two strong Fe(III) chelators, desferrioxamine and Tiron, indicates the integrity of the nuclei. It also indicates that Fe(III) strongly bound to ligands cannot be transferred to the putative iron binding site of the ATPase. Recently, iron uptake by endosomal V-ATPase was described (19Li C.-Y. Watkins J.A. Glass J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It occurs preferentially with Fe(II), is not associated with ATP hydrolysis, and is strongly inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The V-ATPase is part of the system that internalizes iron from Fe-transferrin, and it was considered that Fe(II) uses the proton pore of the V-ATPase to gain access to the cytosol (19Li C.-Y. Watkins J.A. Glass J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The iron uptake we described is not affected by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. It is not affected either by specific inhibitors of other known P-type ATPases and must be ascribed to a new type of P-ATPase. Intracellular free iron is also in the form of Fe(II) (30Kozlov A.V. Yegorov D.Y. Vladimirov Y.A. Azizova O.A. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In experiments in which Fe(II) salts or Fe(III)-citrate + ascorbate were used as sources of external Fe(II), some iron uptake was observed, however, that was totally ATP-independent (not shown). Mutants of E. coli in the iron uptake system (feo) have been isolated (35Kammler M. Schön C. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6212-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Two genes, feoA and feoB, comprise the system. The Feo B protein is localized in the cytoplasmic membrane, and its sequence revealed regions of homology to ATPases, which indicates that iron uptake may be ATP-driven. Some recent important discoveries in the area of P-type ATPases involved in cation transport refer to a Cd2+-ATPase (19Li C.-Y. Watkins J.A. Glass J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to a Cu2+-ATPase (36Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar, 37Tanzi R.E. Petrukhin K. Chernov I. Pellequer J.L. Wasco W. Ross B. Romano D.M. Parano E. Pavone L. Brzustowicz L.M. Devoto M. Peppercorn J. Bush A.I. Sternlieb I. Pirastu M. Gusella J.F. Evgrafov O. Penchaszadeh G.K. Honig B. Edelman I.S. Soares M.B. Scheinberg I.H. Gilliam T.C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). In the experiment in Fig. 7, the inhibitory action of several metal ions on iron uptake by nuclei was tested, and no significant effect was observed. Thus, it seems that we are dealing with a putative Fe-ATPase, distinct from other P-type ATPases involved in cation transport. It has been shown that iron, in addition to inducing ferritin translation (38Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), activates ferritin gene transcription in liver (39Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Iron may be active in other genes as well. Moreover, the possibility cannot be dismissed that iron plays some structural role in chromatin, as copper does (40Marsden M.P.F. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1979; 17: 849-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Our recent investigations using electron energy-loss spectroscopic imaging revealed an unexpected concentration of iron in condensed chromatin.2 We are grateful to Dr. Sergio Almeida-Verjovski for valuable discussion."
https://openalex.org/W1968330238,"Abstract Acetylation of histones bound to rat rRNA genes has been studied relative to their organization in chromatin, either as canonical nucleosomes, containing the inactive copies, or as anucleosomal nonrepeating structures, corresponding to the transcribed genes (Conconi, A., Widmer, R. M., Koller, T., and Sogo, J. M.(1989) Cell 57, 753-761). Nuclei from butyrate-treated rat tumor cells were irradiated with a UV laser to cross-link proteins to DNA, and the purified covalent complexes were immunofractionated by an antibody that specifically recognized the acetylated histones. Upon probing with sequences coding for mature rat 28 S RNA, DNA of the antibody-bound complexes was 5-20-fold enriched relative to the total rat DNA. Since the laser cross-links histones to DNA in both active and inactive genes, one cannot distinguish which one of them, or both, are bound to acetylated histones. Alternatively, purified mononucleosomes were immunofractionated, but DNA from the antibody-bound monosomes was not enriched in coding rDNA. Taken together, these results suggest that nucleosome-organized rRNA genes are bound to nonmodified histones and that the acetylated histones are associated with the active, anucleosomal gene copies."

This process was investigated in vitro using isolated mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles (OMV) from rat liver. 14C-Labeled PC was introduced into the OMV from small unilamellar vesicles by a PC-specific transfer protein (PCTP). The membrane topology of the newly introduced PC was determined from its accessibility to phospholipase A2. Under conditions where the OMV stay intact, externally added phospholipase A2 is able to hydrolyze up to 50% of both the introduced [14C]PC and the endogenous PC. Pool size calculations showed that close to 100% of the PC in the OMV can be exchanged by PCTP. A back-exchange experiment revealed that the introduction of the labeled PC is reversible. The results demonstrate that newly introduced PC molecules readily equilibrate over both leaflets of the OMV membrane. The kinetics of the PCTP-mediated exchange process indicate that the t½ of the transmembrane movement at 30°C is 2 min or less.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The terminal steps of the de novo synthesis of PC (and most other phospholipids) occur primarily on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum(2.Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1991: 205-240Google Scholar). Consequently, the biogenesis of mitochondria requires efficient import of PC from the ER. Several mechanisms for the intracellular transport of phospholipids have been proposed (for a recent review see (3.Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). There is growing evidence that the import of phosphatidylserine into mitochondria occurs via direct interorganelle contact between mitochondria and the so-called mitochondria-associated membrane(4.Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7069-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Ardail D. Gasnier F. Lermé F. Simonot C. Louisot P. Gateau-Roesch O. J. Biol.

Additional mechanisms, so far unknown, are required for the sorting of the newly imported phospholipids within the mitochondrion, in order to maintain the specific phospholipid composition and transbilayer phospholipid distribution of both mitochondrial membranes. In vivo labeling studies in hepatocytes employing [14C]choline have shown that radiolabeled PC appears rapidly in the mitochondrial outer membrane, while transfer to the inner membrane is slow(9.Yaffe M.P. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggests that newly synthesized PC is transferred from the ER to the inner membrane via the outer membrane. In isolated mitochondria, movement of labeled endogenous PC from the outer to the inner membrane has been demonstrated(10.Blok M.C. Wirtz K.W.A. Scherphof G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the outer membrane is the first barrier to be taken by a newly imported PC molecule on its way to the inner membrane or to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane. In the present study the process of PC movement across the outer mitochondrial membrane is investigated in an in vitro system consisting of mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles (OMV) isolated from rat liver mitochondria. These OMV are sealed and have a right-side-out topology with an almost symmetric distribution of PC over the inner and outer membrane leaflet(11.Hovius R.H. Thijssen J. van der Linden P. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine-specific transfer protein (PCTP) was used to introduce radiolabeled PC into the OMV from donor vesicles. The use of PCTP also allowed the determination of the pool size of exchangeable PC in the OMV. The transmembrane distribution of the introduced PC was assessed from its accessibility to externally added phospholipase A2 (PLA2). It is concluded that newly introduced [14C]dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ([14C]DOPC) equilibrates rapidly over the OMV membrane with a t½ at 30°C of at most 2 min. The radiochemicals 1,2-di-(1-14C)-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([14C]DOPC, 114 Ci/mol), and (1α,2α-3H)cholesteryl oleoyl ether ([3H]CE, 37 Ci/mmol) were obtained from New England Nuclear (Brussels, Belgium), and Amersham (Amersham, United Kingdom), respectively. DOPC and dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA) were purchased from Avanti (Birmingham, AL). PCTP was purified from bovine liver and stored at −20°C at a concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, containing 50% glycerol(12.Westerman J. Kamp H.H. Wirtz K.W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (ppPLA2) was purified as in (13.Nieuwenhuizen W. Kunze H. de Haas G.H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32B: 147-154Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Bee venom phospholipase A2 (bvPLA2), bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free), trypsin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were analytical grade. Mitochondria were isolated from the livers of male Wistar rats by a combination of differential centrifugation and isotonic Percoll gradient centrifugation as described(14.Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). OMV were obtained using a modified version of the method recently introduced for mitochondria from Neurospora crassa(15.Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mitochondria were suspended in hypotonic buffer (5 mM KPi, pH 7.2, 5 mM EDTA) at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 20 min under stirring. The outer membrane was detached from the remaining mitoplasts by 20 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a tightly fitting Teflon pestle. The homogenate (15 ml) was layered on a sucrose step gradient consisting of 9 ml of 0.25 M sucrose and 12 ml of 1.1 M sucrose in 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 2.5 mM EDTA (EM buffer). After ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 141,000 × g (SW28 rotor, Beckman), the outer membrane fraction was collected from the 0.25-1.1 M sucrose interface, its sucrose concentration was adjusted to 1.1 M, and it was loaded on the bottom of a flotation sucrose gradient (4 ml/tube). A layer of 7 ml 1.065 M sucrose in EM buffer was put on top, and the tube was filled up with EM buffer. The purified OMV were collected from the 0-1.065 M sucrose interface after ultracentrifugation for 16 h at 141,000 × g (SW41 rotor), diluted in EM buffer, and pelleted by centrifugation for 1 h at 300,000 × g (Ti60 rotor). The pellet was resuspended in 220 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 2 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 (MSH buffer) at a protein concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Aliquots of the OMV were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Typically, the procedure yielded 1 mg of OMV/100 mg of mitochondria based on protein. Based on the total activity of the outer membrane marker enzyme monoamine oxidase, 25% of the outer membranes are recovered in the OMV preparation. The purity of the OMV was assessed by marker enzyme analyses and will be documented in detail elsewhere. 2A. I. P. M. de Kroon, D. Dolis, A. 5er, R. Lill, and B. de Kruijff, manuscript in preparation. Typically, the specific activity of monoamine oxidase was enriched 26 times, while that of succinate cytochrome c reductase (mitochondrial inner membrane marker) was depleted by a factor of 30, compared with the specific activities determined for the mitochondria. The specific activities of monoamine oxidase, the microsomal markers glucose-6-phosphatase and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, the lysosomal marker acid phosphatase, and the plasma membrane marker 5′-nucleotidase in the OMV fraction relative to those of the nuclei-free rat liver homogenate were 69.8, 0.45, 0.55, 2.8, and 1.3, respectively. A dry lipid film was prepared, which consisted of 1.935 μmol of DOPC including 4 μCi of [14C]DOPC, 0.1 μmol of DOPA, and 37 μCi of [3H]CE (1 nmol) as nonexchangeable marker. The lipid film was hydrated in 1 ml of MSH buffer. The resulting phospholipid suspension was subjected to 10 cycles of 30-s ultrasonication with 30-s intervals at 0°C, using a Branson B12 sonifier equipped with a microtip and operated at 55 W output. The sonicated phospholipid suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 315,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant containing the small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) was stored in aliquots at −20°C until use. Storage did not adversely affect the recovery of the SUV in the supernatant after a 20-min centrifugation at 185,000 × g as used in the forthcoming. OMV (at a concentration of 0.25 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with radiolabeled donor SUV (0.15 mM PC) and PCTP (18 μg/ml) in MSH buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 30°C for 20 min unless otherwise indicated. Subsequently, the OMV were separated from the SUV by ultracentrifugation for 20 min at 185,000 × g (TLA100.2 rotor). To determine the extent of the PC exchange, 14C and 3H were counted in the supernatant and in the resuspended pellet by a Packard 1500 Tricarb Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. Quantification of the transfer of [14C]DOPC to the OMV involved a correction for the SUV contamination in the OMV pellet using the 3H-labeled nonexchangeable marker. This contamination typically amounted to 10% of the total amount of SUV added. In the calculation it was assumed that the 14C-specific radioactivity of the co-pelleted SUV is the same as that determined for the SUV in the supernatant. In order to calculate the obtained specific radioactivity of PC in the OMV, the phospholipid phosphorus/protein ratio and the PC content of the OMV were determined. OMV aliquots corresponding to 150 μg of protein were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer(16.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41817) Google Scholar), and the phosphorus content of the organic phase was quantitated (17.Fiske L.M. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) to yield the phospholipid phosphorus/protein ratio. Phospholipid analysis of the OMV extracts by two-dimensional HPTLC was performed as described(14.Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Spots were visualized by iodine vapor and scraped off, and phospholipid phosphorus was quantitated(17.Fiske L.M. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), yielding the PC content of the OMV. Apart from the considerations above, the calculation of the pool size of exchangeable PC in the OMV ((specific radioactivity of OMV/specific radioactivity of SUV outer leaflet) × 100%) was based on the notion that 65% of the PC in the donor SUV is accessible to PCTP(18.van den Besselaar A.M.H.P. de Kruijff B. van den Bosch H. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 510: 242-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19.Johnson L.W. Hughes M.E. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1990; 1025: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In back-exchange experiments, OMV with [14C]DOPC introduced as described above were incubated at 0.25 mg/ml with unlabeled SUV consisting of DOPC/DOPA (95:5, mol/mol) at a concentration of 1.5 mM based on phosphorus, in the presence of 18 μg/ml PCTP at 30°C for the periods of time indicated. OMV were recollected by centrifugation at 185,000 × g as above. Radioactivity in the pellet and the supernatant was counted, and the percentage of [14C]DOPC extracted from the OMV was calculated, taking into account the above corrections, while assuming that 10% of the SUV with associated 14C label co-pellets with the OMV. OMV at a protein concentration of 0.6 mg/ml in MSH buffer were incubated for the indicated periods with ppPLA2 and bvPLA2 at a concentration of 0.4 units/ml each, in the presence of 0.1 mM Ca2+ at room temperature. This mixture of phospholipases A2 is optimal for determining the phospholipid topology in OMV, as stable levels of phospholipid degradation are obtained rapidly(11.Hovius R.H. Thijssen J. van der Linden P. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PLA2 activity was inhibited by the addition of 0.75 mM EGTA. The OMV were pelleted (20 min at 185,000 × g) and subjected to phospholipid extraction. The specific activities of ppPLA2 (1.25 × 103 units/mg) and bvPLA2 (4.2 × 103 units/mg) were determined using egg yolk lipoproteins as substrate(13.Nieuwenhuizen W. Kunze H. de Haas G.H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32B: 147-154Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). After treatment with PLA2, aliquots of the OMV suspension corresponding to 40 μg of protein were incubated with 1.7 mg of trypsin/mg of OMV for 20 min on ice, prior to the addition of a 2.5-fold excess (w/w) of soybean trypsin inhibitor over trypsin(11.Hovius R.H. Thijssen J. van der Linden P. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The remaining activity of the enzyme adenylate kinase, determined spectrophotometrically at 37°C (14.Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 21.Schmidt B. Wachter E. Sebald W. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), served as a measure for the intactness of the OMV. Phospholipids were extracted according to the method of Rose and Oklander (22.Rose G.H. Oklander M. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 428-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from samples corresponding to 100-150 μg of OMV. To determine the degradation of the endogenous PC by PLA2, phospholipids were separated by two-dimensional HPTLC, visualized by iodine vapor, and quantitated as described(14.Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To assess the degradation of [14C]DOPC, the lipid extract was analyzed by one-dimensional HPTLC on silica gel 60 (Merck, FRG), using chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia, water (90:54:5.5:5.5 (v/v/v/v)) as eluent. Subsequently, the radioactive spots on the TLC plate were quantified by a Berthold Automatic TLC linear analyzer (Wildbad, FRG). As the hydrolysis of [14C]DOPC to lyso-[14C]PC and [14C]oleate by PLA2 did not affect the recovery of the radiolabel from the extraction procedure (see Fig. 1A), it was possible to quantitate the extents of [14C]DOPC degradation from the HPTLC elution profiles. No hydrolysis of PC was detected in control experiments without PLA2. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) with 0.1% (w/v) SDS added and bovine serum albumin as standard. Concentrations of SUV were determined by phosphate analysis(17.Fiske L.M. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled DOPC was introduced into isolated mitochondrial OMV from donor vesicles by the action of the PCTP. This protein catalyzes a one-to-one PC exchange resulting in a replacement of the endogenous PC in the acceptor membrane with PC from the donor vesicles, i.e. without changing the PC content of the membranes(23.Rothman J.E. Tsai D.K. Dawidowicz E.A. Lenard J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24.van Meer G. Poorthuis B.J.H.M. Wirtz K.W.A. Op den Kamp J.A.F. van Deenen L.L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25.Wirtz K.W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 73-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). [14C]DOPC was efficiently transferred from donor SUV to acceptor OMV under the conditions used, an incubation for 20 min at 30°C with equal amounts of PC present in the populations of donor and acceptor vesicles (PCdonor/PCacceptor molar ratio approximately 1), and in the presence of PCTP. Typically, around 4 nmol of [14C]DOPC were transferred per mg of OMV protein. After removal of the donor SUV by centrifugation, the OMV were incubated with a mixture of phospholipases A2 from bee venom and porcine pancreas to determine the membrane topology of the labeled PC molecules. Fig. 1A shows the HPTLC analysis of OMV phospholipid extracts from a typical experiment. Approximately 40% of the [14C]DOPC is hydrolyzed within 10 min by the action of PLA2 (Fig. 1, A and B). Degradation of the remainder proceeds slowly and is accompanied by a gradual loss of the intactness of the OMV as indicated by the increasing accessibility of adenylate kinase present in the OMV lumen to externally added trypsin (Fig. 1C). In the presence of an excess of PLA2 (Fig. 1A), up to 94% of the [14C]DOPC is degraded in 10 min. This is accompanied by a loss of barrier function of the OMV membrane as evidenced by the proteolysis of over 80% of adenylate kinase by trypsin (data not shown). Under similar conditions with an excess of PLA2 present virtually all endogenous PC is hydrolyzed(11.Hovius R.H. Thijssen J. van der Linden P. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The time course of the degradation of [14C]DOPC parallels that of the hydrolysis of endogenous PC under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). From the amount of [3H]CE present in the lipid extracts (Fig. 1A) it is estimated that approximately 10% of the total 14C label present originates from co-pelleted SUV. This contamination may account for the slightly different degrees of protection from PLA2 observed for labeled and endogenous PC after 10 min of incubation (Fig. 1B). When the time of the incubation with PCTP is reduced to 3 min, still 60 ± 5% of the 14C label is recovered as intact PC after 10 min of treatment with PLA2 (data not shown). The data suggest that the newly introduced PC rapidly adopts a transbilayer distribution similar to that of the endogenous PC, with approximately 50% of the PC content localized in the inner leaflet and 50% in the outer leaflet in agreement with (11.Hovius R.H. Thijssen J. van der Linden P. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In order to calculate the specific radioactivity of the PC pool in the OMV after exchange by PCTP, the PC content of the OMV was determined. The OMV have a phospholipid phosphorus/protein ratio of 1220 ± 150 nmol/mg (± S.D., n = 6) and a PC content of 54.7 ± 3.1% (± S.D., n = 11) (compare (1.Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and (14.Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar)). The existence of a fast equilibration of newly introduced [14C]DOPC across the OMV membrane is supported by the results depicted in Fig. 2. The specific radioactivity of the PC pool in the OMV was determined after different times of exchange by PCTP and compared with that of the outer leaflet of the donor SUV, as PCTP only has access to the outer leaflet of phospholipid vesicles(19.Johnson L.W. Hughes M.E. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 375: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After 5 min of exchange, the specific radioactivity of both PC pools reaches a similar equilibrium value (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the entire PC pool of the OMV has exchanged with the outer leaflet of the SUV. The exchangeable pool of PC in the OMV was determined in several independent experiments, yielding an average value of 91 ± 12% (± S.D., n = 22). After introduction into the OMV membrane, [14C]DOPC is completely extractable in a back-exchange experiment as shown in Fig. 3. OMV with [14C]DOPC incorporated were incubated with an excess of unlabeled SUV (PCSUP/PCOMV molar ratio of 10) and PCTP. Under these conditions all of the [14C]DOPC is in exchange with the PC in the outer leaflet of the SUV (Fig. 3), demonstrating the reversibility of the transmembrane movement. The present study demonstrates that [14C]DOPC introduced into the outer leaflet of isolated mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles by PCTP is rapidly equilibrated over the two membrane leaflets. This conclusion is based on two lines of experimental evidence. (i) Similar to the extent of hydrolysis of endogenous PC, only 50% of the introduced [14C]DOPC can be degraded by externally added PLA2, while the OMV stay intact, indicating that the other 50% has flipped to the inner leaflet. (ii) The pool size of exchangeable PC in the OMV is close to 100%. This result, combined with the reversibility of the exchange process (Fig. 3), indicates that the probe molecule [14C]DOPC behaves like endogenous PC. The monophasic kinetics observed for the PCTP-catalyzed PC exchange process (Fig. 2) do not allow distinction between the rates of the actual exchange and the PC transmembrane movement. Consequently, the rate constant of the transmembrane movement of PC (flip-flop) is close to or higher than the rate constant of the overall exchange process, which implies that at 30°C the t½ for PC transmembrane movement in OMV is 2 min or less. Direct access of PCTP to the inner leaflet of the OMV membrane by permeation could in principle also explain the results obtained in the present study. However, this possibility is considered remote in view of the molecular size of PCTP (25 kDa(26.Akeroyd R. Moonen P. Westerman J. Puyk W.C. Wirtz K.W.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 141: 385-391Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) relative to that of cytochrome c (12 kDa), for which the outer membrane is impermeable(27.Wojtczak L. Zaluska H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 193: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Accordingly, labeled PC is not recovered in the inner membrane fraction after its introduction into intact mitochondria by PCTP(20.Nicolay K. Hovius R. Bron R. Wirtz K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It may seem paradoxical that on the one hand almost 100% of the PC pool of the OMV is accessible to PCTP, while on the other hand only half of the introduced [14C]DOPC can be degraded by external PLA2 in intact OMV (Fig. 1). A possible explanation would be that the PCTP-catalyzed exchange process, or PCTP itself, induces the rapid transmembrane movement of PC in OMV. This possibility cannot be excluded; however, so far there are no indications that PCTP would have this ability in other biomembranes (23.Rothman J.E. Tsai D.K. Dawidowicz E.A. Lenard J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24.van Meer G. Poorthuis B.J.H.M. Wirtz K.W.A. Op den Kamp J.A.F. van Deenen L.L.M. Eur. J.

Acta. 1976; 426: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PCTP does not induce phospholipid transbilayer movement in protein-free phospholipid vesicles(17.Fiske L.M. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18.van den Besselaar A.M.H.P. de Kruijff B. van den Bosch H. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 510: 242-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The alternative explanation, i.e. that the lyso-PC molecules produced by PLA2 do not participate in the transmembrane equilibration of PC, is considered more likely. The microsomal contamination present in the preparations of OMV requires consideration in view of the rapid rate of PC flip-flop occurring in rat liver microsomes (t½ ∼ 2-3 min at 37°C(17.Fiske L.M. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar)) and the proposed role of a specialized ER fraction (mitochondria-associated membrane) in phospholipid transport to mitochondria(4.Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7069-7074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the specific activity of the microsomal marker enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase in OMV preparations and in microsomes isolated according to (14.Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), the microsomal contamination of the OMV does not exceed 9.4% based on protein.2 Given the phospholipid:protein ratio of microsomes(1.Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), it can be calculated that this percentage corresponds to a contamination of at most 4% on a phospholipid basis. Consequently, microsomal PC hardly contributes to the total PC pool. Vance (8.Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that the specific activity of glucose-6-phosphatase is higher in mitochondria-associated membrane than in microsomes, whereas that of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase is lower. There are no indications that the microsomal fraction contaminating the OMV has characteristics of mitochondria-associated membrane, as the specific activities of both enzymes in the OMV relative to those in the rat liver homogenate are similar (0.45 and 0.55, respectively).2 In vitro studies on the import of PC by rat liver mitochondria have shown that labeled PC is confined to the outer membrane after its introduction by PCTP from phospholipid vesicles(11.Hovius R.H. Thijssen J. van der Linden P. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20.Nicolay K. Hovius R. Bron R. Wirtz K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These results raised the question of which of the putative consecutive steps in intramitochondrial PC transport is limiting, the movement across the outer membrane or the transfer from outer to inner membrane. The present study strongly argues that the first step is not limiting. Calculations of the pool size of exchangeable PC in the outer membrane of intact mitochondria (20.Nicolay K. Hovius R. Bron R. Wirtz K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) suggest that the occurrence of transmembrane equilibration in the outer membrane depends on the acyl chain composition and the type of label of the PC molecule. In the case of [14C]DOPC the size of the exchangeable PC pool in the outer membrane of intact mitochondria was found to be 56%, indicating that the label stays in the outer leaflet(11.Hovius R.H. Thijssen J. van der Linden P. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Combined with the present results this suggests that the inner membrane might have a regulatory role in the transmembrane movement of PC across the outer membrane. In a study on the topology of phospholipids in mitochondrial OMV from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transmembrane movement of PC in the outer membrane was reported to proceed relatively slowly (t½ ∼ 50 min(29.Sperka-Gottlieb C.D.M. Hermetter A. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 946: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)). These authors used a different, non-PC-specific transfer protein and a different donor-acceptor system, which complicates direct comparison with the present data. In vivo labeling in rat hepatocytes has shown that 15 min after the addition of [14C]choline, the specific radioactivity in the mitochondrial outer membrane is approaching equilibrium with that in the microsomes, which is consistent with a rapid transmembrane movement of PC in the outer membrane(9.Yaffe M.P. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The existence of rapid PC transmembrane movement across the mitochondrial outer membrane makes a lot of sense from the point of view of biology. Since mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that should have easy access to newly synthesized membrane components, it does not come as a surprise that the outer membrane has a mechanism for rapid shuttling of phospholipids. Comparable fast rates of energy-independent phospholipid transmembrane movement have been reported in membranes that are sites of phospholipid synthesis, the ER membrane (18.van den Besselaar A.M.H.P. de Kruijff B. van den Bosch H. van Deenen L.L.M.

Recently, we reported a novel type of retinoic acid antagonist (SR11335) and showed that this compound can inhibit retinoic acid (RA)-induced activation of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter construct that contains a special RA response element (RARE). We have now further characterized the antagonism mediated by SR11335 and of newly synthesized structurally related compounds. Two compounds, SR11330 and SR11334, which are poor transactivators, also showed antagonist activities, inhibiting all-trans-RA (tRA) and 9-cis-RA. The retinoids inhibited transcriptional activation of RAR/RXR heterodimers effectively, while inhibition of RXR homodimers was less efficient. Inhibition was observed on several RAREs, including the TREpal, βRARE, apoAI-RARE, and CRBPI-RARE. In addition, the antagonists inhibited tRA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The antagonist did not interfere with DNA binding of the receptors. In limited proteolytic digestion assays, SR11335 induced resistance of the receptors to proteolysis, but the pattern of the degradation was not altered from that induced by tRA, suggesting that these antagonists induce their biological effects by competing with agonists for binding to RARs, thereby preventing the induction of conformational changes of the receptors necessary for transcriptional activation.

We show here that the folding of cytosolic FKBP12 (FK 506 binding protein) is an autocatalytic process both for the mature protein and for a fusion protein with an amino-terminal extension of 16 residues. Native FKBP contains seven trans-prolyl peptide bonds, and the cis-to-trans isomerizations of some or all of them constitute the slow, rate-limiting events in folding. The rate of an autocatalytic reaction increases with reactant concentration, because the product catalyzes its own formation. Accordingly, the folding of the fusion protein was more than 10-fold accelerated when the protein concentration was increased from 0.05 µM to 10 µM. At high concentrations of both forms of FKBP12 autocatalysis was very efficient, and the observed folding rate seemed to approach the rate of the fast direct folding reaction of the protein molecules with the correct (all trans) peptidyl-prolyl bond conformation.

These cells have morphological and ultrastructural characteristics close to the “releasing gland cells” of adhesive organs. The epitope recognized by anti-α-NE was contained in granules having a diameter of 0.2-0.3 µm. Previous works involving the brain of this leech demonstrate the existence of ~14 neurons immunoreactive to the anti-α-NE.

Purity of the isolated peptides was controlled by capillary electrophoresis. Their sequences were determined by a combination of automated Edman degradation, electrospray mass spectrometry measurement, and coelution experiments in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with synthetic α-NE. The results demonstrate that epitopes recognized by the anti-α-NE in the suckers and the central nervous system are identical to vertebrate α-NE (YGGFLRKYPK). This finding constitutes the first biochemical characterization of a prodynorphin-derived peptide in invertebrates.

Moreover the isolation of this peptide in the annelida establishes the very ancient phylogenetic origin of α-NE as well as its conservation in evolution. In vertebrates, all known opioids peptides are cleavage products of three different precursors, i.e. proopiomelanocortin (POMC), 1The abbreviations used are: POMCproopiomelanocortinanti-α-NEanti-α-Neo-endorphinDIAdot immunobinding assayHPGPChigh pressure gel permeationHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMSHmelanocyte-stimulating hormoneα-NEα-Neo-endorphinRTretention timeCNScentral nervous systemELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. proenkephalin, and prodynorphin (1). Processing of the prodynorphin yields a number of bioactive peptides including leucine-enkephalin, Neo-endorphins (α and β), and dynorphins (A and B) (26Patey G. Rossier J. Ann. Endocrinol. 1986; 47: 71-87PubMed Google Scholar). Among these peptides, α-Neo-endorphin (α-NE) has been isolated from all vertebrates phyla (36Sei C.A. Richard R. Dores R.M. Brain Res. 1989; 479: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; 6Dores R.M. McDonald L.K. Goldsmith A. Deviche P. Rubin D.A. Cell. Physiol.

The α-NE isolated from different tetrapods revealed by reversed-phase HPLC similar biochemical properties, reflecting the great conservation of this peptide in tetrapods (36Sei C.A. Richard R.

This result may be due to the following: 1) α-NE sequence changes that render this opioid undetectable to heterologous mammalian antisera, 2) a unique set of posttranslational processing reactions in which α-NE is not liberated from fragments of the prodynorphin precursor, or 3) the possibility that during evolution the prodynorphin precursor may be absent in fishes (see 7Dores R.M.

If these three genes encoding opioid peptides are related (17Gubler U. Habener J.F. Molecular Cloning of Hormone Genes. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1987: 229Crossref Google Scholar), one of the central questions is in what order did these genes evolve from a hypothetical ancestral gene? In this context research on different opioid peptides in invertebrates is essential (38Stefano G.B. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1991; 1: 71-82Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, enkephalin peptides have been isolated in crustacea (23Luschen W. Buck F. Willig A. Jarros P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8671-8675Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), in mollusks (22Leung M.K. Stefano G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 955-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and in annelids (29Salzet M. Bulet P. Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357 (a): 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, a peptide derived from POMC maturation in vertebrates, γ-MSH, has also been characterized in the leech Theromyzon tessulatum (32Salzet M. Wattez C. Bulet P. Malecha J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Given this amount of information in invertebrates concerning opioid peptides, little is known about α-NE in these animals. This peptide was not detected by immunocytochemistry in the mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis (1Boer H.H. van Minnen J. Peptides. 1985; 6: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). By contrast, immunoreactive material was present in annelids i.e. polychaeta (3Dhainaut-Courtois N. Tramu G. Beauvillain J.C. Masson M. Neurochem. Int. 1986; 8: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and achaeta (43Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1987; 6 (a): 195-199Google Scholar, 44Verger-Bocquet M.

In the leech T. tessulatum, a great number of cells immunoreactive to the antiserum raised against α-NE were found in the proboscis (43Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1987; 6 (a): 195-199Google Scholar, 45Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Wattez C. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1988; 7: 21-27Google Scholar) and in the brain (6-14 neurons) (43Verger-Bocquet M.

The aim of the present study is to fully characterized the α-NE-like peptide(s) in the leech T. tessulatum. Here we report for the first time that such material is present in the central nervous system and in a novel type of cell in the suckers. Mature specimens of the rhynchobdellid leech T. tessulatum were reared under controlled laboratory conditions as described in detail by 24Malecha J. Verger-Bocquet M.A. Tramu G. Can. J. Zool. 1989; 67: 636-640Crossref Google Scholar. After anesthesia with chloretone, animals were pinned flat, ventral side up in leech saline solution (25Muller K.J. Nicholls J.G. Stent G.S. Neurobiology of the Leech. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 255Google Scholar). Central nervous system (CNS: brain and nerve cord) and anterior and posterior suckers were excised. Except for the purpose of immunocytochemistry, in which case they were fixed, suckers and CNS were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C for storage. Polyclonal antiserum anti-α-Neo-endorphin (anti-α-NE) was raised in rabbits and provided by Dr. G. Tramu (Laboratoire de Neurocytochimie fonctionnelle, Université de Bordeaux I, Talence, France). Anti-α-NE specificity was determined by radioimmunoassay as noted elsewhere (12Fallon J.H. Ciofi P. Björklund A. Hökfelt T. Handbook of Chemical Neuroanatomy, Neuropeptides in the CNS, Part II. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1990: 1Google Scholar). No significant cross-reactivity was found with methionine-enkephalin, leucine-enkephalin, dynorphin 1-17 and dynorphin 1-8, or α or β endorphin. Anterior and posterior parts of T. tessulatum (including suckers) were fixed overnight at 4°C in Bouin-Hollande fixative (+10% HgCl2 saturated solution). They were then embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned at 7 µm. After removal of paraffin with toluene, the sections were successively treated with the anti-α-NE diluted 1:200 and with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as described elsewhere (46Verger-Bocquet M. Wattez C. Salzet M. Malecha J. Can. J. Zool. 1992; 70: 856-865Crossref Google Scholar). The specificity of the antiserum was tested on consecutive sections mounted on different slides by preadsorbing the antiserum overnight at 4°C with the homologous antigen (synthetic α-NE, Sigma) at a concentration of 500 µg/ml pure antiserum. Anterior and posterior suckers were fixed for 2 h at 4°C in a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid, and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The tissue were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 2 h and were dehydrated before embedding in Epon. Immunostaining was performed directly on ultrathin sections of suckers collected on nickel grids and treated according to the following procedure: 1) 10% H2O2, 8 min; 2) distilled water, 10 min; 3) Coons buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% normal goat serum (NGS), 10 min; 4) anti-α-NE diluted 1:1200 in Coons buffer containing 1% NGS and 1% bovine serum albumin, 24 h, 4°C; 5) Tris 0.1 M, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 M NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1% NGS, for two 10-min periods; 6) 5 nM colloidal gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Janssen, Belgium) diluted 1:50 in the precedent buffer, 1.5 h; and 7) washing in the buffer (twice for 10 min each) and distilled water (twice for 10 min each). The sections were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined with a Jeol JEM 100 CX electron microscope. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and dot immunobinding assay (DIA) were conducted according to 33Salzet M. Wattez C. Slomianny M.C. Léü B. Siegert K.J. Comp. Biochem.

As a control, preadsorption of α-NE was carried out using homologous peptide. Prior to ELISA and DIA, anti-α-NE, at its working dilution was incubated overnight at 4°C with synthetic α-NE (Sigma) (300 µg/ml undiluted anti-α-NE). A four-step procedure was employed (Table I).Table IPurification of the α-Neo-endorphin related peptide in the brain of T. tessulatumStepColumn materialGradient of acetonitrileYield in brain%%1.

After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, the pellet was reextracted once. The two supernatants were combined and loaded onto Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (500 µl of extract/cartridge; Waters). After washing the cartridges with 5 ml of 1 M acetic acid, elution was performed with 5 ml of 50% acetonitrile in water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce). The eluted fractions were reduced 20-fold in a vacuum centrifuge (Savant) to remove acid and organic solvent. The total amount of anti-α-NE-like material was quantified using ELISA. The 50% eluted fraction was taken up to a volume of 250 µl with acidified water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and fractionated on a HPGPC column (Ultraspherogel, 7, 5 × 300 mm, Sec2000, Beckman) associated to a precolumn (Ultraspherogel, 7, 5 × 40 mm, Beckman). Samples were eluted with 30% acetonitrile in acidified water at a flow rate of 500 µl/min. Fractions immunoreactive in DIA to anti-α-NE were concentrated before separated on a C18-peptide protein column (250 mm × 4.6 mm; Vydac) equilibrated with acidified water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Elution was performed with a discontinuous linear gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water over 0-15% for 10 min and over 15-45% for 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored by absorbance at 226 nm and the presence of α-NE-like material detected in aliquots of each fraction by DIA. Fractions that contained the immunoreactive material were applied on the same column with a shallower gradient. Elution was performed with a discontinuous linear gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water over 0-15% for 10 min and over 15-45% for 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After a 20-fold concentration by freeze-drying, fraction aliquots of 0.5 µl were tested by DIA. The α-NE-like material was finally purified on an ODS C18 reversed-phase column (Ultrasphere, 250 mm × 2 mm; Beckman) developed with a linear gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile in acidified water for 60 min at a flow rate of 50 µl/min. The column effluent was monitored by absorbance at 226 nm and the immunoreactive material detected as above. Suckers underwent same purification procedure, except an additional prepurification step was added. The supernatant obtained after acidic extraction contained green and yellow pigments as well as mucus. They were removed early on the procedure by precipitation with water/acetone (20/80, v/v). The acetonic fraction was reduced 20-fold before subjected to the Sep-Pack prepurification step procedure. All HPLC purifications were performed with a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a photodiode array detector (Beckman 168). A comparison between first derivatives of absorbance of scan profiles obtained from synthetic peptides and from the endogenous immunoreactive peptides, at identical concentration (100 pmol) was performed as noted in detail elsewhere (31Salzet M. Wattez C. Baert J.L. Malecha J. Brain Res. 1993; 631 (b): 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prior to microsequencing, the purity of the peptide was controlled by capillary electrophoresis. Separation was performed on an Applied Biosystems model 270A-HT capillary electrophoresis system. Silica capillary (72 cm length) was used. Under these conditions, separation was achieved from anode to cathode in a citrate buffer (20 mM) at pH 2.5. Detection was at 200 nm, temperature was 30°C, and the volume injected was 2 nl. Automated Edman degradation of the purified peptide and detection of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were performed on a pulse liquid automatic sequenator (Applied Biosystems, model 473A). The purified peptide was dissolved in water/methanol (50/50, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid and analyzed on a VG Biotech BioQ mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK). Details of the method have been described elsewhere (28Salzet M. Bulet P. Van Dorsselaer A. Malecha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217 (a): 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to the cells previously described in the proboscis (43Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1987; 6 (a): 195-199Google Scholar) and in the brain (44Verger-Bocquet M.

Endocrinol. 1988; 7: 21-27Google Scholar) of T. tessulatum, numerous α-NE immunoreactive cells are observed in the epithelium of anterior and posterior suckers (Figs. 1, panels 1 and 2). In T. tessulatum, the α-NE-like material exhibited subepidermal bodies located among muscular and mucous gland cells. These small cells, 6-10 µm in diameter, possess a large nucleus (3-5 µm) for their size (Fig. 1, panels 4 and 5). They bear elongated processes that terminate immediately beneath the cuticle (Fig. 1, panel 3) and are abundant (>12,000/mm2). None of the processes had pores through the cuticle (Fig. 1, panel 7). At the ultrastructural level, numerous granules can be noted in the cell body and in the processes. These ovoid or somewhat crescent-shaped granules (0.2-0.3 µm) are characterized by a homogenous electron-dense material (Fig. 1, panel 7). After immunogold labeling, numerous colloidal gold particles are observed in these granules (Fig. 1, panels 6 and 8). Central nervous systems (1000) or suckers (400) were subjected to a peptide extraction in 1 M acetic acid, pH 2. ELISA revealed in crude extract 6.32 ± 1.8 pmol of α-NE-like material/CNS and 15.45 ± 4.6 pmol of α-NE-like material/sucker (after acetonic precipitation). Crude extracts were prepurified using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. The fraction eluted by 50% of acetonitrile was reduced 20-fold by freeze-drying and applied to a HPGPC column. Eluted fractions tested in DIA revealed a single immunoreactive zone in the two cases (CNS or suckers) corresponding to peptides with molecular mass of ~1-4.5 kDa (data not shown). An amount of 5.45 ± 0.75 pmol of α-NE-like material/CNS (recovery of ~87%) and of 13.44 ± 2.25 pmol of α-NE-like material/sucker (recovery of ~82%) was obtained. Results obtained after preadsorption of the antiserum by synthetic α-NE established the specificity of the immunodetection. Each immunoreactive fraction was then concentrated 20-fold and applied to a reversed-phase HPLC. In a first step of reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column, α-NE-like substances (suckers or CNS) eluted at a same retention time (RT) comprised between 21-22 (corresponding to 26-27% of acetonitrile) (Fig. 2). In these conditions the vertebrate α-NE eluted at a RT of 21.85 min. Total amount of α-NE-like material determined by ELISA at this step of purification was 4.85 ± 0.92 pmol of α-NE-like material/CNS (recovery of ~80%) and of 12.63 ± 4.25 pmol of α-NE-like material/sucker (recovery of ~81%). The immunoreactive zone containing this material (suckers or CNS) was analyzed on the same column with a shallower gradient. A peak immunoreactive to anti-α-NE, at a RT comprised between 25 and 25.3 min (corresponding to 26.25-26.48% of acetonitrile), was resolved in both cases. At this step of purification, quantification by ELISA indicated an amount of 4.15 ± 0.75 pmol of α-NE-like material/CNS (recovery of ~66%) and of 10.25 ± 3.75 pmol of α-NE-like material/sucker (recovery of ~66%). In both cases (suckers or CNS), a peak was then purified to homogeneity on an ODS C18 reversed-phase column and gave in each case a single peak at a RT of 28.3 min. Purity of the immunoreactive material (suckers, CNS) was established by capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Quantification by ELISA at this step of purification indicated 3.75 ± 0.86 pmol of α-NE-like material/CNS (recovery of ~60%) and of 9.86 ± 2.62 pmol of α-NE-like material/sucker (recovery of ~64%).Fig. 3Capillary electrophoresis of purified α-NE-like peptide from T. tessulatum CNS. Analyses were performed on a 72-cm capillary in 20 mM citrate buffer at pH 2.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to ensure that the α-NE-like peptide purified either from CNS or from suckers were the same compound, a coinjection on ODS C18 reversed-phase HPLC column of the two purified peptides was performed. A single peak was eluted at a RT of 28.3 min. Moreover, a comparison of the first derivatives of absorbance of the purified α-NE-like peptide from CNS and from suckers at a same concentration revealed a total spectral overlapping between 190 and 300 nm and a ratio equal to 1, reflecting a very similar homology. After the final purification step, a fraction aliquot of the immunoreactive material was evaluated by Edman degradation. The sequence, established on 139 pmol of purified α-NE-like peptide with a sequencing yield of 95%, was Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Lys (Table II). The molecular mass of the CNS α-NE-like peptide measured by electrospray mass spectrometry (m/z = 1228.04 ± 0.06 Da) is in agreement with the calculated isotopic mass (1228.68 Da) of the α-NE (Fig. 4). The same result was obtained with the α-NE-like peptide isolated from suckers (m/z = 1228.3 ± 0.35 versus 1228.68). Moreover, coinjection on ODS C18 reversed-phase HPLC column of each purified peptides (CNS, suckers) and synthetic α-NE revealed a single peak at a RT of 28.5 min. This procedure established that the primary structure of T. tessulatum α-NE-like peptide is fully superposable on that of vertebrate α-NE peptide. Its amount was estimated to 2.45 ± 1.15 pmol/CNS and 8.95 ± 2.15 pmol/sucker.Table IIAutomated Edman degradation of 139 pmol of the α-neoendorphin-related peptide, with central nervous system of the leech T. tessulatumCycle no.PTH-XaaYield (pmol)1Tyr100.462Gly121.243Gly141.174Phe124.65Leu1556Arg43.957Lys100.488Tyr99.529Pro63.6410Lys62.95 Open table in a new tab The present study demonstrates that to the peptide α-NE isolated from the CNS and suckers of the leech T. tessulatum is structurally identical with the one identified in vertebrates (YGGFLRKYPK). The characterization of α-NE in the leech constitutes the first report of the presence of a prodynorphin-derived peptide in an invertebrate. The same true α-NE was isolated and identified both from CNS and suckers of mature T. tessulatum. α-Neoendorphin immunoreactivity is expressed by specific cells in CNS (44Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250 (b): 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 45Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Wattez C. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1988; 7: 21-27Google Scholar), neuroendocrine cells of the foregut (43Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1987; 6 (a): 195-199Google Scholar), and by epithelial cells at the level of the suckers in this animal. Interestingly, this is not a novel observation in that in leeches certain monoclonal antibodies reacted with cells in the CNS and with epithelial cells (18Hogg N. Flaster M. Zipser B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1983; 9: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Such an observation of a common localization among neurons and epithelial cells is very frequent in vertebrates. The present study also shows that α-NE immunoreactive cells in T. tessulatum suckers have morphological and ultrastructural characteristics close to the “releasing gland cells” of adhesive organs of the Branchiobdellids (13Farnesi R.M. Marinelli M. Tei S. Vagnetti D. J. Morphol. 1981; 170: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar; 18Hogg N. Flaster M. Zipser B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1983; 9: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; 15Gelder S.R. Rowe J.P. Can. J. Zool. 1988; 66: 2057-2064Crossref Google Scholar; 47Weigl A.M. Trans. Am. Microsc. Soc. 1994; 113: 276-301Crossref Google Scholar). These cells might constitute with the viscid gland cells a duo-gland adhesive organ (42Tyler N. Zoomorphology. 1976; 84: 1-76Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this regard, the sticky secretion of the viscid cells is used for substrate attachment and the secretion of the releasing cells may assist in detachment. However, we never found pores for these cells or releasing granules on the surface of the leech suckers. The same observation was made by 47Weigl A.M. Trans. Am. Microsc. Soc. 1994; 113: 276-301Crossref Google Scholar in Branchiobdellids. The function of these releasing cells is currently not understood. Interestingly, they may be derived from nerve cells (42Tyler N. Zoomorphology. 1976; 84: 1-76Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar; 15Gelder S.R. Rowe J.P. Can. J. Zool. 1988; 66: 2057-2064Crossref Google Scholar), an observation that is based on similarities in structure and staining properties between them. In Branchiobdellids, the interpretation of 13Farnesi R.M. Marinelli M. Tei S. Vagnetti D. J. Morphol. 1981; 170: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar is that these cells are neurons and the granules might be considered neurosecretory granules. 13Farnesi R.M. Marinelli M. Tei S. Vagnetti D. J. Morphol. 1981; 170: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar suggest that the releasing cells are actually neurons with junctions on the viscid adhesive cell ducts to control the release of the viscid secretion granules. In T. tessulatum, the hypothesis of the nerve cell nature of these releasing cells is sustained by our observations showing that their intracytoplasmic granules (0.2-0.3 µm) contain α-NE, identical to the one present in specific neurons. It is known that in leeches, neurons and epithelial cells are derived from the same blastomeres (48Weisblat D.A. Harper G. Stent G.S. Sawyer R.T. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 58-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In Hirudinea, 41Stewart R.R. Macagno E.R. Zipser B. Brain Res. 1985; 332: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar suggest that the epidermal cells recognized by monoclonal antibodies specific to the CNS are indeed peripheral neurons. Their study with the monoclonal antibody Lan 3-6 shows that during the embryonic development the same labeled epithelial cells possess an apical dendrite and a basal process; therefore, they are neurons. 41Stewart R.R. Macagno E.R. Zipser B. Brain Res. 1985; 332: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar suggest that the expression of the antigens in the axon, is either absent or below the level detectable with these technique in this cell. To answer this question anatomical experiences, e.g. anterograde transport, could be conducted. In T. tessulatum, as in Branchiobdellids (47Weigl A.M. Trans. Am. Microsc. Soc. 1994; 113: 276-301Crossref Google Scholar), continuity between these cells and necks of the viscid cells are scarce, which reinforces the improbable nervous control as proposed by 13Farnesi R.M. Marinelli M. Tei S. Vagnetti D. J. Morphol. 1981; 170: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar. If the nerve nature of these α-NE positive sucker cells is confirmed and considering their abundance, we could propose that they exert an important role either in the control of the adhesivity or in one of the multiple sensorial functions of the suckers. The existence of secretory granules suggests that α-NE can be released in the intracellular spaces and acts via a paracrine mechanism. Although that relationship between Branchiobdellids and the other clitellates remains unclear (19Holt P.C. Hydrobiologia. 1989; 180: 1-5Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar; 2Brinkhurst R.O. Gelder S.R. Hydrobiologia. 1989; 180: 7-15Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the discovery in T. tessulatum of cells resembling the releasing cells of Branchiobdellids argues in favor of a link between adhesive organs of Branchiobdellids and suckers of Hirudinea. Furthermore, in the CNS of the leech, the α-NE secretion of neurons into the circulatory system at the neurohemal site suggests a hormonal role. Alternatively, an action as neurotransmitter or neuromodulator at the level of nerve endings located in the dorsal commissure or the neuropile is also possible, as in the presence of both mechanisms in these animals. The fact that α-NE is highly conserved in course of evolution from annelids to vertebrates suggests an essential function for this peptide. Actually we know that peptides conserved during evolution appear to keep an action on a same physiological function. This argument is sustained by two neuropeptides, acting on the osmoregulation, isolated in both T. tessulatum and vertebrates, i.e. the lysine-conopressin (28Salzet M. Bulet P. Van Dorsselaer A. Malecha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217 (a): 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the angiotensin II (30Salzet M. Bulet P. Wattez C. Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (b): 1575-1582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, it is known that opioids are involved in variety of physiological functions and interact with endocrine system. The endogenous opioids peptides appear to have a role in the interaction between the CNS and the immune system (35Scharrer B. Am. Zool. 1990; 30: 887-895Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar; 34Scharrer Smith E.M. Stefano G.B. Neuropeptides in Neuroimmunology. Springer, Heidelberg Germany1994Google Scholar). In invertebrates, until now, by contrast, nothing is known about the role of α-NE. Consequently, the leech provides for a good model system in which to study this conserved peptide as well as the presence of a possibly conserved precursor, i.e. prodynorphin. The existence of an ancestral proenkephalin gene is supported by the isolation of enkephalin peptides in invertebrate taxa, i.e. the crustacea Carcinus maenas (23Luschen W. Buck F. Willig A. Jarros P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8671-8675Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), in the mollusk Mytilus edulis (22Leung M.K. Stefano G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 955-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and in the leech T. tessulatum (32Salzet M. Wattez C. Bulet P. Malecha J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the ratio of Leu-enkephalin and Met-enkephalin in C. maenas and T. tessulatum is 3:1 and 2:1, respectively, whereas in vertebrates and Mytilus edulis Met-enkephalin is the major opioid peptide. Moreover, immunocytochemical studies performed at the level of T. tessulatum brains revealed that Leu-enkephalin and Met-enkephalin are not detected in the same cells (44Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250 (b): 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). From these observations several hypothesis can be given. First, unlike in vertebrates, there are two separated genes, one coding for Met-enkephalin and the other for Leu-enkephalin. Second, the two pentapeptides come from a unique ancestral proenkephalin precursor and the expression of Met- or Leu-enkephalin is due to different posttranslation processing mechanisms; Leu-enkephalin is not expressed in cells expressing Met-enkephalin and vice versa. If we consider the first hypothesis, the question that is raised is: what can be the second opioid precursor, i.e. a prodynorphin or a POMC-like precursor? Peptides yielded from POMC processing have been identified by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay in invertebrates, i.e. ACTH and β endorphin in the mollusk Planorbarius corneus (14Franchesi C. Ottaviani E. J. Immunol. Res. 1992; 4: 53-55Google Scholar) and in insects (11Duve H. Thorpe A. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), β endorphin in the flatworms (27Reuter M. Gustafsson M. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1989; 52: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and MSH, and endorphins in annelids (3Dhainaut-Courtois N. Tramu G. Beauvillain J.C. Masson M. Neurochem. Int. 1986; 8: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar; 43Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1987; 6 (a): 195-199Google Scholar, 44Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250 (b): 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 45Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Wattez C. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1988; 7: 21-27Google Scholar). These results envisage the existence of a POMC-like precursor in invertebrates. Complete molecular studies have been performed in the trematod Schistosoma mansoni, where a gene related to the vertebrate POMC has been cloned (10Duvaux-Miret O. Dissous C. Gautran J.P. Pattou E. Kordon C. Capron A. New Biol. 1992; 2: 93-99Google Scholar; 9Duvaux-Miret O. Capron A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 650: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, according to 8Duvaux-Miret O. Capron A. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1991; 1: 41-57Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (12) Google Scholar, the extremely high homology between the genes of S. mansoni and vertebrates may be the result of a transfer of genetic material from the host toward the parasite, probably by a viral mechanism. The other possibility is a high evolutionary conservation through selective pressure, which has allowed S. mansoni to synthesize molecules highly similar to the host endogenous signals; this could be used to avoid the host defense (8Duvaux-Miret O. Capron A. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1991; 1: 41-57Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recently, a peptide belonging to the POMC vertebrate family has been isolated in T. tessulatum brains. This peptide is related to the Vertebrate γ-MSH and presented ~80% sequence homology with vertebrates γ1-MSH (32Salzet M. Wattez C. Bulet P. Malecha J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, in the leech T. tessulatum, the γ-MSH-like peptide seems be localized in a multipeptidic precursor different from POMC (31Salzet M. Wattez C. Baert J.L. Malecha J. Brain Res. 1993; 631 (b): 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Salzet M. Bulet P. Wattez C. Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (b): 1575-1582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other peptides present in this multiple hormones precursor have recently been isolated in leeches, i.e. AI and AII (21Laurent V. Bulet P. Salzet M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 190: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; 31Salzet M. Wattez C. Baert J.L. Malecha J. Brain Res. 1993; 631 (b): 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Salzet M. Bulet P. Wattez C. Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (b): 1575-1582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results tend to favor the absence in leeches of a true POMC precursor. If we consider that POMC is absent in annelids, the hypothesis of a prodynorphin-like precursor can be suggested. Furthermore as suggested by 40Stefano G.B. Leung M.K. Zhao X. Scharrer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, detection by immunocytochemistry of the prodynorphin end-products makes it difficult to imagine that proenkephalin is the only source of Leu-enkephalin in neural tissue. It could also derive from a prodynorphin. Although epitopes of the different prodynorphin end-products are immunologically recognized in nervous system of different invertebrates, their chemical nature is unknown. However, in the leech T. tessulatum, α-NE and the dynorphin-like peptides are expressed in different neurons (44Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Tramu G. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250 (b): 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 45Verger-Bocquet M. Malecha J. Wattez C. Tramu G. Comp. Endocrinol. 1988; 7: 21-27Google Scholar). Only the characterization of the α-NE precursor would demonstrate precisely if a prodynorphin-like gene existed in annelids. Our discovery of the α-NE confirms the very ancient stature of opioids in metazoans and the hypothesis emitted by Stefano et al. (1989) that the highly regulated vertebrate immune system probably had its origin in the invertebrates. These molecules would be used since the beginning of the evolution to start a type of integrated reply in order to maintained the body homeostasis (14Franchesi C. Ottaviani E. J. Immunol. Res. 1992; 4: 53-55Google Scholar) and notably in neuroimmunity reactions (39Stefano G.B. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as well as documented neuroregulatory actions (20Kream R.M. Zukin R.S. Stefano G.B. J. Biol.

This study examines the effect of this nonproductive synthesis on promoter clearance and determines other parameters that might affect stuttering synthesis by analyzing a mutant RNAP, RpoB3449, that has altered its function at this process at galP2. RpoB3449 has dramatically diminished stuttering synthesis, and consequently, it has increased the rate of productive initiation due to its enhanced rate of promoter clearance of galP2 compared with wild-type RNAP. Thus, a direct linkage between promoter clearance and productive transcription is demonstrated. The mechanism by which the mutant RNAP has altered the switch between nonproductive stuttering synthesis and productive initiation during promoter clearance is studied. Apparently, RpoB3449 has increased its efficiency in incorporating CTP at the +5 position of the galP2 transcript leading to its reduced stuttering synthesis, indicating that the rate of an RNAP incorporating the CTP after a stretch of uridine residues is important for promoter clearance at galP2. Because RpoB3449 demonstrates “wild-type” stuttering synthesis at the mutant galP2 promoter, which contains the 6 residue at the +5 position, it indicates that the mutant RNAP has altered in binding CTP at this context. Further experiments indicate that it is the +5 position per se of the galP2 sequence rather than a particular nucleotide at that position that is critical in determining the switch between the two alternate pathways during transcription initiation.

One of the potential regulatory steps in prokaryotic transcription is promoter clearance, a transition step in transcription initiation at which an RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseRifrrifampicin resistancebpbase pair(s). switches from an initial transcribing stage to an elongation stage (for reviews see (1.von Hippel P.H.

Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar)). During promoter clearance, RNAP usually also makes two forms of nonproductive initiation products in a promoter-dependent manner: (i) abortive synthesis(3.McClure R.M. Cech C.L. J. Biol.

Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas abortive synthesis is common at most promoters. Recently, evidence of biological significance for these nonproductive syntheses in gene expression is emerging. Nonproductive stuttering syntheses have been shown at the Escherichia coli native pyrBI and galP2 promoters(11.Liu C. Heath L.S. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2904-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12.Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17221-17227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the expression of these two promoters is sensitive to changes in UTP concentration(12.Jin D.J. J. Biol.

At these two promoters, RNAP makes an abundant amount of nonproductive stuttered products and a lesser amount of productive initiation products in vitro when the concentration of UTP is high and vice versa. An E. coli mutant RNAP that overproduces abortive initiation products and reduces productive initiation at the pyrBI promoter in vitro has reduced expression from the promoter in vivo(14.Jin D.J. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 60-72Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CRP protein was shown to inhibit abortive initiation leading to an enhanced productive initiation at the malT promoter(15.Menedez M. Kolb A. Buc H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4227-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). lac repressor was suggested to modify the initial transcribing complex so that promoter clearance was inhibited(16.Lee J. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1991; 66: 793-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA sequences flanking the “classical” promoter region have been implicated to contribute to promoter function(17.Bujard H. Brunner M. Deuschle U. Kammerer W. Knaus R. Reznikoff W.S.

Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting that initially transcribed sequences of promoter may affect nonproductive syntheses and promoter clearance. Our knowledge of the parameters that affect RNAP on abortive and stuttering synthesis as well as of the mechanisms underlying the switch between nonproductive and productive initiations during promoter clearance is very limited. One approach to study these questions is to analyze mutant RNAPs that have altered function in the switching between the two alternate pathways during promoter clearance and to determine how these mutant RNAPs are perturbed in the process. For this purpose, the mutant RNAPs that confer rifampicin resistance (Rifr) were chosen first, because the antibiotic rifampicin inhibits transcription by preventing an initial transcribing complex from entering an elongation mode(3.McClure R.M. Cech C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8949-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Schulz W. Zillig W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6889-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Presumably, rifampicin plugs the pathway leading a nascent RNA out of the active center(20.Mustaev A. Zaychikov E. Severinov K. Kashlev M. Polyakov A. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12036-12040Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); thus the rifampicin-binding sites of RNAP could potentially interact with a nascent RNA. It is reasoned that some of the Rifr mutant RNAPs, which have altered binding of rifampicin, are likely to be altered in the interaction with nascent RNA leading to altered nonproductive synthesis during promoter clearance. Most of the Rifr mutations are clustered in the middle of the rpoB gene encoding the β subunit of RNAP(21.Jin D.J. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 22.Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14820-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and their effects on transcription elongation, termination/antitermination, and other functions have been characterized(23.Jin D.J.

Indeed, using this approach it was shown recently that some Rifr RNAPs that overproduced abortive initiation products have reduced productive initiation and that abortive synthesis is sensitive to the Km of an initially transcribing complex for the nucleotide UTP during transcription initiation(14.Jin D.J. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 60-72Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Some lethal mutant RNAPs that block the initiation-to-elongation transition were described, but the mechanisms underlying the blockage have not been elucidated clearly(27.Kashlev M. Lee J. Zalenskaya K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1990; 248: 1006-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28.Lee J. Kashlev M. Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, the effects of previously described Rifr mutant RNAPs on the nonproductive stuttering synthesis at galP2 are studied to uncover other parameters (in addition to be sensitive to changes in UTP concentration) that might affect promoter clearance at this promoter. It is found that a Rifr mutant RNAP, RpoB3449, has diminished stuttering synthesis and enhanced productive initiation at the galP2 promoter; thus it has altered the switch between the two alternate pathways during promoter clearance. The effect of RpoB3449 on the rate of productive initiation at galP2 is analyzed, and the results indicate that promoter clearance is a rate-limiting step for wild-type RNAP in the productive initiation of galP2. The mechanism by which RpoB3449 has altered promoter clearance at galP2 is studied, and the results indicate that the efficiency of incorporating CTP at the fifth position of galP2 transcript is critical in determining RNAP whether to engage in nonproductive stuttering synthesis or in productive initiation. Nucleotides were from Boehringer Mannheim; salts of glutamate were from Fluka; and 32P-labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Corp. or ICN. Plasmids were isolated using Qiagen column according to the manufacturer's manual followed by phenol extraction, and DNA fragments were purified by electroelution after isolation from a 1.5% agarose gel followed by phenol extraction. The 348-bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pSA509 containing the gal promoter-regulatory region and the very strong Rho-independent transcription terminator of the rpoC gene of E. coli was used as the DNA template for in vitro transcription(29.Choy H. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBHM332 (a kind gift from Dr. Charles Turnbough, Jr., University of Alabama at Birmingham), which was constructed by replacing the 322-bp PvuII fragment of pUC19 with the 758-bp PvuII fragment containing the pyrBI promoter region(30.Donahue J.P. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19091-19099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also used as the DNA template for in vitro transcription. In pBHM332, the transcriptional direction of pyrBI is opposite that of bla. RNAPs were purified from E. coli K12 MG1655 background as described(31.Hager D.A Jin D.J. Burgess R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Both the wild-type and mutant RNAP, RpoB3449, were highly pure (>95%) and had comparable activities in synthesizing the RNAI transcripts of pBR322. The gal repressor (GalR protein, a kind gift of Dr. Yan Ning Zhou) was purified as described(32.Zhou Y.N. Chatterjee S. Roy S. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The C residue at the fifth position of the galP2 coding sequence in the pSA509 plasmid was replaced with G residue as follows. First, two DNA fragments (A and B), which share 33-nucleotide sequences around the starting site (+1) of galP2 coding region, were each amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pSA509 as a DNA template. The sequences of the two primers used for amplifying DNA fragments A (∼300 bp) were: 5′-TTCTAGACCTTCCCGTTTCGCTCAAGTTAG (DJJ121), which covers the sequence upstream of the EcoRI site in pSA509, and 5′-TAGGCTTATGGTATCAAATAACCATAGCATAAC (DJJ122), which covers the complementary sequences to the coding sequences from +19 to −14 position and contains a G to C change at the +5 position. The sequences of the two primers used for amplifying DNA fragments B (∼200 bp) were: 5′-GTTATGCTATGGTTATTTGATACCATAAGCCTA (DJJ123), which covers the coding sequences from −14 to +19 position and contains a C to G change at the +5 position, and 5′-TCATAGAGTCTTGCAGACAAACTGCGCAAC (DJJ124), which covers the sequence downstream of the BamHI site in pSA509. The amplified fragments A and B were isolated from a 1.5% agarose gel and purified by electroelution followed by phenol extraction. The purified DNA fragments were then denatured and annealed at the overlapping sequences followed by Taq polymerase extension in a limited polymerase chain reaction (four cycles) to generate enough double strand DNA to be used as DNA template. Another 20 cycles of polymerase chain reaction were continued after adding two primers (DJJ121 and DJJ124) into the above reactions to amplify the fragment C (∼500 bp), which contains EcoRI and BamHI sites at either end of the fragment and a mutational change at the +5 position of galP2 coding sequence. The amplified DNA fragment C was digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes followed by purification of the resulting ∼350-bp EcoRI-BamHI fragment as described above. This EcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the mutation was ligated with the purified large EcoRI-BamHI-digested fragment of pSA509 resulting in pDJJ51, followed by transformation. Plasmid pDJJ51 DNA was purified from the Ampr transformants, and the C to G change at the +5 position of galP2 sequence was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing carried out on a model 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) using the Taq polymerase dye terminator sequencing protocol (Applied Biosystems Inc.) according to the manufacturer's manual. In vitro transcription assays were essentially as described(12.Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17221-17227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A complete transcription reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-glutamate (pH 8.0), 100 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM magnesium glutamate, 5% glycerol, acetylated bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml), DNA at ∼5 nM, and RNA polymerase at 20 nM for wild-type and 24 nM for RpoB3449, was preincubated for ≥10 min at 37°C. When indicated, GalR protein (87 nM as dimer) was also included during the preincubation period. Unless otherwise mentioned, NTP concentrations were 0.2 mM for ATP, GTP, and UTP and 0.02 mM for CTP. The reaction was started by the addition of NTPs including 32P-labeled nucleotide as indicated and stopped after 10 min or at the indicated times by the addition of a 0.2 volume of 0.2 M EDTA in 40% glycerol with dyes and put on ice. For single round transcription assays, heparin (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) was present in the NTP mixture. After heating for 3 min in boiling water, samples were loaded directly onto a polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, and transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. The nonproductive initiation products were analyzed on a 24% gel, and the productive initiation products were analyzed on a 8% gel. The transcription products were quantified with an AMBIS Imaging System(™) (San Diego, CA), and the data were corrected for background. RNAP makes nonproductive stuttering synthesis products at the galP2 promoter, and the stuttering synthesis is sensitive to the concentration of UTP(12.Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17221-17227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, at high UTP (0.2 mM), wild-type RNAP makes a large amount of stuttered products, whereas at low UTP (0.02 mM), the synthesis of stuttered product is reduced. To study the effects of previously described Rifr mutant RNAPs on stuttering synthesis from the galP2 promoter, transcription initiation assays were performed. Most Rifr mutant RNAPs behaved like wild-type RNAP in stuttering synthesis (data not shown). However, one mutant RNAP, RpoB3449, which has a deletion of an alanine at the 532 position of the β subunit of RNAP, has greatly reduced nonproductive synthesis at galP2 compared with wild-type RNAP (Fig. 1, A and C). Apparently, the effect of the mutant RNAP on stuttering synthesis is promoter-specific, because RpoB3449 behaves like wild-type RNAP at the pyrBI promoter: both RNAPs make a large amount of stuttering synthesis products at 0.2 mM UTP (high) and a lesser amount at 0.02 mM UTP (low) (Fig. 1, B and D). These results indicate that the mutant RNAP is capable of engaging in stuttering synthesis but has an altered function at the galP2 promoter (when comparable amounts of the proteins were used). To determine the mechanism by which RpoB3449 has altered stuttering synthesis at galP2, the effects of different conditions on this nonproductive initiation at galP2 were compared between wild-type and the mutant RNAPs (Fig. 2). It is known that wild-type RNAP stutters at galP2 when only the two nucleotides ATP and UTP are present (12.Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17221-17227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under this condition, RpoB3449 is capable of stuttering synthesis at galP2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 11 and 12), just like wild-type RNAP (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4; see also Fig. 2B). Because the patterns of stuttering syntheses by the two RNAPs are similar and sensitive to the concentration of UTP, it rules out the possibility that RpoB3449 had an altered apparent Km for UTP leading to reduced stuttering synthesis. Because RpoB3449 has diminished stuttering synthesis in the presence of four nucleotides, whereas it is proficient in stuttering synthesis in the presence of only ATP and UTP, it suggests that the presence of either GTP or CTP affects the ability of the mutant RNAP to make stuttering synthesis products at the galP2 promoter. The effects of GTP and CTP on the stuttering synthesis by both RNAPs were studied (Fig. 2). For RpoB3449, omission of GTP from a complete transcription reaction leads to a large reduction in stuttering synthesis compared with that of wild-type RNAP (compare lanes 15 and 16 with lanes 7 and 8 in Fig. 2A); RpoB3449 behaves as if all four nucleotides were present (compare lanes 9 and 10 with lanes 1 and 2; see also Fig. 2B). However, when CTP was omitted from a complete transcription reaction, both the mutant and wild-type RNAPs made comparable amounts of stuttering synthesis products (compare lanes 13 and 14 with lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 2A; see also Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the presence of CTP is responsible for the reduced stuttering synthesis by RpoB3449 at the galP2 promoter. Because CTP is the next nucleotide to be incorporated after the three continuous uridine residues of the nascent RNA oligomer pppAUUU, it is hypothesized that RpoB3449 has increased its efficiency in incorporating CTP at the fifth position of the transcript. Therefore, this mutant RNAP accelerates the rate of polymerization of pppAUUUC, resulting in reduced stuttering synthesis and enhanced promoter clearance at galP2. If the proposed model is correct, one would predict that stuttering synthesis at galP2 by both wild-type and the mutant RNAPs will be sensitive to the concentration of CTP. Furthermore, at high enough concentrations of CTP, wild-type RNAP will have reduced stuttering synthesis, simulating the phenotype of RpoB3449. Conversely, when the concentration of CTP is low enough to reduce the efficiency of the mutant RNAP in incorporating the nucleotide, RpoB3449 should be able to make significant amounts of stuttered products. To determine whether the above predictions are true, transcription assays were performed at a variety of CTP concentrations while keeping the other NTP concentrations constant, and transcription products were analyzed. The results are in complete agreement with the above hypothesis (Fig. 3). Overall, for both RNAPs there is an inverse relationship between the amount of the stuttered products being made and the concentration of CTP used in the assay (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, wild-type RNAP made few stuttered products when the concentration of CTP was high (≥0.2 mM, lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3A) but an abundant amount of the stuttered products when the concentrations of CTP were low (≤0.02 mM, lanes 4-6). When the concentration of CTP was very low (0.001 mM, lane 6), wild-type RNAP made almost the maximum amount of the stuttered products, comparable with that made in the absence of CTP (lane 7). This result indicates that at 1 μM CTP most of the initially transcribing complexes are trapped in the nonproductive synthesis mode. On the other hand, RpoB3449 made only very few of the stuttered products when the concentrations of CTP were >0.005 mM (lanes 8-12) but a significant amount of the stuttered products when the concentration of CTP was very low at 0.001 mM (lane 13). In the absence of CTP in the reaction, the mutant RNAP made the maximum amount of the stuttered products (lane 14). The effect is CTP-specific, because the stuttering synthesis at galP2 by wild-type RNAP was not sensitive to the concentration of GTP (data not shown). These results indicate that the rate of incorporation of CTP at the fifth position of the galP2 transcript is important in determining the efficiency of stuttering synthesis and promoter clearance. It is possible that it is not CTP per se but rather the fifth position of the galP2 sequence (e.g., the base that follows the run of uridine residues) that is critical in determining the efficiency of stuttering synthesis by RNAP. If this was the case, one would predict that by changing CTP to another nucleotide at that position, stuttering synthesis at galP2 would become sensitive to the concentration of the new nucleotide. To determine whether in stuttering synthesis at galP2 the effect is CTP- or position-specific, the C at the fifth position was replaced with G by localized mutagenesis, and the effect of the concentration of GTP on stuttering synthesis was analyzed. The results showed that with the new DNA template, stuttering synthesis by both RNAPs became sensitive to the changes in the concentration of GTP and the amount of stuttered products made was an inverse function of the concentration of GTP (Fig. 4). These results have demonstrated that the effect is position-specific and not CTP-specific, indicating that the fifth position of the galP2 sequence is a critical point in determining stuttering synthesis and promoter clearance at galP2. Furthermore, in contrast to the stuttering synthesis with the wild-type galP2 sequence (Fig. 3), the patterns of stuttering synthesis between the wild-type and the mutant RNAPs are basically the same with the new DNA template containing a C to G change at the fifth position of the galP2 sequence (Fig. 4). The wild-type phenotype of stuttering synthesis by the mutant RNAP with the new DNA template further argues for the notion that the mutant RNAP has an enhanced efficiency in incorporating CTP at the fifth position of the wild-type galP2 sequence, leading to its reduced stuttering synthesis at the promoter. At the present, the possibility that this mutant RNAP affects the Km for CTP or other nucleoside triphosphates during transcription at other contexts cannot be excluded. -Because an initially transcribing RNAP either completes promoter clearance to enter elongation mode or engages in nonproductive stuttering synthesis at galP2, one would predict that promoter clearance is a rate-limiting step for productive initiation when stuttering synthesis occurs. The alteration of RpoB3449 in stuttering synthesis at galP2 provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of the nonproductive initiation on promoter clearance and productive initiation. Because of its reduced stuttering synthesis, the mutant RNAP is likely to have an increased rate of promoter clearance leading to an increased productive initiation compared with wild-type RNAP. To test this hypothesis, the accumulation of both stuttered and the full-length galP2 transcripts (as the productive initiation products) by the two RNAPs was determined as a function of time in a single round transcription assay (i.e., in the presence of heparin) (Fig. 5A). In these assays only transcription from galP2 was measured because GalR repressor protein, which only inhibits transcription from galP1 in vitro(29.Choy H. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and has no effect on stuttering synthesis at galP2(12.Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17221-17227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was included in the reactions. For wild-type RNAP, stuttered products appeared as early as 20 s, indicating that the time needed for RNAP to make oligomers of stuttered products is very short. Full-length transcript P2 appeared at 40 s, the time needed for both promoter clearance and the completion of the transcript elongation, and its amount was increased gradually as time increased. The accumulation of the full-length transcript was parallel with that of the stuttered products as a function of time, indicating that at an any given time only a fraction of the initially transcribing complexes has completed the promoter clearance at galP2 to enter transcription elongation and to finish a productive initiation cycle. Note that more full-length products were made at 15 min than at 6 min, indicating that even after 6 min there were still some wild-type RNAP molecules remaining at the promoter (Fig. 5C). Therefore, promoter clearance at galP2 is a rate-limiting step for productive initiation due to stuttering synthesis for wild-type RNAP. However, in contrast to wild-type RNAP, the mutant RNAP made increasing amounts of the full-length transcript rapidly and lesser amount of the stuttered products (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the accumulation of the full-length transcript approached the plateau within 3 min, when most RNAP molecules had finished a productive initiation cycle (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that at any given time, a larger fraction of the initially transcribing RpoB3449 complexes has completed promoter clearance, and consequently it takes less time for most of the mutant RNAP molecules to finish a productive initiation cycle compared with wild-type RNAP. Clearly, RpoB3449 has a faster rate of promoter clearance due to reduced stuttering synthesis. The effect of the rate of promoter clearance on the productive initiation was further manifested in a multiple round transcription assay (i.e., in the absence of heparin). As shown above, during stuttering synthesis wild-type RNAP does not vacate the promoter, and it remains idling at the promoter for a long duration. Thus, it follows that promoter turnover must be also a rate-limiting step in productive initiation. One expected consequence of this event is a reduced ability to productively initiate in a multiple round transcription assay. In contrast, because RpoB3449 has enhanced the rate of promoter clearance or promoter turnover, there is a better chance for free mutant RNAP molecules to bind to vacated promoters leading to a relative large difference in productive initiation in a multiple round transcription assay compared with that in a single round transcription assay. To test this predication, a multiple round transcription assay was performed. The results are in complete agreement with the above hypothesis (Fig. 5B). For wild-type RNAP, the difference in the overall patterns of the production of galP2 products, in particular for the full-length transcript, was small between the multiple round transcription (Fig. 5B) and the single round transcription (Fig. 5A). Noticeable increase in the production of the full-length galP2 products only occurred after 6 min, and there was only about 40% increase in the production of the productive initiation products in a multiple round transcription compared with that in a single round transcription after 15 min (Fig. 5C). In contrast, for RpoB3449, there was a marked difference in the amount of the full-length galP2 transcript between the multiple round transcription (Fig. 5B) and the single round transcription (Fig. 5A). Significant increases in the production of the full-length galP2 products occurred at 3 min, and as time increased the difference in the production of the full-length transcript between the two assays becomes even larger, and there was an over 3-fold increase in the production of the productive initiation products in a multiple round transcription compared with that in a single round transcription after 15 min (Fig. 5C). At all time points, the mutant RNAP made more productive initiation products than wild-type RNAP, and the effects became most prominent as the time increases in the multiple round transcription assay (Fig. 5C). Clearly, the observed dramatic differences in the productive initiation of galP2 between wild-type and the mutant RNAPs at later time points reflect the amplified intrinsic differences in the rates of promoter clearance between the two RNAPs in a multiple round transcription assay. Stuttering synthesis has been reported both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms(33.Jacques J.-P. Kolakofsky D. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This work presents the first analysis of a mutant RNAP that has altered nonproductive stuttering synthesis during transcription initiation. The perturbation of stuttering synthesis at galP2 by RpoB3449 has provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of nonproductive synthesis on promoter clearance and to study the mechanism (other than UTP concentration) underlying the switch between nonproductive and productive initiation during promoter clearance. During stuttering synthesis, RNAP is able to engage in multiple cycles of initiation without dissociation from the promoter. Furthermore, for each new cycle of initiation, only a fraction of RNAP molecules is able to incorporate the CTP at the fifth position of the galP2 transcript. Only then an initially transcribing complex will be able to complete the promoter clearance step to enter the elongation mode and finish a productive initiation cycle. This is consistent with the observation that the accumulation of the nonproductive initiation products is parallel with that of the productive initiation products in the presence of heparin over a long period of time. Such a prolonged delay in promoter clearance will reduce the rate of the production of the productive initiation products accompanied by an exaggerated accumulation of nonproductive initiation products (both abortive and stuttered products). The mutant RNAP has diminished nonproductive synthesis; therefore it “by-passes” the rate-limiting step leading to a faster rate in productive initiation at galP2 compared with wild-type RNAP. Therefore, the observed dramatic differences between wild-type and the mutant RNAPs in the synthesis of the galP2 products (Fig. 5) demonstrates a direct link between nonproductive stuttering synthesis and productive initiation during promoter clearance. This is an analogy to another case study showing a direct link between abortive initiation and productive initiation during promoter clearance(14.Jin D.J. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 60-72Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the strength of a promoter can be regulated beyond the steps of RNAP binding to a promoter and isomerization, two parameters that have been studied extensively in determine the strength of a classical promoter (34.Hawley D.K. Malan T.P. Mulligan M.E. McClure W.R. Rodriguez R.L. Chamberlin M.J. Promoters: Structure and Function. Praeger, New York1982: 54-68Google Scholar). By analyzing the mechanism by which the mutant RNAP has altered stuttering synthesis at galP2, a “checkpoint” model has evolved for the switch between nonproductive stuttering synthesis and productive initiation during promoter clearance (Fig. 6). According to this model, the rate of incorporation of CTP at the fifth position of galP2 transcript serves as a checkpoint in determining the fate of an initially transcribing complex containing the pppAUUU oligomer. Thus, if the effective concentration of CTP is limiting relative to UTP, the probability of an initially transcribing complex to produce pppAUUUC will be low, leading to enhanced stuttering synthesis. Conversely, when the effective concentration of CTP is abundant, the probability of an initially transcribing complex to produce pppAUUUC will be high, leading to reduced stuttering synthesis and enhanced promoter clearance. In essence, the competition between the rate of incorporating an extra uridine and the rate of incorporating the cytidine to the nascent RNAP oligomer pppAUUU will determine the outcome of an initially transcribing complex into either of the alternate pathways during transcription initiation. RpoB3449 is in a sense a checkpoint mutant of RNAP that has altered the switch between alternate pathways in transcription initiation of galP2, because it has increased efficiency in incorporating CTP at the +5 position of galP2 transcript compared with wild-type RNAP. The fact that RpoB3449 demonstrates wild-type stuttering synthesis at the mutant galP2 promoter, which contains the G residue at the +5 position, indicates that the alteration of the mutant RNAP is probably in binding CTP. Furthermore, this study has demonstrated that the fifth position of the galP2 initially transcribing sequence, rather than a particular nucleotide at that position, is critical in determining promoter clearance. This result indicates that this fifth position, most likely because it lies immediately after the run of uridine residues that are responsible for stuttering synthesis, imposes a high energy barrier that an initially transcribing complex has to overcome. However, it is not likely that in general the fifth position of the initially transcribing sequence is critical in promoter clearance at all promoters. Rather, it is the specific context at the galP2 sequence that makes the fifth position a critical one. It is known that the stretch rU•dA sequences before the fifth position of the galP2 sequence in an initially transcribing complex are intrinsically unstable(14.Jin D.J. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 60-72Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35.Martin F.H. Tinoco Jr., I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 2259-2299Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). When 5′-Br-UTP was used in the place of UTP, the stuttering synthesis at galP2 was reduced dramatically (data not shown); presumably the more stable 5′-Br-U•dA pairs prevented the short RNA oligomers from dissociation from an initially transcribing complex. Therefore, the competition between the rate of incorporation of an extra UTP, leading to the release of a stuttered product, and the rate of incorporation of CTP, leading to a stabilized initially transcribing complex at this critical position of the galP2 sequence, will determine the efficiency of stuttering synthesis and promoter clearance. Why does RNAP tend to make nonproductive initiation products during the transition step between transcription initiation and elongation? It has been speculated that in an initially transcribing complex, RNAP establishes the RNA binding sites, which are postulated to be important in maintaining the integrity of an elongation complex(36.Chamberlin M.J. The Harvey Lectures. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 1-21Google Scholar). It is conceivable that conversion from an initiation to an elongation complex, accompanied by σ factor release is a stress-inducing process. Such a stress state would likely sensitize RNAP to respond to the availability of nucleotides for incorporation at putative critical position(s) in the initially transcribed sequences at some promoters. Because the mature RNA binding sites have not been established yet in an initially transcribing complex, the association of oligomer to the complex is likely to be weak and dissociation-prone, in particular, if the initially transcribed sequences have a run of uridine residues. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the termination efficiency at intrinsic terminators also depends on the rate of RNAP incorporation of a critical nucleotide that lies immediately after a run of uridine residues at the end of terminator sites(37.McDowell J.C. Roberts J.W. Jin D.J. Gross C. Science. 1994; 266: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This similarity between promoter clearance and termination suggests that there is a common mechanism underlying the two processes. It would be interesting to determine whether it is the particular nucleotide or the particular position at those terminators that is important in determining termination efficiency. We are just beginning in understanding the promoter clearance step in transcription initiation. This and other work (14.Jin D.J. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 60-72Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) indicate the importance of Km of an initially transcribing complex for critical nucleotide in promoter clearance at some promoters. Other experiments show that at some other promoters, promoter clearance is not sensitive to the changes in nucleotide concentration but is stimulated by the transcript cleavage factors GreA and GreB(38.Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is likely that the limiting step(s) in promoter clearance at different promoters is different, indicating that control of promoter clearance is a complex process and appears to be promoter-specific (or context-dependent).

https://openalex.org/W1988357838,"The ADC4 mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was studied to determine the structural and functional consequences of the absence of PsaD in photosystem I. Isolated ADC4 membranes were shown to be deficient in ferredoxin-mediated NADP25 reduction, even though charge separation between P700 and FA/FB occurred with high efficiency. Unlike the wild type, FB became preferentially photoreduced when ADC4 membranes were illuminated at 15 K, and the EPR line shapes were relatively broad. Membrane fragments oriented in two dimensions on thin mylar films showed that the g tensor axes of FA- and FB- were identical in the ADC4 and wild type strains, implying that PsaC is oriented similarly on the reaction center. PsaC and the FA/FB iron-sulfur clusters are lost more readily from the ADC4 membranes after treatment with Triton X-100 or chaotropic agents, implying a stabilizing role for PsaD. The specific role of Lys106 of PsaD, which can be cross-linked to Glu93 of ferredoxin (Lelong et al.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10034-10039), was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Chemical cross-linking and protease treatment experiments did not reveal any drastic alterations in the conformation of the mutant PsaD proteins. The EPR spectra of FA and FB in membranes of the Lys106 mutants were similar to those of the wild type. Membranes of all Lys106 mutants showed wild type rates of flavodoxin reduction and flavodoxin-mediated NADP25 reduction, but had 10-54% decrease in the ferredoxin-mediated NADP25 reduction rates. This implies that Lys106 is a dispensable component of the docking site on the reducing side of photosystem I and an ionic interaction between Lys106 of PsaD and Glu93 of ferredoxin is not essential for electron transfer to ferredoxin. These results demonstrate that PsaD serves distinct roles in modulating the EPR spectral characteristics of FA and FB, in stabilizing PsaC on the reaction center, and in facilitating ferredoxin-mediated NADP25 photoreduction on the reducing side of photosystem I."

The complexity of the three-step assembly process including fibrinogen activation, protofibril formation, and fiber bundling lends itself to the diversity of fibrin structure originally noted by Ferry(2.Ferry J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1952; 38: 566-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final fibrin structure depends on many factors such as the rate of monomer production, fibrin monomer concentration, the number of polymerization sites present on the fibrin monomer, pH, ionic strength, solution viscosity, the presence of other charged molecules, and volume exclusion effects(1.Ferry J.D.

A recent challenge to the Hall-Slayter model by Hunziker et al.(16.Hunziker E.B. Straub P.W. Haeberli A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7455-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) refutes the overlapping monomer sequence in the protofibril. Protofibril assembly in the Hunziker model requires the existence of a fibrin monomer with only one FpA removed (AdesA) in sufficient concentrations and with a sufficient lifetime to assemble a non-overlapping protofibril. The fundamental difference in these two models arises from differences in the protofibril structure, which depends on the predominance and stability of AdesA compared with desAA fibrin monomers. Report for the existence of the AdesA monomer is based on gel exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy(16.Hunziker E.B. Straub P.W. Haeberli A. J. Biol.

Other investigators using similar methods and peptide sequencing experiments do not find the AdesA fibrin monomer in either sufficient quantity or lifetime to be a significant factor in fibrin assembly(20.Janmey P.A.

It is the purpose of this report to apply a methodology that permits direct observation and evaluation in real time of the transient intermediates that form during the activation of fibrinogen. Electrophoretic quasi elastic light scattering (ELS) can resolve structural differences between fibrin monomers because of differences in the columbic charge on the different activation intermediates. Quasi elastic light scattering (QLS) without electrophoresis reports on changes in the diffusion coefficients resulting from differences in the mass of the molecule. Thus, ELS should be better suited to study activation products of fibrinogen activation than QLS, since the fibrinopeptide cleavage changes the charge substantially but does not reduce the mass appreciably. Highly purified human band I fibrinogen (less than 10% band II) was used in these experiments(23.Galanakis D.K. Lane B.P. Simon S.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A working solution of 0.5 mg/ml stock fibrinogen was prepared from a freshly thawed fibrinogen stock solution at 0.3 M NaCl by diluting with 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM Hepes at pH 7.4. Contaminating dust and large fibrinogen aggregates in the working solution were reduced by filtration through a 0.22-mm filter followed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 90 min. The final fibrinogen concentration was determined from the solution optical density at 280 nm in a Cary 3E UV/VIS spectrophotometer using an extinction coefficient of 1.6 ml/mg. Further dilution of the working solution to obtain a desired fibrinogen concentration was made with 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM Hepes at pH 7.4. Fibrinogen was activated with 0.005 NIH units/ml human α-thrombin (Sigma). A low concentration of thrombin was used to slow fibrinopeptide cleavage to a rate that could be observed in our experiment. The fibrinogen-thrombin mixture was sampled at various times (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 60, and 90 min), and thrombin was inhibited by the addition of phenylalanyl prolyl arginine chloromethyl ketone (final concentration of 2.5 μM) at each stage. Fibrinogen quenched at various stages of activation was then examined in the ELS spectrometer for the presence of intermediate activation species. Experiments to examine the release of only fibrinopeptide A were carried out using Atroxin, an enzyme derived from Bothrops atrox (Sigma). In these experiments, Atroxin was added at a final concentration of 1.25 ng/ml, in place of thrombin, which gave equivalent fibrin gelation times. Fibrinopeptide B removal was examined in a similar experiment by adding an enzyme purified from Agkistrodon controtrix venom (Sigma) at 2 μg/ml. Although this enzyme removes predominately fibrinopeptide B, 30% fibrinopeptide A is also cleaved (9.Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Hunziker E.B. Straub P.W. Haeberli A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7455-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ELS measurements were made on a multi-angle quasi elastic light scattering spectrometer (DELSA 440, Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah, FL) mounted on a Newport vibration isolation table. Simultaneous measurements were made at four different scattering angles. The electrophoretic effect was obtained by superimposing a uniform electric field (usually 150-500 volts/cm) across the sample. The field was pulsed and its polarity alternated to avoid mass accumulation. The scattered intensity (Is) from a moving particle at a fixed scattering angle (θs) is observed as an oscillating intensity described in the heterodyne experiment as a second order field autocorrelation function(24.Johnson Jr., C.S. Gabriel D.A. Laser Light Scattering. Dover Publication Inc., New York1995Google Scholar, 25.Ware B.R. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 1974; 4: 1-44Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26.Johnson Jr., C.S. Gabriel D.A. Bell J.Ellis Spectroscopy in Biochemistry. Vol 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1980: 177-272Google Scholar), GLhet2(′r)=Iι2+2Iι<Is>cos(K⋅vdT)e−DK2τ(Eq. 1) where τ is the time increment, Io is the intensity of the reference beam (local oscillator), and <Is> is the average intensity of the scattered light. K is the scattering vector defined by where θs is the scattering angle, n is the refractive index, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, vd is the velocity of the scattering particle, and D is the diffusion coefficient. The important quantity in this expression is K•vd, the Doppler shift of the signal resulting from the particle motion. K=4πn7sin⁡(θs/2)λ(Eq. 2) The magnitude of the Doppler shift is determined from the power spectrum, which is calculated from the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation spectrum. The Doppler shift can then be related to the electrophoretic mobility by, δV=[2VoVdsin⁡(θs/2)]/C(Eq. 3) where δv is the Doppler shift, vo is the frequency of the incident light, and C is velocity of light in the medium. The electrophoretic mobility is related to the velocity of the scattering particle by the simple equation, vd = μE, where μ is the electrophoretic mobility and E is the applied electric field(25.Ware B.R. Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 1974; 4: 1-44Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar) . Temperature, ionic strength, pH, and conductivity affect the electrophoretic mobility of the scattering particle and were therefore carefully controlled by monitoring the conductivity of each sample. Joule heating was governed by regulation of the pulse duration and the pulse frequency of the electric field. Thermal lensing was avoided by control of the incident laser power. Snell's law corrections were made for all scattering angles. Fig. 1 shows the changes in the electrophoretic mobility spectrum for fibrinogen at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml (peak A) at intermediate times during a 90-min activation by thrombin. At 10 min, a new peak (peak B) with a mobility of −0.6 (μ-cm)/(V-s) is observed. At 25 min, the electrophoretic spectrum shows the appearance of a third peak (peak C) with a mobility of −1.0 (μ-cm)/(V-s). Both peaks B and C continue to increase in intensity with time as shown by the spectra at 40 and 60 min. Other contributions to the mobility spectra are seen at higher mobilities. These experiments show activation intermediates at times of 10, 25, 40, and 60 min. Under conditions of very dilute thrombin concentrations, peak B emerges well ahead of peak C. In Fig. 2, the effect of thrombin, which removes both FpA and FpB, is compared with Atroxin, which removes only FpA. Thus, by using Atroxin, a homogeneous desAA can be produced. The experimental conditions are identical to those used in Fig. 1. The 25-min mobility spectrum using thrombin from Fig. 1 has been superimposed and is shown as a dashed line so that assignment of peak B can be identified as removal of fibrinopeptide A, yielding desAA. The same fibrinogen mobility (peak A) is observed in both the thrombin and Atroxin experiments. The difference occurs in the absence of peak C. Since Atroxin, the solid curve in Fig. 2, only releases fibrinopeptide A and since the morphology of the single new peak is symmetric, the new mobility shown as peak B must represent the desAA fibrin intermediate. Some investigators have postulated the existence of an AdesA fibrin intermediate. The inset shows a plot of the line width at half height, Γ, for peak B versus the scattering vector, K, and confirms that the line broadening is due to diffusion (Γ/2 = KD2) and not sample heterogeneity (Γ/2 = KD)(24.Johnson Jr., C.S. Gabriel D.A. Laser Light Scattering. Dover Publication Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Thus, contribution to peak B from AdesA is highly unlikely. Furthermore, since the mobility difference between peak A for native fibrinogen and peak B for desAA is so large, if AdesA was present, it should appear as an easily identifiable peak between peak A and peak B. Since no peaks are observed in this region of the mobility spectra, and since we can show the appearance of peak B ahead of peak C (see the spectrum for the 10-min sample time in Fig. 1), we take this as evidence that AdesA does not exist as a significant intermediate. If it exists at all, it must be extremely short lived or at a very low concentration. These observations are consistent with the observation of Janmey et al.(14.Janmey, P. A., Bale, M. D., Ferry, J. D. (1983) Biopolymers 2017–2019Google Scholar, 15.Janmey P.A. Erdile L. Bale M.D. Ferry J.D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4336-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27.Bale M.D. Janmey P.A. Ferry D. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 2265-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the second FpA is removed 16 times faster than the first FpA, suggesting that the possibility of a stable AdesA intermediate is low. To identify the species responsible for the mobility represented by peak C produced by the thrombin activation of fibrinogen shown in Fig. 1, the following experiments were performed. The experiments shown in Fig. 3 are identical to those shown in Figure 1:, Figure 2: except that fibrinogen is activated by an enzyme from the venom of the Southern copperhead, Agkistrodon controtrix, which cleaves FpB at a much faster rate than FpA. Again, the 25-min spectrum from Fig. 1, shown as a dashed line, has been superimposed so that the identification of FpB removal can be established. As expected, no desAA peak (peak B in Fig. 1) is observed because the FpB is removed first. A new peak, peak C′, with a slightly slower mobility than the peak C from Fig. 1, is produced. The activation product from A. controtrix should produce both desBB and desAAdesBB. Additional help to resolve the assignment of peak C was obtained from the production of a homogeneous desAAdesBB generated by first treating fibrinogen with Atroxin followed by A. controtrix venom, which had identical mobility with peak C from Fig. 1(data not shown). Linewidth analysis on peak C generated by both venoms, i.e. desAAdesBB, and from thrombin (Fig. 1) both have a K2 dependence, confirming a single species identified as desAAdesBB. Linewidth analysis of the slower mobility peak C′ from Fig. 3 shows a K dependence, indicating a mixture of species (see Fig. 3, inset). The conclusion from these experiments is that peak C represents desAAdesBB and is supported by the fact that we do not expect to find desBB in thrombin activation. These results also suggest that desAAdesBB has a faster mobility than desBB. Finally, peak C in Fig. 1 is definitely not AdesA, since it would be highly unlikely that removal of one FpA would produce a faster mobility than removal of both FpAs and since no peak C is seen in Atroxin activation. When both desBB and desAAdesBB are present, a slower peak C′ is seen that results from contamination by the slower moving desBB. The experiments shown in Fig. 4 are identical to those shown in Fig. 1, except that the concentration of fibrinogen is higher, 2 mg/ml, since it represents the normal human plasma concentration of fibrinogen and is also identical to the fibrinogen concentration used by Smith (17.Smith G.F. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Hunziker et al.(16.Hunziker E.B. Straub P.W. Haeberli A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7455-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, the activation rate is thrombin limited. As shown in Fig. 4, an activation profile is seen similar to that in Fig. 1 with no evidence for AdesA. Fibrin assembly is initiated by thrombin cleavage of the N-terminal Aα-chain, fibrinopeptide A, which exposes one of the two polymerization site “A's” on the E-domain(28.Doolittle R.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 1973; 27: 1-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 29.Olexa S.A. Budzynski A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Structural information on the chemical nature of “A” polymerization site is limited, but His16 on the Bβ-chain and contributions from α-chain are necessary for polymerization to occur(31.Laudano A.P. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3085-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 32.Laudano A.P. Doolittle R.F.

The polymerization “A” site on the E-domain interacts with the constitutively present “a” site on the D-domain of an adjacent monomer. In contrast to the “A” site, the critical amino acid sequence in the “a” site is better defined and located on the C-terminal γ-chain between amino acid residues 356 and 411(30.Budzynski A.Z. Olexa S.A. Pandya B.V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35.Olexa S.A. Budzynski A. J. Biol.

Once the fibrin monomer is generated following FpA release, fibrin assembly ensues. The classical mechanism for fibrin assembly as described by the Hall-Slayter model suggests that fibrin monomers polymerize in a half-staggered manner so that the D-domain of one monomer interacts with the centrally located E-domain of the adjacent monomer to form protofibrils 2 monomers thick(12.Hall C.E. Slayter H.S. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1959; 5: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In this model, polymerization symmetry permits monomer addition to either end of the growing protofibril (bipolar growth), but only if an “A” site faces the “a” site, which implies rotational symmetry about the minor hemi-axis (equivalent ends) but not about the major hemi-axis with respect to polymerization sites(38.Hermans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An additional critical factor is the structural contribution of the dihedral angle present in fibrinogen that introduces helical structure to the protofibril. However, the exact details of the interaction and packing remain unknown(38.Hermans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, the Hall-Slayter model for fibrin assembly has been challenged(16.Hunziker E.B. Straub P.W. Haeberli A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7455-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fundamental feature of the alternative model described by Hunziker is that only one D-domain from each fibrin monomer is involved in the initial polymerization process. The second D-domain is then left free to form branches. For this model to be possible, the second “A” polymerization site on the E-domain must not be activated, i.e. the AdesA species must predominate and be stable long enough to diffuse to the surface of the assembling fibrin protofibril. If the second FpA is cleaved, protofibril assembly will proceed in an overlapping bipolar manner as postulated in the Hall-Slayter model. Assembly requires close proximity of monomers and growing fibrin oligomers and sufficient time for both rotational and lateral diffusion to occur so that the correct spatial orientation occurs. Thus, the monomer must be stable long enough for diffusive processes to bring monomers and oligomers together. If the AdesA species is the important fundamental monomeric species, it must not encounter a second thrombin molecule that would result in the cleavage of its second FpA before its assembly into the growing fibrin protofibril. These critical interactions between monomer and growing oligomer are highly important in the determination of fiber assembly kinetics and structure(39.Weisel J.W. Veklich Y. Gorkun O. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, a fundamental issue in the differentiation between the Hall-Slayter and Hunziker models is proof of the existence of the AdesA versus the desAA intermediate as the predominant species during fibrin assembly. The existence of a transient AdesA fibrin monomer is controversial and is dependent on the nature of interaction between thrombin and fibrinogen. For example, the AdesA could be produced through one thrombin bound for each FpA so that removal of each FpA is a temporally independent event. The desAA species could be produced by either two thrombin molecules bound simultaneously to fibrinogen or by the sequential removal of FpAs by one bound thrombin molecule. In favor of the latter model, a 16-fold increased rate of removal for the second fibrinopeptide A has been observed(14.Janmey, P. A., Bale, M. D., Ferry, J. D. (1983) Biopolymers 2017–2019Google Scholar, 15.Janmey P.A. Erdile L. Bale M.D. Ferry J.D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4336-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The existence of an AdesA intermediate in the early stage of fibrin formation was first proposed by Smith(17.Smith G.F. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and his analysis, based on N-terminal amino acid analysis of gel chromatography isolated fibrinogen activation intermediates, reported that the interior of fibrin oligomers was composed of desAA monomers but that the oligomer was capped by AdesA monomers. It is not clear from this model how desAA monomers can be added to the growing oligomer if each end is capped by an AdesA. Based on his analysis, Smith postulated that AdesA was the early predominant species. A similar finding also using chromatography to isolate fibrin intermediates was reported by Alkjaersig and Fletcher (18.Alkjaersig N. Fletcher A.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Dietler et al.(19.Dietler G. Kanzig W. Haeberli A. Straub P.W. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 905-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) used light scattering to arrive at a similar conclusion. It should be emphasized that quasi elastic light scattering gives highly accurate diffusion coefficients but only for monodispersed solutions(40.Berne B.J. Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). Sample heterogeneity caused by fibrinogen or fibrin monomer aggregates will produce uncertainty in the result as evidenced by a large second moment in the cumulant analysis(40.Berne B.J. Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). More recently, Hunziker et al.(16.Hunziker E.B. Straub P.W. Haeberli A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7455-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have used electron microcopy to examine fibrin oligomers that appear to contain AdesA intermediates. Electron microscopy studies offer the possibility of analyzing individual monomers and oligomers, but it is not clear if the drying process alters the monomers so that their original solution appearance is altered. Monomer aggregation artifacts may also occur during the drying process. Important species present in solution may not be represented in the observed species. Other investigators do not find evidence for the AdesA fibrin monomer. Wilf and Minton (21.Wilf J. Minton A.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3124-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) used gel permeation chromatography and only found desAA fibrin monomers. Wilf and Minton (21.Wilf J. Minton A.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3124-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) also examined Smith's original proposed assembly mechanism and found that Smith's predictions did not agree with either their analysis or with Shainoff's sedimentation analysis(41.Shainoff J.R. Lahiri B. Bumpus F.M. Thromb. Diath Haemorrh. 1970; 39: 203-217Google Scholar). In addition, only desAA was observed by Janmey et al. (14.Janmey, P. A., Bale, M. D., Ferry, J. D. (1983) Biopolymers 2017–2019Google Scholar, 27.Bale M.D. Janmey P.A. Ferry D. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 2265-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in their light scattering studies. Henschen (22.Henschen A. Lin C.Y. Chien S. Fibrinogen, Thrombosis, Coagulation, and Fibrinolysis. Plenum Press, New York1990: 49-53Google Scholar) was not able to detect AdesA intermediates using a more direct analysis of the FpA and amino acid sequencing of the central, dimeric fragments derived from the N-terminal region of all Aα-chains and α-chains present in the thrombin digest. In this report, we have used light scattering to examine fibrinogen activation intermediates. However, we have avoided the problem of sample heterogeneity by adding electrophoresis to quasi elastic light scattering as described by Ware and Flygare(42.Ware B.R. Flygare W.H. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1971; 12: 81-85Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Differences between the molecular weight and hence the diffusion coefficient of fibrinogen and fibrin monomer using standard quasi elastic light scattering may not resolve subtle differences present in fibrinogen activation intermediates. On the other hand, substantial differences may be present in the molecular charge for each activation species, which would be highly sensitive to detection by electrophoresis. We view the results from QLS and ELS as complementary. We have shown that ELS is well suited for the study of fibrinogen activation and protofibril formation. ELS reports the surface charge of a particle and is observed as the electrophoretic mobility. The ELS method can measure the mobilities of a mixture of multiple particles with different structures and charges. In the present case, differences in the mobility of fibrin intermediates depend on small changes in the surface charge in activation intermediates. When the fibrinopeptides are removed and fibrin monomers are produced, only a small change in the molecular weight occurs, but a large difference in the electrophoretic mobility occurs. In fact, the change is so large that the existence of the AdesA species would be easily observed between peaks A and B, which is not seen (Fig. 1). We have also used limiting concentrations of thrombin to enhance detection of the AdesA intermediate, if it is present. In separate experiments, physiologic concentrations of fibrinogen were examined (Fig. 4). Our data strongly support the hypothesis that desAA fibrin monomer is the significant intermediate in fibrin assembly. If AdesA does exist, its lifetime and concentration are insufficient to exert a significant role in fibrin assembly."

Amplification of cDNA from day 19 fetal rat lung followed by cloning and sequence analyses indicated that only the testis isoform of phosphorylase kinase (PhK-γT) was detectable in fetal lung. In situ hybridization analyses indicated that expression of PhK-γT RNA in developing lung tissue was widespread and not restricted to Type II epithelial cells; PhK-γT protein expression was temporally and spatially correlated with expression of PhK-γT RNA. PhK-γT RNA and protein expression was also characterized in the PhK-deficient glycogen storage disease (gsd) rat. PhK-γT RNA levels were similar in Type II cells isolated from wild type and gsd/gsd fetuses; in contrast, PhK-γT protein was virtually undetectable in gsd/gsd Type II cells and enzyme activity was very low. These results suggest that PhK-γT plays a critical role in mobilization of glycogen during fetal lung development and that failure to catabolize glycogen in the gsd/gsd rat is related to an untranslatable PhK-γT RNA or unstable protein.

INTRODUCTIONThe epithelium of the fetal respiratory tree is characterized by the accumulation of glycogen during the last part of gestation. Glycogen mobilization is both temporally and spatially regulated such that catabolism in the proximal airways proceeds at or close to birth, whereas catabolism in the distal airway occurs earlier coinciding with maturation of the Type II epithelial cell(1.Ito T. Newkirk C. Strum J.M. Mcdowell E.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On day 17 of gestation, the respiratory epithelium of the fetal rat lung consists of undifferentiated columnar cells that contain small amounts of glycogen; lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage granules for surfactant, are not detectable(2.Schellhase D.E. Emrie P.A. Fisher J.H. Shannon J.M. Pediatr. Res. 1989; 26: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On day 19 of gestation, the epithelium consists of cuboidal cells which contain large pools of glycogen and a few lamellar bodies. By day 21 of gestation, the epithelium approximates that observed in postnatal life consisting of thin Type I cells and cuboidal Type II cells which are devoid of glycogen and contain numerous lamellar bodies. Kikkawa and co-workers (3.Kikkawa Y. Kaibara M. Motoyama E.K. Orzalesi M.M. Cook C.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1971; 64: 423-442PubMed Google Scholar) noted the inverse relationship between glycogen and lamellar bodies and speculated that glycogenolysis might be associated with surfactant synthesis. A direct link between the breakdown of glycogen on day 20 of gestation and surfactant synthesis was demonstrated by Farrell and Bourbon (4.Farrell P.M. Bourbon J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) who showed that glucose, originating from glycogen, provided substrate for fatty acid and glycerol synthesis which, in turn, were incorporated into surfactant phosphatidylcholine. Both biochemical and morphological studies therefore support the hypothesis that glycogen breakdown may be an important event in prenatal surfactant phospholipid synthesis.The initial step in glycogen catabolism is the phosphorolysis of glycogen to glucose 1-phosphate by phosphorylase a, the activated form of glycogen phosphorylase. Glycogen phosphorylase enzyme activity has been shown to increase in late gestation fetal lung concomitant with initiation of glycogen degradation(5.Maniscalco W.M. Wilson C.M. Gross I. Gobran L. Rooney S.A. Warshaw J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast to the developmentally regulated increase in enzyme activity, the level of RNA encoding brain glycogen phosphorylase, the predominant isoform of glycogen phosphorylase in developing rabbit lung, does not change during the perinatal period(6.Newgard C.B. Norkiewicz B. Hughes S. Frenkel R.A. Coats W.S. Martiniuk F. Johnston J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that enzyme activity is regulated by allosteric activation and/or by post-translational phosphorylation. Activation of glycogen phosphorylase by phosphorylation is regulated by phosphorylase kinase (PhK). 1The abbreviations used are: PhKphosphorylase kinasePCRpolymerase chain reactionNTAnitrilotriacetic acidbpbase pair(s)ntnucleotidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The importance of this enzyme in glycogen mobilization is demonstrated by the gsd/gsd rat (7.Clark D. Haynes D. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1988; 29: 217-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) which lacks detectable PhK activity in developing lung tissue(8.Rannels S.R. Rannels S.L. Sneyd J.G.T. Loten E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L419-L427PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylase kinase deficiency in gsd/gsd fetuses leads to an accumulation of the inactive form glycogen phosphorylase and failure to mobilize pulmonary glycogen, ultimately resulting in reduced phosphatidylcholine synthesis(8.Rannels S.R. Rannels S.L. Sneyd J.G.T. Loten E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L419-L427PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that post-translational phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase by PhK is a critical step in the regulation of pulmonary glycogen catabolism.Muscle PhK is a hexadecameric protein (α4β4γ4γ4) with a molecular mass of 1.3 × 106 Da (for review, see (9.Pickett-Gies C.A. Walsh D.A. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. 17. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 395-459Google Scholar)). Calmodulin, the δ subunit, is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent activity of this enzyme; the α and β subunits regulate the activity of PhK in response to phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Glycogen phosphorylase is activated following phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit, γ, a 387-amino acid protein. cDNAs encoding muscle PhKγ have been cloned and characterized by a number of laboratories(10.Chamberlain J.S. VanTuinen P. Reeves A.A. Philip B.A. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2886-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11.Bender P.K. Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8799-8805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.da Cruz e Silva E.F. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNAs of 2.4 and 1.6 kilobases encoding muscle PhKγ were detected in mouse skeletal muscle, brain, and cardiac tissues but not in liver, consistent with tissue-specific expression of the muscle enzyme(10.Chamberlain J.S. VanTuinen P. Reeves A.A. Philip B.A. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2886-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression of PhK may be related to the presence of distinct PhK isozymes. Consistent with this hypothesis, human and rat testis PhKγ (PhK-γT) cDNAs have been isolated and shown to be 67% identical to rabbit skeletal muscle PhKγ at the nucleic acid level(13.Hanks S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14.Calalb M.B. Fox D.T. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PhK-γT cDNA detected an abundant 2.0-kilobase RNA in testis which was expressed at much lower levels in most other tissues including lung. PhK-γT RNA was not detected prior to 2 months of age, indicating both temporal as well as a tissue-specific regulation of expression. The purpose of this study was to identify the PhKγ isozyme expressed in the fetal Type II epithelial cell and characterize its temporo-spatial pattern of expression during the perinatal period.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and BreedingRats used in these studies were from the NZR/Mh strain derived from a random bred Wistar line found to be homozygous for liver phosphorylase b kinase deficiency (gsd/gsd). Normal time-dated pregnant Wistar controls were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Control and gsd/gsd animals were bred at the same time so each strain could be compared on the same experimental day. There was no difference in the length of gestation between control Wistars or the gsd/gsd strain; therefore, specific metabolic differences could be distinguished from the effects of gestational age.Isolation of CellsLungs from 2-3 litters of a single gestational age (days 19-21) were removed and placed in sterile 1 × Hanks' balanced salts (without calcium or magnesium), minced into 1-mm cubes, and disrupted in a solution containing 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, Type IV) and 0.15 mg/ml bovine pancreas DNase I (Calbiochem). Cells were then filtered through 160-μm nylon mesh, centrifuged, and resuspended in Joklik's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Mixed cells were plated on 100-mm tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C to promote differential adherence of fibroblasts over a 2-h interval. Type II cells were removed by panning and loaded onto Percoll gradients with density steps of 1.095 and 1.045; cells were collected from the interface. Isolation of adult Type II cells was performed as described previously(15.Rannels S.R. Rannels D.E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 116-123Google Scholar). Cell pellets were divided and sonicated separately for independent phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase assays when yield permitted.Cloning and Sequencing of PKγ Isozyme in Fetal Lung TissueThe cDNA sequences encoding rat muscle (16.Cawley K.C. Ramachandran C. Gorin F.A. Walsh D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2355-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and rat testis (14.Calalb M.B. Fox D.T. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) PhKγ subunits were aligned and degenerate PCR primer pairs selected on the basis of conserved regions: forward primer L, 5′-CT(CG)TTTGACTA(CT)CTCAC(TA)GAG-3′, nucleotides (nt) 685-705 (all nucleotide numbering in this study conforms to the reported sequence for PhK-γT cDNA, GenBank accession number M73808); forward primer N, 5′-AACATTGT(ACG)CATCG(GA)GACCTG-3′, nt 784-804, and reverse primer S, 5′-TCATCCCACTC(CTG)GGTGA-3′, nt 1119-1102. The LS and NS primer pairs were used to optimize conditions for amplification of PhKγ using the muscle PhKγ cDNA (the kind gift of J. S. Chamberlain, Baylor College of Medicine) or the testis PhKγ cDNA (the kind gift of S. Hanks, Vanderbilt University Medical School) as templates for PCR (Fig. 1). Optimal PCR conditions and degenerate primer pairs were subsequently used to amplify PhKγ in cDNA pools that were reversed transcribed from day 19 fetal rat lung poly(A)+ RNA prepared with the FastTrack RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). PCR products were size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned into pCRscript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced in both directions by the method of Sanger(17.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52343) Google Scholar).Analysis of PhK-γT RNA ExpressionPhK-γT RNA levels in lung tissue and isolated Type II epithelial cells were assessed by ribonuclease protection assays using the protocol described by the supplier (Ambion, Austin, TX). For generation of antisense probes, the regions encoding nucleotides 1567-1834 (3′-untranslated sequence) and 1464-1643 (3′ coding sequences) of rat PhK-γT and the comparable regions of rat muscle PhKγ were cloned into pCRscript SK. 32P-Labeled antisense probes were synthesized with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase, gel-purified, and hybridized with 10 μg of total RNA, isolated by the method of Chomczynski(18.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62975) Google Scholar). Following an overnight incubation at 42°C, unhybridized RNA was digested with ribonuclease and the protected fragments analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. PhK-γT RNA levels were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Since actin levels varied during development, a probe for rat ribosomal protein L32 (GenBank accession number X06483) was used as an internal control for gel loading and transfer.Spatial expression of PhK-γT RNA was assessed by in situ hybridization. Sense and antisense probes were generated as described above, using 35S-labeled UTP, and hybridized with cryosections of lung tissues as we have previously described(19.Breslin J.S. Phillips K.S. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).Analysis of PhKγ Protein LevelsThe entire coding sequence of rat PhK-γT (nt 343-1563) was amplified by PCR, cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET21 (Novagen, Madison, WI), and transfected into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Following induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside for 4 h, recombinant PhKγ was recovered by extraction of the bacterial pellet with 6 M guanidine in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl followed by chromatography on NTA-agarose, as described by the supplier (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Recombinant rat PhKγ eluted from the NTA column was dialyzed against TBS (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and injected into rabbits to generate polyclonal antisera as described previously(20.Weaver T.E. Sarin V.K. Sawtell N. Hull W.M. Whitsett J.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1988; 65: 982-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antiserum was prepared by chromatography over recombinant PhK-γT immobilized on Aminolink resin (Pierce Chemical Co.). The column was eluted with 5 mM glycine (pH 2.3), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and the affinity purified antiserum immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 0.5 M Na2HPO4.For Western blot analyses, lung tissues or Type II epithelial cell pellets were homogenized in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin, and chymostatin followed by centrifugation at 140 × g for 10 min (4°C); a cytosolic fraction was prepared by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 30 min (4°C). Equal amounts of cytosolic protein, estimated by the method of Lowry(21.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, and PhK identified by Western blotting(22.Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The specificity of the immunoreaction was verified by prior incubation of the antiserum with 100 μg of recombinant PhKγ or by immunoblotting with preimmune serum.Immunocytochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded lung tissues exactly as described by Vorbroker et al.(23.Vorbroker D.K. Profitt S.A. Nogee L.M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L647-L656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue sections were incubated with either affinity-purified PhKγ antisera or antiserum directed against the SP-C proprotein(23.Vorbroker D.K. Profitt S.A. Nogee L.M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L647-L656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the immunoreaction was verified as described above.Analysis of PhK and Phosphorylase Enzyme ActivityPhosphorylase a and total phosphorylase were measured in the supernatant fraction of lung or cells by the reverse reaction where [14C]glucose 1-phosphate incorporation into glycogen was determined in the absence or presence of 5 mM AMP as described previously(8.Rannels S.R. Rannels S.L. Sneyd J.G.T. Loten E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L419-L427PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Malthus R. Clark D.G. Watts C. Sneyd J.T.T. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One unit of activity represents the conversion of 1 μmol of glucose 1-phosphate into glycogen per minute. Phosphorylase b kinase activity was determined by incubating cell or tissue extracts with rabbit muscle phosphorylase b, followed by assays for phosphorylase a and total phosphorylase as above. One unit of activity catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of phosphorylase b per minute, assuming a molecular weight for phosphorylase b of 97,400 and that the activity of phosphorylase a in the absence of AMP = 70% of the activity in the presence of AMP(25.Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Activities are expressed per wet tissue or cell weight.RESULTSIdentification of PhKγ in Developing LungThe cDNA sequences encoding rat muscle (16.Cawley K.C. Ramachandran C. Gorin F.A. Walsh D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2355-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and rat testis (14.Calalb M.B. Fox D.T. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) PhK were aligned and degenerate PCR primer pairs designed based on the highly conserved catalytic domain encompassing subdomains VIb-X(26.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were adjusted such that the predicted 434-bp fragment could be amplified from both the muscle and testis cDNA template with equal efficiency and degenerate primer pairs were subsequently used to amplify cDNA reverse transcribed from day 19 fetal rat lung poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 1A). Fragments of 434 and 509 bp were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Sequence analyses of cDNA clones from multiple amplification reactions indicated that the 434-bp fragment corresponded exactly to the reported sequence for rat PhK-γT (14.Calalb M.B. Fox D.T. Hanks S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B); cDNA clones encoding muscle PhKγ were not detected and this result was subsequently confirmed by RNase protection assays (see Fig. 2). Sequence analyses of cDNA clones encoding the 509-bp fragment indicated that this fragment also corresponded to rat PhK-γT but contained a 75-bp insert at position 736. The 75-bp insert did not exhibit significant homology to any sequence in the GenBank data base and was detected in Type II cell RNA isolated from both fetal and adult rat lung (see Fig. 8B). Amplification of rat genomic DNA, with primers flanking the insert, followed by sequence analysis confirmed that this sequence represented an unspliced intron (Fig. 1C). No other forms of PhKγ were detected with these or a distinct set of degenerate primers (NS primer pair, not shown) suggesting that the testis isozyme was the major or only form of the catalytic subunit expressed in fetal lung tissue.Figure 2:Expression of PhKγ RNA in lung tissue. 32P-Labeled antisense RNA probes (pkt and pkm at right of figure) were generated from the 3′-untranslated region of the rat testis PhKγ (PKT) cDNA (see Fig. 1B) or the rat muscle PhKγ (PKM) cDNA. Labeled probes were hybridized with 10 μg of total RNA isolated from adult rat testis (T), muscle (M), lung (AL), or day 19 fetal lung (FL). Following an overnight incubation at 42°C, unhybridized RNA was digested with ribonuclease and the protected fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. A 268-base fragment is protected by PKT in all four tissues, although expression in lung and muscle is very low relative to testis; in contrast, PKM protects RNA only in muscle tissue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8:Expression of PhK-γT RNA and protein in Type II epithelial cells isolated from gsd/gsd rats.

The level of testis PhKγ RNA in lung tissue remained relatively constant from day 17 of gestation through the postnatal period and in the adult (Fig. 3) and was similar in isolated fetal (day 20 of gestation) and adult Type II epithelial cells. In situ hybridization with antisense probes indicated that PhK-γT RNA was expressed predominantly in the epithelium of developing airways on day 17 of gestation (Fig. 4A); however, by day 19 of gestation virtually all cells in the lung expressed PhK-γT RNA and this expression profile was maintained postnatally (Fig. 4). Overall the results of these studies suggest that the temporal-spatial expression of PhK-γT RNA did not vary significantly during the perinatal period.Figure 3:Quantitation of PhK-γT RNA expression during lung development. 32P-Labeled PKT antisense RNA probes (see Fig. 2) were hybridized with 10 μg of total RNA isolated from fetal (days 17, 19, and 21 of gestation), postnatal (days 1, 3, and 5), and adult rat lung as well as adult rat testis. Following an overnight incubation at 42°C, unhybridized RNA was digested with ribonuclease and the protected fragments, recovered by ethanol precipitation, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. PhKγ RNA bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gel and normalized to an internal control (L32 RNA).

The specificity of PhK-γT antisense RNA expression was confirmed by: 1) in situ hybridization with two separate sense probes from the 3′-untranslated or 3′-coding region of PhK-γT; 2) by in situ hybridization with irrelevant sense probes (cdk-4 and cdk-1); and 3) by RNase protection assays with labeled PhK-γT sense probes (Fig. 5). Antisense PhK-γT RNA was consistently detected in both fetal and adult lung but not in adult testis or skeletal muscle (Fig. 5). These results suggest that PhK-γT antisense RNA is expressed in lung in a spatially restricted manner.Figure 5:Expression of antisense PhK-γT RNA in fetal and adult lung. 32P-Labeled sense PK-γT RNA probes were generated from the 3′-untranslated region of the rat PKγ cDNA and hybridized with 10 μg of total RNA isolated from fetal (day 17 and 21 of gestation) rat lung, adult rat lung (L), adult rat testis (T), and adult rat muscle (M).

Rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated against recombinant PhK-γT detected purified muscle PhK (Sigma) by Western blotting (Fig. 6B). Affinity-purified immune serum detected a protein, Mr approximately 41,000, in Western blots of cytosol from adult testis or skeletal muscle and immunoreactivity was competed by prior incubation of the antiserum with recombinant PhK-γT (not shown). Western analyses of fetal, postnatal, and adult lung cytosols indicated that levels of PhK-γT protein were similar at all time points; similar results were obtained with cytosols prepared from isolated fetal and adult Type II epithelial cells. Expression of PhK-γT protein was localized by immunocytochemistry to Type II epithelial cells and to the bronchiolar epithelium in rat and mouse lung although lower level expression was detectable throughout the lung (Fig. 7); this pattern of expression was similar in both pre- and postnatal tissues. Surprisingly PhK-γT protein levels in adult testis were comparable to those in lung despite much higher levels of PhK-γT RNA in testis (not shown).Figure 6:Generation and characterization of PhK-γT antisera.

The crystal structure of bovine F1-ATPase (Abrahams, J. P., Leslie, A. G. W., Lutter, R., and Walker, J. E.(1994) Nature 370, 621-628) shows that these suppressor residues are located in the nucleotide-binding domain. Specific hypotheses have been formulated that suggest the conformational coupling of the P-loop with the suppressor sites. P353L is in a “catch” region, which forms unique interactions with the γ-subunit in the three different conformational states of the catalytic site. The identification of this suppressor mutation demonstrates genetically that the catch region is conformationally coupled to the P-loop. T237I is shown to interact with Lys-209, which occurs just after the P-loop. This suggests that this interaction changes the conformation of the P-loop to suppress the initial mutation. L390F interacts with Ala-181, which is adjacent to the P-loop. The mechanism of this suppression is suggested to occur through the interactions of L390F with Ala-181. These results identify critical interactions that modulate the structure of the P-loop and thus the biochemistry of the enzyme.

The mitochondrial ATP synthase is the major enzyme responsible for the aerobic synthesis of ATP. The ATP synthase is composed of a water-soluble portion, the F1-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.34), and a membrane portion, F0. The F1-ATPase has a subunit composition of α3β3γδ∊ with an overall mass of ∼360,000 Da(1.Walker J.E. Fearnley I.M. Gay N.J. Gibson B.W. Northrop F.D. Powell S.J. Runswick M.J. Saraste M.

Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar) and prior biochemical and mutagenesis studies (for review, see (4.Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) indicate that the β-subunits, together with small contributions from the α-subunits, compose the active sites of the enzyme. The binding change hypothesis for ATP synthesis proposed by Boyer et al.(5.Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6.Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 7.Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) suggests that the energy-requiring step for ATP synthesis is the release of newly synthesized ATP and not the phosphorylation step. The hypothesis proposes that three catalytic sites in F1 participate in the synthesis of ATP by a mechanism that involves conformational changes mediating changes in affinity of the active sites for ATP. The binding change hypothesis is supported by a number of biochemical studies (for review, see (6.Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)) and recently by the high resolution crystal structure of the protein (3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar). The crystal structure indicates that the three active sites are not identical: one site is occupied by ADP (βDP), one site by AMP-PNP 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate)GMP-PNPguanosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate).

The differences in βDP, βTP, and βE are also demonstrated by large conformational differences in the active-site domain of each β-subunit, including the structure and location of the P-loop motifs. adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate) guanosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate). The P-loop motif (8.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 164-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 9.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J.

The primary sequence of the P-loop in the β-subunit of F1 is Gly-Gly-Ala-Gly-Val-Gly-Lys-Thr. Crystallographic studies indicate that the backbone structure of the P-loop is the same in many nucleotide-binding proteins: p21ras, elongation factor Tu, myosin, RecA, adenylate kinase, and the ATPase(3.Abrahams J.P.

Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In p21ras, the P-loop has extensive hydrogen bonding with the α-, β-, and γ-phosphates of Mg2+-GMP-PNP(12.Pai E.F. Krengel U.

Biochemical studies of mutants in Escherichia coli and yeast F1 indicate that the P-loop is critical for catalysis (16.Takeyama M. Ihara K. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. Ida K. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M.

Mueller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies in this laboratory indicated that the primary structural constraints of the P-loop in the β-subunit of the yeast ATPase correspond very well with the known structure of p21ras(19.Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As revealed by the crystal structure of F1, the P-loop is in a dramatically different conformation in βE as compared with βTP and βDP, which suggests that the conformation of the P-loop may explain the vacancy of βE for nucleotides. As such, changes in the position, geometry, and structure of the P-loop of the mitochondrial ATPase may, in part, be responsible for changes in the biochemistry of the active site during the catalytic reaction cycle. This study was initiated to identify residues in the β-subunit that interact with the P-loop. Intragenic suppressors were isolated in strains with mutation codons coding for residues in, and immediately adjacent to, the P-loop of the β-subunit of F1. The primary structural constraints on these residues were postulated to be determined by steric interactions with other residues in the enzyme (19.Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study has identified critical interacting residues in the β-subunit that appear to be important conformational links to the P-loop in the active site of the enzyme. These interactions may be important in the catalytic mechanism for the transition from the high to the low affinity conformation, or they may be important for modulating the activity of the enzyme to suit the needs of the particular organism. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DMY201 (19.Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (MATa, ade2-100, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1, lys2-801, trp1-Δ63, ura3-52, atp2::leu2) containing plasmids with the mutant gene coding for the β-subunit of the ATPase was used in this study. The bacterial strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used throughout the study for the cloning procedures. Bacteria were infected with the helper phage VCSM13 (Stratagene) for the synthesis of single-stranded DNA. The following media were used for the growth of the yeast strains: YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), and SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose). SD medium was supplemented with appropriate auxotrophic requirements at 20 mg/liter. P-loop mutants at positions 192, 194, and 198 with conditional growth phenotypes (see Table 1) were grown in SD minimal medium with the auxotrophic requirements. About 108 cells were plated on YPG medium and incubated at the restrictive temperatures. Revertant colonies were picked and pooled, and yeast plasmid DNA was purified (20.Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and used to transform E. coli. The plasmid DNA isolated from E. coli(21.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) was used to transform yeast DMY201. If the transformants grew on YPG medium at restrictive temperatures, the revertant phenotype is plasmid-borne and due to intragenic suppressors or the reversion of the original mutation. These plasmids were subjected to DNA sequencing to identify the mutations.Tabled 1 Chemical mutagenesis and polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis were used to increase the rate of reversion or suppression where necessary. Chemical mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate was performed as described (22.Lawrence C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium (2.5 ml) at 30°C to ∼5 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were washed with water, suspended in 10 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and treated with 2.3% ethyl methanesulfonate for 45 min at 30°C. The cells recovered in YPD medium for 4-8 h. This treatment killed ∼50% of the yeast cells. About 105 cells were plated on YPG plates supplemented with 0.1% glucose and incubated at the restrictive temperature. The colonies that grew on this medium were isolated, and the plasmid DNA was purified (20.Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and transformed into E. coli. Plasmid DNA was isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing, and mutations were identified. Plasmid DNA was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction under the conditions that reduce the fidelity of DNA synthesis by Taq DNA polymerase(23.Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. J. Methods Cell Mol. Biol. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction products were cotransformed into DMY201 with a linearized vector, pRS314(24.Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 25.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing the ATP2 gene. The suppressors were isolated directly by growing the transformants on plates with YPG medium supplemented with 0.05% glucose. The colonies that grew on this medium were picked, and the yeast plasmid DNA was isolated and transformed into E. coli. Plasmid DNA was isolated from E. coli, and the DNA sequence was determined to identify the mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis of L390G and L390A was performed as described(26.Zoller M.J. Smith M. DNA (N. Y.). 1984; 3: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 27.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primer used in this study is a 24-mer (5′-TCT AAA TCA AGG GST TTG GAT GCC-3′, where S is G and C), which was used to mutate Leu-390 to Gly and Ala. The DNA sequence of the restriction fragment that was subjected to mutagenesis was determined to ensure that no other mutations were introduced into the gene. The allelic series of mutations at position 198, in conjunction with the suppressor mutation L390F, were constructed by exchanging restriction fragments between the plasmids containing L390F and Val-198 mutations. The plasmid with V198S/L390F was digested with SacI and SalI. The SalI restriction site is in the vector upstream of the ATP2 gene. The SacI site was an engineered site (19.Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is located just downstream of the coding region of the P-loop. The linear plasmid was resolved on a 1% agarose gel, purified, and ligated with the SalI-SacI restriction fragments of the various plasmids with mutations at position 198. The identity or the mutation at position 198 was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Multiple sequence homology analysis was performed using the program MaxHom (28.Sander C. Schneider R.

Both analyses gave a root mean square deviation of 0.41 Å. For Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, residues 141-366 in the β-subunit in the βDP and βE conformations were superimposed using QUANTA Version 4.1.1. The images were rotated together to get the best perspective of the interacting residues.Figure 3:Interaction pathway proposed for suppressor P353L.

A, P353L (Pro-320B) is proposed to disrupt the hydrogen bond of Asp-348 (Asp-315B) with Arg-370 (Asp-337B), which disrupts the hydrogen bond of Arg-370 with the P-loop main chain carbonyl. This structure is shown in the βDP conformation with bound Mg2+-ADP. This structure does not differ much from the βTP conformation. B, shown is the region corresponding to A in the βE conformation. The regions were superimposed using QUANTA Version 4.1.1 (29.Molecular Simulations Inc.QUANTA. Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA1995Google Scholar) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The perspective shown is the same as that in A. The relative positions of the P-loop, Pro-353, Asp-348, and Arg-370 are quite different in the βE conformation as compared with the βDP conformation, with shifts of 10 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) E. coli cells were transformed by electroporation as described (Bio-Rad).

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and by the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method(31.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar). All DNA sequencing analysis was performed using dideoxynucleotides (32.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl.

The primary structural constraints of residues in the β-subunit of the yeast mitochondrial ATPase P-loop suggested that this P-loop has the same geometry as those of other nucleotide-binding proteins, such as p21ras(19.Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of the structure of the p21ras P-loop with GMP-PNP bound (12.Pai E.F.

In addition, the nucleotide and the Mg2+ ion are nearly superimposed in the structures of p21ras and βDP. These results suggest that the extensive hydrogen bonding pattern of the p21ras P-loop with the nucleotide (12.Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A.

Thus, small changes in the conformation of the P-loop may disturb the hydrogen bonding and thereby alter the chemistry of the active site. The initial goal of this study was the isolation of intragenic suppressors of mutations at or adjacent to the P-loop, specifically at residues 192 and 194 and residue 198. 2The corresponding residues of the β-subunit of F1-ATPase from bovine (B) heart are as follows: Ser-161 (Ser-127B), Ala-181 (Ala-147B), Ala-192 (Ala-158B), Val-194 (Val-160B), Val-198 (Val-162B), Lys-209 (Lys-175B), Thr-237 (Ser-203B), Asp-348 (Asp-315B), Pro-353 (Pro-320B), Arg-370 (Arg-337B), Tyr-378 (Tyr-345B), and Leu-390 (Ile-357B). These residues, as are all residues in the P-loop, are completely conserved between β-subunits of all F-type ATPases in the SWISS-PROT data base. 3The species and SWISS-PROT accession numbers are as follows: 1) Bos taurus (bovine), P00829; 2) Rattus norvegicus (rat), P10719; 3) Homo sapiens (human), P06576; 4) Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Q05825; 5) Rhodospirillum rubrum, P05038; 6) Rhodopseudomonas blastica, P05440; 7) Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast), P22068; 8) Neurospora crassa, P23704; 9) Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers' yeast), P00830; 10) Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, P38482; 11) Daucus carota (carrot), P37399; 12) Hevea brasiliensis (Para rubber tree), P29685; 13) Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (leadwort-leafed tobacco), P17614; 14) Oryza sativa (rice), Q01859; 15) Zea mays (maize), P19023; 16) Chlorobium limicola, P35110; 17) Cytophaga lytica, P13357; 18) Bacteroides fragilis, P13356; 19) Lactobacillus casei, Q03234; 20) Bacillus firmus, P25075; 21) B. firmus, P22478; 22) Bacillus megaterium, P12698; 23) Bacillus subtilis, P37809; 24) thermophilic bacterium PS-3, P07677; 25) Bacillus caldotenax, P41009; 26) Mycoplasma gallisepticum, P33253; 27) Streptococcus downei (Streptococcus sobrinus), P21933; 28) Vibrio alginolyticus, P12986; 29) Escherichia coli, P00824; 30) Thiobacillus ferrooxidans (sulfur-metabolizing), P41168; 31) Pectinatus frisingensis, Q03235; 32) Propionigenium modestum, P29707; 33) Synechococcus sp.

Residues 192, 194, and 198 were postulated to interact sterically with other regions of the ATPase and thus may be important for the conformational changes observed in the catalytic sites during the reaction cycle(19.Shen H. Yao B. Mueller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9424-9428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The steric interactions need not be limited to the most stable structure of the enzyme, but may occur during the reaction cycle, as in the transition state of the enzyme. Analysis of the crystal structure of bovine F1 indicates that residues 192 and 194 do not interact with any residues outside the P-loop, while residue 198 may interact with the adenine ring of the bound nucleotide(3.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar). Table 1 shows growth phenotypes of yeast with various replacements at positions 192, 194, and 198 in the β-subunit of the ATPase. The results described in Table 1 suggest that the size of the amino acid side chain is an important determining factor in the function of the enzyme. Particularly, position 198 appears to require a side chain that is about the size of Val. If the side chain is too small, such as Ala or Ser, or too large, such as Met or Lys, the enzyme is defective, and with Gly at this position, the enzyme is inactive. The crystal structure of bovine F1 indicates that the side chain of Val-198 is 3.8 Å from the adenine ring of the nucleotide. Thus, Val-198 may serve to position the nucleotide or to stabilize the binding of the nucleotide. In comparison, Tyr-378 is also 3.8 Å from the adenine ring and serves as a major determinant in stabilizing nucleotide binding(33.Odaka M. Kaibara C. Amano T. Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Yoshida M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As such, V198S would have a diminished ability to act in this manner, and suppression of V198S would need to compensate for this loss. The requirements at positions 192 and 194 are not so apparent. However, a large number of replacements at these positions give dysfunctional phenotypes (temperature or cold sensitivity or slow growth), suggesting that the residues are not involved directly in the catalytic mechanism. Instead, these residues may serve structural roles or roles in the conformational coupling of the enzyme. The dysfunctional mutants listed in Table 1 were used to isolate intragenic suppressors. Because suppressors may be allele-specific, attempts were made to isolate suppressors from each of the mutants listed as dysfunctional in Table 1. Of these mutants, only A192V, V194Y, V194M, and V198S had strong enough phenotypes to isolate suppressors and provided a reversion or suppressor rate that allowed their isolation. Intragenic suppressors were isolated by a combination of methods as described under “Materials and Methods” and as summarized in Table 2. The number and type of intragenic suppressors isolated were very limited. For mutations V194Y and V194M, only suppressors T237I and P353L were isolated, respectively. For V198S, L390F was the only suppressor mutation identified, whereas for A192V, only revertants were isolated. This low number of intragenic suppressors may be due to limitations imposed by the genetic code or due to a severe limitation on the number of replacements that will suppress these mutations.Tabled 1 Fig. 1 shows the growth phenotypes of the original mutants, the mutants with a suppressor mutation, and the suppressor mutations in a wild-type background. Despite the fact that the suppressors were isolated at one temperature, all of the suppressor mutations complemented the defective growth phenotype at 18 and 30°C, while only T237I was effective at 37°C. These data indicate that the suppressor mutations do not generally provide an enzyme with completely wild-type properties. If the amino acid residue corresponding to the suppressor forms a critical interaction with another residue, it would be expected that mutagenesis of this residue in an otherwise wild-type background would give a defective phenotype. This was tested by separating the suppressor mutation from the original P-loop mutation (Fig. 1). Suppressor L390F was defective at all temperatures, indicating that Leu-390 is an important residue in the F1-ATPase. In contrast, T237I and P353L showed only moderate effects on the growth phenotypes, indicating the replacements modify, but do not eliminate, the enzyme activity. Another indicator of the critical importance of Leu-390 was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of Leu-390 to Ala and Gly. Fig. 1 shows that strains with L390A or L390G have a negative growth phenotype on glycerol medium. These results indicate that Leu-390 makes important contacts with at least one other residue. Identification of the P-loop suppressor mutant L390F indicates that this interaction can be transmitted to the P-loop in the active site of the enzyme. The allelic specificity of suppressor L390F was tested since this specificity should provide some information on the mechanism of the suppressor mutation. Specifically, the suppressor should show allelic specificity if it acts by reversing the effect of the primary mutation. This is in contrast to a mechanism whereby a suppressor improves the overall state of the enzyme, thereby overcoming the dysfunctional defect. Fig. 2 shows the growth phenotypes of the L390F mutation in the presence of 10 different residues at position 198. The results indicate that the suppressor mutation is allele-specific. At 30°C, a nearly wild-type growth phenotype for L390F was observed with Cys, Lys, Met, or Thr at position 198. However, at all three temperatures, L390F suppressed only Cys or Thr at position 198. Gly-198 was nonfunctional with either Leu or Phe at position 390. These data support the previous conclusion that Val-198 makes critical steric interactions with another residue or with the bound nucleotide. The mechanism by which the suppressor mutations might act to alter the enzyme conformation was determined by analysis of the crystal structure of bovine F1-ATPase. Pro-353 is ∼20 Å from the β-phosphate of ADP in βDP, so the mechanism of suppression must be by long-range conformational changes. Fig. 3A shows the proposed interaction pathway by which P353L could suppress V194M. Pro-353 is at the beginning of helix G of the nucleotide-binding domain of the ATPase and is in a “catch” region that forms unique interactions with the γ-subunit in the three different conformational states of the catalytic site. Helix G is also adjacent to β-sheet 8, which is adjacent to the P-loop. Arg-370 is located in β-sheet 8 and hydrogen-bonds with the carbonyl of Ala-192. P353L may alter the hydrogen bond of Arg-370 with the P-loop backbone by eliciting a conformational change, which is transmitted through helix G to β-sheet 8. Alternatively, Asp-348 hydrogen-bonds with N-1 of Arg-370, and the guanidinium group of Arg-370 hydrogen-bonds with the carbonyl of Ala-192. Ala-192 is"
