The primary auditory cortex showed increased activity in response to noise bursts, whereas acoustically matched speech syllables activated secondary auditory cortices bilaterally. Instructions to make judgments about different attributes of the same speech signal resulted in activation of specific lateralized neural systems. Discrimination of phonetic structure led to increased activity in part of Broca's area of the left hemisphere, suggesting a role for articulatory recoding in phonetic perception. Processing changes in pitch produced activation of the right prefrontal cortex, consistent with the importance of right-hemisphere mechanisms in pitch perception."

The p53 protein binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner and thus may regulate gene transcription. Cotransfection experiments showed that wild-type p53 activated the expression of genes adjacent to a p53 DNA binding site. The level of activation correlated with DNA binding in vitro. Oncogenic forms of p53 lost this activity. Moreover, all mutants inhibited the activity of coexpressed wild-type p53, providing a basis for the selection of such mutants during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1500891430,"A vacuolating toxin was purified to homogeneity from broth culture supernatant of the human gastric bacterium, Helicobacter pylori. The procedure for isolating the toxin included ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interactive chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography, which together resulted in a greater than 5000-fold purification of toxin activity. The molecular mass of the purified, denatured toxin was 87,000 +/- 320 daltons, and the native toxin was an aggregate with a molecular mass greater than or equal to 972,000 daltons. The amino-terminal sequence of the purified toxin was partially homologous with internal sequences of numerous transport or ion channel proteins. Antiserum raised against the M(r) = 87,000 protein neutralized toxin activity, whereas preimmune serum did not. When reacted with specific antiserum to the M(r) = 87,000 protein in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay, culture supernatants from eight tox+ H. pylori strains produced significantly higher optical density readings than eight tox- supernatants (0.614 +/- 0.11 versus 0.046 +/- 0.01, p less than 0.0001). Sera from H. pylori-infected humans recognized the purified M(r) = 87,000 protein significantly better by ELISA than sera from uninfected persons (0.424 +/- 0.06 versus 0.182 +/- 0.02, p = 0.0009). Finally, ELISA recognition of the purified M(r) = 87,000 protein by human sera was significantly associated with toxin-neutralizing activity (p = 0.019, r = 0.518)."
https://openalex.org/W1980192472,"In many different spatial discrimination tasks, such as in determining the sign of the offset in a vernier stimulus, the human visual system exhibits hyperacuity by evaluating spatial relations with the precision of a fraction of a photoreceptor's diameter. It is proposed that this impressive performance depends in part on a fast learning process that uses relatively few examples and that occurs at an early processing stage in the visual pathway. This hypothesis is given support by the demonstration that it is possible to synthesize, from a small number of examples of a given task, a simple network that attains the required performance level. Psychophysical experiments agree with some of the key predictions of the model. In particular, fast stimulus-specific learning is found to take place in the human visual system, and this learning does not transfer between two slightly different hyperacuity tasks."

https://openalex.org/W1481032119,"A monoclonal antibody (mAb), HPC-1, labels the plasma membrane of the amacrine cell soma and inner plexiform layer in rat retina and other central neurons. HPC-1 antigen recognizes several proteins of about 35 kDa. In this study, an HPC-1 positive cDNA, HPC-113, was isolated from a lambda gt11 cDNA library of the rat hippocampus. HPC-113 had the 894-base pair nucleotide sequence in an open reading frame and the calculated molecular mass of the deduced amino acid sequence (298 residues) was 33,989 Da, implying that HPC-113 contains almost the full-length coding region of HPC-1 antigen is an integrated membrane protein revealing the characteristic alpha-helical structure with periodical heptad repeats usually seen in proteins with coiled-coil structures. Although the entire amino acid sequence did not show significant homology to any proteins so far known, a few local sequences in the possible extracellular domain of the HPC-1 antigen molecule had notable homology to some partial sequences in the laminin B1 chain. These sequences of laminin are included in the portion which has neurite outgrowth and/or survival promoting activity. The HPC-1 gene was transcribed in nerve tissues much more predominantly than in non-neuronal tissues. Thus, HPC-1 antigen(s) was confined to be a newly identified neuronal cell membrane protein(s) localized in a subpopulation of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1562206355,"From bovine brain microtubules we purified tau protein kinase I (TPKI, Mr 45,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and tau protein kinase II (TPKII) whose activity was attributed to a 30-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE by affinity-labeling using an ATP analog. Both kinases were activated by tubulin. TPKII, but not TPKI, phosphorylated tau fragment peptides previously used for detection of a Ser/ThrPro kinase activity. Therefore, TPKII was considered to be the Ser/ThrPro kinase. TPKI was more effective than TPKII for producing the decrease of tau-1 immunoreactivity and mobility shift of tau on SDS-PAGE. Moreover, TPKI, but not TPKII nor other well-known protein kinases, generated an epitope present on paired helical filaments. These findings suggested that tau phosphorylated by TPKI resembled A-68, a component of paired helical filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1965236514,"After giving birth, sheep and many other species form a selective bond with their offspring based on the sense of smell. Processing of olfactory signals is altered to allow the animals to perform this selective recognition. Lamb odors have little effect on either neurotransmitter release or electrical activity of neurons in the olfactory bulb before birth. However, after birth there is an increase in the number of mitral cells, the principal cells of the olfactory bulb, that respond to lamb odors, which is associated with increased cholinergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter release. Selective recognition of lambs is accompanied by increased activity of a subset of mitral cells and release of glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from the dendrodendritic synapses between the mitral and granule cells. The relation between the release of each transmitter after birth also suggests an increased efficacy of glutamate-evoked GABA release."

https://openalex.org/W1537950723,"The gene for the beta A4-amyloid precursor protein (APP) consists of 19 exons which code for a typical N- and O-glycosylated transmembrane protein with four extracellular domains followed by the transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. The beta A4-amyloid sequence is part of exons 16 and 17. Several APP isoforms can be generated by alternative splicing of exons 7 and 8, encoding domains with homologies to Kunitz-type protease inhibitors and the MRC OX-2 antigen, respectively. The mechanism by which the pathological beta A4 is generated is unknown, it is however a critical event in Alzheimer's disease and is distinct from the normally occurring cleavage and secretion of APPs within the beta A4 sequence. We report here for the first time considerable APP mRNA expression by rat brain microglial cells. In addition we showed by S1 nuclease protection and polymerase chain reaction analysis of reverse transcribed RNA (RT-PCR) that T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and microglial cells expressed a new APP isoform by selection of a novel alternative splice site and exclusion of exon 15 of the APP gene. This leads to a transmembrane, beta A4 sequence containing APP variant, lacking 18 amino acid residues close to the amyloidogenic region. The use of this novel alternative splice site alters the structure of APP in close proximity to the beta A4 region and thus may determine a variant, potentially pathogenic processing of leukocyte-derived APP in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1486980795,"The two transcription activation functions (TAFs) of the human progesterone receptor (hPR) have been characterized. TAF-1, located in the N-terminal region A/B, has been narrowed down to a 91-amino acid sequence, which is sufficient for transcription activation in chimeras with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Both hPR TAF-1 and TAF-2 activate a minimal promoter in yeast. No autonomous TAF could be found in the N-terminal 164 amino acids (designated AB3) which are responsible for the differential activation of promoters by the hPR isoforms A and B. Reduction of the target gene promoter complexity did not alter this differential activation, indicating that AB3 does not require additional promoter-bound factors to exert its effect. Instead, the cell specificity of AB3 and its ability to squelch hPR-induced transcription suggest that this differential isoform activity is due to the effect of a limiting factor which binds to region AB3."
https://openalex.org/W2166606314,"High resolution crystal structures have been determined for six chicken-type lysozymes that were constructed to investigate putative intermediates in the evolution of the lysozymes of modern game birds (Malcolm, B. A., Wilson, K. P., Matthews, B. W., Kirsch, J. F., and Wilson, A. C. (1990) Nature 345, 86-89). The amino acid replacements include Thr-40—-Ser, Ile-55—-Val, and Ser-91—-Thr, as well as combinations of these substitutions. Residues 40, 55, and 91 are buried within the core of chicken lysozyme. The replacements therefore involve the insertion and/or removal of methyl groups from the protein interior. The mutant proteins have normal activities, and their thermal stabilities span a range of 7 degrees C, with some variants more stable and some less stable than the naturally occurring forms. Comparison of the crystal structures shows the overall structures to be very similar, but there are differences in the packing of side chains in the region of the replacements. The x-ray coordinates were used to evaluate the repacking of side chains in the protein interior and to attempt to evaluate the contributions of the different energetic interactions toward the overall stability of each variant. The results illustrate how proteins can compensate for potentially destabilizing substitutions in different ways and underscore the importance of high resolution structural data if changes in protein thermostability due to changes in protein sequence are to be understood. The findings also suggest that protein stability can be increased by mutations that lower strain in the protein interior while maintaining total buried hydrophobic surface area."
https://openalex.org/W1674184175,"The bovine brain A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) is distinct from other A1ARs in that it displays the unique agonist potency series of N6-R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) greater than N6-S-phenylisopropyladenosine (S-PIA) greater than 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine and has a 5-10-fold higher affinity for both agonists and antagonists. The cDNA for this receptor has been cloned from a size-selected (2-4-kb) bovine brain library and sequenced. The 2.0-kb cDNA encodes a protein of 326 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 36,570 daltons. The amino acid sequence fits well into the seven-transmembrane domain motif typical of G protein-coupled receptors. Northern analysis in bovine tissue using the full length cDNA demonstrates mRNAs of 3.4 and 5.7 kb with a tissue distribution consistent with A1AR binding. Subcloning of the cDNA in a pCMV5 expression vector with subsequent transfection into both COS7 and Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed a fully functional A1AR which could inhibit adenylylcyclase and retained the unique pharmacologic properties of the bovine brain A1AR. The A1AR was found to have a single histidine residue in each of transmembrane domains 6 and 7. Histidine residues have been postulated by biochemical studies to be important for ligand binding. Mutation of His-278 to Leu-278 (seventh transmembrane domain) dramatically decreased both agonist and antagonist binding by greater than 90%. In contrast, mutation of His-251 to Leu-251 decreased antagonist affinity and the number of receptors recognized by an antagonist radioligand. In contrast, agonist affinity was not perturbed but the number of receptors detected by an agonist radioligand was also reduced. These data suggest that both histidines are important for both agonist and antagonist binding, but His-278 appears critical for ligand binding to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1488594793,"Glucagon and the glucagon-like peptides play important roles in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that approximately 1300 base pairs of rat glucagon gene 5'-flanking sequences direct transgene expression to the pancreas and brain, but not to the intestine, of transgenic mice. These observations suggested that different tissue-specific enhancer elements mediate activation of glucagon gene transcription in the pancreas and intestine. We have now generated mice that express SV40 large T antigen under the control of approximately 2000 base pairs of glucagon gene 5'-flanking sequences. Transgene expression was observed in the brain and pancreas in association with the development of pancreatic endocrine tumors. In contrast to the mice described previously, we also detected transgene expression throughout the gastrointestinal tract in endocrine cells of the stomach and small and large intestine. Focal areas of enteroendocrine cell hyperplasia in the large bowel invariably progressed to invasive and metastasizing plurihormonal endocrine carcinoma, which was clinically and pathologically evident by 4 weeks of age. In contrast, transgene expression in the small bowel and stomach was not associated with progression to either hyperplasia or carcinoma. The results of these studies provide functional evidence for the existence of an upstream cis-acting regulatory domain that directs glucagon gene transcription to the endocrine cells of the intestine in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1522682756,"Specific metabolites of arachidonic and linoleic acid have been proposed as serving a regulatory function in growth factor signal transduction in fibroblasts. In studies with Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) fibroblasts, we found lipoxygenase inhibitors to be potent blockers of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent mitogenesis. Analytical chemical characterization of arachidonic and linoleic acid metabolism in SHE cells demonstrated that the major lipoxygenase product was 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE). EGF stimulation of quiescent SHE cells resulted in an enhancement of HODE biosynthesis. The primary arachidonate products were prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha formed via the cyclooxygenase pathway. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity did not alter the EGF-mitogenic response in SHE cells. Addition of lipoxygenase-derived linoleate metabolites (10(-10)-10(-6) M) produced a 2-4-fold potentiation of EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in SHE cells. Interestingly, the linoleate products did not enhance the EGF mitogenic effect in variant SHE cells that had lost tumor suppressor gene function. These results were confirmed by autoradiographic studies of DNA synthesis and suggest that loss of tumor suppressor phenotype correlates with a lack of responsiveness to linoleate products in signal transduction. In studies on the mechanism of EGF regulation of linoleic acid metabolism, inhibitors of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity were observed to block EGF-stimulated HODE biosynthesis. In addition, both cyclohexamide and actinomycin D attenuated the ability of EGF to increase linoleic acid metabolism in SHE cells. EGF induction of the linoleate pathway appears to be linked to activation of the EGF receptor and may be modulated at transcriptional or translational levels."
https://openalex.org/W1983600521,"The hydrophobic faces of single crystals of a series of pairs of racemic and chiral-resolved hydrophobic alpha-amino acids were used as a substrate, onto which water vapor has been cooled to freezing. The morphologies and molecular packing arrangements within each crystal pair are similar but only one of each pair exhibits a polar axis, parallel to the hydrophobic face exposed to water. Those crystals that have a polar axis induce a freezing point higher by 4 degrees to 5 degrees C than the corresponding crystals that do not have a polar axis. The results are interpreted in terms of an electric field mechanism that helps align the water molecules into ice-like clusters en route to crystallization."
https://openalex.org/W1557111900,"Neural cell adhesion molecule L1 is postulated to be involved in cell-cell interaction, neurite elongation, fasciculation of axons, cell migration, and myelination. To determine the function of L1 directly, we have transfected rat L1 cDNA into mouse fibroblast L cells. Stable transformants expressing L1 showed uniform surface expression of the molecule without phenotypic changes. Dispersed L1-expressing transfectants aggregated with faster kinetics than control cells in a homophilic manner. Divalent cations were not required for this cell aggregation. L1-transfected cells markedly enhanced neuronal cell adhesion and migration in co-culture with rat cerebellar neurons. These results indicate that L1 is involved in a determinant step of neural development through molecular interactions."

Chem. 267, 10791-10796), two invariant surface glycoproteins, ISG65 and ISG75, were identified in the mammalian stage of the parasitic protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei. In this study, the genes coding for these proteins have been isolated. Their nucleotide sequence suggests no relationship to other known genes and predicts polypeptides with NH2-terminal signal sequences, hydrophilic extracellular domains, single trans-membrane alpha-helices, and short cytoplasmic domains. ISG65 and ISG75 are expressed in bloodstream forms (70,000 and 50,000 molecules/cell, respectively) but not in the insect midgut stage. They can be detected in all T. brucei brucei variant clones investigated. Both polypeptides are distributed over the entire surface of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1494451260,"Low molecular weight phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases of human placenta and human red cell were purified and sequenced by a combination of Edman degradation and tandem mass spectrometry. Screening of a human placental lambda gt11 cDNA library yielded overlapping cDNA clones coding for two distinct human cytoplasmic low molecular weight phosphotyrosyl protein phosphatases (HCPTPs). The two longest clones, designated HCPTP1-1 and HCPTP2-1, were found to have identical nucleotide sequences, with the exception of a 108-base pair segment in the middle of the open reading frame. Polymerase chain reaction studies with human genomic DNA suggest that the difference between HCPTP1-1 and HCPTP2-1 does not result from alternative RNA splicing. Studies with a human chromosome 2-specific library confirmed that these sequences are located on chromosome 2, which is known to be the location of red cell acid phosphatase locus ACP1. The coding sequences of HCPTP1-1 and HCPTP2-1 were placed downstream from a bacteriophage T7 promoter and the proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. The resulting recombinant enzymes (designated HCPTP-A and HCPTP-B, respectively) showed molecular weights of 18,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and both of them exhibited immunoreactivity with antisera raised against authentic human placental and bovine heart enzymes. The expressed proteins were highly active towards the phosphatase substrates p-nitrophenyl phosphate, beta-naphthyl phosphate, and O-phospho-L-tyrosine, but not alpha-naphthyl phosphate, threonine phosphate, or O-phospho-L-serine. HCPTP-A and -B possessed effectively identical amino acid compositions, immunoreactivities, inhibition by formaldehyde, and kinetic properties when compared with two human red cell acid phosphatase isoenzymes. It is concluded that HCPTP-A and -B are the fast and slow forms of red cell acid phosphatase, respectively, and that this enzyme is not unique to the red cell but is instead expressed in all human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1506602661,"Surface proteins of the mammalian stage of the parasitic protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei, were biotinylated with sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexanoate. Since the predominant protein labeled by this reagent is the membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein (mfVSG), a procedure was developed to convert mfVSG to its soluble form by the endogenous glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C while retaining other biotinylated surface proteins in a membrane-bound state. From these membranes, three novel glycoproteins of 60, 65, and 75 kDa could be isolated by a combination of Triton X-114 phase separation and precipitations by streptavidin and concanavalin A coupled to solid supports. These polypeptides were detected in trypanosomes expressing different mfVSGs and are thus considered to be invariant. In a variant clone in which the mfVSG is trypsin-sensitive, the invariant surface glycoproteins of 65 and 75 kDa, designated ISG65 and ISG75, respectively, were proteolytically degraded with similar kinetics as the mfVSG. Neither ISG65 nor ISG75 could be detected in procyclic trypanosomes, the stage of the parasite characteristic for the insect midgut. Gene cloning reported in the accompanying paper (Ziegelbauer, K., Multhaup, G., and Overath, P. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10797-10803) suggests that ISG65 and ISG75 are transmembrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1490672339,"Prostaglandin G/H synthase (PGG/HS) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxanes. We screened a human lung fibroblast cDNA library with an ovine PGG/HS cDNA and isolated a 2.3-kilobase clone (HCO-T9). Sequence analysis of this clone showed that (a) it contained the entire translated region of PGG/HS and (b) it displayed an in-frame splicing of the last 111 base pairs encoded by exon 9, which resulted in the elimination of the N-glycosylation site at residue 409. Polymerase chain reaction amplification with specific oligonucleotides of reverse-transcribed mRNA from diverse human tissues and cultured cells yielded 400- and 300-base pair fragments that corresponded, respectively, to the intact and spliced transcripts. The expression of these two transcripts in cultured human lung fibroblasts was differentially regulated by serum, transforming growth factor beta 1, interleukin 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, as each of these conditions stimulated preferentially the expression of the unspliced transcripts. The elimination of one of the four N-glycosylation sites by the alternative splicing of exon 9 and the differential regulation of this process by relevant cytokines and growth factors may represent a mechanism for the regulation of PGG/HS enzymatic activity under physiological or pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1506141487,"We had proposed earlier that the anaerobe Oxalobacter formigenes sustains a proton-motive force by exploiting a secondary carrier rather than a primary proton pump. In this view, a carrier protein would catalyze the exchange of extracellular oxalate, a divalent anion, and intracellular formate, the monovalent product of oxalate decarboxylation. Such an electrogenic exchange develops an internally negative membrane potential, and since the decarboxylation reaction consumes an internal proton, the combined activity of the carrier and the soluble decarboxylase would constitute an proton pump with a stoichiometry of 1H+ per turnover. This model is now verified by identification and purification of OxlT, the protein responsible for the anion exchange reaction. Membranes of O. formigenes were solubilized at pH 7 with 1.25% octyl glucoside in 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid/K, in the presence of 0.4% Escherichia coli phospholipids and with 20% glucerol present as the osmolyte stabilant. Rapid methods for reconstitution were developed to monitor the distribution of OxlT during biochemical fractionation, allowing its purification by sequential anion and cation exchange chromatography. OxlT proved to be a single hydrophobic polypeptide, of 38 kDa mobility during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with a turnover number estimated as at least 1000/s. The properties of OxlT point to an indirect proton pump as the mechanism by which a proton-motive force arises in O. formigenes, and one may reasonably argue that indirect proton pumps take part in bacterial events such as acetogenesis, malolactate fermentation, and perhaps methanogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1491333609,"Many eukaryotic proteins are modified by N-linked glycosylation, a process in which oligosaccharides are added to asparagine residues in the sequon Asn-X-Ser/Thr. However, not all such sequons are glycosylated. For example, rabies virus glycoprotein (RGP) contains three sequons, only two of which appear to be glycosylated in virions. To examine further the signals in proteins which regulate N-linked core glycosylation, the glycosylation efficiencies of each of the three sequons in the antigenic domain of RGP were compared. For these studies, mutants were generated in which one or more sequons were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. Core glycosylation of these mutants was studied using two independent systems: 1) in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with dog pancreatic microsomes, and 2) transfection into glycosylation-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. Parallel results were obtained with both systems, demonstrating that the sequon at Asn37 is inefficiently glycosylated, the sequons at Asn247 and Asn319 are efficiently glycosylated, and the glycosylation efficiency of each sequon is not influenced by glycosylation at other sequons in this protein. High levels of cell surface expression of RGP in Chinese hamster ovary cells are seen with any mutant containing an intact sequon at Asn247 or Asn319, whereas low levels of cell surface expression are seen when the sequon at Asn37 is present alone; deletion of all three sequons completely blocks RGP cell surface expression. Thus, although core glycosylation at Asn37 is inefficient, it is still sufficient to support a biological function, cell surface expression. Future studies using mutagenesis of this model protein and its expression in these two well defined systems will aim to begin to unravel the rules governing core glycosylation of glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1515746559,"The alpha-hemolysin gene from Staphylococcus aureus, excluding the 5' region encoding the hydrophobic leader sequence, was amplified from genomic DNA. The identity of the disputed C terminus has been confirmed and revisions made to the internal sequence. The hemolysin is expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and has been purified to homogeneity from this source. In addition, active [35S-Met]alpha-hemolysin of high specific radioactivity can be generated in an E. coli transcription-translation system. By criteria based on protein chemistry, and biological and electrophysiological assays, the recombinant polypeptide is closely similar to the staphylococcal polypeptide ruling out the possibility of functionally important posttranslational modifications in S. aureus. Convenient new assays utilizing the 35S-labeled polypeptide to measure erythrocyte binding, oligomer formation in detergent and on target cells, and hemolysis have been developed. They have been used to demonstrate that a deletion mutant of alpha-hemolysin, in which five C-terminal amino acids are absent, is severely compromised in its ability both to oligomerize and to lyse rabbit erythrocytes. The mutant polypeptide nevertheless binds tightly to erythrocytes as a monomer, strengthening the idea that oligomerization is required for cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W1505436131,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) is a 25-kDa phosphoprotein that binds to the 7-methylguanosine cap of mRNA and acts, along with other eIF-4 polypeptides, to unwind mRNA secondary structure at the 5' terminus. Recent studies have indicated that eIF-4E acts as a protooncogene, but only in its phosphorylated state. In order to determine the role of eIF-4E in oncogenesis, we examined its regulation and expression in cloned rat embryo fibroblasts transformed with the Harvey ras (Ha-ras) oncogene. The expression of Ha-ras increased the rate of protein synthesis but did not increase the levels of eIF-4E mRNA or protein. However, a dramatic increase (7-fold) in phosphate incorporation into eIF-4E was observed. The percentage of eIF-4E in the phosphorylated state was the same in transfected and control cells, indicating that both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of eIF-4E were increased. Phosphopeptide mapping of eIF-4E from transformed cells indicated a single site of phosphorylation at Ser-53, which is the same as that identified previously in eIF-4E from reticulocytes and HeLa cells. These results indicate that p21ras is part of the signal transduction pathway leading to phosphorylation of eIF-4E. These findings also provide a potential mechanism for cell transformation by p21ras which involves the preferential stimulation of translation of certain mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2041802180,"Environmental stimuli that signal the occurrence of aversive or dangerous events activate endogenous opiate analgesia systems. Signals for safety (the nonoccurrence of aversive events) produce the opposite and inhibit environmentally produced analgesia. Stimuli that signal safety are now shown to abolish the analgesic effect of morphine, even when morphine is applied directly to spinal cord. Further, this antiopiate effect occurs because the environmental stimulus leads to release of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin in the spinal cord. This process may contribute to the regulation of pain and the development of opiate tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W1605449179,"The glutathione S-transferase pi gene (GST pi) is highly expressed in estrogen receptor negative (ER-) but not expressed in ER+ human breast cancer cell lines. To define regulatory mechanisms of GST pi gene expression, we analyzed both the activity of the GST pi promoter and the posttranscriptional fate of GST pi RNA sequences in three ER+ and three ER- breast cancer cell lines. Expression of a transiently transfected CAT reporter gene driven by the GST pi promoter and 2203 nucleotides of 5'-flanking sequences were similar in all six cell lines regardless of ER status. Endogenous GST pi transcription rates in nuclei isolated from ER- cells were quite low despite high steady state levels of cytoplasmic mRNA. Furthermore, the endogenous GST pi gene was transcribed in ER+ nuclei at rates similar to those obtained in ER- nuclei. We determined the stabilities of mRNAs transcribed from the endogenous GST pi gene (ER- cells) and from a stably transfected GST pi cDNA expression vector (ER+ and ER- cells). The endogenous GST pi mRNA was extraordinarily stable in ER- cells. Comparisons between transfected ER+ and ER- cells revealed no significant differences in the stabilities of transfection-derived GST pi mRNA sequences. We conclude that GST pi mRNA stability contributes significantly to the high levels of cytoplasmic mRNA observed in ER- cells, but that the differential expression of GST pi in ER+ versus ER- cells is governed by other posttranscriptional processes."
https://openalex.org/W1633199640,"The carbohydrate-recognition domain of rat serum mannose-binding protein A has been subjected to random cassette mutagenesis. Mutant domains, expressed in bacteria, were initially screened for binding to invertase-coated nitrocellulose and then analyzed further for Ca2+ affinity, saccharide binding, resistance to proteolysis, and oligomerization. The results are consistent with previous evolutionary and structural studies. Six out of seven completely inactive mutants have changes in residues directly involved in ligating Ca2+. Most changes in conserved residues which form part of the hydrophobic core characteristic of Ca(2+)-dependent (C-type) animal lectins result in decreased affinity for Ca2+, even though these residues are distant from the Ca2+ sites. Changes can be made in large portions of the surface without affecting saccharide binding. The results indicate that the precise arrangement of the regular portion of the domain containing the hydrophobic core is necessary for formation of a stable Ca(2+)-ligated structure under physiological conditions. The data also suggest that the saccharide-binding site is likely to be in close proximity to the bound Ca2+."

https://openalex.org/W1564503933,"A small redox-active protein has been purified to homogeneity from cell-free extracts of the strictly anaerobic thermophilic methanogen, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (strain Marburg). The purification consisted of streptomycin sulfate and acid treatments and three chromatographic steps using Sephadex G-75, Mono Q HR 10/10, and Superose 12 HR 10/30 columns. When these procedures were carried out under strictly anaerobic conditions, approximately 3 mg of this protein could be isolated from 45 g of wet cell paste. Like the thioredoxins and glutaredoxins, it is a small acidic protein (pI = 4.2) consisting of 83 amino acids (M(r) = 9136). In the presence of dithiothreitol or dihydrolipoate, the protein serves as a hydrogen donor for the ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli, and it catalyzes the reduction of insulin. However, it does not interact with the thioredoxin reductases from E. coli or Corynebacterium nephridii and does not function as a hydrogen donor for the ribonucleotide reductase of C. nephridii. The amino acid sequences determined by automated Edman degradation of the 14C-carboxymethylated protein and of peptides derived from trypsin and chymotrypsin digestions show a redox-active site -Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys-, typical of the glutaredoxins. Its amino acid sequence shows moderate identity with the known glutaredoxins (E. coli, yeast, rabbit bone marrow, calf thymus, and pig liver) when the proteins are aligned at the active site. The secondary structure of the glutaredoxin-like protein predicted by the Chou-Fasman procedure shows that it is similar to the known glutaredoxins. However, surprisingly, the protein does not function as a glutathione-disulfide oxidoreductase in the presence of glutathione and glutathione reductase. This glutaredoxin-like protein may be a component of a ribonucleotide-reducing system distinct from the previously described systems utilizing thioredoxin or glutaredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1661406919,"Some strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbor a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule, called T. We obtained T cDNA clones by random priming of denatured T dsRNA followed by reverse transcription. Sequence data of T show that only one strand ((+)-strand) has coding capacity for a protein with 940 amino acids which spans almost the entire length of the molecule (2.9 kilobases). Within this protein we found a sequence pattern characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of (+)-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses. Although T has no homology with other dsRNAs found in S. cerevisiae, such as L-A, L-BC, M1, or W, the T-encoded protein shows a high degree of conservation with the W-encoded protein. This conservation extends beyond a region that contains the consensus sequences for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, suggesting that both T and W are evolutionarily related. With a (+)-strand-specific probe for T we identified 23 S RNA, a new single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) species with a sedimentation coefficient of 23 S. T and 23 S RNA have the same mobility under denaturing conditions with glyoxal, suggesting that 23 S RNA is, in fact, the (+)-single-stranded RNA form of T dsRNA. 23 S RNA synthesis is induced under stress conditions such as heat shock and starvation. The relationship between T and 23 S RNA clearly resembles the one between W and its single-stranded derivative form, 20 S RNA. Thus T and W dsRNAs (and their respective single-stranded species) constitute a new RNA family in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1489909412,"Lipoprotein kinetic studies have demonstrated that a large proportion of Sf 60-400 very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is cleared directly from the circulation in Type IV hypertriglyceridemic subjects, at an unknown tissue site. The present studies were designed to investigate the role of hepatocytes in this process and to define the conditions, whereby Type IV Sf 60-400 VLDL would induce lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. Type IV VLDL (Sf 60-400) failed to augment the total cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, or triglyceride content of HepG2 cells following 24-h incubations. Coincubation of bovine milk lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and Type IV VLDL with HepG2 cells induced a 3-fold increment in cellular esterified cholesterol mass (p less than 0.005) and a 7-fold increase in cellular triglyceride mass (p less than 0.005), compared to VLDL alone. The increased cellular lipid mass was associated with increased oleate incorporation into cellular cholesterol esters and triglycerides. Exogenous LPL hydrolyzed 76% of the VLDL triglyceride over 24 h. LPL action on Type IV VLDL was sufficient to promote cellular uptake of these lipoproteins, while elevated media-free fatty acid levels were not. Although HepG2 cells secrete apolipoprotein (apo) E, we assessed the role of VLDL-associated apoE in the lipid accumulation induced by VLDL plus LPL. ApoE-rich and apoE-poor Type IV VLDL subfractions induced similar increments in cellular esterified cholesterol in the presence of LPL, despite a 4-fold difference in apoE content. Sf 60-400 VLDL, from subjects homozygous for the defective apoE2, plus LPL, behaved identically to Type IV VLDL plus LPL. Type IV VLDL plus LPL, preincubated with anti-apoE (1D7) and apoB (5E11) monoclonal antibodies, known to block the binding of apoE and -B, respectively, to the LDL receptor failed to block lipid accumulation. In contrast, apoE-poor Type IV VLDL, apoE2 VLDL, and VLDL plus 1D7 were taken up poorly by J774 cells, cells that secrete LPL, but not apoE. These studies suggest that lipolytic remodeling of large Type IV VLDL by LPL is a prerequisite for their uptake by HepG2 cells and that HepG2 cell-secreted apoE rather than VLDL-associated apoE is the ligand involved in uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1542753223,"In adult mammals, injured axons regrow over long distances in peripheral nerves but fail to do so in the central nervous system. Analysis of molecular components of tissue environments that allow axonal regrowth revealed a dramatic increase in the level of hemopexin, a heme-transporting protein, in long-term axotomized peripheral nerve. In contrast, hemopexin did not accumulate in lesioned optic nerve. Sciatic nerve and skeletal muscle, but not brain, were shown to be sites of synthesis of hemopexin. Thus, hemopexin expression, which can no longer be considered to be liver-specific, correlates with tissular permissivity for axonal regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1497642271,rap1GAP is a GTPase activating protein that specifically stimulates the GTP hydrolytic rate of the ras-related protein p21rap1.rap1GAP undergoes post-translational modification that causes a substantial change in its mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. At least part of this modification is due to the phosphorylation. Expression of a rap1GAP cDNA in insect cells labeled with 32Pi resulted in high level incorporation of radioactivity into serine residues of the expressed protein. Purified rap1GAP was phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent kinase and the cell cycle p34cdc2 kinase. The molar ratio of incorporated phosphate/rap1GAP was approximately 3 by cAMP-dependent kinase and 2 by p34cdc2. The sites of phosphorylation by both kinases were localized to a 100-residue segment contained in the carboxyl-terminal region of the predicted primary structure of rap1GAP. Highly favorable recognition sequences for the two kinases are contained within this fragment and are proposed as the sites of phosphorylation. Treatment of SK-MEL-3 cells with dibutyryl cAMP promoted phosphorylation of rap1GAP in vivo. Based on the results of comparative phosphopeptide mapping the sites of phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro are identical.
https://openalex.org/W1577958516,"AP-2 and AP-3 are cellular proteins that drive the in vitro polymerization of clathrin triskelia into cage structures. The interaction of these two types of assembly proteins (APs) with preassembled clathrin cages has been studied in order to identify the sites on the triskelia required for binding. Comparing binding of the APs to intact or to proteolytically clipped cages, we attempted to distinguish between binding to the terminal domain, the globular end of the heavy chain, and binding to the hub of the clathrin triskelia, the portion that remains assembled after trypsin treatment. AP-3 binds to intact clathrin cages but not to those that were treated with trypsin. AP-3 also bound to cages consisting solely of clathrin heavy chains; proteolysis of these cages also eliminated AP-3 binding. In addition, AP-3 did not bind to either isolated hubs or terminal domains that had been immobilized on Sepharose. These data indicate that clathrin light chains are not required for binding of AP-3, and that neither terminal domain nor hubs alone will suffice. However, an intact heavy chain is both necessary and sufficient for the binding of AP-3. Previous work has demonstrated one binding site for AP-2 on proteolyzed cages containing only clathrin hubs; the existence of a second binding site associated with the terminal domain was hypothesized. Here we provide direct evidence for recognition by AP-2 of isolated terminal domains immobilized on Sepharose and show that the core of the AP-2 molecule is responsible for this interaction. These results provide the first demonstration of a functional role for the conserved terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W1535036367,"Chick brain precursor neurons were observed to introduce sialic acid biosynthetically into only three specific gangliosides: monosialosyl lactosyl ceramide (GM3), disialosyl lactosyl ceramide (GD3), and disialosyl gangliotrihexosyl ceramide (GD2), when sialic acid was labeled metabolically by its obligate precursor, [3H] ManNAc. Sialosyl donor CMP-[3H]NeuAc supplied in the culture medium gave rise uniquely to surface-labeled GD3. Thus sialosyl transferase/GD3 synthase activity is expressed both intraneuronally and in the neuronal exofacial surface. Upon epidermal growth factor-induced onset of neurite outgrowth, labeled complex sialosyl gangliotetrahexosyl ceramide species of gangliosides began to appear in the embryonic neuronal plasma membrane. However, intraneuronal and exofacial sialosyl transferase/GD3 synthase activities remained constant, with or without neurite outgrowth. Moreover, simpler species of gangliosides maintained a steady quantitative sialosyl level (1.6 +/- 0.2 micrograms of sialic acid/mg of protein), whereas more complex species completely absent before neurite outgrowth accrued and reached 4.8 +/- 0.9 micrograms of sialic acid/mg of protein with full neurite development. This analysis of developmental patterns of ganglioside sialosylation has provided evidence that stable neurite outgrowth depends upon generation by the neuron of special plasma membrane with a massive content of complex higher species of gangliosides."
https://openalex.org/W1569644904,"Circular duplex DNA containing the SV40 replication origin was assembled into chromosomes in vitro with core histones and nucleosome assembly factor from HeLa cells. Their ability to serve as a template for replication was examined by incubating them with SV40 T antigen and HeLa cell extract. Nucleosome assembly of the template prevented DNA replication. Replication of chromosomes was severely inhibited at more than two-thirds of physiological nucleosome density. When the DNA was preincubated with T antigen and then assembled into chromosomes, however, inhibition of DNA replication was greatly reduced. These results suggest that nucleosome assembly of the template inhibits initiation of SV40 DNA replication and that the inhibition can be overcome by formation of an initiation complex before nucleosome assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1552052595,"We have reported an accumulation of T-kininogen mRNA in the liver of aging Sprague-Dawley rats. T-kininogen is a cysteine proteinase inhibitor. Since a disruption of the intracellular protein degradation machinery is known to occur during senescence, we wished to further define the role of this protein in the aging process. As a first step, we have measured T-kininogen levels both in serum and within the liver. We have found that serum protein levels are indeed augmented during senescence, although not as dramatically as the mRNA (2.5-fold versus 8.3-fold). Immunocytochemistry, as well as Western blot analysis suggests that this is due to the presence of T-kininogen within hepatic cells in aged rats. Life-long dietary restriction, a known age-prolonging treatment, decreases the overexpression of the protein in 24-month-old rats. Later, diet-restricted animals still show an increased expression from the gene, the effect being delayed but not abolished by dietary manipulation. Interestingly, a longitudinal study indicated the existence of a positive correlation between the time of increase of serum T-kininogen and the time of death of the animal. Serum T-kininogen was found to increase 2.5-4 months before death."
https://openalex.org/W1502770681,"The connector of bacteriophage phi 29 is required for prohead assembly, binds DNA, and drives DNA packaging into viral proheads. Limited proteolysis of the connector protein with endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus aureus V8 and chymotrypsin showed that a domain of the NH2-terminal region is involved in DNA binding and in the subsequent packaging into preformed proheads, but not in prohead assembly. Mutants in specific amino acids of the NH2-terminal domain, obtained by directed mutagenesis techniques, showed that the Ala1-Arg2-Lys3-Arg4 region of the connector is absolutely necessary for DNA packaging into the proheads as well as for efficient DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1562180152,"OxlT, a secondary carrier found in Oxalobacter formigenes, mediates the exchange of divalent oxalate and monovalent formate. Because OxlT has an unusually high turnover number (greater than or equal to 1000/s), and because formate, one its substrates, shows high passive membrane permeability as formic acid, it has been difficult to obtain information on protein-substrate interactions using traditional methods in membrane biology. For this reason, we devised a new way to measure substrate dissociation constants. Detergent-solubilized material was exposed to inactivating temperatures in the absence or presence of OxlT substrates, and periodic reconstitution was used to monitor the kinetics of thermal decay. The data were consistent with a simple scheme in which only unliganded OxlT was temperature-sensitive; this premise, along with the assumption of equilibrium between liganded and unliganded species, allowed calculation of substrate dissociation constants for oxalate (18 +/- 3 microM), malonate (1.2 +/- 0.2 mM), and formate (3.1 +/- 0.6 mM). Further analysis revealed that substrate binding energy contributed at least 3.5 kcal/mol to stabilization of solubilized OxlT. Accordingly, we suggest that substrate binding energy is directly involved in driving protein structure reorganization during membrane transport. This new approach to analyzing protein-substrate interactions may have wider application in the study of membrane carriers."
https://openalex.org/W1622562746,"In higher plants the small subunit (S) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (ribulose-P2 carboxylase, EC 4.1.1.39) contains a segment of 16 amino acids which is absent from cyanobacterial S. This segment connecting two beta sheets has been shown, by crystallographic analysis, to form a hairpin loop. The quaternary structure of ribulose-P2 carboxylase indicates several S to large subunit (L) interactions. Eleven of 22 residues within the loop form the interface with 20 residues from two different L dimers. Eight of the loop residues are involved in hydrogen bonds, salt links, and hydrophobic interactions. To test the hypothesis, whether this loop had a function in the assembly of L and S into the hexadecameric enzyme, 6 amino acids within the loop were modified by site-directed mutagenesis of the pea rbcS-3A gene. All substituted S were imported by isolated chloroplasts from pea with wild type efficiency. Mutants E54-R, H55-A, P59-A, D63-G, D63-L, and Y66-A were assembly-competent, indicating that changes of side chains at these positions are tolerated. Replacement of arginine 53, whose side chain forms H-bonds with L residues Y226 and G261, with glutamate completely abolished assembly into holoenzyme. We suggest that arginine 53 in S is essential for ribulose-P2 carboxylase quaternary structure in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1540702128,"Activation of resting human peripheral blood T lymphocytes by the lectin phytohemagglutinin results in an increase in methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) activity, accompanied by an increase in the amount of the alpha/alpha' catalytic subunits of the enzyme. In contrast, the amount of the noncatalytic beta subunit remains constant throughout the course of the response. Using both polyclonal antibodies to the holoenzyme and monoclonal antibodies to the alpha/alpha' subunits, we detected a cross-reactive 68-kDa protein, which we refer to as lambda. This protein is present in high abundance in resting T cells but decreases upon cell stimulation, as both MAT activity and the amount of the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits increase. The decrease in lambda and increase in alpha/alpha' occurs after interleukin-2 production and before DNA synthesis. lambda virtually disappears when the cells are actively dividing. Several continuous T cell lines (HPB-ALL, MOLT-4, and Jurkat) as well as a freshly isolated T cell leukemia (ALL-2) had no detectable lambda. The Km for L-methionine for enzyme from resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 19-23 microM, which is 3-8-fold higher than purified MAT from fresh leukemic cells or enzyme from Jurkat cells, both of which have a Km of 3.5-3.8 microM. Kinetic analysis of enzyme activity from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggested the presence of two forms of enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of AdoMet. After separation of lambda from the alpha and beta subunits by hydrophobic chromatography, it was determined that lambda has MAT activity but that it is significantly less active than the form containing the alpha subunit. It therefore appears that in resting T cells MAT is sequestered as a less active form. We hypothesize that lambda is a precursor to the catalytic subunits of human lymphocyte MAT and propose that the transition from lambda to alpha/alpha' may be important in the response of T cells to mitogenic signals."
https://openalex.org/W1497225109,"Anti-idiotypic antibodies were used to mimic the binding surface of the T4 bacteriophage deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase enzyme, providing an immunological probe for protein-protein interactions involving this enzyme. Polyclonal dCMP hydroxymethylase antibodies were affinity-purified and used to generate anti-idiotypic antibodies. The anti-idiotypic serum immunoprecipitated two native viral proteins, deoxycytidylate hydroxymethylase (EC 2.1.2.8) and thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45), from a sonicated detergent-treated extract of T4-infected Escherichia coli. The anti-anti-dCMP hydroxymethylase antibody was found to be specific in binding to the T4 dTMP synthase, with no detectable affinity for the host dTMP synthase. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated the viral dCMP hydroxymethylase and dTMP synthase to be associated in a deoxyribonucleotide synthetase enzyme complex. Our current approach, using anti-idiotypic antibodies as probes for protein-protein interactions, and complementary studies involving dCMP hydroxymethylase enzyme affinity columns indicate a direct association between bacteriophage T4 dCMP hydroxymethylase and dTMP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1727332411,"The Nb2 node lymphoma cell line has been widely used as a model for investigating lactogen cellular actions. Both pertussis (PTX) and cholera (CTX) toxins modulate lactogen-stimulated Nb2 cell mitogenesis, suggesting G protein involvement in lactogen signal transduction. The following studies were performed to further investigate this possibility. Both PTX-sensitive (41 kDa) and CTX-sensitive substrates (42 and 45 kDa) were identified in Nb2 cell membrane and recognized by specific anti-Gi and anti-Gs antibodies, respectively. Equal numbers of Nb2 cells were then incubated with the lactogen human growth hormone (hGH, 10 ng/ml) for 0-72 h. Membrane protein prepared from each time point (50 micrograms) was compared in toxin-stimulated ADP-ribosylation studies. CTX-stimulated ADP-ribosylation was unaffected by prior hGH incubation. PTX-stimulated ADP-ribosylation increased 237 +/- 69% (X +/- S.E.) compared with 0-h controls (n = 11; p less than 0.01) after 4-7 h of hGH incubation then decreased toward 0-h samples by 24 and 72 h. No change in Gi alpha concentration was observed, but beta subunit concentration increased (145 +/- 14% at 7 h; p less than 0.01; n = 3) in a time course that paralleled the changes in PTX-stimulated ADP-ribosylation. In summary, 1) both Gi and Gs were present in Nb2 cell membrane, 2) incubation of cells with a lactogen, hGH, for 4-7 h markedly enhanced PTX-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha in vitro, whereas CTX-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha was unchanged, and 3) although no change in Gi alpha concentration was observed, beta subunit concentration increased in parallel with the increase in PTX-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha. These results suggest that hGH may modify PTX-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of Gi not by changing Gi alpha concentration, perhaps by increasing beta subunit concentration, enhancing association of Gi alpha by beta gamma subunits, which, in turn, is preferentially ADP-ribosylated. This may represent a late signal transduction event and may also have implications for other effectors dependent on Gi-mediated events."
https://openalex.org/W1582807621,"Abstract The binding of an appropriate ligand to its specific receptor on the membrane of T cells triggers a cascade of events involved in T cell activation. An important yet unanswered question is how the mitogenic signals are transmitted through the cytoplasm and into the nucleus. The present study was carried out to determine changes in the microtubule (MT) system, following T cell activation. Fluorescence microscopy was employed to examine the organization of the microtubule network in human peripheral blood T cells in response to four different mitogens (phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, anti-CD3, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). The microtubules increase in length, number, and complexity of distribution 20 h after mitogenic stimulation. Using an in situ direct analysis protocol consisting of selective extraction of cells with detergent and Ca2+, 11 protein species, which fulfill the operational definition of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), were identified in resting human T cells. Alterations in the expression of these protein species were studied following mitogenic stimulation. These alterations in MAPs expression were also found in purified blast cell fractions indicating that they were specific changes occurring in activated T cell populations. These observations suggest a role for MT and MAPs in the cascade of human T cell activation."
