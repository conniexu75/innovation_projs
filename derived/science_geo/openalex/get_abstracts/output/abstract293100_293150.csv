https://openalex.org/W2078758890,Relatively unoxidized black uranium ores from sandstone deposits in the western United States show deviations in the uranium-235 to uranium-234 ratio throughout a range from 40 percent excess uranium-234 to 40 percent deficient uranium-234 with respect to a reference uranium-235 to uranium-234 ratio. The deficient uranium-234 is leached preferentially to uranium-238 and the excess uranium-234 is believed to result from deposition of uranium-234 enriched in solutions from leached deposits.

On the other hand, if freshly applied asphalt is used as a binder for a white material such as gypsum or lime, subsurface temperatures can be dropped as much as 24 degrees F. The cost and permanence of such coatings might permit their use to cover very large areas of the earth, and the coatings might prove effective in modifying weather."

These changes are accompanied by atrophy, similar to that caused by hypophysectomy, of the ovaries and uterus of the female or testes and accessory glands of the male."

https://openalex.org/W2050323674,"Occurrence of light saturation in the reaction of thionine (T) with Fe2+ suggests the existence of T â‹… Fe2+ complexes practically indistinguishable by their absorption spectra from free thionine; photoreduction seems to occur by electron transfer in such complexes, delayed by more than 10-5 second after light absorption. Both phenomena must be of general significance."
https://openalex.org/W2025134557,"A solid sample of octadecane-1-H(3) was found to show a fairly good proportionality of the counting rate to the amount of the sample. Taking account of the synthetic process, nonvolatility, and spreadability of octadecane, this compound offers a possibility of being used as a standard sample for counting the radioactivity of tritium."

https://openalex.org/W1966643493,"The aecial stage of a rust on Ephedra has been called a Peridermium. Clues as to its telial stage have been lacking. It is here described as resembling more a form of Roestelia, and the reasons for its possible relation to Gymnosporangium multiporum Kern are presented: the two sets of hosts have similar distributions: the two rust stages have the same geographic range; they have been found in close proximity in the field."
