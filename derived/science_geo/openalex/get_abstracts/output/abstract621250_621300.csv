https://openalex.org/W2781822280,"Activity in the motor cortex predicts movements, seconds before they are initiated. This preparatory activity has been observed across cortical layers, including in descending pyramidal tract neurons in layer 5. A key question is how preparatory activity is maintained without causing movement, and is ultimately converted to a motor command to trigger appropriate movements. Here, using single-cell transcriptional profiling and axonal reconstructions, we identify two types of pyramidal tract neuron. Both types project to several targets in the basal ganglia and brainstem. One type projects to thalamic regions that connect back to motor cortex; populations of these neurons produced early preparatory activity that persisted until the movement was initiated. The second type projects to motor centres in the medulla and mainly produced late preparatory activity and motor commands. These results indicate that two types of motor cortex output neurons have specialized roles in motor control."
https://openalex.org/W2802570435,"Controlling a quantum system by using observations of its dynamics is complicated by the backaction of the measurement process—that is, the unavoidable quantum disturbance caused by coupling the system to a measurement apparatus. An efficient measurement is one that maximizes the amount of information gained per disturbance incurred. Real-time feedback can then be used to cancel the backaction of the measurement and to control the evolution of the quantum state. Such measurement-based quantum control has been demonstrated in the clean settings of cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics, but its application to motional degrees of freedom has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate measurement-based quantum control of the motion of a millimetre-sized membrane resonator. An optomechanical transducer resolves the zero-point motion of the resonator in a fraction of its millisecond-scale coherence time, with an overall measurement efficiency close to unity. An electronic feedback loop converts this position record to a force that cools the resonator mode to its quantum ground state (residual thermal occupation of about 0.29). This occupation is nine decibels below the quantum-backaction limit of sideband cooling and six orders of magnitude below the equilibrium occupation of the thermal environment. We thus realize a long-standing goal in the field, adding position and momentum to the degrees of freedom that are amenable to measurement-based quantum control, with potential applications in quantum information processing and gravitational-wave detectors. The displacement of a mechanical resonator is measured to within 35% of the Heisenberg uncertainty limit, enabling feedback cooling to the quantum ground state, nine decibels below the quantum-backaction limit."
https://openalex.org/W2898777639,"Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the spinal cord restores locomotion in animal models of spinal cord injury but is less effective in humans. Here we hypothesized that this interspecies discrepancy is due to interference between EES and proprioceptive information in humans. Computational simulations and preclinical and clinical experiments reveal that EES blocks a significant amount of proprioceptive input in humans, but not in rats. This transient deafferentation prevents modulation of reciprocal inhibitory networks involved in locomotion and reduces or abolishes the conscious perception of leg position. Consequently, continuous EES can only facilitate locomotion within a narrow range of stimulation parameters and is unable to provide meaningful locomotor improvements in humans without rehabilitation. Simulations showed that burst stimulation and spatiotemporal stimulation profiles mitigate the cancellation of proprioceptive information, enabling robust control over motor neuron activity. This demonstrates the importance of stimulation protocols that preserve proprioceptive information to facilitate walking with EES. Electrical spinal cord stimulation interferes with natural proprioceptive information in humans. Ecological stimulation protocols that preserve limb position awareness and proprioceptive circuit dynamics facilitate walking after spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W2898385186,"Deconstructive functionalization involves carbon–carbon (C–C) bond cleavage followed by bond construction on one or more of the constituent carbons. For example, ozonolysis1 and olefin metathesis2,3 have allowed each carbon in C=C double bonds to be viewed as a functional group. Despite the substantial advances in deconstructive functionalization involving the scission of C=C double bonds, there are very few methods that achieve C(sp3)–C(sp3) single-bond cleavage and functionalization, especially in relatively unstrained cyclic systems. Here we report a deconstructive strategy to transform saturated nitrogen heterocycles such as piperidines and pyrrolidines, which are important moieties in bioactive molecules, into halogen-containing acyclic amine derivatives through sequential C(sp3)–N and C(sp3)–C(sp3) single-bond cleavage followed by C(sp3)–halogen bond formation. The resulting acyclic haloamines are versatile intermediates that can be transformed into various structural motifs through substitution reactions. In this way we achieve the skeletal remodelling of cyclic amines, an example of scaffold hopping. We demonstrate this deconstructive strategy by the late-stage diversification of proline-containing peptides. The silver-mediated deconstructive functionalization of saturated nitrogen heterocycles via acylic haloamine intermediates provides access to various acyclic amines as well as enabling ring contraction and skeletal remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W2898756839,"The circadian clock is closely related to human health, such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Our previous study revealed that irregular feeding induced abnormal lipid metabolism with disruption of the hepatic circadian clock. We hypothesized that breakfast skipping induces lipid abnormalities, such as adiposity, by altering the hepatic circadian oscillation of clock and lipid metabolism-related genes. Here, we established a delayed first active-phase meal (DFAM) protocol as a breakfast-skipping model. Briefly, rats were fed a high-fat diet during zeitgeber time (ZT) 12–24 in a control group and ZT 16–4 in the DFAM group. The DFAM group showed increased body weight gain and perirenal adipose tissue weight without a change in total food intake. The circadian oscillations of hepatic clock and de novo fatty acid synthesis genes were delayed by 2–4 h because of DFAM. The peaks of serum insulin, a synchronizer for the liver clock, bile acids, and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) were delayed by 4–6 h because of DFAM. Moreover, DFAM delayed the surge in body temperature by 4 h and may have contributed to the increase in body weight gain and adipose tissue weight because of decreased energy expenditure. These data indicated a potential molecular mechanism by which breakfast skipping induces abnormal lipid metabolism, which is related to the altered circadian oscillation of hepatic gene expression. The results also suggested that the delayed peaks of serum NEFA, bile acids, and insulin entrain the circadian rhythm of hepatic clock and lipid metabolism-related genes."

The purpose of this study was to measure the basic timely childhood immunization coverage and to identify determinants of factors influencing childhood immunization coverage in Sindh, Pakistan. Methods Data from Maternal and Child Health Program Indicator Survey 2013–2014 which was conducted in Sindh province of Pakistan was used. Outcome measure was full coverage of the basic immunization schedule from child’s vaccination card. The association of receiving basic immunization with demographic factors, socioeconomic status, mother and child health information sources, and perinatal care factors were tested by binary logistic regression. Results Among 2,253 children, 1,156 (51.3%) received age-based full basic immunization. The basic immunization rates were 69.1% for under five weeks old, 38.3% for six to nine weeks, 18.8% for 10–13 weeks, 44.0% for 14 weeks-eight months, 60.4% for nine to 11 months, and 59.1% for over one year. Child’s age, number of living children, parents’ education level, wealth, the source of mother and child health information, number of antenatal care, and assistance during delivery were associated with completing basic immunization. Conclusions The overall full basic immunization coverage in Pakistan was still low. Policy makers should identify children at risk of low immunization coverage and obstacles of receiving antenatal care, implement educational interventions targeting on less educated parents, and conduct mass immunization campaigns for timely and complete immunization."
https://openalex.org/W2899513798,"Pancreatic cancer, mostly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), is one of the most lethal cancers, with a dismal median survival around 8 months. PDAC is notoriously resistant to chemotherapy. Thus far, numerous attempts using novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies yielded limited clinical benefits for pancreatic cancer patients. It is hoped that delineating the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance in pancreatic cancer may provide novel therapeutic options. Using acquired gemcitabine resistant pancreatic cell lines, we revealed an important role of the GLI-SOX2 signaling axis for regulation of gemcitabine sensitivity in vitro and in animal models. Down-regulation of GLI transcriptional factors (GLI1 or GLI2), but not SMO signaling inhibition, reduces tumor sphere formation, a characteristics of tumor initiating cell (TIC). Down-regulation of GLI transcription factors also decreased expression of TIC marker CD24. Similarly, high SOX2 expression is associated with gemcitabine resistance whereas down-regulation of SOX2 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment. We further revealed that elevated SOX2 expression is associated with an increase in GLI1 or GLI2 expression. Our ChIP assay revealed that GLI proteins are associated with a putative Gli binding site within the SOX2 promoter, suggesting a more direct regulation of SOX2 by GLI transcription factors. The relevance of our findings to human disease was revealed in human cancer specimens. We found that high SOX2 protein expression is associated with frequent tumor relapse and poor survival in stage II PDAC patients (all of them underwent gemcitabine treatment), indicating that reduced SOX2 expression or down-regulation of GLI transcription factors may be effective in sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2806614401,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder associated with social impairments, communication difficulties, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Yet, there is no confirmed cause identified for ASD. Studying the functional connectivity of the brain is an emerging technique used in diagnosing and understanding ASD. In this study, we obtained the resting state functional MRI data of 283 subjects from the National Database of Autism Research (NDAR). An automated autism diagnosis system was built using the data from NDAR. The proposed system is machine learning based. Power spectral densities (PSDs) of time courses corresponding to the spatial activation areas are used as input features, feeds them to a stacked autoencoder then builds a classifier using probabilistic support vector machines. Over the used dataset, around 90% of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was achieved by our machine learning system. Moreover, the system generalization ability was checked over two different prevalence values, one for the general population and the other for the of high risk population, and the system proved to be very generalizable, especially among the population of high risk. The proposed system generates a full personalized report for each subject, along with identifying the global differences between ASD and typically developed (TD) subjects and its ability to diagnose autism. It shows the impacted areas and the severity of implications. From the clinical aspect, this report is considered very valuable as it helps in both predicting and understanding behavior of autistic subjects. Moreover, it helps in designing a plan for personalized treatment per each individual subject. The proposed work is taking a step towards achieving personalized medicine in autism which is the ultimate goal of our group's research efforts in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2898670767,"The pyrolysis process of various types of biomass (agricultural and wood by-products) in non-isothermal conditions using simultaneous thermal analyses (STA) was investigated. Devolatilization kinetics was implemented through combined application of model-free methods and DAEM (distributed activation energy model) using Gaussian distribution functions of activation energies. Results obtained were used in the curve prediction of the rate of mass loss against temperature at various heating rates by numerical optimization. The possible calculation of biomass samples behavior under pyrolytic conditions as the summation of their pseudo-components, hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin is also explored. The differences between experimental and calculated data are less than 3.20% offering a quality test of applicability of proposed model on the kinetic studies of a wide range of biomass samples. It seems that the most physically realistic model is the decomposition of biomass in three reactions, depending on the composition of the biomass regarding hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin. Kinetic model applied here may serve as a starting point to build more complex models capable of describing the thermal behavior of plant materials during thermochemical processing."
https://openalex.org/W2899162995,"Self-medication is very common especially in developing countries and is documented to be associated with many health risks including antibiotic resistance. This study investigated the prevalence, determinants and knowledge of self-medication among residents of Siha District in Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 residents in a rural District of Kilimanjaro region, North-eastern Tanzania from 1st to 28th April 2017. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information regarding drugs used, knowledge, history and reasons for antibiotic self-medication. Log-binomial regression analysis was done using STATA 13 to examine factors associated with self-medication. A slightly majority of the respondents (58%) admitted to self-medication. Antibiotics most commonly utilized were amoxycillin (43%) and an antiprotozoal drug metronidazole (10%). The most common symptoms that led to self-medication were cough (51.17%), headache/ fever/ malaria (25.57%) and diarrhoea (21.59%). The most common reasons for self-medication were emergency illness (24.00%), health facility charges (20.33%), proximity of pharmacy to home (17.00%) and no reason (16.66%). Almost all reported that self-medication is not better than seeking medical consultation, 98% can result into harmful effects and 96% can result to drug resistance. The level of self-medication in this study is comparable with findings from other studies in developing countries. Pharmacies were commonly used as the first point of medical care. There is therefore a need for educative antibiotic legislative intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of antibiotic self-medication in Siha district in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W2898766183,"Viruses hijack and modify host cell functions to maximize viral proliferation. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reorganizes host cell metabolism to produce specialized membrane structures and to modify organelles such as double-membrane vesicles and enlarged lipid droplets (LDs), thereby enabling virus replication and assembly. However, the molecular bases of these host–HCV interactions are largely unknown. Here, using a chemical screen, we demonstrate that the benzamide derivative flutamide reduces the host capacity to produce infectious HCV. Flutamide disrupted the formation of enlarged LDs in HCV-infected cells, thereby abolishing HCV assembly. We also report that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a known flutamide target, plays a key role in mediating LD accumulation and HCV production. This AhR function in lipid production was also observed in HCV-uninfected Huh-7 cells and primary human hepatocytes, suggesting that AhR signaling regulates lipid accumulation independently of HCV infection. We further observed that a downstream activity, that of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), was the primary regulator of AhR-mediated lipid production. Specifically, blockade of AhR-induced CYP1A1 up-regulation counteracted LD overproduction, and overproduction of CYP1A1, but not of CYP1B1, in AhR-inactivated cells restored lipid accumulation. Of note, HCV infection up-regulated the AhR–CYP1A1 pathway, resulting in the accumulation of enlarged LDs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the AhR–CYP1A1 pathway has a significant role in lipid accumulation, a hallmark of HCV infection that maximizes progeny virus production. Our chemical–genetic analysis reveals a new strategy and lead compounds to control hepatic lipid accumulation as well as HCV infection.

https://openalex.org/W2899354526,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function to down-regulate gene expression involving in various cellular processes related to carcinogenesis. Recently, miR-22 was identified as a tumor-suppressing miRNA in many human cancers. However, the regulatory mechanism and the specific function of this miRNA in cervical cancer remain unclear. In the present study, we carried out gene transfection, western blot and quantitative RT-PCR to explore the regulatory mechanism and the functional role of miR-22 in cervical cancer. We verified that miR-22 was down-regulated in cervical cancer tissues and cervical cancer cell lines relative to matched non-tumor tissues and normal human cervical keratinocyte line (HCK1T). By contrast, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) was inversely correlated with miR-22 in both cervical tissues and cancer cell lines. Mechanically, HDAC6 was down-regulated by miR-22 at the post-transcriptional level, via a specific target site within the 3’UTR, identified by a luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, we also showed that the correlation between miR-22 and HDAC6 expression was regulated by an E6/p53 pathway in HCK1Ts expressing HPV16 E6. For functional study, an ectopic expression of miR-22 could inhibit cell proliferation and migration, and could induce apoptosis of cervical cancer cell lines. These findings demonstrated that miR-22 was down-regulated in cervical cancer and inversely collated with its downstream target HDAC6. MiR-22 acts as tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation and migration, and by inducing apoptosis of cervical cancer cell lines by targeting the 3’UTR of HDAC6. This newly identified E6/p53/miR-22/HDAC6 regulatory network might be a candidate therapeutic target for cervical cancer."

Objectives To compare the effects of adding electrical dry needling into a program of manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound on pain, function and related-disability in individuals with plantar fasciitis (PF). Background The isolated application of electrical dry needling, manual therapy, exercise, and ultrasound has been found to be effective for PF. However, no previous study has investigated the combined effect of these interventions in this population. Methods One hundred and eleven participants (n = 111) with plantar fasciitis were randomized to receive electrical dry needling, manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound (n = 58) or manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound (n = 53). The primary outcome was first-step pain in the morning as measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Secondary outcomes included resting foot pain (NPRS), pain during activity (NPRS), the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), the Foot Functional Index (FFI), medication intake, and the Global Rating of Change (GROC). The treatment period was 4 weeks with follow-up assessments at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months after the first treatment session. Both groups received 6 sessions of impairment-based manual therapy directed to the lower limb, self-stretching of the plantar fascia and the Achilles tendon, strengthening exercises for the intrinsic muscles of the foot, and therapeutic ultrasound. In addition, the dry needling group also received 6 sessions of electrical dry needling using a standardized 8-point protocol for 20 minutes. The primary aim was examined with a 2-way mixed-model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as the between-subjects variable and time as the within-subjects variable after adjusting for baseline outcomes. Results The 2X4 ANCOVA revealed that individuals with PF who received electrical dry needling, manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound experienced significantly greater improvements in first-step morning pain (F = 22.021; P<0.001), resting foot pain (F = 23.931; P<0.001), pain during activity (F = 7.629; P = 0.007), LEFS (F = 13.081; P<0.001), FFI Pain Subscale (F = 13.547; P<0.001), FFI Disability Subscale (F = 8.746; P = 0.004), and FFI Total Score (F = 10.65; P<0.001) than those who received manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound at 3 months. No differences in FFI Activity Limitation Subscale (F = 2.687; P = 0.104) were observed. Significantly (X2 = 9.512; P = 0.023) more patients in the electrical dry needling group completely stopped taking medication for their pain compared to the manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound group at 3 months. Based on the cutoff score of ≥+5 on the GROC, significantly (X2 = 45.582; P<0.001) more patients within the electrical dry needling group (n = 45, 78%) achieved a successful outcome compared to the manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound group (n = 11, 21%). Effect sizes ranged from medium to large (0.53<SMD<0.85) at 3 months in favor of the electrical dry needling group. Conclusion The inclusion of electrical dry needling into a program of manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound was more effective for improving pain, function and related-disability than the application of manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound alone in individuals with PF at mid-term (3 months). Level of evidence Therapy, Level 1b."
https://openalex.org/W2898834479,"Background Adults and older people with intellectual disabilities (ID) frequently receive anti-cholinergic drugs in chronic use, but no studies in Italy to date have investigated cumulative anticholinergic exposure and factors associated with high anticholinergic burden in this frail population. Aim To probe the cumulative exposure to anticholinergics and the demographic, social and clinical factors associated with high exposure. Methods The 2012 updated version of the Anticholinergic Burden Score (ACB) was calculated for a multicentre sample of 276 adult and older people over 40 years with ID and associations with factors assessed. Results Overall, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, anxiolytics, and antidepressants were the most frequent classes contributing to the total ACB score. People living in residential care were more likely exposed to high anticholinergic burden (an ACB score of 3+): both community housing (odds ratio [OR] 4.63, 95%CI 1.08–19.95) and nursing home facility ([OR] 9.99, 95%CI 2.32–43.04). There was also a significant association between an ACB score of 3+ and reporting mental health conditions ([OR] 25.56, 95% CI 8.08–80.89) or a neurological disease ([OR] 4.14, 95%CI 1.32–12.94). Neither demographic characteristics (age and gender) nor other clinical conditions (somatic comorbidity, levels and typology of ID) were associated with higher anticholinergic load. A high burden of anticholinergic was significantly more frequent in laxative users (22.6% ACB3+ vs. 5.1% ACB 0) (p = 0.003). Conclusions Psychotropics drugs were the highest contributors to the anticholinergic burden in adult and old age ID, especially in those people living in institutional settings with mental health and/or neurological conditions. High anticholinergic load has shown to be associated with the use of laxatives."
https://openalex.org/W2898973508,"Chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) is a cytosolic protein implicated in diverse actin-based processes, including integrin trafficking, cell adhesion, and tubulogenesis. CLIC4 is rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane by RhoA-activating agonists and then partly colocalizes with β1 integrins. Agonist-induced CLIC4 translocation depends on actin polymerization and requires conserved residues that make up a putative binding groove. However, the mechanism and significance of CLIC4 trafficking have been elusive. Here, we show that RhoA activation by either lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or epidermal growth factor is necessary and sufficient for CLIC4 translocation to the plasma membrane and involves regulation by the RhoA effector mDia2, a driver of actin polymerization and filopodium formation. We found that CLIC4 binds the G-actin–binding protein profilin-1 via the same residues that are required for CLIC4 trafficking. Consistently, shRNA-induced profilin-1 silencing impaired agonist-induced CLIC4 trafficking and the formation of mDia2-dependent filopodia. Conversely, CLIC4 knockdown increased filopodium formation in an integrin-dependent manner, a phenotype rescued by wild-type CLIC4 but not by the trafficking-incompetent mutant CLIC4(C35A). Furthermore, CLIC4 accelerated LPA-induced filopodium retraction. We conclude that through profilin-1 binding, CLIC4 functions in a RhoA–mDia2–regulated signaling network to integrate cortical actin assembly and membrane protrusion.

https://openalex.org/W2899404570,"Background Choices of hypoglycemic agents for patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are limited. Available data among patients with CKD suggest that pioglitazone was effective and safe, with no increase in serious adverse effects. However, weight gain and fluid retention are major clinical problems for pioglitazone among patients with CKD. We conducted this study to compare the efficacy and side effects of low dose pioglitazone with standard dose pioglitazone among patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD. Methods A total of 75 patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD and inadequate glycemic control receiving any pharmacological antidiabetic treatment were randomly assigned to 2 groups. One group consisted of 37 patients treated with standard dose pioglitazone (15 mg/day) and another group consisted of 38 patients treated with low dose pioglitazone (7.5 mg/day). Glycosylated hemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) and metabolic profiles were monitored every 8 weeks for 24 weeks. Body composition was assessed using bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA). Results After 6 months of therapy, HbA1c levels decreased in both standard and low dose pioglitazone groups. The mean changes in HbA1c for standard and low dose pioglitazone were 1.1±1.6 and -1.4±1.5 (P = 0.543), respectively. Compared with low dose pioglitazone, standard dose pioglitazone treatment led to a greater increase in body weight, fat mass, total body water and extracellular water composition. No major adverse effects including hypoglycemia, congestive heart failure and abnormal liver function were identified. Conclusion Pioglitazone 7.5 mg once daily treatments presented similar glycemic control to standard dose pioglitazone and exhibited beneficial effects on weight gain and fluid retention among patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2899022141,"Objective Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common pathogen during infancy, with the potential to cause serious disease and mortality in high-risk groups. The objective of this study was to characterize trends of RSV and bronchiolitis hospitalizations in the first year in a population-based cohort and assess differences in trends according to risk status. Methods Using an observational retrospective cohort design, we examined a California population-based dataset of vital statistics linked to hospital discharge data for up to 1 year after birth from 1997–2011. Infants were categorized by medical condition and then by gestational age. Medical conditions of interest included chronic lung disease, certain congenital heart diseases, or others known to affect risk for developing severe bronchiolitis. The primary outcome was hospitalization due to RSV; secondary outcome was hospitalization for unspecified bronchiolitis (UB) not coded as RSV. Annual person-year rates were calculated for infants <12 months of age during January to December of each year. Results Of 7,298,401 infants born during the study period, 121,230 (1.7%) had a medical condition associated with risk; these infants experienced 6853 RSV and 6568 UB hospitalizations in the first year. In infants without medical conditions, 96,694 RSV and 69,886 UB hospitalizations occurred. All-cause infant hospitalizations declined over time from 12.2 to 9.3 per 100 person-years. RSV hospitalization rates for infants with medical conditions decreased from 7.6 to 3.4 per 100 person-years, with the largest relative decline in infants with chronic lung disease (12.0 to 5.0 per 100 person-years). For infants without medical conditions, RSV hospitalizations declined from 1.4 to 0.8 per 100 person-years, with greater decreases among preterm infants with earlier gestational age. UB hospitalization rates remained relatively stable across the study years, from 6.2 to 5.4 and 1.0 to 0.8 per 100 person-years for infants with and without medical conditions. Conclusions Various interventions may have contributed to observed decreases in RSV hospitalizations from 1998–2011, which were greater in high-risk populations recommended for RSV immunoprophylaxis and not observed with UB. Further efforts to promote evidence-based practice and optimal targeting of appropriate interventions will ensure continued improvement in care for vulnerable infants."
https://openalex.org/W2899376051,"Objectives The metabolic syndrome has been associated with a variety of individual variables, including demographics, lifestyle, clinical measures and physical performance. We aimed to identify independent predictors of the prevalence and incidence of metabolic syndrome in a large cohort of older adults. Methods The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam is a prospective cohort including community-dwelling adults aged 55–85 years. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. The incidence of metabolic syndrome was calculated over a period of three years. Stepwise backward logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors, including variables for demographics, lifestyle, clinical measures and physical performance, both in a cross-sectional cohort (n = 1292) and a longitudinal sub-cohort (n = 218). Results Prevalence and incidence of metabolic syndrome were 37% (n = 479) and 30% (n = 66), respectively. Cross-sectionally, heart disease (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.37–2.65), peripheral artery disease (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.32–3.42), diabetes (OR: 4.74, 95% CI: 2.65–8.48), cerebrovascular accident (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.09–3.37), and a higher Body Mass Index (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.26–1.38) were significant independent predictors of metabolic syndrome. Longitudinally, Body Mass Index (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05–1.27) was an independent predictor of metabolic syndrome. Conclusion Four age related diseases and a higher Body Mass Index were the only predictors of metabolic syndrome in the cross-sectional cohort, despite the large variety of variables included in the multivariable analysis. In the longitudinal sub-cohort, a higher Body Mass Index was predictive of developing metabolic syndrome."

The national cancer cohort, an exhaustive population-based cohort, was set up on the basis of the National Health Data System (SNDS) by the French National Cancer Institute.The aim is to describe the French national cancer cohort.All people living in France (67 million population) with universal insurance coverage and diagnosed, treated or followed up for a cancer, such as survivors, are included and will be followed up for 25 years. It contains all healthcare consumptions and reimbursements (i.e. hospitalization, outpatient care, medication…) since 2010. Every year, around 650 000 new cases are included.From 2010 to 2015, 6.2 million subjects have been included. Most subjects were entered in 2010, in 2015 it concerned 0.6 million. In 2015, the median age was 65 [54-76]; 51% were women. The primary cancer organ could be attributed with certitude to 87% of the people. The most frequent locations were skin (16%), breast (15%), prostate (12%), colon-rectum (11%) and lung (9%). In 2015, 40% of included subjects underwent surgery for cancer, 16% chemotherapy at hospital and 11% at least one session of radiotherapy.Based on SNDS, the cancer cohort has been designed to study cancer care use in the short-, medium- and long-term, and evaluate healthcare and public health policies."
https://openalex.org/W2898687987,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a very rare fatal disease characterized for accelerated aging. Although the causal agent, a point mutation in LMNA gene, was identified more than a decade ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying HGPS are still not fully understood and, currently, there is no cure for the patients, which die at a mean age of thirteen. With the aim of unraveling non-previously altered molecular pathways in the premature aging process, human cell lines from HGPS patients and from healthy parental controls were studied in parallel using Next-Generation Sequencing (RNAseq) and High-Resolution Quantitative Proteomics (iTRAQ) techniques. After selection of significant proteins and transcripts and crosschecking of the results a small set of protein/transcript pairs were chosen for validation. One of those proteins, ribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase 1 (PRPS1), is essential for nucleotide synthesis. PRPS1 loss-of-function mutants present lower levels of purine. PRPS1 protein and transcript levels are detected as significantly decreased in HGPS cell lines vs. healthy parental controls. This modulation was orthogonally confirmed by targeted techniques in cell lines and also in an animal model of Progeria, the ZMPSTE24 knock-out mouse. In addition, functional experiments through supplementation with S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe), a metabolite that is an alternative source of purine, were done. Results indicate that SAMe has a positive effect in the proliferative capacity and reduces senescence-associated Beta-galactosidase staining of the HPGS cell lines. Altogether, our data suggests that nucleotide and, specifically, purine-metabolism, are altered in premature aging, opening a new window for the therapeutic treatment of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2899215918,"To characterize the amount of EEG suppression achieved in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) patients treated with pharmacologically-induced coma (PIC).We analyzed EEG recordings from 35 RSE patients between 21-84 years-old who received PIC that target burst suppression and quantified the amount of EEG suppression using the burst suppression probability (BSP). Then we measured the variability of BSPs with respect to a reference level of BSP 0.8 ± 0.15. Finally, we also measured the variability of BSPs with respect to the amount of intravenous anesthetic drugs (IVADs) received by the patients.Patients remained in the reference BSP range for only 8% (median, interquartile range IQR [0, 29] %) of the total time under treatment. The median time with BSP below the reference range was 84% (IQR [37, 100] %). BSPs in some patients drifted significantly over time despite constant infusion rates of IVADs. Similar weight-normalized infusion rates of IVADs in different patients nearly always resulted in distinct BSPs (probability 0.93 (IQR [0.82, 1.0]).This study quantitatively identified high variability in the amount of EEG suppression achieved in clinical practice when treating RSE patients. While some of this variability may arise from clinicians purposefully deviating from clinical practice guidelines, our results show that the high variability also arises in part from significant inter- and intra- individual pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variation. Our results indicate that the delicate balance between maintaining sufficient EEG suppression in RSE patients and minimizing IVAD exposure in clinical practice is challenging to achieve. This may affect patient outcomes and confound studies seeking to determine an optimal amount of EEG suppression for treatment of RSE. Therefore, our analysis points to the need for developing an alternative paradigm, such as vigilant anesthetic management as happens in operating rooms, or closed-loop anesthesia delivery, for investigating and providing induced-coma therapy to RSE patients."
https://openalex.org/W2898925904,"Objective To evaluate the impact of Teach-Back on communication quality in a national telephone-based telehealth service, for callers varying in health literacy. Design Cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomised trial with continuous recruitment, short (fixed) exposure and blinded outcome assessors. Nurses were stratified by hours worked and randomised into training groups using a computer generated sequence. Setting An Australian national pregnancy and parenting telephone helpline. Intervention Complex intervention involving a single 2-hour group Teach-Back training session, combined with ongoing nurse self-reflection on their communication following each call and each shift. Participants Participants were 637 callers to the telephone helpline aged 18–75 (87% female), of whom 127 (13%) had inadequate health literacy (measured with the Single Item Literacy Screener); and 15 maternal and child health nurses with 15 years’ experience on average. Measures Primary outcome was a modified subscale of the Health Literacy Questionnaire, ‘having sufficient information to manage health’. Secondary caller outcomes included caller confidence, perceived actionability of information and nurse effort to listen and understand. Nurse outcomes were perceptions of their communication effectiveness. Results Over a 7 week period, 376 surveyed callers received usual care and 261 Teach-Back. Ratings on the primary outcome increased over time (OR 1.17, CI 1.01 to 1.32, p = 0.03) but no independent Teach-Back effect was observed. A consistent pattern suggests that, compared with usual care, Teach-Back helps callers with inadequate health literacy feel listened to (OR 2.3, CI 0.98 to 5.42, p = 0.06), confident to act (OR 2.44, CI 1.00 to 5.98, p = 0.06), and know what steps to take (OR 2.68, CI 1.00 to 7.17, p = 0.06). Nurse perceptions of both their own communication effectiveness (OR = 2.31; CI 1.38 to 3.86, p<0.0001), and caller understanding (OR = 2.56; CI 1.52 to 4.30, p<0.001) both increased with Teach-Back. No harms were reported. Conclusions Teach-Back appears to benefit telephone health service users with inadequate health literacy, but the extent of this is unclear due to smaller numbers of lower literacy participants. Improving caller ratings over time are likely due to increasing nurse communication competence."

This anatomical study characterizes the donor nerve branches of the supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves used for corneal neurotization.In 13 non-embalmed cadavers, the supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves were dissected and distances to anatomical landmarks measured. Cross-sections of supratrochlear and supraorbital donor nerves were harvested and histomorphometrically analyzed to assess the number of myelinated axons.The donor axon counts were 3146 ± 1069.9 for the supratrochlear and 1882 ± 903 for the supraorbital nerve distal to the supraorbital notch. The supratrochlear nerve was dissected on the medial upper eyelid 2 cm lateral to the facial midline and the branch of the supraorbital nerve 1 cm medial to the mid-pupillary line.The supraorbital and supratrochlear branches of the trigeminal nerve are potent donor nerves for corneal neurotization in the treatment of neuropathic keratopathy and can be reliably dissected using anatomical landmarks."

We tested a larger number of organic solvents with the same experimental set up, using skin from new-born piglets and static diffusion cells. Thirty-six common organic solvents were studied neat (and 31 of them also in water dilution): acetone, acetonitrile, n-butanol 2-butanone 2-butoxyethanol, 1-butoxy-2-propanol, n-butyl acetate, butyl acrylate, cyclohexane, cyclohexanone, 1,2-dichloroethane, dichloromethane, ethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, ethyl acetate, ethyl acrylate, ethylbenzene, furfuryl alcohol, n-hexane, 2-hexanone, 2-isopropoxyethanol, methanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, methyl acrylate, 3-methyl-1-butanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether, 4-metyl-2-pentanol, methyl methacrylate, 2-propanol, 2-propen-1-ol, 2-propoxyethanol, 1-propoxy-2-propanol, styrene, trichloromethane, toluene and m-xylene. In addition, a mixture of 2-methylbutyl acetate and n-pentyl acetate was tested. For most of the solvents, little or no percutaneous absorption data have been published. Lag times, steady-state fluxes and apparent permeability coefficients were obtained from the time courses of solvent appearance in the receptor medium, as measured by gas chromatography. The use of the same methodology and kind of skin resulted in small variability within experiments, underlining the need for consistent methodology for useful results for developing predictive models. Furthermore, a comparison of the neat and diluted data shows that water dilution affects all these variables and that the direction and magnitude of the effects vary between chemicals. This comparison strongly supports that prediction of percutaneous absorption of neat and water diluted chemicals requires different models."
https://openalex.org/W2899334374,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major psychiatric illness affecting around 1% of the global population. BD is characterized by recurrent manic and depressive episodes, and has an estimated heritability of around 70%. Research has identified the first BD susceptibility genes. However, the underlying pathways and regulatory networks remain largely unknown. Research suggests that the cumulative impact of common alleles with small effects explains only around 25–38% of the phenotypic variance for BD. A plausible hypothesis therefore is that rare, high penetrance variants may contribute to BD risk. The present study investigated the role of rare, nonsynonymous, and potentially functional variants via whole exome sequencing in 15 BD cases from two large, multiply affected families from Cuba. The high prevalence of BD in these pedigrees renders them promising in terms of the identification of genetic risk variants with large effect sizes. In addition, SNP array data were used to calculate polygenic risk scores for affected and unaffected family members. After correction for multiple testing, no significant increase in polygenic risk scores for common, BD-associated genetic variants was found in BD cases compared to healthy relatives. Exome sequencing identified a total of 17 rare and potentially damaging variants in 17 genes. The identified variants were shared by all investigated BD cases in the respective pedigree. The most promising variant was located in the gene SERPING1 (p.L349F), which has been reported previously as a genome-wide significant risk gene for schizophrenia. The present data suggest novel candidate genes for BD susceptibility, and may facilitate the discovery of disease-relevant pathways and regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W2898947883,"Monoallelic point mutations in the gene encoding the cytosolic, NADP+-dependent enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) cause increased production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in multiple cancers. Most IDH1 mutant tumors retain one wildtype (WT) IDH1 allele. Several studies have proposed that retention of this WT allele is protumorigenic by facilitating substrate channeling through a WT–mutant IDH1 heterodimer, with the WT subunit generating a local supply of α-ketoglutarate and NADPH that is then consumed by the mutant subunit to produce 2-HG. Here, we confirmed that coexpression of WT and mutant IDH1 subunits leads to formation of WT–mutant hetero-oligomers and increases 2-HG production. An analysis of a recently reported crystal structure of the WT–R132H IDH1 heterodimer and of in vitro kinetic parameters for 2-HG production, however, indicated that substrate channeling between the subunits is biophysically implausible. We also found that putative carbon-substrate flux between WT and mutant IDH1 subunits is inconsistent with the results of isotope tracing experiments in cancer cells harboring an endogenous monoallelic IDH1 mutation. Finally, using a mathematical model of WT–mutant IDH1 heterodimers, we estimated that the NADPH:NADP+ ratio is higher in the cytosol than in the mitochondria, suggesting that NADPH is unlikely to be limiting for 2-HG production in the cytosol. These findings argue against supply of either substrate being limiting for 2-HG production by a cytosolic IDH1 mutant and suggest that the retention of a WT allele in IDH1 mutant tumors is not due to a requirement for carbon or cofactor flux between WT and mutant IDH1.

In vitro assays of α-KG and NADPH consumption in IDH mutant cell lysates have also suggested synergy between the WT and mutant IDH activities (7Dang L. White D.W. Gross S. Bennett B.D.

Several explanations have been proposed for the dependence of mutant IDH1 activity on WT IDH1. It is possible that the enzymatic activity of WT–mutant heterodimers is intrinsically superior to that of mutant–mutant homodimers as suggested by some studies of recombinant IDH1 proteins (20Bralten L.B.

Alternatively, the WT dependence might be due to substrate channeling or some other form of cooperativity between the WT and mutant subunits as proposed previously (17Ward P.S. Lu C. Cross J.R.

A tale of two subunits: how the neomorphic R132H IDH1 mutation enhances production of αHG.Biochemistry. 2011; 50 (21524095): 4804-481210.1021/bi200499mCrossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both the WT activity for oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate and the mutant activity for reduction of α-KG to 2-HG remain intact in a WT–mutant IDH1 heterodimer, suggesting that channeling could be involved. The dependence of 2-HG production on WT IDH1 might also reflect differences in substrate availability in the cytosol and mitochondria as levels of α-KG and NADPH may differ between compartments. Here, we report a lack of evidence for substrate channeling or metabolic flux between WT and mutant IDH1. We first considered the possibility that α-KG and NADPH are produced and maintained in a protected pool around the heterodimer by the WT subunit. On the basis of existing structural evidence and in vitro IDH1 enzyme kinetics, we calculated that such channeling is biophysically implausible, even for densely packed IDH1 heterodimers. After ruling out substrate channeling, we then characterized the extent of all carbon flux through WT IDH1. Using stable isotope tracing, we showed that 2-HG is predominantly derived from glutamine in IDH1 mutant cancer cells in culture with no need to invoke flux of α-KG between subunits. Finally, through quantitative modeling of IDH1 WT–mutant heterodimers, we estimated the mitochondrial to cytosolic NADPH:NADP+ ratio, which suggests that NADPH is unlikely to be limiting for the production of 2-HG by mutant IDH1 in the cytosol. WT IDH1 in the cytosol can produce α-KG and NADPH. Mutant IDH1 consumes α-KG and NADPH, producing the oncometabolite 2-HG and regenerating NADP+ (Fig. 1A). Most cancer-associated IDH1 mutations occur in monoallelic fashion with retention of one WT IDH1 allele in the tumor cells. It was shown previously that coexpression of WT and R132H IDH1 in cells results in greater 2-HG production than expression of equimolar amounts of mutant IDH1 alone (17Ward P.S. Lu C. Cross J.R. Abdel-Wahab O. Levine R.L. Schwartz G.K. Thompson C.B.

In these prior experiments, however, the generation of WT–mutant IDH1 heterodimers was not formally demonstrated. Here, we confirm previous findings that the coexpression of WT and mutant IDH1 increases 2-HG production (Fig. 1B). In HEK 293T cells already expressing endogenous WT IDH1, expression of increasing amounts of FLAG-tagged R132H IDH1 resulted in increasing 2-HG production. Coexpression of Myc-tagged WT IDH1 further enhanced the production of 2-HG, consistent with previous findings (17Ward P.S. Lu C. Cross J.R. Abdel-Wahab O. Levine R.L. Schwartz G.K. Thompson C.B. The potential for isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate depends on allele specificity and subcellular compartmentalization.J. Biol.

In addition, we found that the exogenous coexpression of WT and mutant IDH1 resulting in enhanced 2-HG production is associated with the formation of WT–mutant IDH1 hetero-oligomeric species in cells. Cells were transfected with either empty vector, a mutant IDH1 construct with a FLAG epitope tag (R132H-FLAG), or R132H-FLAG in combination with a WT IDH1 construct containing a Myc epitope tag. 48 h after transfection, cells were quenched rapidly in 80% MeOH and subsequently analyzed for 2-HG levels by GC-MS. A parallel set of transfected cells was lysed and used for FLAG immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Myc-tagged WT IDH1 was found to coprecipitate with FLAG-tagged R132H IDH1 in cells in which they were coexpressed (Fig. 1B).

There is substantial variability in the values reported; for instance, measurements of kcat for the WT enzyme range from 8.6 to 44,000 s−1 and from 0.19 to 1,000 s−1 for R132H IDH1. To investigate this discrepancy and to obtain values for mathematical modeling, we measured the in vitro kinetics of recombinant WT and R132H IDH1 (Table 1). The parameters obtained are in close agreement with the prior values reported in two studies of the enzymatic mechanism of IDH1 (24Pietrak B. Zhao H. Qi H. Quinn C. Gao E. Boyer J.G. Concha N.

As such, it has been suggested that cytoplasmic 2-HG synthesis might be enhanced by the local production of α-KG and NADPH in WT–mutant heterodimers and that this effect might explain the dramatic reduction of 2-HG levels following loss of the WT enzyme (17Ward P.S. Lu C. Cross J.R. Abdel-Wahab O. Levine R.L. Schwartz G.K. Thompson C.B. The potential for isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate depends on allele specificity and subcellular compartmentalization.J. Biol.

As an initial test of this hypothesis, we performed a biophysical analysis of putative substrate channeling between the WT and mutant subunits. A crystal structure of the IDH1 WT–R132H heterodimer at 3.2-Å resolution has been reported previously (Fig. 2A) (25Yang B. Zhong C. Peng Y. Lai Z. Ding J. Molecular mechanisms of “off-on switch” of activities of human IDH1 by tumor-associated mutation R132H.Cell Res. 2010; 20 (20975740): 1188-120010.1038/cr.2010.145Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that there is no physical association between the active sites of the WT and the mutant, suggesting that any interaction would be due to a local elevation of [α-KG] and [NADPH] around each heterodimer. We first examined diffusion of α-KG and NADPH away from the WT active site to assess the feasibility of achieving local enrichment. From inspection of the crystal structure, we estimated that the straight-line distance between the two active sites is ∼37.3 Å. Assuming Dα-KG = 6.7 × 10− 10 m2/s and DNADPH = 4.1 × 10−10 m2/s (see “Experimental procedures”) and three-dimensional diffusion governed by t=<x2>6D(Eq. 1) it would take just 3.5 and 5.7 ns for α-KG and NADPH, respectively, to travel the distance between the active sites. In 15 s, the time required for one turnover of the mutant enzyme, both substrates could travel over 3000 times further than the intersite distance. This simple calculation suggests that the local and bulk cytoplasmic concentrations of α-KG and NADPH are likely equilibrated on catalytically relevant timescales. As our estimate for intersite distance is based on a crystal structure, it does not account for possible dynamic changes in the conformation of the two subunits, which could bring the active sites into closer proximity. It is plausible that such shifts do occur in the IDH1 heterodimer as certain inhibitors of the mutant enzyme are known to bind to an allosteric pocket on the WT subunit, and the activity of WT IDH1 is controlled in part by the highly flexible α10 regulatory element (27Xu X.

Any dynamic change, however, would have to reduce the straight-line distance by at least several orders of magnitude for local elevation of substrate concentration to be relevant. Packing of enzymes into dense clusters has been suggested to enable channeling even in the absence of physical association of active sites. Castellana et al. (29Castellana M. Wilson M.Z. Xu Y. Joshi P. Cristea I.M. Rabinowitz J.D. Gitai Z. Wingreen N.S. Enzyme clustering accelerates processing of intermediates through metabolic channeling.Nat.

Using their framework, we investigated whether N = 4000 IDH1 heterodimers confined in a sphere with radius r = 40 nm (i.e. at the dense-packing limit nmax = 25 mm) could efficiently channel α-KG and NADPH.

This may lead to rapid virological failure in subjects initiating ART, and mother-to-child transmission despite prophylaxis. Methods Treatment-naïve pregnant women from four antenatal care clinics in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, were enrolled from October 2016 to November 2017. Genotypic resistance testing and phylogenetic subtype analysis was performed on 48 specimens. Results Forty eight women met the survey inclusion criteria. All specimens were successfully amplified and genotyped. Specimens from five women were associated with HIV-1 drug resistance mutations. Four carried mutations exclusively linked to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (K103N, K103N/S) and one carried mutations to both NNRTIs (G190S, K101E) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (M184V). These results corresponded to 10.4% (95% CI: 4.5–22.2%), 2.1% (95% CI: 0.4–10.9%) and 0% (95% CI: 0.0–7.4%) drug resistance mutations to NNRTIs, NRTIs and protease inhibitors, respectively. HIV-1 circulating recombinant form 02AG was most commonly found, followed by HIV-1 sub-subtype A3. Subtype/CRF was not associated with drug resistance mutations. Conclusion Our study reports a 10.4% prevalence of pretreatment drug resistance to NNRTIs in HIV-1-infected pregnant women in the capital Bissau, Guinea Bissau. Since NNRTIs are part of first-line ART in the country, baseline resistance screenings or adjustment of national treatment guidelines should be considered as antiretroviral treatment programs are scaled up."

Competence of maternal healthcare providers directly affects quality of care and health outcomes. This study assessed competence of midwives and associated factors in provision of care during labor, and the immediate postpartum period at public health facilities in Tigray, Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study design was employed to collect data through direct observation of the performance of 144 midwives selected from 57 health facilities. Data were collected from January to February 2015 by 12 experienced midwives who were trained on basic emergency obstetric care and had previous experience with data collection. Using a standardized competence checklist, adapted from International confederation of midwives, data collectors interviewed and directly observed the performance of midwives from admission of laboring mothers to six hours after delivery. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify predicators associated with overall clinical competence of midwives.The mean competence score of midwives was found to be 51%. In multivariable linear regression, male midwifery professionals (p = 0.022), availability of up to date job aids in work place (p = 0.04) and being recognized for improved performance (p = 0.005) were significantly associated with competence of midwives in the provision of care during labor, childbirth and immediate postpartum period.Competence of midwives was found to be low to provide safe and quality maternity care in the region. Male gender, availability of complete job aids and receiving recognition/awards for better performance were predicted competence. This requires attention and investment from Tigray regional health bureau and health development partners working on maternal and child health. Competence based in-service training, on-the-job mentoring, availing up to dated standard job aids, recognition of high performing midwives are recommended to improve the quality of maternity care in public health facilities of the region. Moreover, affirmative actions including on-the-job training and supervision are needed to improve the competence of female midwives."
https://openalex.org/W2899161970,"Secondary hypertension is a serious form of hypertension, involving 5% to 10% of all hypertension patients. Hypertension is a risk factor of the saccular intracranial aneurysm (sIA) disease and subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured sIA (aSAH), but the impact of secondary hypertension on sIA disease is poorly known. In a defined Eastern Finnish sIA population we studied the prevalence of secondary hypertension and its impact on sIA disease phenotype.We included 2704 consecutive sIA patients first admitted to Kuopio University Hospital from 1995 to 2014. Their clinical data from Kuopio Intracranial Aneurysm patient and Family Database was fused with prescription drug usage data, hospital diagnoses and causes of death, retrieved from nationwide registries. Medical records of hypertensive sIA patients were reviewed to confirm or exclude secondary hypertension. Prevalence of secondary hypertension and associated diagnoses were calculated. Logistic regression was used to identify clinical characteristics of sIA disease that associated with secondary hypertension.We identified 2029 (75%) sIA patients with hypertension and 208 (10%) of them had secondary hypertension. Most frequent conditions associated with secondary hypertension were kidney and renovascular diseases (45%), sleep apnea (27%) and hypothyroidism (19%); 46 (22%) of the 208 patients had more than one such condition. In multivariate logistic regression analyses of 1561 aSAH patients, secondary hypertension significantly associated with the number of sIAs (p = 0.003; OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.10-1.58) and male gender (p = 0.034; OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.04-2.43).Secodary hypertension was relatively common (10%) among hypertensive sIA patients. Secondary causes for hypertension should be taken into account in hypertensive sIA patients, especially in aSAH patients with multiple intracranial aneurysms. Further research is indicated to evaluate the impact of secondary hypertension on the long-term rupture risk of unruptured sIA carriers and long-term outcome after aSAH."

https://openalex.org/W2899354376,"The AAA+ ATPase p97 regulates ubiquitin-dependent protein homeostasis and has been pursued as a cancer drug target. The ATP-competitive inhibitor CB-5083 and allosteric inhibitor NMS-873 are the most advanced p97 inhibitors described to date. Previous studies have reported that their cytotoxicity can be readily overcome and involves single p97 mutations in the linker between the D1 and D2 ATPase domains and within D2. We report here that the proline 472 to leucine (P472L) mutation, in the D1-D2 linker and identified in CB-5083-resistant cells, desensitizes p97 to both inhibitor classes. This mutation does not disrupt the distinct D2-binding sites of the inhibitors. Instead, P472L changes ATPase domain communication within the p97 hexamer. P472L enhances cooperative D2 ATP binding and hydrolysis. This mechanism alters the function of the D1-D2 linker in the control of D2 activity involving the ATP-bound state of D1. Although increased D2 activity is sufficient to desensitize the P472L mutant to NMS-873, the mutant's desensitization to CB-5083 also requires D1 ATPase domain function. Our study highlights the remarkable adaptability of p97 ATPase domain communication that enables escape from mechanistically distinct classes of cytotoxic p97 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2899376676,"Aconitum carmichaelii, commonly known as Fuzi, is a typical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herb that has been grown for more than one thousand years in China. Although root rot disease has been seriously threatening this crop in recent years, few studies have investigated root rot disease in Fuzi, and no pathogens have been identified. In this study, fungal libraries from rhizosphere soils were constructed by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing using the HiSeq 2500 high-throughput platform. A total of 948,843 tags were obtained from 17 soil samples, and these corresponded to 195,583,495 nt. At 97% identity, the libraries yielded 12,266 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), of which 97.5% could be annotated. In sick soils, Athelia, Mucor and Mortierella were the dominant fungi, comprising 10.3%, 10.1% and 7.7% of the fungal community, respectively. These fungi showed 2.6-, 1.53- to 6.31- and 1.38- to 2.65-fold higher enrichment in sick soils compared with healthy soils, and their high densities reduced the fungal richness in the areas surrounding the rotted Fuzi roots. An abundance analysis suggested that A. rolfsii and Mucor racemosus, as the dominant pathogens, might play important roles in the invading Fuzi tissue, and Phoma adonidicola could be another pathogenic fungus of root rot. In contrast, Mortierella chlamydospora, Penicillium simplicissimum, Epicoccum nigrum, Cyberlindnera saturnus and Rhodotorula ingeniosa might antagonize root rot pathogens in sick soils. In addition, A. rolfsii was further verified as a main pathogen of Fuzi root rot disease through hypha purification, morphological observation, molecular identification and an infection test. These results provide theoretical guidance for the prevention and treatment of Fuzi root rot disease."
https://openalex.org/W2899469976,"Interventions that can facilitate early diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) will facilitate early treatment and improve clinical outcomes but there has been concerns about additional medical costs to the health care system. An examination through a retina fundus photography by a non-specialist has been suggested as a potential cost-effective alternative to a direct examination by a specialist, but limited scientific data exists on the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies for AMD. Our objective is to conduct an economic evaluation of various population-wide screening strategies for AMD among the South Korean population.Using a Markov cohort model, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of four AMD screening strategies (opportunistic examination, opportunistic treatment, systematic photography, and systematic examination) in comparison with status quo (no screening) for South Korean adults. We projected a life time horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 100,00 persons of age 40 with and without AMD at baseline. The outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, cost from the societal perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each strategy. Interventions were evaluated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 30,000,000 KRW ($27,538) per QALY gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to address the model uncertainty. Opportunistic examination was strongly dominated because it generated fewer expected QALYs but incurred greater expected cost than the other screening strategies. The mean lifetime expected costs were 289,013 KRW, 363,692 KRW, 9,351,964 KRW, and 12,309,783 KRW, and the mean QALYs gained were 37.73, 37.75, 40.47, 40.68, for no screening, opportunistic treatment, systematic photography, and systematic examination, respectively. The results were most sensitive to the utility weight of mild AMD, the probability of complication from treatment, the cost of being in mild AMD, and the probability of recovery from complication. After eliminating the two weakly dominated strategies, systematic photography was cost-effective at the ICER of 3,310,448 KRW per QALY in comparison to status quo.Under the WTP threshold of 30,000,000 KRW per QALY, systematic photography is cost-effective for screening AMD in South Korean adults. Systematic examination by ophthalmologists generates more expected QALY and cost compared to systematic photography."

https://openalex.org/W2899167146,"Sodium ions (Na+) are key regulators of molecular events in many cellular processes, yet the dynamics of this ion remain poorly defined. Developing approaches to identify and characterise Na+ microenvironments will enable more detailed elucidation of the mechanisms of signal transduction. Here we report the application of Spectral Phasor analysis to the Na+ fluorophore, CoroNa Green, to identify and spatially map spectral emissions that report Na+ microenvironments. We use differentiating stem cells where Na+ fluxes were reported as an antecedent. Myoblast stem cells were induced to differentiate by serum starvation and then fixed at intervals between 0 and 40-minutes of differentiation prior to addition of CoroNa Green. The fluorescent intensity was insufficient to identify discrete Na+ microenvironments. However, using Spectral Phasor analysis we identified spectral shifts in CoroNa Green fluorescence which is related to the Na+ microenvironment. Further, spectral-heterogeneity appears to be contingent on the distance of Na+ from the nucleus in the early stages of differentiation. Spectral Phasor analysis of CoroNa Green in fixed stem cells demonstrates for the first time that CoroNa Green has unique spectral emissions depending on the nature of the Na+ environment in differentiating stem cells. Applying Spectral Phasor analysis to CoroNa Green in live stem cells is likely to further elucidate the role of Na+ microenvironments in the differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2898994401,"Due to recent advances in genetic manipulation, transgenic mosquitoes may be a viable alternative to reduce some diseases. Feasibility conditions are obtained by simulating and analyzing mathematical models that describe the behavior of wild and transgenic populations living in the same geographic area. In this paper, we present a reaction–diffusion model in which the reaction term is a nonlinear function that describes the interaction between wild and transgenic mosquitoes, considering the zygosity, and the diffusive term that represents a nonuniform spatial spreading characterized by a random diffusion parameter. The resulting nonlinear system of partial differential equations is numerically solved using the sequential operator splitting technique, combining the finite element method and Runge-Kutta method. This scheme is numerically implemented considering uncertainty in the diffusion parameters of the model. Several scenarios simulating spatial release strategies of transgenic mosquitoes are analyzed, demonstrating an intrinsic association between the transgene frequency in the total population and the strategy adopted."
https://openalex.org/W2899164062,"Background Pneumonia remains the leading cause of paediatric infectious mortality globally. Treatment failure, which can result from non-adherence to oral antibiotics, can lead to poor outcomes and therefore improving adherence could be a strategy to reduce pneumonia related morbidity and mortality. However, there is little published evidence from low-resource settings for the drivers of non-adherence to oral antibiotics in children. Objective We aimed to investigate reasons for adherence and non-adherence in children diagnosed and treated in the community with fast-breathing pneumonia in rural Malawi. Methods We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with caregivers of children known to have been diagnosed and treated with oral antibiotics for fast-breathing pneumonia in the community and key informant interviews with community healthcare workers (CHW). FGDs and interviews were conducted within communities in Chichewa, the local language. We used a framework approach to analyze the transcripts. Results We conducted 4 FGDs with caregivers and 10 interviews with CHWs. We identified four themes, which were common across caregivers and CHWs: knowledge and understanding, effort, medication perceptions and community influences. Caregivers and CHWs demonstrated good knowledge of pneumonia and types of treatment, but caregivers showed confusion around dosing and treatment durations. Effort was needed to seek care, prepare medication and understand regimens, acting as a barrier to adherence. Perceptions of how well the treatment was working influenced adherence, with both quick recovery and slow recovery leading to non-adherence. Community influences were both supportive, with transport assistance for referrals and home visits to improve adherence, and detrimental, with pressure to share treatments. Conclusion Adherence to oral antibiotic treatment for fast-breathing pneumonia was understood to be important, however considerable barriers we described within this rural low-resource setting, such as the effort preparing and administering medication, community pressures to share drugs and potential complexity of regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2898698075,"The traditional shipborne navigation system uses a two-dimensional electronic chart as a platform to integrate and control a variety of electronic navigation equipment information. It cannot intuitively restore the actual traffic environment or fundamentally improve the perception ability of the crew in poor visibility conditions. This paper proposes integrating three-dimensional simulations and real ship driving systems and presents research on “virtual–real” and “dynamic–static” ship navigation technology and equipment. In the proposed method, the hydrologic factors, topographic features, waterways, traffic dynamics, and ship driving information are effectively integrated, with a focus on achieving key advancements such as the integration of simulations and real ship driving as well as multi-source information fusion. A multi-angle, all-around, multi-level visual display for water traffic environments in poor visibility conditions is provided to enhance the ability of crews to perceive their traffic environments and thereby to provide auxiliary navigation for ships in complex weather conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2898763709,"The histone variant CENP-ACse4 is a core component of the specialized nucleosome at the centromere in budding yeast and is required for genomic integrity. Accordingly, the levels of Cse4 in cells are tightly regulated, primarily by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. However, structural transitions in Cse4 that regulate its centromeric localization and interaction with regulatory components are poorly understood. Using time-resolved fluorescence, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show here that soluble Cse4 can exist in a closed conformation, inaccessible to various regulatory components. We further determined that binding of its obligate partner, histone H4, alters the interdomain interaction within Cse4, enabling an open state that is susceptible to proteolysis. This dynamic model allows kinetochore formation only in the presence of H4, as the Cse4 N terminus, which is required for interaction with other centromeric components, is unavailable in the absence of H4. The specific requirement of H4 binding for the conformational regulation of Cse4 suggests a structure-based regulatory mechanism for Cse4 localization. Our data suggested a novel structural transition–based mechanism where conformational flexibility of the Cse4 N terminus can control Cse4 levels in the yeast cell and prevent Cse4 from interacting with kinetochore components at ectopic locations for formation of premature kinetochore assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2898900442,"Blood lipids have served as key biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet emerging evidence indicates metabolite profiling might reveal a larger repertoire of small molecules that reflect altered metabolism, and which may be associated with early disease risk. Inadequate micronutrient status may also drive or exacerbate CVD risk factors that emerge during childhood. This study aimed to understand relationships between serum lipid levels, the plasma metabolome, and micronutrient status in 38 children (10 ± 0.8 years) at risk for CVD. Serum lipid levels were measured via autoanalyzer and average daily micronutrient intakes were calculated from 3-day food logs. Plasma metabolites were extracted using 80% methanol and analyzed via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Spearman’s rank-order coefficients (rs) were computed for correlations between the following serum lipids [total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG)], 805 plasma metabolites, and 17 essential micronutrients. Serum lipid levels in the children ranged from 128–255 mg/dL for total cholesterol, 67–198 mg/dL for LDL, 31–58 mg/dL for HDL, and 46–197 mg/dL for TG. The majority of children (71 to 100%) had levels lower than the Recommended Daily Allowance for vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, folate, vitamin D, and potassium. For sodium, 76% of children had levels above the Upper Limit of intake. Approximately 30% of the plasma metabolome (235 metabolites) were significantly correlated with serum lipids. As expected, plasma cholesterol was positively correlated with serum total cholesterol (rs = 0.6654; p<0.0001). Additionally, 27 plasma metabolites were strongly correlated with serum TG (rs ≥0.60; p≤0.0001), including alanine and diacylglycerols, which have previously been associated with cardiometabolic and atherosclerotic risk in adults and experimental animals. Plasma metabolite profiling alongside known modifiable risk factors for children merit continued investigation in epidemiological studies to assist with early CVD detection, mitigation, and prevention via lifestyle-based interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2899113696,"Background MicroRNA is endogenous non-coding small RNA that negative regulate and control gene expression, and increasing evidence links microRNA to oncogenesis and the pathogenesis of cancer. The goal of this study was to explore the potential molecular mechanism of miR-375 in various cancers. Methods MiR-375 overexpression in different tumor cell lines was probed with microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The common target genes of miR-375 were obtained by Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA), and identified by miRWalk2.0 software for target gene prediction. Additionally, we directed in silico analysis including Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) analysis, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways annotations to provide a summary of the function of miR-375 in various carcinomas. Eventually, data was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were utilized for a validation in 7 cancers. Results The nine miR-375 related chips were acquired by the GEO data. The 5 down regulated genes came from 9 available microarray datasets, which overlapped with the potential target genes predicted by miRWalk2.0 software. The target genes were intensely enriched in amino acid biosynthetic and metabolic process from biological process (GO) and Cysteine and methionine metabolism (KEGG analysis). In view of these approaches, VASN, MAT2B, HERPUD1, TPAPPC6B and TAT are probably the most important miR-375 targets. In addition, miR-375 was negatively correlated with MAT2B, which was verified in 5 tumors of TCGA. Conclusion In summary, this study based on common target genes provides an innovative perspective for exploring the molecular mechanism of miR-375 in human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2898696864,"Objective The oral health-related quality of life has recently been reported to be a rather important aspect of general health. Dropping out of dental treatment has long been a problem plaguing oral health. However, the relationship between dropout for dental treatment and the oral health-related quality of life is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the oral health-related quality of life in patients who dropped out of dental treatment. Materials and methods We conducted a questionnaire-based investigation using web research. The participants were allocated to two groups (dropout group and maintenance group). The dropout group included participants who had stopped visiting their dental office in the past and had not revisited in the last decade. The maintenance group included patients who visited their dental office continually for a regular checkup. We analyzed the General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) as an indicator of the oral health-related quality of life and assessed the background characteristics of the subjects. Results We analyzed 225 people in the dropout group and 236 people in the maintenance group. The score of GOHAI was significantly different between the 2 groups (dropout group:47.07, maintenance:48.97, p = 0.035), and the more frequent dropouts brought the less GOHAI score (p = 0.012). Furthermore, the results of a logistic regression analysis showed that dropping out of dental treatment was significantly associated with the GOHAI score (p = 0.002). Conclusion A relationship was demonstrated between the oral health-related quality of life and dental treatment dropout. Furthermore, dental treatment dropout seemed to have negative effects on the oral health-related quality of life."

https://openalex.org/W2899094107,"Tourist satisfaction has always been a crucial research issue in the tourism economy. This paper utilizes the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) to analyze the impact of urban tourism satisfaction on urban macroeconomics from a macro perspective, using quarterly data on tourist satisfaction in 35 large and medium-sized cities along with major urban macroeconomic variables. This study is quite distinct from previous research that focused on constructing a tourist satisfaction index and analyzing the influence factors of tourism satisfaction from the perspective of the micro-level internal composition of tourism. The empirical results show: Firstly, in respect of the impact of urban tourists' satisfaction on the GDP income of cities, the SDM and the SDM with a lagged first-order dependent variable (SDM_dlag) show that the short-term and long-term indirect effects of log-tourist satisfaction are significantly positive, indicating that city satisfaction has a significant positive spatial spillover effect on GDP growth in other cities; Secondly, in respect of the influence of urban tourist satisfaction on the cost of urban life in the SDM, the long-term direct and indirect effects of logarithmic satisfaction are significantly positive, implying, in the long run, that tourist satisfaction has a positive intraregional spillover effect and spatial spillover effect on urban living costs; Finally, the SDM_dlag for the regression of urban tourist satisfaction on the cost of urban daily life shows that the short-run direct and indirect effects of city tourist satisfaction are significantly negative, indicating that tourist satisfaction has intra-regional and spatial spillover effects, and its rise will reduce the cost of living expenses in local and other cities in the short term. Overall, we have further elucidated the role of different levels of urban tourist satisfaction in city macroeconomics from the spatial dimension, thereby enriching the existing research on tourist satisfaction to some certain extent."
https://openalex.org/W2899144714,"Understanding the distribution and transport of Uranium is important because it can lead to both chemical and radiological toxicity. This study presents the Uranium concentrations time series from 1964 to 2009 obtained from a 3 m deep snow pit at Dome Argus, East Antarctic Plateau. The data shows that Uranium concentrations vary from 0.0067 pg g-1 to 0.12 pg g-1, with a mean concentration of 0.044 pg g-1. Its mean concentration is 2-3 folds lower than at West Antarctica study sites, such as the Antarctic Peninsula (mean 0.12 pg g-1), IC-6 (Ice Core-6) (mean 0.11 pg g-1) and a suite of ice cores from the US ITASE traverse. Before the mid-1980s, the varieties of Uranium concentrations are relatively stable, with a very low mean concentration of 0.016 pg g-1and its main source is sea salt deposition, while a small number of anthropogenic sources are likely to be caused by Uranium mining operations in South Africa. A remarkable increase of Uranium concentrations has occurred since the mid-1980s (by a factor of ~ 9) compared with the amount before the mid-1980s. This increase coincides with the Uranium records at IC-6 and Antarctic Peninsula (DP-07-01) during the same period, and are mostly attributed to Uranium mining operations in Australia as a potential primary anthropogenic Uranium source. Our observations suggest that Uranium pollution in the atmosphere might have already become a global phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2899248445,"Matricaria discoidea DC. (Asteraceae) has documented use as an insect repellent by Blackfoot Indians and other indigenous groups of North America. This investigation was conducted to evaluate this practice and systematically identify chemical constituents responsible for any insect repelling effect by utilizing a mosquito (Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus)) biting deterrent bioactivity-directed purification approach. Hydrodistilled oil from dried aerial parts of M. discoidea was the most bioactive crude extract generated and was as. Fractionation of this extract, followed by re-evaluation for mosquito biting deterrence using the K & D (Klun and Debboun) bioassay, produced many active fractions that were subsequently evaluated by spectroscopic techniques and the most active compounds were determined to be α-terpineol, spathulenol, and neryl isovalerate. A & K (Ali and Khan) large cage in vitro evaluation of pure compounds isolated from M. discoidea indicated α-terpineol to be the most active compound providing complete protection at 25 μg/cm2. This is the first report on the mosquito repellency of neryl isovalerate and scientific evidence reported here validates the traditional use of M. discoidea as a biting-insect deterrent."
