https://openalex.org/W1601873036,"The Ras-like GTPase Cdc42 is essential for cell polarity and bud site assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by regulating cell cycle-dependent reorganization of cortical cytoskeletal elements. However, its role in mammalian cells is unknown. To identify potential effectors of Cdc42Hs, we incubated lysates from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or PC12 cells with immobilized glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdc42Hs fusion proteins bound to different guanine nucleotides and observed a specific association between the 85-kDa subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate)-bound GST-Cdc42Hs. Recombinant p85 formed a complex with GTP gamma S-bound GST-Cdc42Hs and with a GTPase-defective GTP-bound GST-Cdc42Hs-Q61L mutant, but not with a GTP gamma S-bound, effector domain GST-Cdc42HsT35A mutant. Both the Rho-GAP homology domain of p85 and the Cdc42Hs-GAP competitively inhibited the binding of recombinant p85 to Cdc42Hs. In addition, PI 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-p85 antibody was stimulated 2-4-fold by GST-Cdc42-GTP gamma S. Similar interactions were observed between p85 and GST-Rac1-GTP gamma S but not between p85 and GST-RhoA-GTP gamma S. These findings suggest that PI 3-kinase, through the Rho-GAP homology domain of p85, can couple to the effector domain of Cdc42Hs and that p85 may be a target for the GTP-bound forms of Cdc42Hs and Rac1."
https://openalex.org/W1602103287,"The effects of wortmannin (WT), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, on differentiation of PC12 cells were analyzed. WT inhibited PI 3-kinase activity of PC12 cells at a concentration of 10(-7) M in vivo and in vitro. Transient inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity at the time of nerve growth factor stimulation had no effect on activation of the ras protein or neurite formation by the cells. However, continuous inhibition of PI 3-kinase blocked differentiation at the step just before neurite formation. When WT was applied to cells growing neurites, elongation of the neurites was stopped at that step. These results suggest that PI 3-kinase may be involved in neurite elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1526143887,"Abstract 5-Hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine (5-OHdC) and 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxyuridine (5-OHdU) are major products of oxidative DNA damage with mutagenic potential. Until now, no enzymatic activity responsible for their removal has been identified. We report here that both 5-OHdC and 5-OHdU are substrates for Escherichia coli endonuclease III and formamidopyrimidine DNA N-glycosylase (FPG). 5-OHdU is also a substrate for uracil DNA N-glycosylase. Consistent with their mechanisms of action on previously described substrates, endonuclease III removes 5-OHdC and 5-OHdU via a N-glycosylase/beta-elimination reaction, FPG follows a N-glycosylase/beta,delta-elimination reaction, and uracil N-glycosylase removes 5-OHdU by N-glycosylase action leaving behind an abasic site. Endonuclease III removes both lesions more efficiently than FPG, and both endonuclease III and FPG remove 5-OHdC slightly more efficiently than 5-OHdU. Uracil DNA N-glycosylase removes 5-OHdU more efficiently than the other two enzymes and has no activity on 5-OHdC even when present in great excess. Analysis of crude extracts obtained from wild type and endonuclease III deletion mutants of E. coli correlated well with data obtained with the purified enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1586946310,"Inherited resistance to activated protein C (APC) is a recently identified major cause of thrombosis. It is associated with a mutation in the factor V gene affecting one of the cleavage sites for APC. APC resistance was recently found to be corrected by factor V, suggesting that factor V may have anticoagulant properties as a cofactor to APC. To elucidate this further, we have studied the effect of factor V and protein S, which is a known cofactor to APC, on APC-mediated degradation of factor VIIIa in a purified system. The APC-mediated degradation of factor VIIIa was monitored by a factor X activation reaction using purified factor IXa, phospholipid, and calcium. In the presence of both factor V and protein S, APC was found to inhibit factor VIIIa activity efficiently. APC alone or together with factor V was ineffective, whereas APC in combination with protein S was less efficient than when factor V was also included in the reaction. Two monoclonal antibodies, one against protein S and the other directed toward factor V, were found to inhibit the APC cofactor activity of the factor V-protein S mixture. Factor Va did not express APC cofactor activity, and addition of excess factor Va over factor V did not inhibit the APC cofactor function of a factor V-protein S mixture. In conclusion, the results suggest that factor V and protein S work in synergy as phospholipid-bound cofactors to APC."
https://openalex.org/W1520757652,"Heparan sulfate (HS) can bind a large variety of biological effectors, including extracellular matrix components, growth factors, chemokines, degradative enzymes, and protease inhibitors. Where studied, HS is known to be structurally heterogeneous and to vary in sulfation pattern between cells and tissues. Because heparan sulfate can represent several distinct proteoglycans, we asked whether the structural variation in the heparan sulfate chains of a single species of cell surface proteoglycan is a reproducible, differentiated characteristic and whether the variation can result in distinct biological functions. We studied the molecular structure and binding affinity for type I collagen and fibroblast growth factor-2 of syndecan-1 purified from the surfaces of NMuMG normal murine mammary gland epithelia, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, and BALB/3T3 endothelioid cells. Syndecan-1 from these cell types varied in molecular mass largely due to variation in the length of the HS chains. Although the highly sulfated and N-acetylated domains in these HS chains were organized similarly, the number of highly sulfated domains differed. The disaccharide compositions were also similar except for reproducible and consistent differences in the amount of hexuronic acid-N-sulfated-6-O-sulfated glucosamine and 2-O-sulfated hexuronic acid-N-sulfated glucosamine. These differences were confirmed by oligosaccharide mapping, which showed cell type-specific variations in the composition of the highly sulfated domains. These structural variations correlated with cell type-specific differences in the affinity of syndecan-1 and its isolated HS chains for type I collagen. However, no differences in affinity for fibroblast growth factor-2 were detected. The results indicate that the size, fine structure, and ligand affinity of the HS chains on a single proteoglycan species differ in a consistent and reproducible manner between cell types. Thus, the variation in structure and binding ability of HS on syndecan-1 is a differentiated characteristic of the cell type that can enable cells to respond distinctly to the HS-binding effectors in the cellular microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W1583466237,"Biological nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by nitrogenase, an enzyme comprised of two component proteins called the Fe protein and the MoFe protein. Both nitrogenase component proteins contain metalloclusters. The Azotobacter vinelandii nifS gene product (NifS), which is required for full activation of the nitrogenase component proteins, is a pyridoxal phosphate enzyme and is able to catalyze the desulfurization of L-cysteine to yield sulfur and L-alanine (Zheng, L., White, R. H., Cash, V.L., Jack, R.F., and Dean, D.R. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 2754-2758). An enzyme-bound persulfide that was identified as an intermediate in the cysteine desulfurization reaction catalyzed by NifS has been suggested as a possible S-donor in formation of the iron-sulfide cores of the nitrogenase metalloclusters. In the present work it is shown that NifS is able to effectively catalyze activation of an apo-form of the Fe protein that was prepared by removal of its Fe4S4 cluster using the chelator, alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl. The reconstitution reaction includes apo-Fe protein, NifS, L-cysteine, ferrous ion, dithiothreitol, and MgATP. Reconstitution of the inactive apo-Fe protein catalyzed by NifS results in 80-95% recovery of the original activity and yields an Fe protein having the normal electron paramagnetic resonance spectra properties associated with the Fe protein's Fe4S4 cluster. An altered NifS protein, NifS-Ala325, which lacks the desulfurase activity and is unable to from the NifS-bound persulfide, is not able to catalyze reactivation of the apo-Fe protein. These in vitro results support the proposal that NifS activity provides the inorganic sulfide necessary for in vivo formation of the nitrogenase metalloclusters. Moreover, because NifS has recently been shown to be a member of a highly homologous gene family, it appears that pyridoxal phosphate chemistry might play a general role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1629392288,"Multisite phosphorylation of the nuclear lamins is thought to regulate the process of mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown in vivo. Here we investigate the involvement of two proposed human mitotic lamin kinases, beta II protein kinase C (PKC) and p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase, in human lamin B1 phosphorylation in vitro and in intact cells. We find that both kinases can phosphorylate purified soluble lamin B at similar rates. However, beta II PKC phosphorylates interphase nuclear envelope lamin B at more than 200 times the rate of human p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase. beta II PKC-mediated phosphorylation of lamin B is confined to two sites, Ser395 and Ser405, within the carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas human p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase phosphorylates a single site, Ser23, in the amino-terminal domain. A second potential p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase site within the carboxyl-terminal domain, Ser393, is not phosphorylated by human p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase. However, invertebrate p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase from sea star exhibits a different specificity, phosphorylating both amino- and carboxyl-terminal sites. Mitotic human lamin B from intact cells is phosphorylated predominantly in its carboxyl-terminal domain. Comparative tryptic phosphopeptide mapping demonstrates that the beta II PKC site, Ser405, is a prominent target of mitotic lamin B phosphorylation in vivo. beta II PKC translocates to the nucleus during the G2/M phase of cell cycle concomitant with phosphorylation of Ser405, indicating a physiologic role for nuclear beta II PKC activation in mitotic lamin B phosphorylation in vivo. The presence of phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl-terminal domain of mitotic lamin B which are not phosphorylated by either beta II PKC or p34cdc2/cyclin B kinase suggests the involvement of other lamin kinase(s) in G2/M phase lamin B phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1582210525,"In the pancreas proglucagon (PG), a peptide precursor of 160 amino acids is cleaved to produce glucagon and a 30-amino acid N-terminal flanking peptide, but the fate of the C-terminal flanking peptide (99 amino acids) is incompletely known. We subjected acid ethanol extracts of human and porcine pancreases to gel filtration and analyzed the fractions with specific radioimmunoassays for the following regions of proglucagon: PG 62-69, PG 72-81, PG 78-87, PG 98-107 amide, PG 126-134, and PG 149-158. Based on these assays and successive purifications by high performance liquid chromatography we isolated and purified to homogeneity three porcine peptides which were subjected to mass spectrometry and sequencing. One peptide was PG 64-69. The second was PG 72-108, as determined by mass spectrometry, N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and specific radioimmunoassays. The third had a molecular size of approximately 10,000, an N-terminal sequence corresponding to PG 72-81, and a C-terminal sequence terminating at PG 158 (specific radioimmunoassay). A similar peptide with an identical N-terminal sequence, a C-terminal sequence corresponding to PG 146-158, and a molecular mass of 9969 (theoretical mass for human PG 72-158 = 9971) was isolated from human pancreas together with small amounts of a peptide corresponding to PG 72-107 amide. Thus, the pancreatic processing of the C-terminal flanking peptide in proglucagon includes the formation of equimolar (to glucagon) amounts of PG 64-69 and PG 72-158 (major proglucagon fragment) and smaller amounts of N-terminally extended glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (PG 72-108 in pigs and PG 72-107 amide in humans)."
https://openalex.org/W1574323219,"Mucin glycopeptides were prepared from the sputum of a patient suffering from cystic fibrosis. The carbohydrate chains were released by alkaline borohydride treatment. Sialylated and sulfated oligosaccharide-alditols were purified by ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and high performance anion-exchange chromatography. The structures of the oligosaccharide-alditols were determined by high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy in combination with fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. Twenty-four oligosaccharides were characterized and illustrate the diversity of the carbohydrate chains of cystic fibrosis respiratory mucins. Among these 24 oligosaccharide-alditols, 15 are novel structures. Sialylation may occur on the C-6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine involved in the carbohydrate-peptide linkage or on a terminal galactose residue, either on C-3 or on C-6. Sulfation may occur either on the C-3 of a terminal galactose residue or on the C-6 of a N-acetylglucosamine residue. The most complex structures contain sulfated derivatives of the H,X, or Y determinants or a sialylated and sulfated derivative of the X determinant (Structure A)."
https://openalex.org/W1490406634,"Apoptosis is an important physiological process that involves the deletion of specific cells in a controlled and timely manner. A biochemical hallmark typifying apoptosis in normal lymphocytes is DNA cleavage caused by a calcium-dependent nuclease. We have previously identified and purified an 18-kDa nuclease (NUC18) from glucocorticoid-treated rat thymocytes whose activity is associated with this apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Partial protein sequencing of pure NUC18 has generated two peptide sequences that have a remarkable similarity to rat cyclophilin A and other members of the cyclophilin family. We report here that recombinant cyclophilins A, B, and C have a calcium/magnesium-dependent nuclease activity with biochemical and pharmacological properties similar to those of NUC18. Our results raise the intriguing possibility that cyclophilin or a cyclophilin-related protein may play a role in lymphocyte apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1647782814,"Glucocorticoid agonists, i.e. dexamethasone or triamcinolone acetonide, rapidly induce expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) delta and repress expression of C/EBP alpha in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Within 30 min of glucocorticoid treatment, the cellular level of C/EBP delta rises dramatically, increasing > 100-fold within 6 h. Concurrently, the level of C/EBP alpha decreases, reaching a minimum within 4 h. The dexamethasone concentration dependence and steroid specificity of these responses suggest that both processes are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. The reciprocal effects of dexamethasone on the steady-state levels of C/EBP alpha and C/EBP delta can be accounted for kinetically and quantitatively by changes in their mRNA levels and by the transcription rates of their respective genes. The glucocorticoid-induced changes in expression of the C/EBP isoforms are correlated with the transcriptional activation of the SCD1 gene, an adipocyte gene known to be transactivated by C/EBP isoforms. Glucocorticoids also regulate expression of the C/EBP isoforms in vivo. Within 4 h of administration of dexamethasone or triamcinolone acetonide to adult rats, expression of C/EBP delta is induced in white adipose tissue while expression of C/EBP alpha is repressed. Like the response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the effects of dexamethasone on C/EBP alpha in white adipose tissue are rapid and transient."
https://openalex.org/W1668855587,"To begin to explore the basis for the tissue-specific expression of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), we focused on three rat tissues (liver, heart, and skeletal muscle) in which the enzyme was known to display very different properties. In Northern blot analysis, a cDNA probe corresponding to liver CPT I readily hybridized to a 4.5-kilobase species of mRNA in liver and heart, but not in skeletal muscle. Using the same probe to screen a neonatal rat heart cDNA library, a full-length clone, surprisingly having 100% sequence identity to the liver CPT I cDNA, was isolated. The paradox was resolved by two additional experiments. First, in Western blots of mitochondrial membranes, an antibody raised against liver CPT I recognized the 88-kDa protein in heart, as well as in liver, but not in skeletal muscle. Second, high specific activity [3H]deschloroetomoxir (a covalent ligand for CPT I) reacted with a single form of CPT I in liver (approximately 88 kDa) and skeletal muscle (approximately 82 kDa), while proteins of both sizes were labeled in the cardiac myocyte. Tritiated ligand binding to the two heart proteins was blocked by excess unlabeled malonyl-CoA. It is concluded that liver and skeletal muscle each contains a single and distinct isoform of CPT I with monomeric size of approximately 88 and 82 kDa, respectively. The heart contains a CPT I protein of approximately 82 kDa in size (probably identical to the skeletal muscle protein) but, importantly, also expresses the liver-type enzyme. The results likely explain why previous studies of heart CPT I yielded an apparent Km for carnitine and I50 value for malonyl-CoA inhibition that were intermediate between those of the liver and skeletal muscle enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1569227242,"In order to clone novel diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) isozymes, we first obtained a DGK-related cDNA fragment by polymerase chain reaction using the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 mRNA and degenerated primers. The amplified fragment was subsequently used as a probe for screening the cDNA library from HepG2 cells. We obtained a cDNA clone coding for a novel DGK isozyme (designated DGK gamma) comprised of 791 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence of DGK gamma was 52 and 62% identical to those of previously sequenced porcine 80-kDa and rat 90-kDa enzymes, respectively. DGK gamma, although initially cloned from the HepG2 cDNA libraries, was unexpectedly expressed in the human retina abundantly and to a much lesser extent in the brain. Other human tissues, including the liver and HepG2 cells, contained extremely low levels of DGK gamma mRNA. Furthermore, HepG2 cells and most of the human tissues except for the retina and brain expressed a truncated DGK gamma with an internal deletion of 25 amino acid residues (Ile451-Gly475). When transfected into COS-7 cells, the nontruncated cDNA gave phosphatidylserine-dependent DGK activity with no apparent specificity with regard to the acyl compositions of diacylglycerol. In contrast the truncated cDNA failed to give DGK activity in spite of the expression of its mRNA and enzyme protein in COS cells, thus demonstrating that the truncated DGK gamma is catalytically inactive. The sequence comparison of the three cloned DGKs revealed the presence of four highly conserved regions including the two sets each of EF-hand and zinc finger structures. Although the implication of the catalytically inactive form of DGK gamma remains unknown, this work further demonstrates the occurrence of multiple animal DGK isozymes with a conserved basic structure but with markedly different expression patterns depending on the cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1498954167,"Although tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL) induce the expression of the IL-8, TNF-stimulated gene 6, and plasminogen activation inhibitor-2 genes and the activation of NF-kappa B with nearly identical kinetics, the two cytokines differ significantly in the induction of the IL-6 gene in all primary fibroblasts tested. IL-1 induces IL-6 gene expression after 30 min of IL-1 treatment, reaching a maximum level by 7 h, and is sustained for up to 14 h. TNF also induces the IL-6 gene expression at 30 min but the induction was low. A similar differences in the amount of IL-6 secreted was observed in the IL-1/TNF-treated cells. Measurement of IL-6 gene transcription by nuclear run-on transcription assays indicated a 4-fold higher rate of IL-6 gene transcription in IL-1-treated than in TNF-treated cells. The IL-1-induced IL-6 mRNA has a significantly longer half-life (> 6 h) compared to 30 min for TNF-treated cells. These results suggest that the induction of the IL-6 gene expression in primary human fibroblasts by TNF and IL-1 is differentially regulated at the transcriptional as well as at the post-transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W1562828870,"Abstract Rap1A is a GTP-binding protein of the Ras superfamily that is highly abundant in phagocyte membranes. Although Rap1A copurifies with cytochrome b558, a component of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase complex of human phagocytes and B lymphocytes, the involvement of Rap1A in the regulation of the oxidative burst in these cells has not been clearly established. Therefore, we have stably transfected human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes that possess an activable NADPH oxidase complex with cDNAs for mutants of Rap1A locked in a GTP-bound (63E) and GDP-bound (17N) state. Both the 17N and 63E mutants of Rap1A inhibited phorbol ester-stimulated O2-. production by 50 and 80%, respectively, while transfection with cDNA for wild-type Rap1A had no effect on the respiratory burst. No effects of the Rap1A mutants on cell viability, proliferation, expression of cell-surface markers, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated interleukin-8 generation were detected. These data demonstrate that Rap1A is a regulator of O2-. formation in intact cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of both GTP- as well as GDP-bound mutants indicates that Rap1A functions in a dynamic cycle as opposed to a unidirectional pathway, as is the case for the other NADPH oxidase regulatory GTP-binding protein, Rac."
https://openalex.org/W1575122167,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) exerts its action via a cell surface receptor complex consisting of two subunits, the IL-6 receptor and the signal transducer gp130. We have studied the role of both transmembrane proteins for IL-6 internalization and ligand-induced down-regulation of cell surface receptors. Co-expression of wild-type and mutant forms of both the IL-6 receptor and gp130 in transiently transfected COS-7 cells revealed that gp130 is essential for efficient endocytosis and receptor down-regulation. Whereas the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-6 receptor is not significantly involved in the internalization process, deletion of the corresponding domain of gp130 resulted in an almost complete loss of the ability to endocytose IL-6. Mutants with different truncations within the intracellular domain of gp130 revealed that a 10-amino acid sequence TQPLLDSEER is crucial for efficient internalization. Since this sequence contains a putative di-leucine internalization motif, we suggest that a di-leucine motif directs the receptor mediated endocytosis of the IL-6 receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1583208426,"Mitochondria that have accumulated Ca2+ can be induced to undergo a permeability transition: the inner membrane becomes nonselectively permeable to small (< 1500 daltons) solutes. Our laboratory has recently identified the polyamine spermine as an inhibitor of the permeability transition of isolated rat heart and liver mitochondria. Here, we have used swelling of liver mitochondria as an indicator of transition occurrence to investigate the connection between spermine, another transition antagonist, ADP, and several key triggering agents: P(i), Ca2+, and t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH). Our results demonstrate that: 1) ADP strongly inhibits only the swelling induced by P(i); transitions induced by t-BH and Ca2+ are minimally affected. 2) The sensitivity of the permeability transition to P(i) is enhanced in mitochondria depleted of adenine nucleotides. 3) Incubation with P(i) decreases mitochondrial ADP and ATP content. 4) Spermine inhibits less well in adenine nucleotide-depleted than control mitochondria, regardless of triggering agent. 5) Spermine and ADP act synergistically to inhibit the transition. 6) ADP replenishment makes P(i) a worse triggering agent. Triggering by Ca2+ and t-BH is enhanced. 7) P(i) overcomes spermine inhibition; Ca2+ and t-BH do not. We propose that P(i) triggers the transition by lowering the matrix concentration of the inhibitor ADP and that spermine inhibits the transition by enhancing ADP effectiveness. In addition, these data clearly distinguish the triggering action of P(i) from that of Ca2+ and t-BH."
https://openalex.org/W2130220696,"The zona pellucida is an extracellular matrix surrounding the mammalian egg where species-specific gamete recognition and signaling occur. Pig zona pellucida were isolated in large amounts and used as an affinity matrix for detergent-solubilized, biotinylated membrane proteins of pig spermatozoa. On non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, specifically bound sperm proteins migrated with M(r) 170,000, 150,000, 130,000, 56,000, and 50,000 (p50). Disulfide bond reduction separated each of the M(r) 130,000-170,000 proteins into M(r) 105,000 (p105) and M(r) 45,000 (p45) subunits, indicating that these high M(r) proteins are related. Based on two-dimensional electrophoresis, the M(r) 56,000 band was composed of three to four proteins that migrated with M(r) 56,000-62,000 (p56-62) in the second (reducing) dimension. p50 bound to heterologous zona pellucida (murine, bovine) and to Xenopus laevis oocyte envelopes, demonstrating a lack of species specificity to its binding and was identified as proacrosin/acrosin based on amino acid sequences of two tryptic peptides and its interaction with monospecific antibodies to proacrosin. In contrast, p105/p45 and one or more of the p56-62 proteins bound to pig zona pellucida but not to the egg extracellular matrices of the other species; these proteins therefore exhibited the species-specific binding to the zona pellucida expected for molecules involved in specific gamete adhesion. Amino acid sequences of nine tryptic peptides derived from p105/p45 did not match peptide sequences in existing databases, establishing it as a unique protein. These (p105/p45 and at least one p56-62 protein) are the first sperm membrane proteins to be identified that bind in a species-specific manner to the egg extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1485736993,"Initiation of the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway is mediated by a complex formed between plasma-derived factor VII/VIIa and cell-derived tissue factor (TF). To identify the site(s) of interaction, zymogen VII and VIIa were enzymatically and chemically modified, and their affinities for TF were estimated by measuring their inhibitory effects on the amidolytic activity enhanced after formation of the VIIa-TF complex. We found that the VIIa-light chain (Ki = 3.5 x 10(-7) M) and its fragment consisting of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-domain and the first epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain (Gla-EGF1 peptide; Ki = 1.0 x 10(-6) M) have an affinity for TF. Therefore, one of the binding sites of VII with TF is probably located in the Gla-EGF1 region. On the other hand, a dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone-treated Gla-domainless VIIa (Ki = 0.7 x 10(-7) M) showed a high affinity for TF, whereas the corresponding Gla-domainless VII similarly treated showed no binding potential, thereby indicating that binding site(s) other than in the Gla-EGF1 region are present in VIIa but not in VII. Acetylation or carbamylation of the alpha-amino group of the NH2-terminal Ile-153 of VIIa resulted in the loss of binding affinity for TF; such modifications convert VIIa into a zymogen-like inactive form by destroying the salt bridge between Ile-153 and Asp-343 in VIIa. The rate of carbamylation of VIIa was reduced in the presence of TF. Protection of the alpha-amino group of Ile-153 from carbamylation after complex formation was consistent with salt bridge formation between Ile-153 and Asp-343 in the VIIa-TF complex. Therefore, binding of TF with the heavy chain of VIIa may induce a conformational change that brings the alpha-amino group of Ile-153 close to the beta-carboxyl group of Asp-343 to make a stable salt bridge."
https://openalex.org/W1515660540,"In polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells the newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins, on the exocytic pathway, are sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and delivered directly to the apical or basolateral surface. Forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and dibutyryl cAMP, all known to activate protein kinase A, stimulated transport of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from the TGN to the apical surface. The same reagents, however, did not affect the transport of HA from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Goli complex nor did they affect transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein from the TGN to the basolateral surface. The addition of staurosporin, a general protein kinase inhibitor, did not affect the transport of HA in nontreated cells but blocked the stimulation caused by the above reagents. Apical transport of HA was also stimulated by phorbol ester, an activator of protein kinase C. Activation of apical transport by phorbol ester as well as aluminum fluoride (Pimplikar, S. W., and Simons, K. (1993) Nature 362, 456-458) was also negated by staurosporin. These results show that in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, protein kinase A and protein kinase C selectively stimulate the apical transport."
https://openalex.org/W1598637952,"Human cells remove bulky adducts from DNA by excising single-stranded fragments 27-29 nucleotides in length by an enzyme system consisting of at least 14 polypeptides. All of the previous work on characterizing the excision reaction was conducted with plasmids 3 or 8 kilobases in length. To determine if the size and tertiary structure of DNA play a role in the excision reaction and to find out if large DNA fragments are necessary to contact all of the subunits of the excinuclease, we performed experiments with circular DNA and with linear DNA fragments of various sizes. We found that the human excinuclease is capable of removing DNA adducts from linear and covalently closed circular DNAs with about the same efficiency. Furthermore, we found that the excinuclease can remove a thymine dimer or a psoralen-thymine monoadduct from linear fragments provided that the distance between the lesion and the 5'-terminus of the damaged strand is > or = 60 nucleotides and the distance between the lesion and the 3'-terminus is > or = 44 nucleotides. Thus, the minimum size substrate for human excinuclease is approximately 100 base pairs in length."
https://openalex.org/W1602730687,"We here demonstrate that mastoparan, fluoride, forskolin, cholera toxin, and 8-bromoadenosine-3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate all selectively stimulate apical endocytosis of the protein toxin ricin without increasing the uptake at the basolateral side of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Activation of adenylyl cyclase and an increased level of cAMP seem to increase ricin endocytosis by a clathrin-independent mechanism since stimulation of endocytosis by cholera toxin and 8-bromoadenosine-3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate occurred even when the clathrin-dependent pathway was blocked by low cytosolic pH. The data suggest that mastoparan stimulates apical endocytosis by interacting with heterotrimeric G proteins, and also this stimulation of endocytosis appears to be clathrin independent since the uptake of transferrin at the apical side was strongly inhibited by mastoparan after brefeldin A-induced missorting of the transferrin receptor to this pole of the cell. In addition, mastoparan stimulated apical endocytosis when clathrin-mediated endocytosis was blocked by acidification of the cytosol. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the existence of clathrin-independent endocytosis on both the apical and the basolateral surface of control Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Our results suggest that endocytosis at the apical pole of epithelial cells can be regulated selectively by a physiological signal."
https://openalex.org/W1506416799,"The functional subunits of the human Type I interferon (IFN) receptor complex have not been defined. Using site-specific recombination in a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), we have produced a deletion within the human IFN-alpha receptor (Hu-IFN-alpha R1) gene which eliminates exon II of the gene. This deletion effectively eliminates the MHC Class I antigen induction and antiviral activity previously reported for this fully functional parental YAC clone (Soh, J., Mariano, T. M., Lim, J.-K., Izotova, L., Mirochnitchenko, O., Schwartz, B., Langer, J., and Pestka, S. (1994c) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18102-18110). We have successfully reconstituted this activity by expression of the cDNA encoding the Hu-IFN-alpha R1 component (Uze, G., Lutfalla, G., and Gresser, I. (1990) Cell 60, 225-234) in cells containing the YAC with this deletion. The Hu-IFN-alpha R1 subunit thus plays a critical role in the functional human Type I IFN receptor complex, whose components are encoded on this YAC. In addition, as binding of ligands is retained in the cells containing the YAC with the deletion, it is clear a second subunit encoded on the YAC is responsible for ligand binding activity. This system will now allow the identification of additional subunits involved in the response to the Type I IFNs and the functional significance of each."
https://openalex.org/W1616015704,"The dioxin receptor is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that binds to target DNA sequences (xenobiotic responsive elements, XREs) following ligand-dependent dimerization with its partner factor, Arnt (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator). Both factors contain an N-terminal basic region helix-loop-helix motif mediating dimerization and subsequent DNA binding. In this study we investigate the possible role of Arnt in agonistic and antagonistic effects of the dioxin receptor ligand alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF). Using specific antisera for the ligand binding dioxin receptor and Arnt, respectively, we show that exposure of the dioxin receptor to ANF in vitro induced recruitment of Arnt, thus stimulating binding of the heteromeric complex to XRE. In transient transfection assays, ANF at high concentrations stimulated expression of an XRE-driven reporter gene. This agonistic effect of ANF is, therefore, most likely attributable to ANF stimulation of dioxin receptor-Arnt heterodimerization and subsequent binding of the complex to XRE. Using a minimal XRE-driven reporter gene construct, we could further confirm earlier studies showing that ANF antagonizes the effect of a dioxin receptor agonist, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Next we employed chimeric receptor constructs containing amino acids 1-500 of the human glucocorticoid receptor fused to dioxin receptor fragments lacking the very N-terminal basic region helix-loop-helix dimerization and DNA binding motif. These chimeric receptor constructs show dioxin responsiveness upon transient transfection into mutant Arnt-deficient hepatoma cells and are, thus, functionally uncoupled from Arnt. Importantly, dioxin-dependent activation of the chimeric receptors was inhibited in the presence of ANF, demonstrating that dimerization of dioxin receptor with Arnt was not necessary for manifestation of the antagonistic effect of ANF. Rather, dioxin receptor sequences, which confer dioxin regulation upon a heterologous DNA binding and transactivating domain, also mediated the antagonistic effects of ANF."
https://openalex.org/W2160380609,"We evaluated the G protein selectivity of chimeric M1 and M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors in which either the third intracellular (I3) loop or the N-terminal portion of this loop (the I3N peptide) was replaced by the corresponding sequence from the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. The chimeras retained agonist-dependent G protein regulatory activity, but were completely promiscuous among potential G protein targets. When expressed in transfected cells, the chimeric receptors activated adenylyl cyclase, the major target of the beta-adrenergic receptor, and activated phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein, presumably a Gq. Gs is not a target of either muscarinic receptor, and Gq is not a cellular target of either the M2 muscarinic or beta-adrenergic receptor. When co-reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles with purified G proteins, the chimeric receptors were completely nonselective among all G proteins tested. They activated Gi, G(o), Gz, and Gs with similar efficiencies. This promiscuity was largely suppressed, both in transfected cells and in reconstituted vesicles, by the additional replacement of the second intracellular (I2) loop of the beta-adrenergic receptor. Such double substitutions created receptors specific for Gs, the target of the beta-adrenergic receptor. These findings suggest that G protein specificity depends on the proper combination of multiple regions on a receptor's cytoplasmic surface. In addition, the promiscuous receptors described here may be useful for regulating novel G proteins whose natural regulators are not yet known."
https://openalex.org/W1680307102,"PC2 is a subtilisin-like protease which is thought to be involved in the processing of prohormones and proneuropeptides in neuroendocrine cells. The mature 68-kDa enzyme is generated by intracellular proteolytic processing of a 75-kDa pro-PC2 polypeptide. Neuroendocrine cells contain at least two secretory pathways: the regulated pathway whereby secreted products are concentrated, stored in granules, and released in response to external stimulation of the cell, and the constitutive pathway, whereby secretory and plasma membrane proteins are continuously transported to the cell surface without prior concentration or storage. An important step in the sorting of proteins into these pathways is thought to involve the aggregation of proteins destined for storage granules. To define the mechanisms in the intracellular sorting of PC2 to secretory vesicles, the present study was undertaken to investigate the aggregation and membrane association properties of precursor and mature forms of PC2. Using material expressed in microinjected Xenopus oocytes, it was demonstrated that the 75-kDa pro-PC2 polypeptide undergoes calcium- and acid pH-dependent aggregation. Calcium exhibited an effect on the aggregation of pro-PC2 at pH 7.0 and 6.5, whereas below 6.5 aggregation was independent of calcium. Association of pro-PC2 with membranes was observed at pH 5.5, but not at pH 7.0, 6.5, nor 6.0. The mature 68-kDa PC2 polypeptide remained soluble under conditions that caused aggregation and membrane association of the 75-kDa propolypeptide. Deletion of COOH-terminal sequences had no effect on the association of pro-PC2 with membranes, whereas a peptide corresponding to amino acids 57-85 of the propeptide was able to partially compete the membrane associated pro-PC2 away from the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1579053513,"Calpain requires Ca2+ both for proteolysis of its substrates and for interaction with its endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin. Although calmodulin-like domains (CaMLDs) of large and small subunits of calpain have been suggested to be the sites for Ca(2+)-dependent interaction with calpastatin, specificity and molecular basis of the interaction have remained unclear. We investigated the interaction between the CaMLD of human mu-calpain large subunit expressed in Escherichia coli and a 19-residue synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the region A (the amino-terminal conserved acidic region) of one of the four repetitive functional domains of calpastatin. The recombinant CaMLD bound to the oligopeptide immobilized on Sepharose beads in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The CaMLD failed in binding to a mutant oligopeptide with one amino acid substitution. Enhancement of fluorescence intensity of a hydrophobic probe, 2-(p-toluidino)naphthalene-6-sulfonate, was observed upon incubating with the CaMLD and further increased by Ca2+. The Ca(2+)-dependent enhancement of fluorescence intensity was strongly suppressed by the wild type oligopeptide, but not by the mutant one. Kinetic experiments were performed with BIAcore where binding of the CaMLD to the oligopeptide immobilized on a biosensor chip was detected as real time signals of surface plasmon resonance. The determined dissociation constant (KD) was 3.1 x 10(-9) M. These results suggest that the region A of calpastatin binds to the CaMLD in a specific manner similar to interactions between calmodulin-binding peptides and calmodulin where hydrophobic properties are known to be important."
https://openalex.org/W1537094542,"The S-100 proteins are a structurally related family displaying diverse intracellular and extracellular interactions. One such protein p9Ka (also known as calvasculin), or its mRNA (also known as CAPL, 42A, 18A2, mts, pEL 98), becomes elevated upon changes in the growth and differentiation of cells. Overexpression of p9Ka in benign rat mammary cells induces the metastatic phenotype. In order to help understand the role of p9Ka in these processes, the molecular properties of recombinant rat p9Ka have been studied. Recombinant p9Ka forms multimers in vitro, which are not due to intermolecular disulfide bridges, it binds 2 mol of calcium ions/mol of protein, and the binding of calcium ions is strongly antagonized by monovalent and divalent cations tested. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that p9Ka is located on cytoskeletal elements in a pattern which is identical to actin filaments stained with phalloidin. In vitro, it is shown that recombinant p9Ka binds to sites on at least two intracellular polypeptides. These sites display the same binding capacity for p9Ka in extracts of cultured rat mammary cells which show widely differing levels of expression of natural p9Ka. The results suggest that the production of p9Ka, and not of its target molecules, may be associated with the changes seen in cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561480693,"In this study, we evaluated the ability of low molecular weight manganese-based superoxide dismutase mimetics to attenuate neutrophil-mediated oxygen radical damage to human aortic endothelial cells in vitro. Human neutrophils, when exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the complement compound C5a, induced endothelial damage assessed by the release of 51Cr into the medium. This damage correlated with the amount of superoxide generated by neutrophils. Three superoxide dismutase mimetics, with catalytic rate constants for superoxide dismutation ranging from 4 to 9 x 10(7) M-1 S-1, inhibited neutrophil- or xanthine oxidase-mediated endothelial cell injury in a concentration-dependent manner. A similar manganese-based compound with no detectable superoxide dismutase activity was ineffective in inhibiting injury. Fluorescent studies of the neutrophil respiratory burst showed that the superoxide dismutase mimetics were protective without interfering with the generation of superoxide by activated neutrophils. Catalase, elastase inhibitors, and desferrioxamine mesylate (an iron chelator and hydroxyl radical scavenger) were not protective against cell injury. This investigation demonstrates that neutrophil-mediated human aortic endothelial cell injury in vitro is mediated by the superoxide anion and that low molecular weight manganese-based superoxide dismutase mimetics are effective in abrogating this damage."
https://openalex.org/W2146374465,"Synapsin II is an abundant peripheral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles that is expressed exclusively in neuronal cells. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the 5'-terminal region of the murine synapsin II gene. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analysis show that synapsin II gene transcription is initiated from a unique site. The synapsin II gene promoter contains no canonical TATA or CAAT boxes but has putative binding sites for the transcription factors Sp1, AP2, and NGFIA. This promoter is embedded in a large G+C-rich domain with characteristics of a CpG island. Transfection experiments using synapsin II-luciferase fusion genes demonstrate that the 5'-flanking sequence functions as a strong promoter in neuronal but not in nonneuronal cells. Deletion analysis reveals the presence of a neuron-specific core promoter (-79 to 153) and, upstream, two positive and one negative regulatory elements. The 5'-terminal region of the murine synapsin I gene was also cloned and sequenced. Although there is no extensive sequence homology between the 5'-flanking regions of the synapsin I and II genes, comparison analysis has identified two regions of homologous sequences, which may be involved in determining neuron specificity of the core promoters of these two genes."
https://openalex.org/W1552728236,"Thyroid hormone response elements are specific DNA sequences that allow thyroid hormone receptors to confer ligand-dependent regulation of gene expression. The response elements characterized to date have been composed of varying arrangements of multiple copies of a conserved hexameric sequence. The traditional consensus half-site of these response elements is the sequence 5‘-AGGTCA, although we have demonstrated recently that the optimal thyroid hormone receptor monomer binding site is 2 base pairs larger, 5‘-TAAGGTCA. Since other members of this family of nuclear receptors also have been shown to use varying arrangements of the traditional hexamer sequence as response elements, we examined whether the octamer sequence was specific as a thyroid hormone response element. The studies reported here demonstrate that only thyroid hormone receptors confer ligand responsiveness to a reporter gene containing a single copy of the octamer sequence as a response element and that qualitative and quantitative differences in the binding of related nuclear receptors to this sequence can account for this functional specificity. We also have shown that thyroid hormone induction from the octamer response element occurs independently of retinoid X receptors, in contrast to the induction from traditional complex thyroid hormone response elements."
https://openalex.org/W1531166371,"Escherichia coli preprotein translocase consists of the peripheral membrane protein SecA and the integral membrane domain SecY/E. SecY/E, whether isolated chromatographically or by immunoprecipitation, was found to be complex of three polypeptides, SecY, SecE, and band 1. Band 1 did not correspond to a known sec gene product. The independent purification of the separate integral membrane polypeptides needed for reconstitution of translocation yielded SecY, SecE, and a protein that we termed P12. Based on the sequence of P12, we have prepared antisera to a carboxyl-terminal peptide domain and shown that this antiserum specifically labels only P12 on immunoblots of inner membrane vesicles. We now report that affinity-purified anti-P12 antibodies specifically label the band 1 subunit of the SecY/E complex, whether the SecY/E was isolated chromatographically or by precipitation with antibodies to an epitope-tagged SecY subunit. In addition, the antiserum to P12 can specifically immunoprecipitate the full three-subunit SecY/E complex from detergent extracts. This finding completes the identification of the polypeptides that are essential for catalysis of preprotein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1510961536,"We have produced transgenic mice expressing human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) driven by the mouse metallothionein I promoter. We found that integration of the LPL gene construct was associated with a high perinatal mortality. Animals that survived the first 2 weeks of life grew normally afterwards. Compared with controls, transgenic animals had higher post-heparin plasma LPL and tissue LPL activities. Immunoreactive human LPL was detected in their post-heparin plasma but not in controls. Transgenic animals had significantly lower plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) while on a regular laboratory chow. By electron microscopic analysis and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, the size and morphology of the plasma VLDL were very similar in transgenic and control animals, which suggests that VLDL particles acted on by the increased tissue LPL in the transgenic animals were mostly taken up by the cell without being released back into circulation. The hypertriglyceridemia and elevated VLDL in response to sucrose feeding were completely abolished in transgenic animals. They also had lower VLDL lipids compared with control animals when they were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. Feeding the mother of transgenic mice a high-fat diet during pregnancy completely reversed the high perinatal mortality associated with the integrated transgene, which suggests that the deleterious effect of LPL overexpression may be related to the depletion of some essential lipid nutrient."
https://openalex.org/W1479856629,"Intracellular events within enterocytes following receptor-mediated endocytosis of intrinsic factor-cobalamin (IF-Cbl) are poorly understood. We have examined the fate of IF and Cbl in filter-grown Caco-2 cells which express both IF receptors and transcobalamin II and which transcytose Cbl. Uptake of IF-Cbl from the apical surface leads to the intracellular accumulation of Cbl in a process that reaches an equilibrium between internalization and secretion only after a 20-h continuous incubation. Transcytosed Cbl is detectable in the basolateral medium 4 h after the onset of endocytosis. Cbl is released from the basolateral surface with the same kinetics irrespective of from which cell surface endocytosis of IF-Cbl took place. Following uptake, internalized IF is degraded with a half-time of 4 h. Leupeptin causes a partial block in the proteolysis of IF, an intracellular accumulation of Cbl bound to IF, and a decrease in transcytosis of Cbl. Finally, an analysis of intracellular Cbl during transcytosis shows that free Cbl is present within cells during transcytosis."

The protease responsible for this process is encoded within the 635-amino acid open reading frame of the UL26 gene of the virus. A simple purification scheme is given in this report for the native, mature form of the protease expressed in Escherichia coli. The scheme allows the preparation of milligram quantities of purified enzyme for elucidation of kinetic mechanism as well as for structural studies. Utilizing a 13-residue peptide substrate representing the natural cleavage site that releases the protease, kcat and Km values of the purified native enzyme are 2.0 min-1 and 0.88 mM, respectively. Thus, peptide cleavage is less efficient than reported for other viral proteases. The possibility exists that viral or cellular factors are involved in vivo for activation of the protease for herpes capsid maturation."

Down-regulation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester did not affect the induction of either c-fos-beta-galactosidase or vasoactive intestinal peptide-luciferase by ciliary neurotrophic factor or leukemia inhibitory factor. In contrast, while leukemia inhibitory factor induction of choline acetyltransferase-luciferase expression was protein kinase C-independent, there appears to be both protein kinase C-dependent and -independent pathways for induction of choline acetyltransferase-luciferase by ciliary neurotrophic factor. Cotransfection of a dominant-negative mutant p21rasN17 blocked nerve growth factor-mediated induction of c-fos-beta-galactosidase, but did not affect induction of c-fos-beta-galactosidase, vasoactive intestinal peptide-luciferase, or choline acetyltransferase-luciferase by either ciliary neurotrophic factor or leukemia inhibitory factor. Thus, in contrast to the action of nerve growth factor, gene induction by ciliary neurotrophic factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor is ras-independent in IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1540147281,"Treatment of rat dorsal root ganglion cultures with 1 microM okadaic acid leads to a fragmentation of neurofilaments and a reduction in the electrophoretic mobilities of the three subunits on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Sacher, M. G., Athlan, E. S., and Mushynski, W. E. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 186, 524-530). Based on the observed response to varying concentrations of okadaic acid, fragmentation was inferred to be due to inhibition of protein phosphatase-2A activity and reduction in electrophoretic mobility to inhibition of protein phosphatase-1. Okadaic acid treatment led to an increase in amino-terminal, relative to carboxyl-terminal, domain phosphorylation in the low molecular weight (NF-L) subunit in the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The purified catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-2A dephosphorylated 32P-labeled NF-L and the middle molecular weight subunit from okadaic acid-treated cultures, whereas the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 had no effect. In the case of NF-L, phosphate moieties were preferentially removed from the amino-terminal domain. These results show that the amino-terminal domain of NF-L can be phosphorylated in situ and implicate protein phosphatase-2A in the turnover of phosphate moieties in this domain."

Chem. 265, 21629-21633). This enzyme has been purified more than 10,000-fold from Macrobdella leech. The final preparation gives a single protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the molecular mass of 84 kDa. The pI is determined to be 6.0 using isoelectric focusing. With 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-NeuAc as substrate, the pH optimum is between pH 5.5-7.0. Unlike regular sialidases, sialidase L is not inhibited by 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-NeuAc. Two of the seven tryptic peptides derived from sialidase L contain the consensus repeat S-X-D-X-G-X-T-W that has been found in the regular sialidases. Among various sialoglycoconjugates tested, sialidase L cleaves only the NeuAc alpha 2-->3Gal linkage. NeuAc alpha 2-->6Gal, NeuAc alpha 2-->6GalNAc, NeuAc alpha 2-->6GlcNAc, NeuAc alpha 2-->8-NeuAc, and NeuAc alpha 2-->9NeuAc linkages are not hydrolyzed. At pH 7.0, sialidase L and Clostridial sialidase release 46 and 92% of sialic acid, respectively, from bovine fetuin, indicating that sialidase L selectively cleaves NeuAc alpha 2-->3Gal linkages in fetuin. Sialidase L is the first sialidase found to exhibit a strict specificity toward the hydrolysis of the NeuAc alpha 2-->3Gal linkage, and it should become useful for the selective cleavage of NeuAc alpha 2-->3Gal linkages in sialoglycoconjugates without destroying other sialosyl linkages."
https://openalex.org/W1524025209,"The reductive half-reaction of milk xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) with NADH and with xanthine has been studied at pH 7.5, 25 degree C. NADH reduces XDH to the two-electron reduced form at a rate of 18 s-1, independent of NADH concentration over the range studied. Further reduction by NADH to the four-electron state is inhibited by excess NADH. Subsequent binding of NADH to the four-electron reduced form of the enzyme causes the redistribution of one electron from the flavin to the molybdenum center. The four-electron reduced species reached through reduction by NADH is the same as the species obtained upon reaction of NAD with fully reduced XDH. In contrast, xanthine rapidly reduces XDH to the four-electron level; further reduction is comparatively slow and is inhibited by excess xanthine. Studies using substoichiometric xanthine show that the reaction of XDH with 1 equivalent of xanthine involves rapid substrate binding and rapid reduction of the molybdenum center of the enzyme. Before the release of urate from the molybdenum active site, an electron is transferred at 15 s-1 from the reduced molybdenum center to one of the iron-sulfur centers of XDH. Urate is then released at a rate of 13 s-1, followed by a rapid electron redistribution within the protein. The reductive half-reaction of XDH with xanthine is rate-limiting in xanthine/NAD turnover, which appears to occur between the two- and four-electron reduced enzyme species. The reduction of XDH by substoichiometric amounts of the fluorescent substrate xanthopterin was also studied. This reaction, monitored by changes in both absorbance and fluorescence, was found to involve the formation of two molybdenum complexes (an Eox.S complex and an Ered.P complex) followed by the release of the product, leucopterin."
https://openalex.org/W1566472590,"The inherited diseases hyperkalemic periodic paralysis and paramyotonia congenita are caused by mutations in the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel gene. To determine if differences in the expression patterns of the adult and cardiac/fetal sodium channel genes could explain some clinical features of these disorders, we developed a novel mRNA quantitation strategy called quantitative multiplex fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QMF-PCR). This assay tests the relative levels of multiple mRNA species simultaneously using automated sequenators. We show validation of this method by competitive-PCR and RNase protection. Developmental studies of sodium channel mRNAs in humans and mice by QMF-PCR showed that the adult sodium channel mRNA quickly increased, while the cardiac/fetal sodium channel mRNA slowly decreased similarly in both limb and diaphragm muscle. We find that the adult sodium channel gene expression is predominant in fetal and neonatal muscle of both humans and mice: adult isoform mRNA concentration in fetal muscle was 8.4 x 10(-6) micrograms/micrograms of total RNA; cardiac/fetal isoform mRNA was 2.0 x 10(-6) micrograms/micrograms; and actin mRNA was 3.4 x 10(-3) micrograms/micrograms. Our results suggest that differential sodium channel gene expression correlates with age of onset of disease, but not with diaphragm involvement, in patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis."
https://openalex.org/W1484605081,"The purpose of this study was to test a long standing hypothesis regarding the forces that drive the assembly of intermediate filaments (IFs). The initial step of IF assembly is the formation of dimeric, alpha-helical coiled coils. On the outside of the coiled coils, charged amino acids are distributed periodically such that positively and negatively charged residues are arranged in alternating zones, 9.5/2 residues wide (Parry et al., 1977; McLachlan and Stewart, 1982). This structural feature has given rise to the hypothesis that, if neighboring coiled coils were staggered axially by an odd multiple of a charged zone, electrostatic interactions between them could provide the driving force for the assembly of higher order oligomers or filaments (Fraser et al., 1986; Parry and Steinert, 1992). Using the IF protein vimentin as a model system, we carried out deletion mutagenesis experiments to test this hypothesis. We generated mutant vimentin proteins lacking 14, 21, and 28 residues in Helix 1B of the rod domain, and analyzed their assembly properties by DNA transfection into IF null cells, in vitro assembly, and chemical cross-linking. Results from these experiments are consistent with, and support, the hypothesis that charge complementation plays a key role in the assembly and stabilization of intermediate filaments."

To investigate the functional and structural significance of the modular structure, we engineered a subunit, in which module F4 of the beta-subunit was replaced by that of the by use of mutagenesis. The NMR and resonance Raman spectra of the isolated beta alpha-subunit have revealed that it has a beta-subunit-like heme environmental structure. However, the gel chromatography and NMR spectra of mixtures of the chimera and native subunits clearly showed that the chimera beta binds specifically to the beta-subunit to form a heterotetramer, not to the alpha-subunit. These results led us to conclude that the predominant role of the module F4 is the subunit association and suggest that the modules are structural and functional units that have advantages in producing stable functional proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1591655804,"In order to study the structural details of ligand protein interactions of the human retinoid X receptor alpha (hRXR alpha), the DEF and EF domains of the receptor were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The fusion proteins were expressed at high levels and were affinity-purified by chromatography over glutathione-agarose. The DEF and EF domains were cleaved from the fusion proteins by digestion with thrombin. Retinoic acid binding was quantitated using two different methods. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and the stoichiometry of 9-cis-retinoic acid binding were performed by monitoring quenching of protein fluorescence. To directly compare the binding affinity of the E. coli-derived truncated hRXR alpha with full-length hRXR alpha expressed in transiently transfected COS cells, Scatchard analyses of [3H]9-cis-retinoic acid binding assays were performed. Both methods of analysis indicate that while the cleaved DEF peptide bound 9-cis-retinoic acid tightly, the cleaved EF peptide exhibited variable binding activity between preparations. By fluorimetric analysis, the Kd of the cleaved DEF peptide was estimated to be 3 +/- 0.5 nM with a stoichiometry of 1:1.1 +/- 0.1. By Scatchard analysis, the Kd values for [3H]9-cis-retinoic acid to the GST-hRXR alpha (DEF) peptide and the cleaved DEF peptide were estimated to be 1.8 nM and 5.6 nM, respectively. The estimated molecular mass from high speed sedimentation equilibrium experiments was 36 +/- 2 kDa for the apo-DEF peptide alone and 38 +/- 3 kDa for the holo-DEF peptide complexed with 9-cis-retinoic acid. This suggests that the recombinant ligand binding domain was predominantly in the monomer form. However, dimers of the cleaved DEF peptides were detected in chemical cross-linking experiments both in the presence and absence of 9-cis-retinoic acid. Since the purified E. coli-derived truncated hRXR alpha DEF peptide appears to fully retain its ligand binding activity, it should provide a useful model system for further structural analysis of ligand-protein interactions."

Chem. 268, 6453-6462) to investigate the relationship between mRNA structure, translation, and stability in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The stability of the cat mRNA was not influenced by changes in the length and nucleotide sequence of the 5'-leader, but was affected by the formation of stable 5'-secondary structures (> -15 kcal.mol-1). Cat mRNA stability changed only slightly when the CYC1 3'-trailer was replaced with PGK1 sequences, and was influenced by some secondary structures in the 3'-trailer. Secondary structures formed by interactions between the 5'-leader and 3'-trailer increased the stability of the cat mRNA. However, all of the cat mRNAs studied were intrinsically unstable, having half-lives between 4 and 14 min. The translatability of the cat mRNAs did not correlate with their half-life, and their decay was not blocked by cycloheximide. Therefore, the rapid degradation of the cat mRNA does not seem to depend on translational elongation and is not related in any obvious way to the rate of translational initiation. Furthermore, sequences in the 3'-trailer do not program the rapid decay of the cat mRNA. We discuss the implications of these data in the light of current models of mRNA degradation pathways."

In this study we observed that preincubation with Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A inhibited both CTL and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, okadaic acid inhibited only CTL-CMC without significantly affecting NK-CMC. Incubation of CTL and NK cells with their sensitive TC inhibited both CTL-CMC by 74% and NK-CMC by > 80%. This loss in lytic activity was accompanied by a loss of 60% and > 80% in the cellular p-nitrophenyl phosphate phosphatase (pNPPase) activity in CTL and NK cells, respectively. When treated with 100 units/ml interleukin-2 for 16-18 h at 37 degrees C, inactivated CTL and NK cells recovered 70% and 100% of their lytic activity and approximately 60% and 100% of phosphatase activity, respectively. Analysis revealed that > 80% of the pNPPase activity was associated with membrane-bound CD45, and it is this phosphatase activity that was reversibly affected by target cell-induced inactivation/reactivation of CTL and NK cells. These results suggest that Ser/Thr phosphatases and CD45 play a key role in modulating the lytic activity of effector cells exposed to sensitive target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555945794,"Taking advantage of the potent mitogenic effect exerted by insulin in human colonic cells, we used Caco-2 cells transfected with an activated (Val-12) human Haras gene or the polyoma middle T (PyMT) oncogene, a constitutive activator of pp60c-src tyrosine kinase activity, to investigate the effect of oncogenic p21ras and PyMT/pp60c-src on insulin mitogenic signaling. As compared to vector control Caco-2 cells, both oncogene-transfected cells exhibited: 1) a loss of response to insulin's stimulatory effect on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity and cell proliferation, both of which were constitutively increased; 2) a decrease in insulin receptor (IR) affinity and insulin-stimulated exogenous tyrosine kinase activity, which resulted from increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity (Delage, S., Chastre, E., Empereur, S., Wicek, D., Veissiere, D., Capeau, J., Gespach, C., and Cherqui, G. (1993) Cancer Res. 53, 2762-2770), since IR alterations were corrected by PKC down-regulation; and 3) a decrease in both IR mRNA level and IR number, which was independent of PKC since it persisted after PKC down-regulation. In conclusion, this is the first evidence that oncogenic p21ras and PyMT/pp60c-src abolish insulin mitogenic signaling in human colonic cells through mechanisms involving (i) constitutive activation of MAP kinase and (ii) marked decreases in both IR function and expression which are mediated by PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1581142815,"Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells deficient in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) activity are impaired in chemically induced differentiation (Pilz, R. B., Eigenthaler, M., and Boss, G. R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16161-16167). We identified by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis two low molecular weight proteins (referred to as pp 21-1 and 21-2) that were phosphorylated when parental MEL cells, but not A-kinase-deficient MEL cells, were treated with the membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP. We showed that pp 21-1 and 21-2: (a) were direct A-kinase substrates; (b) bound GTP; and (c) belonged to the ras superfamily of proteins. The only ras-related proteins that are clearly A-kinase substrates both in vitro and in vivo are Rap 1A and 1B while H- and K-Ras can be A-kinase substrates in vitro; we showed by immunological methods, phosphopeptide mapping, and migration on two-dimensional gels that pp 21-1 and 21-2 were not identical to one of these four proteins. We found a 3-fold increase of 32PO4 incorporation into pp 21-2 in hexamethylene bisacetamide-treated parental MEL cells which was not secondary to an increase in pp 21-2 protein but appeared secondary to increased phosphorylation of pp 21-2 by A-kinase. Thus, pp 21-1 and 21-2 are either new ras-related proteins or are previously identified ras-related proteins not known to be A-kinase substrates, and increased phosphorylation of pp 21-2 occurs during differentiation of MEL cells."
https://openalex.org/W1586519409,"Transcription of the Acanthamoeba tbp gene is stimulated by a cis-acting promoter element that is bound by an activator protein, TATA-binding protein promoter binding factor (TPBF). Here, we report the complete purification of TPBF and describe its transcription activating and DNA-binding properties. TPBF contains two polypeptides with molecular weights of 51,000 and 50,000, whereas the native molecular weight of TPBF suggests it is dimeric or trimeric in solution. Phosphatase treatment of TPBF converts the 51,000 molecular weight species to the 50,000 molecular weight form, demonstrating that TPBF is phosphorylated. Phosphorylation reduces DNA binding by TPBF, as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays after phosphatase treatment. TPBF makes numerous contacts with the bases and phosphate backbone of its DNA recognition element, and the pattern of these contacts suggests that it is a novel type of DNA-binding protein. TPBF can bind to additional, low affinity sites within the TBP gene promoter, suggesting that, in addition to positive activation of tbp gene expression, TPBF could also inhibit transcription by competing for binding sites for other proteins within the TBP promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1492430186,"In order to identify a possible enhancer-like regulatory sequence for the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) gene, various DNA segments in the 5'-flanking region were ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene driven by the tPA gene promoter, and their CAT enhancing activities were measured following transfection to human melanoma-derived Bowes cells that highly express the gene. Major and minor activities were detected in two adjacent upstream sequences, 160 base pairs (bp) (-2288 to -2129) and 102 bp (-2390 to -2289), respectively, and the former was subjected to further analysis. The CAT enhancing activity of the 160-bp sequence was greatly affected by its position and orientation in the constructs and the sequence also functioned weakly with the SV40 promoter. Deletion of any small portion from the sequence abolished the CAT enhancing activity, suggesting that the entire sequence is required for the activity. This sequence did not show a further CAT enhancing activity in Bowes cells treated with the inducers phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate and dexamethasone and did not function in HeLa or HT1080 cells under any conditions. Taken together, the 160-bp sequence is likely to be responsible for the constitutive and/or cell type-specific expression of the tPA gene in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588994875,"The complex of benzylsuccinic acid with thermolysin has been redetermined at 1.7-A resolution and refined to a crystallographic residual of 15.7%. In contrast to the prior study, which was to 2.3-A resolution, and without the benefit of refinement (Bolognesi, M. C. and Matthews, B. W. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 634-639), the present analysis shows that it is the D- rather than the L-isomer of benzylsuccinic acid that binds. The stereochemistry of the zinc-carboxylate interaction is now seen to be syn, as is also observed in all known zinc-carboxylate complexes of both thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A. The mode of binding of the beta-carboxylate resembles the presumed geometry of the tetrahedral transition state and, as such, is consistent with the commonly accepted mechanism of action of thermolysin and of carboxypeptidase A."
