https://openalex.org/W1644749979,"Cellular functions, such as signal transmission, are carried out by 'modules' made up of many species of interacting molecules. Understanding how modules work has depended on combining phenomenological analysis with molecular studies. General principles that govern the structure and behaviour of modules may be discovered with help from synthetic sciences such as engineering and computer science, from stronger interactions between experiment and theory in cell biology, and from an appreciation of evolutionary constraints."

https://openalex.org/W4238878907,"Nanoscale electromechanical systems-nanotweezers-based on carbon nanotubes have been developed for manipulation and interrogation of nanostructures. Electrically conducting and mechanically robust carbon nanotubes were attached to independent electrodes fabricated on pulled glass micropipettes. Voltages applied to the electrodes closed and opened the free ends of the nanotubes, and this electromechanical response was simulated quantitatively using known nanotweezer structure and nanotube properties. The mechanical capabilities of the nanotweezers were demonstrated by grabbing and manipulating submicron clusters and nanowires. The conducting nanotube arms of the tweezers were also used for measuring the electrical properties of silicon carbide nanoclusters and gallium arsenide nanowires."

Global transposon mutagenesis was used to identify nonessential genes in an effort to learn whether the naturally occurring gene complement is a true minimal genome under laboratory growth conditions. The positions of 2209 transposon insertions in the completely sequenced genomes of M. genitalium and its close relative M. pneumoniae were determined by sequencing across the junction of the transposon and the genomic DNA. These junctions defined 1354 distinct sites of insertion that were not lethal. The analysis suggests that 265 to 350 of the 480 protein-coding genes of M. genitalium are essential under laboratory growth conditions, including about 100 genes of unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W2044098624,"Natural antibodies are often dismissed from immunological analysis as ""background,"" but they may play an important role in conferring immunity against infections. In antibody-free mice infected with various viruses or with Listeria monocytogenes, viral or bacterial titers in peripheral organs, including the kidney and brain, were 10 to 100 times greater than in antibody-competent mice (and enhanced their susceptibility to some infections), and titers in secondary lymphoid organs were 10 to 100 times lower than in antibody-competent mice. Thus, natural antibodies play a crucial role by preventing pathogen dissemination to vital organs and by improving immunogenicity through enhanced antigen-trapping in secondary lymphoid organs."

https://openalex.org/W1980051345,"During the 1997-98 El Nino, the equatorial Pacific Ocean retained 0. 7 x 10(15) grams of carbon that normally would have been lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The surface ocean became impoverished in plant nutrients, and chlorophyll concentrations were the lowest on record. A dramatic recovery occurred in mid-1998, the system became highly productive, analogous to coastal environments, and carbon dioxide flux out of the ocean was again high. The spatial extent of the phytoplankton bloom that followed recovery from El Nino was the largest ever observed for the equatorial Pacific. These chemical and ecological perturbations were linked to changes in the upwelling of nutrient-enriched waters. The description and explanation of these dynamic changes would not have been possible without an observing system that combines biological, chemical, and physical sensors on moorings with remote sensing of chlorophyll."

https://openalex.org/W2053283145,"Metamorphosis is an integrated set of developmental processes controlled by a transcriptional hierarchy that coordinates the action of hundreds of genes. In order to identify and analyze the expression of these genes, high-density DNA microarrays containing several thousand Drosophila melanogaster gene sequences were constructed. Many differentially expressed genes can be assigned to developmental pathways known to be active during metamorphosis, whereas others can be assigned to pathways not previously associated with metamorphosis. Additionally, many genes of unknown function were identified that may be involved in the control and execution of metamorphosis. The utility of this genome-based approach is demonstrated for studying a set of complex biological processes in a multicellular organism."
https://openalex.org/W2055729102,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent familial cancer syndrome resulting from germ line mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Hallmark features of the disease are the development of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas), which can progress to malignancy. Unlike humans, mice that are heterozygous for a mutation in Nf1 do not develop neurofibromas. However, as described here, chimeric mice composed in part of Nf1-/- cells do, which demonstrates that loss of the wild-type Nf1 allele is rate-limiting in tumor formation. In addition, mice that carry linked germ line mutations in Nf1 and p53 develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which supports a cooperative and causal role for p53 mutations in MPNST development. These two mouse models provide the means to address fundamental aspects of disease development and to test therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1981013532,"Human corneal equivalents comprising the three main layers of the cornea (epithelium, stroma, and endothelium) were constructed. Each cellular layer was fabricated from immortalized human corneal cells that were screened for use on the basis of morphological, biochemical, and electrophysiological similarity to their natural counterparts. The resulting corneal equivalents mimicked human corneas in key physical and physiological functions, including morphology, biochemical marker expression, transparency, ion and fluid transport, and gene expression. Morphological and functional equivalents to human corneas that can be produced in vitro have immediate applications in toxicity and drug efficacy testing, and form the basis for future development of implantable tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2122206933,"Data from ice 3590 meters below Vostok Station indicate that the ice was accreted from liquid water associated with Lake Vostok. Microbes were observed at concentrations ranging from 2.8 x 10(3) to 3.6 x 10(4) cells per milliliter; no biological incorporation of selected organic substrates or bicarbonate was detected. Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA genes revealed low diversity in the gene population. The phylotypes were closely related to extant members of the alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria and the Actinomycetes. Extrapolation of the data from accretion ice to Lake Vostok implies that Lake Vostok may support a microbial population, despite more than 10(6) years of isolation from the atmosphere."

The contact altitude is close to an equipotential line, the topography is smoother at all scales below the contact than above it, the volume enclosed by this contact is within the range of estimates of available water on Mars, and a series of extensive terraces parallel the contact in many places."
https://openalex.org/W2000690172,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin. Mutations that activate the protooncogene ras, such as loss of Nf1, cooperate with inactivating mutations at the p53 tumor suppressor gene during malignant transformation. One hundred percent of mice harboring null Nf1 and p53 alleles in cis synergize to develop soft tissue sarcomas between 3 and 7 months of age. These sarcomas exhibit loss of heterozygosity at both gene loci and express phenotypic traits characteristic of neural crest derivatives and human NF1 malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1486644147,"Homocysteine thiolactone, a cyclic thioester, is synthesized by certain aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in editing or proofreading reactions that prevent translational incorporation of homocysteine into proteins. Although homocysteine thiolactone is expected to acylate amino groups in proteins, virtually nothing is known regarding reactivity of the thiolactone. Here it is shown that reactions of the thiolactone with protein lysine residues were robust under physiological conditions. In human serum incubated with homocysteine thiolactone, protein homocysteinylation was a major reaction that could be observed with as little as 10 nM thiolactone. Individual proteins were homocysteinylated at rates proportional to their lysine contents. Homocysteinylation led to protein damage, manifested as multimerization and precipitation of extensively modified proteins. Model enzymes, such as methionyl-tRNA synthetase and trypsin, were inactivated by homocysteinylation. Metabolic conversion of homocysteine to the thiolactone, protein homocysteinylation, and resulting protein damage may underlie involvement of Hcy in the pathology of vascular disease.-Jakubowski, H.

https://openalex.org/W2162285399,"Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant family of Bornean canopy trees, display the unusual reproductive strategy of strict interspecific mast-fruiting. During 1986-99, more than 50 dipterocarp species dispersed seed only within a 1- to 2-month period every 3 to 4 years during El Nino-Southern Oscillation events. Synchronous seed production occurred across extensive areas and was essential for satiating seed predators. Logging of dipterocarps reduced the extent and intensity of these reproductive episodes and exacerbated local El Nino conditions. Viable seed and seedling establishment have declined as a result of climate, logging, and predators. Since 1991, dipterocarps have experienced recruitment failure within a national park, now surrounded by logged forest."
https://openalex.org/W1981099026,"Analysis of a portion of Vostok ice core number 5G, which is thought to contain frozen water derived from Lake Vostok, Antarctica (a body of liquid water located beneath about 4 kilometers of glacial ice), revealed between 2 x 10(2) and 3 x 10(2) bacterial cells per milliliter and low concentrations of potential growth nutrients. Lipopolysaccharide (a Gram-negative bacterial cell biomarker) was also detected at concentrations consistent with the cell enumeration data, which suggests a predominance of Gram-negative bacteria. At least a portion of the microbial assemblage was viable, as determined by the respiration of carbon-14-labeled acetate and glucose substrates during incubations at 3 degrees C and 1 atmosphere. These accreted ice data suggest that Lake Vostok may contain viable microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W1939092506,"Aggregates of β-amyloid peptide (βAP), the main constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brain, kill neurons by a not yet defined mechanism, leading to apoptotic death. Here, we report that both full-length βAP(j_40) or (1–42) and its active fragment βAP(25_35) act as proliferative signals for differentiated cortical neurons, driving them into the cell cycle. The cycle followed some of the steps observed in proliferating cells, including induction of cyclin Di, phosphorylation of retinoblastoma, and induction of cyclin E and A, but did not progress beyond S phase. Inactivation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase-4 or -2 prevented both the entry into S phase and the development of apoptosis in βAP(25_35)-treated neurons. We conclude that neurons must cross the G1/S transition before succumbing to βAP signaling, and therefore multiple steps within this pathway may be targets for neuroprotective agents.—Copani, A., Condorelli, F., Caruso, A., Vancheri, C., Sala, A., Giuffrida Stella, A.

https://openalex.org/W2049556064,"Isotope studies show that the Vostok ice core consists of ice refrozen from Lake Vostok water, from 3539 meters below the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet to its bottom at about 3750 meters. Additional evidence comes from the total gas content, crystal size, and electrical conductivity of the ice. The Vostok site is a likely place for water freezing at the lake-ice interface, because this interface occurs at a higher level here than anywhere else above the lake. Isotopic data suggest that subglacial Lake Vostok is an open system with an efficient circulation of water that was formed during periods that were slightly warmer than those of the past 420,000 years. Lake ice recovered by deep drilling is of interest for preliminary investigations of lake chemistry and bedrock properties and for the search for indigenous lake microorganisms. This latter aspect is of potential importance for the exploration of icy planets and moons."
https://openalex.org/W2113053506,"Tubby-like proteins (TULPs) are found in a broad range of multicellular organisms. In mammals, genetic mutation of tubby or other TULPs can result in one or more of three disease phenotypes: obesity (from which the name “tubby” is derived), retinal degeneration, and hearing loss. These disease phenotypes indicate a vital role for tubby proteins; however, no biochemical function has yet been ascribed to any member of this protein family. A structure-directed approach was employed to investigate the biological function of these proteins. The crystal structure of the core domain from mouse tubby was determined at a resolution of 1.9 angstroms. From primarily structural clues, experiments were devised, the results of which suggest that TULPs are a unique family of bipartite transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1576968639,"Interleukin-18 (IL-18), also called interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducing factor, has recently been characterized as a potent IFN-gamma-inducing cytokine. We now report that IL-18 is a novel antiangiogenic and antitumor cytokine. In vitro, IL-18 specifically inhibits fibroblast growth factor-2-stimulated proliferation of capillary endothelial cells. In vivo, IL-18 is sufficiently potent to suppress the fibroblast growth factor-induced corneal neovascularization by systemic administration in mice. This cytokine also inhibits embryonic angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Systemic and intralesional administrations of IL-18 produce a significant suppression of the growth of murine T241 fibrosarcoma in syngeneic C57Bl6/J and immunodeficient SCID mice. The antitumor effect appears to be potent because an average of >75% inhibition of primary tumor growth was observed at a dose of 50 microg/kg/day. In cell culture, murine T241 fibrosarcoma cells are insensitive to recombinant IL-18 at concentrations that significantly inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. Immunohistochemical studies of tumor tissues reveal hypovascularization of the IL-18-treated tumors. These results suggest that IL-18 may participate in the regulation of a switch of tumor angiogenesis.-Cao, R., Farnebo, J., Kurimoto, M., Cao, Y. Interleukin-18 acts as an angiogenesis and tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1926705561,"The goal of this work was to improve the potential of fibrin to promote nerve regeneration by enzymatically incorporating exogenous neurite-promoting heparin-binding peptides. The effects on neurite extension of four different heparin-binding peptides, derived from the heparin-binding domains of antithrombin III, neural cell adhesion molecule and platelet factor 4, were determined. These exogenous peptides were synthesized as bi-domain peptide chimeras, with the second domain being a substrate for factor XIIIa. This coagulation transglutaminase covalently bound the peptides within the fibrin gel during coagulation. The heparin-binding peptides enhanced the degree of neurite extension from embryonic chick dorsal root ganglia through 3-dimensional fibrin gels, and the extent of enhancement was found to correlate positively with the heparin-binding affinity of the individual domains. The enhancement could be inhibited by competition with soluble heparin, by degradation of cell-surface proteoglycans, and by inhibition of the covalent immobilization of the peptide. These results demonstrate an important potential role for proteoglycan-binding components of the extracellular matrix in neurite extension and suggest that fibrin gels modified with covalently bound heparin-binding peptides could serve as a therapeutic agent to enhance peripheral nerve regeneration through nerve guide tubes. More generally, the results demonstrate that the biological responses to fibrin, the body's natural wound healing matrix, can be dramatically improved by the addition of exogenous bioactive peptides in a manner such that they become immobilized during coagulation.-Sakiyama, S. E., Schense, J. C., Hubbell, J. A. Incorporation of heparin-binding peptides into fibrin gels enhances neurite extension: an example of designer matrices in tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2080763985,"Subsets of murine CD4+ T cells localize to different areas of the spleen after adoptive transfer. Naïve and T helper 1 (TH1) cells, which express the chemokine receptor CCR7, are home to the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath, whereas activated TH2 cells, which lack CCR7, form rings at the periphery of the T cell zones near B cell follicles. Retroviral transduction of TH2 cells with CCR7 forces them to localize in a TH1-like pattern and inhibits their participation in B cell help in vivo but not in vitro. Thus, differential expression of chemokine receptors results in unique cellular migration patterns that are important for effective immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2124007511,"In vitro PA28 binds and activates proteasomes. It is shown here that mice with a disrupted PA28b gene lack PA28a and PA28b polypeptides, demonstrating that PA28 functions as a hetero-oligomer in vivo. Processing of antigenic epitopes derived from exogenous or endogenous antigens is altered in PA28-/- mice. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses are impaired, and assembly of immunoproteasomes is greatly inhibited in mice lacking PA28. These results show that PA28 is necessary for immunoproteasome assembly and is required for efficient antigen processing, thus demonstrating the importance of PA28-mediated proteasome function in immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1886154307,"We examined the gene and protein expression of IRS 1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) in adipocytes from two groups of healthy individuals with an increased propensity for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): those with two first-degree relatives with diabetes and another group with massive obesity. A low expression of IRS 1(<50% of the matched control group) was seen in «30% of both groups and these individuals were characterized by insulin resistance and its hallmarks: higher levels of insulin, glucose, and triglycerides. Two individuals with previously unknown NIDDM were diagnosed and both had low IRS 1 expression. Low IRS 1 protein expression was associated with low mRNA levels but not with the common Gly972Arg polymorphism of the IRS 1 gene. Taken together, our present and previous findings show that a low expression of IRS 1 in fat cells predicts insulin resistance and NIDDM. Furthermore, they support the likelihood that an impaired transcriptional activation may play a key role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM.—Carvalho, E., Jansson, P.-A., Axelsen, M., Eriksson, J.

Here the structures of human TFIID and the TFIID-IIA-IIB complex that were obtained by electron microscopy and image analysis to 35 angstrom resolution are presented. TFIID is a trilobed, horseshoe-shaped structure, with TFIIA and TFIIB bound on opposite lobes and flanking a central cavity.

https://openalex.org/W1748935412,"Id proteins act as negative regulators of bHLH transcription factors by forming transcriptionally inactive protein complexes. The proposed function of these proteins includes promotion of cell growth and cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of cellular differentiation. We investigated the role of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway in the degradation of the Id3 protein. We found Id3 to be a short-lived protein and estimated the half-life to be approximately 20 min in 293 cells. Using specific inhibitors of the 26S proteasome and mutant fibroblast cells with a temperature-sensitive defect in the essential E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, we show that Id3 and the related Id1 and Id2 proteins are degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We found the Id4 protein to be much less sensitive to inhibitors of the 26S proteasome, but its degradation was dependent on the E1 enzyme. In addition, we observed that coexpression of the bHLH protein E47 with Id3 significantly reduced the rate of degradation of Id3, suggesting that Id3 is less susceptible to degradation by the 26S proteasome when complexed to a bHLH protein. -Bounpheng, M.

The structures of TFIID and TFTC have been determined at 3.5-nanometer resolution by electron microscopy and digital image analysis of single particles. Human TFIID resembles a macromolecular clamp that contains four globular domains organized around a solvent-accessible groove of a size suitable to bind DNA. TFTC is larger and contains five domains, four of which are similar to TFIID."
https://openalex.org/W1868324460,"We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of an autonomous nuclear polyphosphoinositide cycle that generates second messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG), capable of attracting to the nucleus specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (Neri et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 29738–29744). Recently, however, nuclei have also been shown to contain the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the non-canonical 3-phosphorylated inositides. To clarify a possible role of this peculiar class of inositol lipids we have examined the question of whether nerve growth factor (NGF) induces PKC-ζ nuclear translocation in PC12 cells and whether this translocation is dependent on nuclear phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) activityand its product, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]. NGF increased both the amount and the enzyme activity of immunoprecipitable PI 3-K in PC12 cell nuclei. Activation of the enzyme, but not its translocation, was blocked by PI 3-K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Treatment of PC12 cells for 9 min with NGF led to an increase in the nuclear levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Maximal translocation of PKC-ζ from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (as evaluated by immunoblotting, enzyme activity, and confocal microscopy) occurred after 12 min of exposure to NGF and was completely abrogated by either wortmannin or LY294002. In contrast, these two inhibitors did not block nuclear translocation of the conventional, DAG-sensitive, PKC-α. On the other hand, the specific phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C inhibitor, 1-O-octadeyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, was unable to abrogate nuclear translocation of the DAG-insensitive PKC-ζ. These data suggest that a nuclear increase in PI 3-K activity and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production are necessary for the subsequent nuclear translocation of PKC-ζ. Furthermore, they point to the likelihood that PKC-ζ is a putative nuclear downstream target of PI 3-K during NGF-promoted neural differentiation.—Neri, L. M., Martelli, A. M., Borgatti, P., Colamussi, M. L., Marchisio, M., Capitani, S. Increase in nuclear phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate synthesis precede PKC-ζ translocation to the nucleus of NGF-treated PC12 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1868834139,"Recent identification in bone of transporters, receptors, and components of synaptic signaling suggests a role for glutamate in the skeleton. We investigated effects of glutamate and its antagonist MK801 on osteoclasts in vitro. Glutamate applied to patch clamped osteoclasts induced significant increases in whole-cell membrane currents (P<0.01) in the presence of the coagonist glycine. Agonist-elicited currents were significantly decreased after application of MK801 (100 microM, P<0.01), but MK801 had no effect on actin ring formation necessary for osteoclast polarization, attachment, and resorption. In cocultures of bone marrow cells and osteoblasts in which osteoclasts develop, MK801 inhibited osteoclast differentiation and reduced resorption of pits in dentine (3 to 100 microM; P<0.001). MK801 added early in the culture (for as little as 2-4 days) was as effective as addition for the entire culture period. Addition of MK801 for any time after day 7 of culture was ineffective in reducing osteoclast activity. Using rat and rabbit mature osteoclasts cultured on dentine or explants of mouse calvariae prelabeled with (45)Ca, we could not detect significant effects of MK801 on osteoclastic resorption. These data show clearly that glutamate receptor function is critical during osteoclastogenesis and suggest that glutamate is less important in regulating mature osteoclast activity.-Peet, N.

https://openalex.org/W1937457543,"Although it is established that growth factors and prostaglandins function in the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity and in the healing of gastric mucosal injury and ulceration, the regulatory relationship between growth factors and prostaglandins in the gastric mucosa is not well characterized. Therefore, we investigated whether hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) affects expression of COX-2 (the inducible form of the prostaglandin synthesizing enzyme, cyclooxygenase) in gastric epithelial cells and whether this action is mediated through the MAP (ERK) kinase signaling pathway. In RGM1 cells (an epithelial cell line derived from normal rat gastric mucosa), HGF caused an increase in COX-2 mRNA and protein by 236% and 175%, respectively (both P<0.05). This induction of COX-2 expression was abolished by pretreatment with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059. HGF also triggered a 13-fold increase in c-Met/HGF receptor phosphorylation (P<0.005) and increased ERK2 activity by 684% (P<0.01). Pretreatment with PD98059 abolished the HGF-induced increase in ERK2 activity, but not c-Met/HGF receptor phosphorylation. The specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB203580, had no effect on HGF-induced COX-2 expression. Thus, HGF triggers activation of the COX-2 gene in gastric epithelial cells through phosphorylation of c-Met/HGF receptor and activation of the ERK2 signaling pathway.-Jones, M.

https://openalex.org/W1737562486,"Nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP have been implicated in many neuronal functions, including regulation of gene expression, but little is known about the downstream targets of NO/cGMP in the nervous system. We found that type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase), which is widely expressed in the brain, mediated NO- and cGMP-induced activation of the fos promoter in cells of neuronal and glial origin; the enzyme was ineffective in regulating gene expression in fibroblast-like cells. The effect of G-kinase II on gene expression did not require calcium uptake but was synergistically enhanced by calcium. G-kinase II was membrane associated and did not translocate to the nucleus; however, a soluble G-kinase II mutant translocated to the nucleus and regulated gene expression in fibroblast-like cells. Soluble G-kinase I also regulates fos promoter activity, but membrane targeting of G-kinase I prevented the enzyme from translocating to the nucleus and regulating transcription in multiple cell types, including glioma cells; this suggests that cell type-specific factor(s) that mediate the transcriptional effects of extranuclear G-kinase II are not regulated by G-kinase I. Our results suggest that G-kinase I and II control gene expression by different mechanisms and that NO effects on neuronal plasticity may involve G-kinase II regulation of gene expression.-Gudi, T., Hong, G.

https://openalex.org/W1871366524,"The effect of increasing dietary intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and vitamin E on indices of oxidative DNA damage was investigated. Twenty-one healthy male, nonsmokers aged 28.9 +/- 1.3 years participated in a free-living, split plot/change over trial in which half the volunteers consumed diets containing 5% PUFA as food energy for 4 wk and, after a 10 wk washout period, consumed a 15% PUFA diet for another 4 wk. The other volunteers followed an identical protocol, except that they consumed the 15% PUFA diet first. The diets were provided to volunteers either with or without an additional 80 mg dalpha-tocopherol acetate/day; otherwise total fat, carbohydrates, protein, and basal vitamin E contents remained unchanged. DNA damage induced by 200 microM H(2)O(2) in lymphocytes from volunteers as well as endogenous DNA damage in the form of oxidized pyrimidines, measured by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay), significantly decreased after consumption of the 5% PUFA diet (P<0.001 and P=0.01, respectively), but significantly increased after consumption of the 15% PUFA diet when alpha-tocopherol levels were in the range of 5-7 mg/day (P=0. 008 and P=0.03, respectively). These changes were abolished by an additional 80 mg dalpha-tocopherol/day. This study indicates that increasing dietary levels of PUFA to 15% may adversely affect some indices of DNA stability. However, increasing the dietary intake of vitamin E by 80 mg/day ameliorates the damaging effects of PUFA. -Jenkinson, A. McE., Collins, A. R., Duthie, S. J., Wahle, K. W. J., Duthie, G. G.

It is surprising that amino acid sequence analysis of pig pp700 revealed homology to AHNAK-encoded protein, which was originally identified in human cell lines of neural crest origin as 700-kDa phosphoprotein. Cardiac AHNAK expression was assessed on mRNA level by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sequence-directed antibodies raised against human AHNAK recognized pp700 in immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments, confirming the homology between both proteins. Anti-AHNAK antibodies labeled preferentially the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes in cryosections of rat cardiac tissue and isolated cardiomyocytes. Sarcolemmal pp700/AHNAK localization was not influenced by stimulation of either the PKA or the protein kinase C pathway. In back-phosphorylation studies with cardiac biopsies, we identified distinct pp700 pools. The membrane-associated fraction of pp700 underwent substantial in vivo phosphorylation on beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation by isoproterenol, whereas the cytoplasmic fraction of pp700 was not accessible to endogenous PKA. It is important that in vivo phosphorylation occurred in that pp700 fraction which coprecipitated with the calcium channel beta subunit. We hypothesize that both phosphorylation of pp700 and its coupling to the beta subunit play a physiological role in cardiac beta-adrenergic signal transduction.

https://openalex.org/W1941053972,"To determine the role of GLUT4 on postexercise glucose transport and glycogen resynthesis in skeletal muscle, GLUT4-deficient and wild-type mice were studied aftera3h swim exercise. In wild-type mice, insulin and swimming each increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake by twofold in extensor digitorum longus muscle. In contrast, insulin did not increase 2-deoxyglucose glucose uptake in muscle from GLUT4-null mice. Swimming increased glucose transport twofold in muscle from fed GLUT4-null mice, with no effect noted in fasted GLUT4-null mice. This exercise-associated 2-deoxyglucose glucose uptake was not accompanied by increased cell surface GLUT1 content. Glucose transport in GLUT4-null muscle was increased 1.6-fold over basal levels after electrical stimulation. Contraction-induced glucose transport activity was fourfold greater in wild-type vs. GLUT4-null muscle. Glycogen content in gastrocnemius muscle was similar between wild-type and GLUT4-null mice and was reduced ~50% after exercise. After 5 h carbohydrate refeeding, muscle glycogen content was fully restored in wild-type, with no change in GLUT4-null mice. After 24 h carbohydrate refeeding, muscle glycogen in GLUT4-null mice was restored to fed levels. In conclusion, GLUT4 is the major transporter responsible for exercise-induced glucose transport. Also, postexercise glycogen resynthesis in muscle was greatly delayed; unlike wild-type mice, glycogen supercompensation was not found. GLUT4 it is not essential for glycogen repletion since muscle glycogen levels in previously exercised GLUT4-null mice were totally restored after 24 h carbohydrate refeeding.—Ryder, J.

The strain rise times of the events range from tens to thousands of seconds, and the seismic moment scales with the square root of the rise time. This scaling law contrasts with the conservative assumption of constant rupture velocity in fault modeling but is consistent with the occurrence of a slow rupture propagation analogous to heat diffusion in a slab."
https://openalex.org/W1660176836,"Hereditary tyrosinemia type I is the most severe metabolic disease of the tyrosine catabolic pathway mainly affecting the liver. It is caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, which prevents degradation of the toxic metabolite fumarylacetoacetate (FAA). We report here that FAA induces common effects (i.e., cell cycle arrest and apoptosis) in both human (HepG2) and rodent (Chinese hamster V79) cells, effects that seem to be temporally related. Both the antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities of FAA are dose dependent and enhanced by glutathione (GSH) depletion with L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO). Short treatment (2 h) with 35 microM FAA/+BSO or 100 microM FAA/-BSO induced a transient cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition (20% and 37%, respectively) 24 h post-treatment. In cells treated with 100 microM FAA/-BSO, an inactivation, followed by a rapid over-induction of cyclin B-dependent kinase occurred, which peaked 24 h post-treatment. Maximum levels of caspase-1 and caspase-3 activation were detected at 3 h and 32 h, respectively, whereas release of mitochondrial cytochrome c was maximal at 24-32 h post-treatment. The G2/M peak declined 24 h later, concomitantly with the appearance of a sub-G1, apoptotic population showing typical nucleosomal-sized DNA fragmentation and reduced mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsi(m)). These events were prevented by the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, whereas G2/M arrest and subsequent apoptosis were abolished by GSH-monoethylester or N-acetylcysteine. Other tyrosine metabolites, maleylacetoacetate and succinylacetone, had no antiproliferative effects and induced only very low levels of apoptosis. These results suggest a modulator role of GSH in FAA-induced cell cycle disturbance and apoptosis where activation of cyclin B-dependent kinase and caspase-1 are early events preceding mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and Deltapsi(m) loss. -Jorquera, R., Tanguay, R.

https://openalex.org/W2159162955,"Annexin I is an intracellular protein in search of a function. Ex vivo it has calcium- and phospholipid-binding properties. To evaluate its role in vivo, MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with annexin I in sense or antisense orientations. In cells overexpressing annexin I, calcium release was abrogated on stimulation of purinergic or bradykinin receptors, whereas non-transfected cells or cells with down-regulated annexin I released calcium within seconds. Basal calcium and calcium stores were not affected. The impaired calcium release was paralleled by a down-regulation of the activities of phospholipase C, group II phospholipase A2, and E-cadherin with altered adhesion and enhanced tumor growth on soft agar. Significantly smaller tumors, with the histologically most differentiated cells, were observed in nude mice inoculated with cells transfected with the antisense rather than with the sense plasmid. These observations indicate that annexin I modulates cell functions by controlling intracellular calcium release. Frey, B. M., Reber, B. F. X., Vishwanath, B. S., Escher, G., Frey, F. J.

https://openalex.org/W1520568416,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly immunotropic human herpesvirus with oncogenic potential and is involved in numerous pathologies. EBV utilizes its major envelope glycoprotein gp350 to bind to its receptor CR2/CD21 on target cells for initiating the infection. We have previously shown that EBV is able to modulate transcription and translation of a number of cytokine genes via its gp350-mediated binding to this receptor. However, the effects of the binding of purified gp350 to CR2/CD21 on plastic-adherent monocyte-macro-phages (AMM) have not been investigated. These cells are a rich source of potent proinflammatory and immune-modulating cytokines, and express low levels of CR2/CD21. We show here for the first time that recombinant gp350 (rgp350) causes production of the potent proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 β in human AMM. Surprisingly, rgp350 is comparable in this capacity to the phorbol ester 12–0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. This induction of IL-1 β production was accompanied by increased steady-state levels of its mRNA in gp350-treated AMM, and was dependent on the specific binding of rgp350 to the EBV receptor CR2/CD21. We also show that the signaling pathways resulting in the induction of IL-1 β synthesis by rgp350 required protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate kinase activities and occurred via activation of the NF-κB family of transcription factors.—D’Addario, M., Ahmad, A., Xu, J.

https://openalex.org/W1873110547,"In non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is impaired in muscle, contributing in a major way to development of hyperglycemia. We previously showed that expression of the glucose phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase (GK) in cultured human myocytes improved glucose storage and disposal, suggesting that GK delivery to muscle in situ could potentially enhance glucose clearance. Here we have tested this idea directly by intramuscular delivery of an adenovirus containing the liver GK cDNA (AdCMV-GKL) into one hind limb. We injected an adenovirus containing the beta-galactosidase gene (AdCMV-lacZ) into the hind limb of newborn rats. beta-Galactosidase activity was localized in muscle for as long as 1 month after delivery, with a large percentage of fibers staining positive in the gastrocnemius. Using the same approach with AdCMV-GKL, GK protein content was increased from zero to 50-400% of the GK in normal liver sample, and total glucose phosphorylating activity was increased in GK-expressing muscles relative to the counterpart uninfected muscle. Expression of GK in muscle improved glucose tolerance rather than changing basal glycemic control. Glucose levels were reduced by approximately 35% 10 min after administration of a glucose bolus to fed animals treated with AdCMV-GKL relative to AdCMV-lacZ-treated controls. The enhanced rate of glucose clearance was reflected in increases in muscle 2-deoxy glucose uptake and blood lactate levels. We conclude that restricted expression of GK in muscle leads to an enhanced capacity for muscle glucose disposal and whole body glucose tolerance under conditions of maximal glucose-insulin stimulation, suggesting that under these conditions glucose phosphorylation becomes rate-limiting. Our findings also show that gene delivery to a fraction of the whole body is sufficient to improve glucose disposal, providing a rationale for the development of new therapeutic strategies for treatment of diabetes.-Jiménez-Chillarón, J.

https://openalex.org/W1572842835,"CD38 displays lateral association with the HIV-1 receptor CD4. This association is potentiated by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. The aim of this work was to evaluate the CD38 role in T cell susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Using laboratory X4 HIV-1 strains and X4 and X4/R5 primary isolates, we found that CD38 expression was negatively correlated to cell susceptibility to infection, evaluated as percentage of infected cells, release of HIV p24 in the supernatants, and cytopathogenicity. This correlation was at first suggested by results obtained in a panel of human CD4+ T cell lines expressing different CD38 levels (MT-4, MT-2, C8166, CEMx174, Supt-1, and H9) and then demonstrated using CD38 transfectants of MT-4 cells (the line with the lowest CD38 expression). To address whether CD38 affected viral binding, we used mouse T cells that are non-permissive for productive infection. Gene transfection in mouse SR.D10.CD4~.F1 T cells produced four lines expressing human CD4 and/or CD38. Ability of CD4+CD38+ cells to bind HIV-1 or purified recombinant gp120 was significantly lower than that of CD4+CD38~ cells. These data suggest that CD38 expression inhibits lymphocyte susceptibility to HIV infection, probably by inhibiting gp120/CD4-dependent viral binding to target cells.—Savarino, A., Bottarel, F., Calosso, L., Feito, M.
