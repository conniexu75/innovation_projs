https://openalex.org/W1532223486,"Nanotube fibers are expected to have a wide range of applications from energy storage to high-strength mechanical devices. But as Baughman explains in his Perspective, methods for making such fibers have been of limited success. In contrast, the process reported by Vigolo et al. shows great promise. Together with a recently reported, more economically viable nanotube production process, this method may open the door to large-scale devices and materials based on carbon nanotubes."

https://openalex.org/W1993300431,"Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of the Mona Lisa is famous for her smile. Perhaps it is the difference in her expression carried by high and low spatial frequency ranges (gradual versus sharp luminance gradations) that helps produce her smile's elusive quality.

The spatial resolution of the human visual system changes dramatically with distance from the center of gaze ([1][1]), due to the fact that both the retina and the visual cortex devote disproportionately more neuronal machinery to the fovea. Acuity 6 to 7° eccentric of the center of gaze is about one-tenth the acuity at the center of gaze. This means that our central vision is dominated by significantly higher spatial frequencies than is our peripheral vision. Conversely, vision only a few degrees from the center of gaze is much blurrier than in the fovea.

To see how Mona Lisa's smile would look at different eccentricities, the image has been filtered to exaggerate selectively low or high spatial frequencies. A clear smile is much more apparent in the low spatial frequency images than in the high spatial frequency image. Thus, if you look at the painting so that your gaze falls on the background or on Mona Lisa's hands, your perception of her mouth would be dominated by low spatial frequencies, so it would appear much more cheerful than when you look directly at her mouth.

This explanation goes beyond the popular idea that da Vinci blurred her mouth ( sfumato ) to make her expression ambiguous ([2][2]). It seems that her smile is more apparent in the low spatial frequency range, and therefore more apparent to peripheral vision than to central vision. Hence the elusive quality—you can't catch her smile by looking at her mouth. She smiles until you look at her mouth, and then it fades, like a dim star that disappears when you look directly at it.

https://openalex.org/W1539267738,"Over half of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere is partially absorbed by carbon sinks. As Fung explains in this Perspective, determining the location and magnitude of these sinks remains a major challenge. Bousquet et al. find that regional and global terrestrial carbon sinks are much more variable than their oceanic counterparts and that the tropical land masses may play a major role. Given that the land sink is so variable, it is uncertain how it will repond to climate change."

https://openalex.org/W1503322462,"The mechanism by which colloidal suspensions containing particles with magnetic or electric dipole moments phase separate has long remained obscure. Pincus highlights the report by Tlusty and Safran, who have found that a mechanism derived from polymer physics is applicable to this problem because the suspended colloidal particles form polymerlike chains. A wide range of seemingly different systems, from biopolymers to inorganic ceramic networks, may ultimately be described within a general model."
https://openalex.org/W1982472236,"THE report of Wilgus and coworkers1 on the preventive action of manganese, aluminum, zinc and iron on the occurrence of slipped tendon (perosis) in young growing chicks, together with our observations of a number of chicks hatched with slipped tendon, led us to study the effects on embryonic development and hatchability of feeding a slipped-tendon-producing ration to laying hens. Eggs from hens that had been fed such a ration for two months gave a hatchability of less than 10 per cent. Those embryos that were sufficiently developed before death for observation showed, without exception, very short legs and wings and parrot beak. The few chicks that hatched, although having short legs, did not have slipped tendon. Another group of hens fed the same ration plus 40 ppm each of manganese and zinc, as the respective sulfates, and 100 ppm of iron, as ferrous ammonium sulfate, produced eggs giving good hatchability and all normal chicks. Embryos that died showed normal development of appendages and mandibles. The eggs from the hens fed the slipped-tendon-producing ration contained much less manganese than those from the hens fed the same ration plus the mineral supplements indicated above. As a result of these analyses and of our studies2 on slipped tendon, we were inclined to attribute this condition to a manganese deficiency. This was proved to be correct by the injection of 0.03 mgs of manganese directly into the albumen of such eggs just prior to incubation, which resulted in normal development of the embryos and in an increase in hatchability. The metatarsi, tibiae and humeri of the chicks and 20-21-day embryos from the injected eggs were 52, 44 and 40 per cent. longer, respectively, than the same bones of those from the eggs which were not injected with manganese. The injection of .03 mgs of zinc into the albumen of the egg had no appreciable preventive effect on this disorder. These findings may offer some insight into the mechanism which produces slipped tendon in the growing chick. Further studies on this problem are in progress.

Policy-makers should not frame the debate on science funding in terms of percentage of increase. Rather, a systematic analysis of the promise of opportunities should be conducted and the funds allotted accordingly. This article is a call to rethink how lawmakers are funding the discoveries upon which future generations will rely."

Scheduled to be scrapped in September to make room for a new device, the Large Hadron Collider, LEP was granted a 1-month stay of execution so physicists could continue experiments hinting at evidence for the Higgs boson--a theoretical particle that physicists have coveted for decades. On 8 November, CERN's director-general turned down a further extension, but the executive committee of the lab's staff association blasted the decision, saying that the case against LEP had not been made clearly enough."

https://openalex.org/W1916248050,"On page 1338, a group of geophysicists suggests that the mysterious boundary between Earth's molten iron core and its rocky mantle most resembles an inverted sea floor, with liquid-iron-laced sediments collecting on the roof of the core. They argue that a slow, inverted rain of precipitates rising to the core-mantle boundary and settling into a kilometers-thick layer might explain a variety of observations, from a subtle nodding of Earth's axis to seismic speed zones at the boundary. Their story will be difficult to verify, however, because painting a portrait of the core-mantle boundary depends on very indirect geophysical evidence."
