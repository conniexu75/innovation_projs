The ability of inositol stereoisomers to interact with and stabilize small Aβ complexes was addressed. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that epi- and scyllo- but not chiro-inositol were able to induce a structural transition from random to β-structure in Aβ42. Alternatively, none of the stereoisomers were able to induce a structural transition in Aβ40. Electron microscopy demonstrated that inositol stabilizes small aggregates of Aβ42. We demonstrate that inositol-Aβ interactions result in a complex that is non-toxic to nerve growth factor-differentiated PC-12 cells and primary human neuronal cultures. The attenuation of toxicity is the result of Aβ-inositol interaction, as inositol uptake inhibitors had no effect on neuronal survival. The use of inositol stereoisomers allowed us to elucidate an important structure-activity relationship between Aβ and inositol. Inositol stereoisomers are naturally occurring molecules that readily cross the blood-brain barrier and may represent a viable treatment for AD through the complexation of Aβ and attenuation of Aβ neurotoxic effects.

Alzheimer's disease nerve growth factor phosphate-buffered saline sulfhydryl rhodamine B lactate dehydrogenase Alzheimer's disease is characterized neuropathologically by amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary tangles, and selective neuronal loss. The major component of the amyloid deposits is amyloid-β (Aβ), a 39–43 residue peptide. Soluble forms of Aβ generated from cleavage of amyloid precursor protein are normal products of metabolism (1.Esch F. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R.

The importance of residues 1–42 (Aβ42) in Alzheimer's disease was highlighted in the discovery that mutations in codon 717 of the amyloid precursor protein gene, presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes result in an increased production of Aβ42 over Aβ1–40 (Aβ40; Refs. 3.Suzuki N.

These results in conjunction with the presence of Aβ42 in both mature plaques and diffuse amyloid (6.Gravina S.A. Ho L. Eckman C.B. Long K.E. Otvos L. Younkin L.H. Suzuki N. Younkin S.G. J. Biol.

This hypothesis was supported by the fact that Aβ42 deposition precedes that of Aβ40 in Down's syndrome (7.Iwatsubo T. Mann D.M. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Ann.

Many in vitro studies have demonstrated that Aβ can be neurotoxic or enhance the susceptibility of neurons to excitotoxic, metabolic, or oxidative insults (11.Weiss J.H. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. J.

Initially it was thought that only the fibrillar form of Aβ was toxic to neurons (15.Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J.

These data suggested that prevention of Aβ oligomerization would be a likely strategy to prevent AD-related neurodegeneration. Several studies have demonstrated that in vitro Aβ-induced neurotoxicity can be ablated by compounds that can increase neuronal resistance by targeting cellular pathways involved in apoptosis (21.Paradis E.

The site at which Aβ acts to induce neurotoxicity has yet to be elucidated but its toxic effects have been blocked by a variety of disparate agents. Docking of Aβ-fibrils to neuronal and glial cell membranes may be an early and intervenable step during the progression of AD.1 Formation of amyloid plaques, as well as, neurotoxicity and inflammation may be direct or indirect consequences of the interaction of Aβ with molecules containing sugar moieties. Previous studies have demonstrated that Aβ interaction with glycosaminoglycans results in aggregation of Aβ possibly adding to their insolubility and plaque persistence (27.Gupta-Bansal R.

Biochem. 1999; 266: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans have also been implicated in neuronal toxicity (30.Schulz J.G. Megow D. Reszka R. Villringer A. Einhaupl K.M. Dirnagl U. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and microglial activation (31.Guilian D. Haverkamp L.J., Yu, J.H. Karshin W.L. Li J. Kirkpatrick J.

Alternatively, interaction with glycolipids such as gangliosides results in the stabilization and prevention of Aβ fibril formation, as well as, the site of Aβ production (33.Bouillot C.

Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The family of phosphatidylinositols, on the other hand, results in acceleration of fibril formation (38.McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The headgroup of phosphatidylinositol is myo-inositol a naturally occurring simple sugar involved in lipid biosynthesis, signal transduction, and osmolarity control. We have demonstrated that myo-inositol stabilizes a small micelle of Aβ42 (38.McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The interaction of Aβ with small sulfated compounds, antibiotics, and glycosaminoglycans has been shown to vary as the charge distribution across the compound is varied (12.Tomiyama T. Shoji A.

Med. 1995; 1: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).myo-Inositol has 8 stereoisomers that alter the distribution of hydroxyl groups across the surfaces of the sugar ring. In the present study, we examined the ability of four inositol isomers (Fig.1) to stabilize small aggregates of Aβ40 and Aβ42. The resultant Aβ-inositol complexes were subsequently examined for their ability to modulate Aβ-induced toxicity of nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC-12 cells and primary human fetal neuronal cultures. Inositol stereoisomers: myo-, epi-, andscyllo-inositol were purchased from Sigma,chiro-inositol from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). PC-12 cells were from ATCC. NGF was purchased from Alamone Laboratories (Israel). Competitive inhibitors used in this study, phloridzin andd-glucose, were purchased from Sigma. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were synthesized by solid phase Fmoc chemistry by the Hospital for Sick Children's Biotechnology Center (Toronto, Ontario). Peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 μBondapak column. Peptides were initially dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100% trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich, Milwakee, WI), diluted in distilled H2O and immediately lyophilized. Peptides were then dissolved in 40% trifluoroethanol (Aldrich) in H2O and stored at −20 °C until use. Alternatively, the lyophilized peptides were dissolved in distilled H2O at 10 mg/ml concentration and used immediately. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco Circular Dichroism Spectrometer Model J-715 (Easton, MO) at 25 °C. Spectra were obtained from 200 to 260 nm, with a 0.5-nm step, 1-nm band width. Peptide:inositol ratios were varied from 1:1 to 1:20 (w/w) with a final peptide concentration of 10 μm. The effects of the inositols on peptide conformation were determined by adding an aliquot of stock peptide solutions to inositol suspended in PBS, 50 mm phosphate buffer or dH2O. The contribution of inositols to the CD signal was removed by subtracting the inositol only spectra. Aβ peptide conformations were determined in 40% trifluoroethanol/H2O and in buffer under the same conditions. Peptides were incubated with the inositol stereoisomers at a 1:1 ratio (w/w) in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) or in dH2O. For negative staining, carbon-coated pioloform grids were floated on aqueous solutions of peptides (100 μg/ml). After grids were blotted and air dried, the samples were stained with 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0). The peptide assemblies were observed in a Hitachi H-7000 operated with an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. Neural cells are derived from human fetal central nervous system (cerebral hemispheres) tissue obtained at 12–16 weeks gestation as described previously (40.McLaurin J. D'Souza S. Stewart J. Blain M. Beaudet A. Nalbantoglu J. Antel J.P. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 13: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cultures were obtained using MRC (Canada) approved guidelines. The cultures are prepared by dissociation of the fetal central nervous system tissue with 0.05% trypsin and 50 μg/ml DNase, passing the tissue through a 125-μm nylon mesh screen, and then through a 70-μm screen. After washing with PBS, the cells are suspended in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% glucose, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate and placed onto poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well dishes. Cultures are treated on day 4 with 1 mm 5-fluorodeoxyuridine to deplete astrocytes. The treatment is repeated twice over a 2-week period. PC-12 cells were plated at 500 cells per well in a 96-well plate and suspended in 30 ng/ml NGF diluted in N2/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were differentiated over 5–7 days to a final cell number of 10,000–15,000 per well. Aβ was either used directly or aged 3 days at room temperature to induce fibrillogenesis. The Aβ solutions were then incubated with various inositols for 20–24 h at room temperature. Aβ with and without inositols was added to cultures at a final Aβ concentration of 0.1 μg/μl and incubated for 24 or 72 h at 37 °C. Toxicity was assayed using the sulfhydryl rhodamine B (SRB) assay and the lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH). Cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10%. Plates were washed with H2O and air-dried. Protein was stained with 0.4% SRB (Molecular Probes Inc) in 1% acetic acid for 30 min (41.Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8663) Google Scholar). Plates were washed with 1% acetic acid and air-dried. The dye was extracted in unbuffered 10 mm Tris and absorbance was assayed at 550 nm on a Bio-Rad Benchmark microtiter plate reader. Prior to addition of Aβ and inositols, fetal calf serum was added to NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells to a final concentration of 1% in order to stabilize LDH in the supernatant. Supernatants from the Aβ-treated cultures were removed and analyzed for LDH release using a commercial kit (Sigma). Results are expressed as B-B units/ml. The proliferative properties of NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells were determined using a [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Briefly, cells were differentiated with NGF for 5 days at 37 °C. In order to determine the basal, Aβ and inositol-induced proliferation 1 mCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (NEN Dupont, Mississauga, ON) was added to each well and incubated for 18 h. Cells were then harvested onto glass fiber filters and radioactivity determined as counts/min per well by liquid scintillation counting on a Beckman β-counter. NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells were cultured in glucose-free media for inositol competition assays. 1 mmd-Glucose was added to PC-12 cells immediately prior to the addition of Aβ/inositol mixtures. Similarly, 100 μmphloridzin was added to NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells in the presence and absence of Aβ/inositol mixtures. Cells were then incubated for 24 h before toxicity was measured using both the SRB and LDH assays. PC-12 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at 1000 cells per slip and differentiated in 30 ng/ml NGF in N2/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 5 days. The presence of Aβ on the cell surface of NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells was examined between 30 min and 3 h of incubation in the presence of Aβ with and without inositols. Aβ was visualized using Aβ-specific antibodies, 6E10 and 4G8 (Senetek, St. Louis, MA) followed by goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to Cy3 (Dako, Cerpinteria, CA). Cells were post-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde prior to fluorescence visualization. In order to determine the interaction of the inositol stereoisomers (Fig.1) with Aβ, we investigated the effect of these compounds in the random coil to β-structure transition necessary for Aβ-micelle and fibril formation. Examination of Aβ structure immediately upon incubation with inositol will lend evidence for the effect of inositols on fibril nucleation. Previously, we have shown that Aβ42-myo-inositol interactions result in an immediate conformational change from random coil to β-sheet, whereas, Aβ40 does not undergo this transition (38.McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The structural details of Aβ40 and Aβ42-inositol isomer interactions were investigated by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). Aβ40 and Aβ42 stored in 40% trifluoroethanol displayed CD spectra indicative of partially α-helical structures as previously reported (34.McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 42.Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 10 μm, both Aβ40 and Aβ42 became unstructured after dilution in PBS (pH 7.0) (Fig. 2, A andD). When incubated in the presence of epi-, scyllo-, and chiro-inositol, Aβ40 remained random as seen withmyo-inositol (Fig. 2; Ref. 38.McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Variation of the charge density on the inositol ring did not induce a conformational switch in Aβ40. We have previously shown that Aβ40-GAG interactions are inhibited in buffers containing phosphate counterions (29.McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the interactions of Aβ40 with inositol in dH2O (pH 6.8). None of the stereoisomers were able to induce a conformational transition in Aβ40, suggesting that charge shielding was not the limiting factor in Aβ40-inositol interactions. Increasing the concentration of myo-inositol to 1m induced a β-structural transition in Aβ40. At this concentration, myo-inositol functions as a chemical chaperone to stabilize the peptide through osmotic remediation and not peptide binding (42.Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 43.Yang D.S. Yip C.M. Huang T.H.J. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32970-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In contrast, Aβ42 was immediately induced to form β-structure in the presence of both epi-inositol (Fig. 2 D) andscyllo-inositol (Fig. 2 E) but not in the presence of chiro-inositol at peptide:inositol ratio of 1:20 (w/w) (Fig. 2 F). The stereoisomers differ frommyo-inositol in the number of hydroxyl groups extending on either side of the inositol ring (Fig. 1). myo-Inositol has four hydroxyl groups on one surface of the ring and two hydroxyl groups on the other. If we consider only the more highly charged surface of the ring, then epi-inositol increases the surface charge by one hydroxyl group, whereas, scyllo-inositol decreases the hydroxyl groups from 4 to 3 (Fig. 1). chiro-Inositol also decreases the number of hydroxyl groups to 3 but unlikescyllo-inositol, the spacing of the charge density is uneven (Fig. 1). The structure-activity relationship between inositol stereoisomers and Aβ elucidate the necessity for hydroxyl groups with the same orientation at either positions 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 6 of the inositol ring to stabilize the Aβ42-inositol complex. The concentration dependence of Aβ42-inositol structural transition was examined to determine the stoichiometry of this interaction. Bothepi- and scyllo-inositol were able to induce a transition from random to β-structure in Aβ42 at a 1:1 ratio (by weight). This corresponds to one molecule of Aβ42 to 25 molecules of inositol. Although inositol is in excess amounts with respect to Aβ42, this is not disparate with inositol concentrations in the central nervous system of young adults. Our CD studies show that inositols induce the structural transition necessary for fibrillogenesis but this may not correlate with increased fibril growth. The characteristics of Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils in the presence and absence of inositol stereoisomers were examined by electron microscopy. Unseeded samples of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were incubated in the presence of epi-, scyllo-,chiro-inositol, and alone for 96 h. Negative stain electron microscopy demonstrated that when Aβ40 was incubated in buffer alone, it formed fibrils of varying lengths with some apparent intertwining of fibrils (Fig.3 A). When Aβ40 was incubated in the presence of epi-inositol (Fig. 3 B),scyllo-inositol, or chiro-inositol the fibrils formed were indistinguishable from those of Aβ40 alone. Negative stain electron microscopy analysis of Aβ42 demonstrated that when Aβ42 is incubated in buffer, fibrils were of varying lengths (Fig. 4 A). In the presence ofchiro-inositol, the Aβ42 fibers were indistinguishable from Aβ42 alone (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, no fibrils could be detected in the presence of epi-inositol (Fig.4 C) and scyllo-inositol (Fig. 4 D) demonstrating an activity similar to myo-inositol (38.McLaurin J. Franklin T.

The fine thread-like structures detected in the Aβ42-epi- andscyllo-inositol samples were present in the inositol solutions alone and therefore not Aβ fibrils. These results demonstrate that although epi- andscyllo-inositol are able to induce β-structure in Aβ42, the Aβ42-inositol complex does not progress to form fibrils. Similar to that reported for myo-inositol, Aβ42 can form stable β-structured, non-fibrillar complexes with epi- andscyllo-inositol. Aβ-induced toxicity of neuronal cell lines and primary cultures is well established (15.Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J.

The ability of inositol stereoisomers to induce β-structure and stabilize a small Aβ complex appears to have all the requirements so far described as necessary for Aβ-induced toxicity. Light microscopy demonstrated that addition of aggregated Aβ40 or Aβ42 to NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells resulted in decreased cell number and retraction of neurites (Fig. 5 B) as compared with PC-12 cells alone (Fig. 5 A). NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells retained their morphology when incubated in the presence of Aβ42-myo-inositol complexes (1:20; Fig. 5 C). Aβ has been shown to kill neurons through both apoptotic and necrotic pathways, therefore Aβ-induced toxicity in the presence of inositol stereoisomers was examined using the SRB and LDH assays. The SRB assay measures total cell death whereas the LDH assay measures cell death that is associated with membrane damage. The SRB assay demonstrated that Aβ40 treatment resulted in a 61% cell survival that was not significantly changed by preincubation of Aβ40 withmyo-inositol (Table I), whereas, Aβ42 resulted in a 55% cell survival which increased to 80% by preincubation with myo-inositol (Table I). Finally supernatants from the toxicity assays were assessed for the release of LDH, Aβ40-induced LDH release was decreased slightly by preincubation with myo-inositol, whereas Aβ42-myo-inositol decreased the amount of LDH released to levels ofmyo-inositol treatment alone (data not shown). These results suggest that incubation of Aβ42 with myo-inositol either stabilizes a small non-toxic oligomer, blocks Aβ-neuronal cell surface interactions, or alternatively that myo-inositol alone blocks Aβ-induced toxicity.Table IConcentration dependence of inositol rescue of Aβ-induced neurotoxicity% cell survivalAβ40Aβ42Inositolmyo-Inositol 061 ± 2.755 ± 6.9100 0.1 μg/μl56 ± 8.353 ± 10.280 ± 10.4 1.0 μg/μl49 ± 3.556 ± 5.174 ± 4.3 2.0 μg/μl66 ± 2.780.7 ± 1.4aPaired t test indicatesp < 0.01 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.94 ± 13.8epi-Inositol 056 ± 6.354 ± 7.2100 0.1 μg/μl93 ± 6.7aPaired t test indicatesp < 0.01 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.89 ± 16.8bPaired t-test indicatesp < 0.05 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.93 ± 3.1 1.0 μg/μl96 ± 6.1aPaired t test indicatesp < 0.01 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.90 ± 6.8bPaired t-test indicatesp < 0.05 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.87 ± 1.1 2.0 μg/μl89 ± 9.7aPaired t test indicatesp < 0.01 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.49 ± 2.999 ± 10.9scyllo-Inositol 056 ± 6.354 ± 7.2100 0.1 μg/μl83 ± 19bPaired t-test indicatesp < 0.05 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.83 ± 6.7bPaired t-test indicatesp < 0.05 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.94 ± 7.4 1.0 μg/μl97 ± 2.7aPaired t test indicatesp < 0.01 when compared to the absence of inositol treatments.97 ± 6.1aPaired t test indicatesp < 0.01 when compared to the absence of inosit"

Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In contrast to most eukaryotes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not possess a complex I but rather contains two NADH dehydrogenases associated with the inner membrane (2.de Vries S.

The electron transport chain complexes are large multisubunit complexes embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane. They are electronically linked to each other by smaller components, which may be located in the membrane (e.g. quinone) or in the aqueous phase (e.g. cytochrome c). A number of studies exist that address the molecular organization of these complexes in the membrane, and two models have been proposed (see Ref. 4.Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar for complete discussion). According to the popular “liquid state” model, one or all of the components of the electron transport chain are randomly arranged in the membrane and are free to diffuse in a lateral manner. The rate of electron transfer between the complexes would be determined by the diffusion process. The second model, the “solid state” model, involves the ordered association of the electron chain components with each other. Indeed a number of earlier reports provide evidence that the stoichiometric association of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes could occur (4.Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5.Hatefi Y. Rieske J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 225-231Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6.Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using inhibitor titration-based experiments, evidence was recently provided to suggest that both quinone and cytochrome c do not diffuse freely through or along the membrane (7.Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). From these findings it was concluded that, at least in yeast mitochondria, the respiratory chain may act as one functional unit (7.Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence, however, to demonstrate the physical interaction of one respiratory complex with another in yeast mitochondria has been lacking to date. We have recently initiated a study of the assembly of the cytochromebc 1 complex in S. cerevisiae and were investigating the role of the Bcs1p protein, a molecular chaperone, in the assembly process (8.Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the course of this work, we observed that the cytochrome bc 1 complex could be isolated as a supracomplex, significantly larger than the estimated size of the previously described dimeric cytochrome bc 1complex (8.Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this present study, we have further analyzed the cytochrome bc 1 supracomplex. We present evidence here that this supracomplex represents the association of the cytochrome bc 1 complex with the cytochromec oxidase complex. By using a co-immunoprecipitation approach, we demonstrate a physical interaction of subunits of the cytochrome bc 1 complex with those of the cytochrome c oxidase complex. We conclude the cytochromebc 1 complex does not exist alone as a dimer in the mitochondrial inner membrane but rather is located exclusively in a large complex with the cytochrome c oxidase complex. We term this complex the cytochrome bc 1-cytochromec oxidase supracomplex. All yeast strains used in this analysis were constructed in the same genetic background of W303-1A and are summarized in Table I. The Δshy1 (W303-1A shy1::HIS3) strain was constructed by replacing the entire open reading frame encoding the Shy1p (the SHY1 gene) with the HIS3 gene, as described previously (9.Wach A. Brachat A.

All cells were harvested at anA 578 nm of ∼1–1.5. Mitochondria were isolated according to published procedures (11.Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E.

Open table in a new tab Isolated mitochondria (200 μg of protein) were lysed in 40 μl of digitonin buffer (1% (w/v) digitonin, 50 mm potassium acetate, 30 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml α2-macroglobulin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min on ice (8.Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Following solubilization, a clarifying spin (30 min, 226,000 ×g, TLA45 rotor, Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge) was performed. SDS-PAGE1 and Western blot analysis of the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions indicated that approximately 90% of the total cytochromebc 1 complex and 85% of the cytochromec oxidase complex had been solubilized by the digitonin extraction procedure. Mitochondria (200 μg of protein) were solubilized with digitonin and subjected to a clarifying spin, as described above. The samples (40 μl) were supplemented with 4 μl of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Serva Blue G in 500 mm aminocaproic acid) prior to electrophoresis. Samples were then analyzed by BN-PAGE (12.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) using either 4–8 or 5–10% polyacrylamide gradient gels, as indicated. Following electrophoresis, Western blotting was performed, and the protein complexes were detected by immunoblotting. The calibration standards used in the BN-PAGE and gel filtration analysis (see below) are as follows: Hsp60 (840 kDa), bovine thyroglobin (670 kDa), horse spleen apoferritin (443 kDa), potato β-amylase (200 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin monomer (66 kDa), and bovine erythrocyte anhydrase (29 kDa). Isolated mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were solubilized in digitonin buffer (lacking 10% glycerol), as described previously (8.Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Following a clarifying spin, the detergent extract was applied to a Superose 6 fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 25 ml column volume), which was previously equilibrated with the digitonin buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Subunits of the cytochrome bc 1 and cytochrome coxidase complexes were detected in the eluate fractions by immunoblotting. Antibodies against Core1, Cox4p, and respective preimmune IgG were covalently bound to protein A-Sepharose with the cross-linker dimethyl pimelimidate, as described previously (8.Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were lysed in digitonin buffer and following a clarifying spin were incubated under gentle shaking for 2 h at 4 °C either with anti-Core1, anti-Cox4p, or respective preimmune IgG coupled to the protein A-Sepharose, as described previously (8.Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the digitonin buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. NADH-cytochromec reductase and cytochrome c oxidase activities of wild-type mitochondria (10 μg) were measured at 23 °C, in a UVICON 930-Spectrophotometer (Kontron), essentially as described previously (13.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When indicated, mitochondrial proteins were solubilized with detergent (1% (w/v) digitonin or 0.1% (w/v) lauryl maltoside or 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate) prior to measurement of the enzyme activities. Protein determinations and SDS-PAGE were performed according to the published methods of Bradford (14.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) and Laemmli (15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), respectively. The detection of proteins after Western blotting on nitrocellulose was performed using the ECL detection system according to the supplier's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to analyze the oligomeric state of the cytochrome bc 1 complex in yeast mitochondria, the complex was solubilized from the mitochondrial membranes using the mild detergent, digitonin. Measurement of the enzyme activities of the cytochromebc 1 complex (also the cytochrome coxidase complex) indicated that it was solubilized as an active enzyme by the digitonin (Table II). Indeed the levels of activities measured following digitonin solubilization were similar to those achieved following solubilization by lauryl maltoside or deoxycholate (Table II).Table IIEnzymatic measurements of respiratory chain activities following detergent solubilizationMitochondriaNADH-cytochrome creductaseCytochrome c oxidase−Detergent0.941.54+Digitonin0.881.55+Deoxycholate0.741.35+Lauryl maltoside0.871.30Respiratory activities of wild-type mitochondria and detergent-solubilized wild-type mitochondria refer to μmoles of cytochrome c reduced or oxidized per min per mg of mitochondrial protein, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Respiratory activities of wild-type mitochondria and detergent-solubilized wild-type mitochondria refer to μmoles of cytochrome c reduced or oxidized per min per mg of mitochondrial protein, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The native molecular mass of the digitonin-solubilized cytochromebc 1 complex was estimated using the technique of BN-PAGE, followed by Western blotting and immune decoration with antibodies specific for subunits of the cytochromebc 1 complex (Fig.1). The cytochromebc 1 complex was solubilized from wild-type mitochondria and parallel to mitochondria isolated from various strains bearing deletions in individual genes encoding subunits of the cytochrome bc 1 complex. Immune decoration of the resulting blots with antisera against both the Rieske FeS protein and cytochrome b indicated that the predominant form of the wild-type cytochrome bc 1 complex had an apparent molecular mass of ∼1000 kDa. We designate this larger complex as the cytochrome bc 1 supracomplex. The size estimation of the 1000-kDa complex was in good agreement with our previous gel filtration analysis, following detergent solubilization under similar conditions (8.Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A minor amount of the cytochromebc 1 complex had an apparent size of ∼850 kDa. The presence of Qcr10p (16.Brandt U. Uribe S. Schägger H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12947-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is apparently not essential to form this supracomplex, as the size of the cytochrome bc 1complex in the QCR10 null mutant, Δqcr10, was similar to that observed in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the absence of Qcr6p did not have a significant effect on the formation or stability of the supracomplex. The cytochromebc 1 supracomplex observed in the Δqcr6 mutant, the QCR6 null mutant, was slightly smaller than that observed in wild-type mitochondria. Qcr6p is a highly negatively charged protein (pI 3.87) (17.Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17005-17011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its loss from the cytochrome bc 1 complex would alter the net charge of the complex and may also alter the conformation of the complex. Both changes would likely have an effect on the mobility of the complex under BN-PAGE analysis. Analysis of the cytochrome bc 1 complex in mitochondria deficient in either Qcr9p or the Rieske FeS protein revealed that these subunits are essential for the formation of the cytochrome bc 1 supracomplex (Fig. 1). In the Δrip1 and Δqcr9 mitochondria, two forms of the cytochrome bc 1 complex smaller than the supracomplex were observed. The predominant form was ∼500 kDa in size, and a second, less abundant complex of ∼670 kDa, more obvious in the Δrip1 mitochondria, was also observed. These complexes may correspond to pre-assembly forms of the supracomplex. In summary, these data indicate that in wild-type mitochondria the cytochrome bc 1 complex exists in the inner membrane as a larger oligomeric structure whose size is approximately 1000 kDa. Assembly of this supra-form of the cytochromebc 1 complex does not require the presence of either Qcr6p or Qcr10p. On the other hand, assembly of the supracomplex is not observed in the absence of Qcr9p and the Rieske FeS protein, both of which represent essential subunits for the enzymatic activity of the cytochrome bc 1 complex. The apparent requirement for Qcr9p for the formation of the supracomplex may be due to an indirect effect due to the loss of the Rieske FeS protein in the Δqcr9 mitochondria. The association of the Rieske FeS protein with the cytochrome bc 1 complex is especially labile in the absence of the Qcr9p (18.Phillips J.D. Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that the observed cytochrome bc 1supracomplex represents a physical association of the cytochromebc 1 complex with another different respiratory chain complex, such as the cytochrome c oxidase complex, was investigated. To do so, the native molecular mass of the cytochromec oxidase complex was analyzed following digitonin solubilization and BN-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1). Immune decoration of the resulting blot revealed that the cytochrome c oxidase complex in wild-type mitochondria was also present in a complex of ∼1000 kDa that co-migrated with the cytochromebc 1 complex (Fig. 1). Thus these findings indicate that the cytochrome c oxidase complex, like the cytochrome bc 1 complex, exists in a higher molecular mass supracomplex, which is stable following solubilization with digitonin. Co-migration of these two respiratory chain complexes may indicate that they co-exist in one larger supracomplex. Interestingly, in the absence of the Rieske FeS protein and the Qcr9p, the cytochrome c oxidase complex did not form the larger 1000-kDa complex, but rather smaller forms of the complex, ∼670, ∼500, and 400 kDa (only in the Δqcr9mitochondria), were observed (Fig. 1). The mobilities of the larger two of these complexes are similar to the pre-assembly forms of the cytochrome bc 1 supracomplex, which raised the possibility that these complexes may contain both cytochromebc 1 and cytochrome c oxidase subunits. The dependence of the cytochrome c oxidase complex on the presence of subunits of the cytochromebc 1 complex for its assembly into the 1000-kDa supracomplex is addressed in more detail later (see Fig. 3). In order to gain further insight into the possible physical interaction of the cytochrome bc 1 complex with the cytochromec oxidase complex, we analyzed the assembly state of the cytochrome bc 1 complex in yeast strains that do not contain an assembled functional cytochrome c oxidase complex. The cytochrome c oxidase-deficient mitochondria used in this analysis were isolated from the Δimp1 strain (deficient in Imp1p peptidase, necessary for the maturation of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II) (19.Behrens M. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), Δcox4(deficient in subunit 4, an essential subunit of the cytochromec oxidase complex) (20.Maarse A.C. van Loon A.P. Riezman H. Gregor I. Schatz G. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2831-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and Δshy1 (deficient in Shy1p, a protein involved in the assembly of the cytochromec oxidase complex) (21.Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14356-14364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from each of these mutant strains and, in parallel to wild-type mitochondria, were solubilized with digitonin. Co-migration of Rieske FeS and cytochrome b proteins upon the BN-PAGE analysis indicated that the cytochrome bc 1 complex was functionally assembled in these cytochrome coxidase-deficient mitochondria. In each case, however, the cytochromebc 1 complex had an apparent molecular mass of ∼670 kDa, in contrast to the 1000-kDa supracomplex observed in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 2). Thus we conclude that in the absence of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, the cytochrome bc 1 complex fails to form a supracomplex but assembles into a complex whose native molecular mass corresponds closer to that described previously for the dimeric cytochrome bc 1 complex. The native molecular mass of the yeast cytochromec oxidase complex was also estimated by a second independent technique, gel filtration chromatography, following solubilization of mitochondrial membrane proteins by digitonin. Consistent with the BN-PAGE results, the subunits of the cytochromebc 1 and cytochrome c oxidase complexes of wild-type mitochondria co-migrated together under these conditions, with an estimated molecular mass in the range of 1000 kDa (Fig. 3 A). A small fraction of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 (Cox4p) proteins eluted in a low molecular weight fraction which most likely represents a fraction of Cox4p dissociated from the cytochrome c oxidase complex. BN-PAGE analysis of the cytochrome c oxidase complex of mitochondria isolated from a number of yeast mutant strains deficient in an assembled cytochrome bc 1 complex was then performed (Fig. 3 B). The cytochrome c oxidase supracomplex in the Δqcr6 mitochondria was found to be slightly smaller than in wild-type mitochondria. This size difference is similar to that observed previously for the cytochromebc 1 supracomplex, an observation consistent with the notion that the supracomplex involves an interaction of the cytochrome bc 1 and cytochrome coxidase complexes. Furthermore, the assembly of the cytochromec oxidase supracomplex was severely affected in mitochondria of two other mutants of the cytochrome bc 1complex, Δcbp3 and Δc 1. Both of these strains do not contain an assembled cytochromebc 1 complex; Cbp3p is a factor required for the assembly of the cytochrome bc 1 complex, and cytochrome c 1 is an essential subunit of the cytochrome bc 1 complex (8.Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22.Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11122-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Sadler I. Suda K. Schatz G. Kaudewitz F. Haid A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In these mutant strains, two distinct forms of the cytochrome coxidase complex were observed as follows: a less abundant form of ∼670 kDa, and a smaller, more abundant form of ∼500 kDa. Thus the formation of the cytochrome c oxidase supracomplex required the presence of an assembled cytochrome bc 1complex. In summary, these data demonstrate that both the cytochromebc 1 complex and the cytochrome coxidase complexes form a larger oligomeric supracomplex of ∼1000 kDa in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The cytochromebc 1 and the cytochrome c oxidase complexes display a co-dependence for the formation of their respective supracomplex forms. Taken together, these data imply that the cytochrome bc 1 and cytochrome coxidase complexes exist together in one supracomplex in the mitochondrial inner membrane. In order to demonstrate a physical association of subunits of the cytochromebc 1 complex with those of the cytochromec oxidase complex, a co-immunoprecipitation approach was adopted. Mitochondria were solubilized with digitonin, and immunoprecipitation of the cytochrome bc 1complex was performed using antibodies specific for the Core1 subunit (Fig. 4 A). The cytochromebc 1 complex had remained intact under these immunoprecipitation conditions, as indicated by the co-immunoprecipitation of the Rieske FeS protein with Core1. Probing the Core1 immunoprecipitate with antibodies specific for subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, Cox2p, Cox4p, and Cox5ap, indicated that the cytochrome c oxidase complex was physically associated with the cytochrome bc 1complex under these solubilization conditions. Quantitation analysis indicated that approximately 50% of the total Core1 protein and 45–60% of total Cox4p and Cox5ap proteins were immunoprecipitated with the Core1 antibodies. Thus the levels of the cytochromec oxidase subunits in the Core1 immunoprecipitate were similar to those of the cytochrome bc 1 complex subunits. The cytochrome c oxidase subunits were not detected when preimmune serum was used in the immunoprecipitation analysis. The specificity of the immunoprecipitation of the cytochromec oxidase subunits with the Core1 antiserum was further demonstrated when mitochondria isolated from the Δcor1null mutant were used for the immunoprecipitation analysis. In the absence of Core1, the subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase complex were not found in the immunoprecipitate, thus ruling out the unexpected possibility of cross-reactivity of the Core1 antiserum with the cytochrome c oxidase subunits (Fig. 4 A). In a parallel analysis, antibodies specific for cytochrome coxidase subunit 4 were used for the co-immunoprecipitation procedure (Fig. 4 B). Analysis of the resulting immunoprecipitate revealed that in addition to Cox2p, subunits of the cytochromebc 1 complex, Core1 and Core2, had been co-immunoprecipitated with Cox4p. Similar levels of the both cytochromec oxidase and cytochrome bc 1 complex subunits (ranging from 45 to 60% of the total protein in mitochondria) were recovered in the Cox4p immunoprecipitate. Thus, as had been observed in the Core1 immunoprecipitate described above, the efficient co-immunoprecipitation of the supracomplex by Cox4p antibodies is achieved under these conditions. Finally, the specificity of the Cox4p co-immunoprecipitation of the cytochrome bc 1subunits was controlled using both preimmune serum and mitochondria solubilized from the Δcox4 null mutant strain. In summary, these results indicate that the cytochromebc 1 complex physically interacts with the cytochrome c oxidase complex to form a supracomplex in the mitochondrial inner membrane. This supracomplex can be efficiently immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for either the cytochromebc 1 or the cytochrome c oxidase complexes. Does the formation of the supracomplex enhance the stability of the subunits of the cytochromebc 1 and cytochrome c oxidase complexes? The following data would suggest this is not the case. Mitochondria isolated from mutants deficient in the cytochromec oxidase complex contain similar levels of the cytochromebc 1 complex subunits as wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 5 A). Thus these results indicate that the cytochrome bc 1 complex does not depend on the formation of the supracomplex for its proteolytic stability in the membrane. Likewise the levels of Cox2p did not differ significantly from those of wild-type mitochondria when analyzed in a number of mutants defective in the cytochromebc 1 complex (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand the stability of Cox4p was enhanced in mitochondria that contained the supracomplex (wild-type and Δqcr6 mitochondria) and was slightly reduced in mitochondria isolated from the Δc 1 and Δcbp3 mitochondria, where the formation of the supracomplex was impaired. The level of Cox4p was particularly reduced in the absence of Qcr9p of the cytochromebc 1 complex, suggesting it may play a role in the stabilization of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit. In conclusion the steady state levels of Cox2p do not appear to be affected by the absence of the supracomplex; however, the levels of Cox4p are decreased in the absence of the cytochromebc 1 complex, in particular when Qcr9p subunit is lacking. In the present study we report the observation that the cytochromebc 1 complex (complex III) of yeast mitochondria exists as a supracomplex with the cytochrome c oxidase complex (complex IV). This cytochromebc 1-cytochrome c oxidase supracomplex was observed by techniques of BN-PAGE, gel filtration, and co-immunoprecipitation, following solubilization of mitochondrial membrane proteins with the mild detergent digitonin. Although in this size range it is difficult to determine accurately, we estimate the size of the supracomplex to be approximately 1000 kDa, consistent with a stoichiometry of two cytochrome bc 1 complexes associated with two cytochrome c oxidase complexes (III2-IV2). The possibility that the mitochondrial electron chain complexes may be found in physical association with each other has been discussed (4.Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5.Hatefi Y. Rieske J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 225-231Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6.Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but the isolation of such stable supracomplexes from yeast mitochondria has not been reported previously. In the prokaryotesParacoccus denitrificans and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and thermophilic bacterium PS3, complexes III and IV have been isolated together as supercomplexes (24.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 15386-15391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast mitochondria, enzymatic data suggest that the electron carriers ubiquinone and cytochrome c do not display a pool type of behavior under physiological conditions as reported recently (7.Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Such a mode of action would be inconsistent with a random diffusion of these carriers and indicate a close association of the cytochromebc 1 and cytochrome c oxidase complexes. On the basis of these data it was implied that the respiratory chain in yeast behaves as a single functional unit (7.Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), an interpretation that would be fully consistent with our observations. The data presented here suggest that in yeast mitochondria both the cytochrome bc 1 complex and the cytochromec oxidase complexes are exclusively located in a stable supracomplex. Is complex II associated with the digitonin-solubilized complex III-IV supracomplex? Our findings suggest this is not the case. Subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase complex (complex II) did not co-fractionate with the cytochrome bc 1-cytochrome coxidase complex upon gel filtration analysis (results not shown). Furthermore, the formation or size of the cytochromebc 1-cytochrome c oxidase supracomplex was not impaired in mitochondria isolated from yeast mutants deficient in an assembled complex II (results not shown). The isolation of a stable complex between the cytochromebc 1 and cytochrome c oxidase complexes has been achieved here due to the mild nature of the detergent, digitonin, we used for the membrane solubilization. By using this mild detergent, we had succeeded in isolating and maintaining the ATP synthase complex as a larger, dimeric complex, in contrast to the more traditional detergents that resulted in the solubilization of the complex in its monomeric form (10.Arnold I.A. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 27.Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subunit analysis of the dimeric complex led to the identification of four novel subunits of the yeast ATP synthase complex (10.Arnold I.A. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 27.Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We analyzed the formation of the supracomplex in mutants compromised in the assembly of either the cytochrome bc 1 or cytochrome c oxidase complexes. Assembly of the supracomplex form was observed in mutants deficient in the non-essential subunits of the cytochrome bc 1 complex, Qcr6p and Qcr10p. Deletion of the genes encoding essential subunits of either the cytochrome bc 1 or cytochrome coxidase complexes prevented the assembly of the supracomplex. In the absence of the assembled cytochrome bc 1 complex, the cytochrome c oxidase complex assembled to an oligomeric species, whose size was consistent with a dimeric cytochromec oxidase complex. Likewise, in the absence of cytochromec oxidase assembly, the cytochromebc 1 complex assembled to its dimeric complex. Thus the formation of the supracomplex requires the presence of the functionally assembled cytochrome bc 1 and cytochrome c oxidase complexes. The assembly of the individual cytochrome bc 1 or cytochromec oxidase complexes to their respective dimeric forms appears not to be dependent on their ability to form the supracomplex. What is the function of the cytochromebc 1-cytochrome c oxidase supracomplex? The assembly of the cytochrome bc 1and cytochrome c oxidase complexes as a supracomplex could serve to enhance the proteolytic stability of these complexes in the membrane. Our data suggest that this is not the case, as the levels of the cytochrome bc 1 and cytochrome coxidase complexes were not, however, adversely affected in the absence of the supracomplex. Physical association of these mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes may serve to enhance the flow of electrons between these complexes and to reduce the dependence on random diffusion of electron carriers quinone and cytochrome c. Indeed formation of a supracomplex between complexes III and IV inP. denitrificans has been demonstrated to enhance significantly electron transfer between these complexes (24.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a tighter coupling of the electron transfer steps, as a result of physical association of mitochondrial electron chain complexes, would be compatible with the solid state model of electron transfer, as discussed by Rich (4.Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).

These side chains are either oriented in thecis (3R/7S) or the transform (3R/7R), and a number of structurally related compounds have been described and found to occur ubiquitously in plants (1.Hamberg M. Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The first physiological role of JA found in 1971 was inhibition of plant growth (2.Aldridge, D. C., Galt, S., Giles, D., and Turner, W. B. (1971) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. C 1623–1627Google Scholar). Since then, jasmonates were identified as signals of altered gene expression in various plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses as well as of distinct stages of plant development (3.Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 4.Wasternack C. Parthier B. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In tomato leaves, JA was recognized as an essential intermediate in the wound-induced signaling cascade following herbivore attack (5.Farmer E.E. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7713-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), and for numerous cell suspension cultures JA was described as a signal of elicitor-induced phytoalexin synthesis (6.Gundlach H.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) are the most intriguing JA responses, caused in most cases by up-regulation of specific enzymes (9.Blechert S. Brodschelm W. Hölder S. Kammerer L. Kutchan T.M. Mueller M.J. Xia Z.-Q. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4099-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 12.Feussner I. Hause B. Vörös K. Parthier B. Wasternack C. Plant J. 1995; 7: 949-957Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). JA responses were identified by means of altered expression of specific genes, by JA-insensitive and JA-deficient mutants, by JA-deficient transgenes, or by corresponding endogenous rises of jasmonates including inhibitor studies. More recently, the JA precursor (9S,13S)-12-oxo-(10,15Z)-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) was suggested to be the preferential signal of JA-mediated responses such as tendril coiling (13.Blechert S. Bockelmann C. Füβlein M. v. Schrader T. Stelmach B. Niesel U. Weiler E.W. Planta. 1999; 207: 470-479Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or terpenoid biosynthesis (11.Koch T. Krumm T. Jung V. Engelberth J. Boland W. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Among developmental processes, pollen maturation (14.McConn M. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 403-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and seedling growth (15.Koda Y. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 639-646Crossref Google Scholar) are JA-dependent. The biosynthesis of JA proceeds via an oxylipin pathway (Fig. 1), starting with the lipoxygenase-catalyzed insertion of molecular oxygen into position 13 of linolenic acid followed by the dehydration of the resulting fatty acid hydroperoxide ((13S)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid) by allene oxide synthase (AOS; EC 4.2.1.92) to an allene oxide (1.Hamberg M. Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This allene oxide is then cyclized by allene oxide cyclase (AOC; EC 5.3.99.6) to OPDA. After reduction of the ring double bond by a reductase and three rounds of β-oxidation, (+)-7-iso-JA,i.e. (3R,7S)-JA, is formed. Vick and Zimmerman (16.Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) already proposed a similar biosynthetic scheme in 1983, but the formation of OPDA from (13S)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid was believed to be the result of a single enzyme called hydroperoxide cyclase. In 1988, Hamberg (17.Hamberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that this step was performed by two enzyme activities. One of them, a membrane-bound activity purified later as AOS (18.Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), catalyzed the formation of an unstable allene oxide, which rapidly decays by chemical hydrolysis with a half-life of 25 s to α- and γ-ketol and OPDA (Fig.1). OPDA only amounts to 10–15% of the total degradation products and is racemic, consisting of thecis isomers 9S,13S and 9R,13R. However, in the presence of a second, soluble enzyme activity (AOC) that was purified recently (19.Ziegler J. Hamberg M. Miersch O. Parthier B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the amount of α- and γ-ketols decreased, and the 9S,13S enantiomer of OPDA was formed exclusively. This specificity of AOC determines the stereochemistry of the side chains in the naturally occurring jasmonate structure. In addition, the lipoxygenase-derived products can be converted by a divinyl ether synthase, a reductase, a peroxygenase, and a hydroperoxide lyase (20.Blée E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 33-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Due to these facts and the unspecific ketol formation following the AOS step, the AOC can be regarded as the first enzyme specific for JA synthesis. Interestingly, correct isomeric structure of OPDA formed by AOC is kept only by one of two reductases isolated so far (21.Schaller F. Hennig P. Weiler E.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 188: 1345-1351Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several forms of lipoxygenases, AOSs, and OPDA reductases have been cloned from different plant species and have been characterized biochemically, leading to hints of their physiological significance (21.Schaller F. Hennig P. Weiler E.W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 188: 1345-1351Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22.Rosahl S. Z. Naturforsch. 1996; 51c: 123-138Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23.Song W.C.

So far, for AOC only biochemical data of the purified enzyme including substrate specificity are available (19.Ziegler J. Hamberg M. Miersch O. Parthier B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Ziegler J. Wasternack C. Hamberg M. Lipids. 1999; 34: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In order to analyze the physiological importance of that step of JA biosynthesis, we cloned AOC. Here, we describe a full-length cDNA isolated from tomato leaves coding for a protein of 26 kDa that was localized in chloroplasts and whose 5′-truncated version exhibited AOC activity. Corn (Zea mays L. cv. Boss), barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Salome) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Moneymaker) were grown in soil under greenhouse conditions with 16 h light (with a minimum intensity of 130 μmol·m−2·s−1) at 25 °C. Primary barley leaves were harvested 7 days after germination, cut into 5-cm segments starting 1 cm below the leaf tip, and floated in Petri dishes on a 1 m sorbitol solution. Developing corn seeds were harvested 2 weeks after anthesis. Tomato plants were grown for 8 weeks, and the second leaf was excised and wounded using a fabric pattern wheel and subsequently floated on distilled water under continuous white light (120 μmol·m−2·s1) for the indicated times. Quantitative determination of levels of nonesterified OPDA and linolenic acid and steric analysis of OPDA were performed in unwounded leaves of tomato (15–20 g) or leaves (3–5 g) that had been wounded in situfor 0.5 h (OPDA) and 3 h (linolenic acid), respectively, by use of a hemostat. The tissue was shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was extracted with ethanol. [2H5]OPDA and [2H5]linolenic acid were added to a small part of the extracts, and the levels of OPDA and linolenic acid were determined by mass spectrometry. The remaining parts of the extracts were subjected to solid phase extraction and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the isolated OPDA was subjected to steric analysis as described by Ziegler et al. (26.Ziegler J. Wasternack C. Hamberg M. Lipids. 1999; 34: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). JA levels were determined as described by Kramell et al.(27.Kramell R. Miersch O.

Miersch O. Parthier B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The protein band was excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing as well as to internal sequencing after Lys C digestion by automated Edman degradation. For PCR cloning total RNA was extracted from developing corn seeds, barley leaves, and tomato leaves according to standard protocols (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA of all three tissues was used in a reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Titan TM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the following primers: upstream, 5′-CAA GAA CTT TAC GT(A/C/G/T) TA(T/C) GA(A/G)-3′; downstream, 5′-dT23(C/G)(A/C/G/T)-3′. The following temperature program was used: 30 min at 42 °C for the reverse transcription reaction followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were blunt end-ligated into pBSK Bluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. The clone pTomAOC4 was used as a probe to screen 5 × 105 plaque-forming units of a cDNA library made of 5 μg of mRNA from a tomato cell culture using the λ-ZAP cDNA library kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization was performed at 65 °C in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 3 h, followed by hybridization at 65 °C overnight with the 32P-labeled insert from clone pTomAOC4 in the prehybridization solution. Filters were washed three times at 65 °C in 2× SSC plus 0,1% SDS for 15 min each. Positive plaques were purified and converted into phagemids by in vivo excision. Sequence analysis of plasmid and phagemid clones was performed with the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using the Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Either the whole coding region or a 5′-deletion starting at nucleotide 235 as seen in Fig. 2 was amplified by PCR with a 5′ NdeI and a 3′ EcoRI restriction site, respectively, and cloned into the cloning sites of the expression vector pJC20 and pJC40 (29.Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were introduced into the host strain BL21DE3(pLysS). The bacteria were grown in LB medium up to an A 600 of 0.5 absorbance units and induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation, subjected to two freeze thaw cycles, and lysed by sonication in 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol. The extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for the determination of AOC activity. The enzyme activity was either determined using the radioactivity assay as described by Ziegleret al. (19.Ziegler J. Hamberg M. Miersch O. Parthier B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or by estimating the enantiomeric composition of OPDA according to Ref. 26.Ziegler J. Wasternack C. Hamberg M. Lipids. 1999; 34: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. The recombinant protein expressed in pJC40 was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Quiagen), and the purity was checked by SDS-PAGE. The purified recombinant AOC was used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. 5–10 μg of genomic DNA were digested with restriction enzymes and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Southern blotting onto nylon membranes was performed as described by the manufacturer. For genetic mapping, 47 F2 plants were used from the mapping population described (30.Tanksley S.D. Ganal M.W. Prince J.P. de Vicente M.C. Bonierbale M.W. Bround P. Fulton T.M. Giovannoni J.J. Grandillo S. Martin G.B. Genetics. 1992; 132: 1141-1160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Onto this interspecific population (L. esculentum ×Lycopersicon pennellii) more than 1000 markers have been mapped previously. Since DNA from the same plants was used, the mapping data could be integrated into this map. The hybridization of the AOC gene and the integration into the mapping framework were done according to standard procedures (30.Tanksley S.D. Ganal M.W. Prince J.P. de Vicente M.C. Bonierbale M.W. Bround P. Fulton T.M. Giovannoni J.J. Grandillo S. Martin G.B. Genetics. 1992; 132: 1141-1160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small pieces of young leaves were fixed, embedded in polyethylene glycol, and cut as described (31.Hause B. Demus U. Teichmann C. Parthier B. Wasternack C. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cross-sections (2-μm thickness) were immunolabeled by incubation with rabbit anti-AOC antibodies (diluted 1:2000) followed by a goat anti-rabbit-IgG antibody conjugated with BODIPY (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After immunolabeling, sections were mounted in citifluor/glycerol. Control experiments were performed by using preimmune serum. The fluorescence of immunolabeled AOC was visualized with a Zeiss “Axioskop” epifluorescence microscope using the proper filter combination. From the sequencing of the purified corn AOC protein (19.Ziegler J. Hamberg M. Miersch O. Parthier B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), one internal sequence of 6 amino acids (SPAYLR) and two N-terminal peptides (AKDARPTKVQELYVYEIN and KAKDARPTKVQELYVYEI) were obtained. The latter were almost identical and only differed by one additional Lys residue at the N-terminal end. Previously, a dimeric nature of AOC was suggested by the molecular size of about 48 kDa as estimated by gel filtration compared with the migration of the AOC protein as a 22-kDa band on SDS-PAGE (19.Ziegler J. Hamberg M. Miersch O. Parthier B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The finding of two almost identical N-terminal peptides supports the suggestion that AOC is a homodimeric protein. Additionally, both N-terminal sequences lack the start methionine residue. This could be caused by post-translational processing, which might be necessary for dimer formation or for the transport across intracellular membranes. The obtained peptide sequences served as templates for the generation of oligonucleotide primers to perform a reverse transcriptase-PCR-based cloning approach for AOC. As upstream primers, degenerate oligonucleotides directed against different regions of the N-terminal sequence were used, whereas for the downstream primer, an oligo(dT) anchor was chosen. Since developing corn seeds showed a high AOC activity, we used the RNA from that tissue as a template. Irrespective of the primer combinations and PCR conditions, no specific PCR fragment could be amplified, suggesting that either the peptide information is not specific enough to amplify the desired product or that the mRNA is of very low abundance or even absent in this tissue. In order to exclude the second possibility as far as possible, we focused on tissues, where an accumulation of endogenous JA levels can be induced, presumably preceded by an increase in AOC expression. Therefore, sorbitol-stressed barley leaf segments (32.Lehmann J. Atzorn R. Brückner C. Reinbothe S. Leopold J. Wasternack C. Parthier B. Planta. 1995; 197: 156-162Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and wounded tomato leaves (33.Peña-Cortés H. Fisahn J. Willmitzer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4106-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) were used as a source for RNA. No specific PCR products were obtained with the barley RNA, but reverse transcriptase-PCR with RNA from wounded tomato leaves resulted in a weak band of about 850 bp. Sequencing of this PCR fragment revealed that it also encodes the internal sequence of six amino acids obtained from the purified corn protein. This PCR product was used as a probe to screen a tomato cDNA library, resulting in the isolation of a 1-kilobase pair clone. This size approximately corresponds to the size of the signal detected on the Northern blots, suggesting that a full-length cDNA clone was obtained. The first start codon in frame with the peptide sequences from the purified corn AOC is located at position 47 and is preceded by a stop codon at position 16. The protein coding region encompasses 732 bp encoding a protein of 244 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 26 kDa (Fig.2). The difference of about 4 kDa between the deduced molecular mass of the tomato protein and that from the subunit of the purified corn enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE could, in part, be due to the post-translational removal of amino acids at the N terminus. In order to identify the protein encoded by the cDNA clone as an AOC, we performed overexpression to measure AOC activity. At first, the whole coding region was cloned into the expression vector pJC20 and, for purification, into the His tag vector pJC40. After induction by isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside, only a low expression of the recombinant protein was observed on SDS-PAGE, but after Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography of the His-tagged protein, one band of the expected size of 26 kDa could be detected. However, neither the crude bacterial extracts nor the purified protein showed AOC activity. Considering that the purified protein from corn was N-terminally processed, the lack of enzymatic activity in the full-length tomato protein could be due to the failure of the right post-translational modification in the bacteria. To explore this possibility, we amplified a fragment from the tomato sequence, which produces a truncated protein starting at amino acid residue 64. This corresponds in length to the processed N terminus of the purified corn protein. In that case, the start codon was introduced by a NdeI restriction site. After induction of the bacteria, SDS-PAGE revealed a prominent band of 22 kDa that was absent in control bacteria transformed only with the empty vector (Fig.3). The same band was also observed in noninduced bacteria, which might be due to an insufficient repression of the bacterial expression system in the absence of inducer. The bacterial extracts were then examined for AOC activity. As shown in Table I, the control bacteria showed no activity at all, whereas in induced, transformed bacteria a high specific activity of about 15,000 nmol of OPDA/mg of protein was detected. As expected from the protein pattern on SDS-PAGE, the noninduced bacteria also showed AOC activity, but in this case a 10-fold lower specific activity was obtained. The AOC activity of the recombinant protein was sensitive to proteinase K digestion and was inhibited by 12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid, a specific AOC inhibitor (19.Ziegler J. Hamberg M. Miersch O. Parthier B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Ziegler J. Wasternack C. Hamberg M. Lipids. 1999; 34: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which further supports the specificity of the recombinant protein. One special feature of the AOC reaction is the competition between the chemical decomposition of the unstable allene oxide substrate, giving rise to racemic OPDA and the enzymatic conversion to enantiomeric OPDA. Therefore, the ultimate identification for a protein as AOC can only be achieved by the proof that the enzyme specifically forms (9S,13S)-OPDA. The steric analysis of the reaction products showed that the recombinant protein almost exclusively forms the (9S,13S)-OPDA enantiomer. Proteinase K digestion and the addition of 12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid decreased the amount of that OPDA enantiomer to levels seen after chemical decomposition. Altogether, the results on the AOC activity showed that the isolated clone from tomato codes for AOC. Interestingly, the specific activity of the N-terminal, His-tagged protein expressed in the pJC40 vector was about 10-fold lower than that of the untagged protein. Together with the observation that only the truncated protein was active, it seems possible that additional amino acids at the N terminus might somehow impair dimer formation.Table IAllene oxide cyclase activity and enantiomeric composition of 12-oxophytodienoic acid produced by the recombinant truncated allene oxide cyclaseSpecific AOC activityPercentage (S/S) of total OPDAnmol of OPDA × mg−1 proteinaDue to the assay design, AOC activity could only be calculated by end point measurements of OPDA.Percentagenmol/mg%%pJC20/pJC40Only chemical049pJC20 + insert (no IPTG)1202755pJC20 + insert + IPTG15,74110096 with proteinase K944651 with inhibitor (100 μm)1259856pJC40 + insert + IPTG13028NDThe cDNA coding for an N-terminal truncated AOC as described in the legend to Fig. 2 was cloned into the expression vector pJC20 and in the His-tagged vector pJC40.

Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms responsible for normal regulation of insulin secretion from the β-cell, many aspects of this process remain unclear. In particular, chemical and physiological interactions between cells within the islet exert an important level of control in the physiological regulation of insulin secretion that is not entirely understood. Both hormonal and neuronal influences within islets may modulate β-cell activity and insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo (1.Schuit F.C. Derde M.P. Pipeleers D.G. Diabetologia. 1989; 32: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2.Norman A.W. Litwack G. Hormones. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 193-227Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Moens K.

Although such influences have been demonstrated, the existence of significant autocrine effects of insulin on β-cells remained controversial for many years because a variety of studies yielded conflicting evidence on the modulation of insulin secretion by insulin in whole islets orin vivo. Recently, however, a variety of new methods have been utilized that demonstrate potent and possibly clinically important autocrine actions of insulin. Several recent studies have indicated that β-cells express components of insulin signaling systems including insulin receptors (4.Verspohl E.J. Ammon H.P.T. J. Clin.

Evidence has also been obtained indicating that insulin released by glucose can activate these components in addition to other proteins in the cells.

Furthermore, maximal glucose-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), a major product of PI3-K activity, coincides with the early peak phase insulin secretion in islets and clonal β-cells (10.Alter C.A. Wolf B.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, autocrine activation of the β-cell insulin receptors and several downstream proteins has been demonstrated. Some of the physiological consequences of insulin receptor activation at β-cells have recently been revealed. Activation of the insulin signaling pathway in β-cells leads to initiation of insulin synthesis at both transcriptional and translational levels, increasing the cellular content of releasable hormone in primary and clonal β-cell cultures (14.Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol.

Moede T. Berggren P.-O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In βTC6-F7 cells transfected to overexpress the insulin receptor, basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was enhanced compared with kinase negative controls (15.Xu G. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar). In another report, clonal cells lacking the IRS-1 protein showed both decreased insulin content and glucose-stimulated secretion (17.Kulkarni R.N. Winnay J.N. Brüning J.C. Hanahan D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: A57Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These latter studies suggest that insulin can exert positive control over synthesis and/or secretion. Direct evidence for the effects of insulin on insulin secretion has been obtained by application of exogenous insulin to isolated β-cells and detecting secretion by amperometry (18.Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data illustrate that insulin evokes insulin secretion mediated by the insulin receptor and that such positive feedback occurs during glucose stimulation. This report also showed that insulin could evoke an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i). A recent study with clonal β-cells demonstrated that overexpression of IRS-1 and insulin receptor elevated [Ca2+]i levels and enhanced fractional insulin secretion (19.Xu G.G. Gao Z.Y. Borge P.D. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18067-18074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in good agreement with the studies on application of exogenous insulin. The potential in vivo significance of positive autocrine feedback on insulin secretion and synthesis was revealed in experiments in which the gene for the β-cell insulin receptor was inactivated by use of the Cre-loxP system (20.Kulkarni R.N. Brüning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the β-cell insulin receptor had lowered insulin response to glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, suggesting an important role for autocrine signaling in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in vivo. Further evidence for the importance of autocrine action was obtained when a polymorphism in IRS-1 in humans was associated with impaired insulin secretion and pathology of some forms of type 2 diabetes (21.Porzio O. Federici M. Hribal M.L. Lauro D. Accili D. Lauro R. Borboni P. Sesti G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The identical polymorphism expressed in clonal β-cells reduced glucose and sulfonylurea-stimulated insulin secretion. The evidence so far has established that insulin activates the insulin receptor and that this effect results in enhanced insulin synthesis and insulin secretion. Derangement in this process leads to impaired insulin secretion similar to that seen in type 2 diabetes. Such results suggest a potential link between the symptoms of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion found in type 2 diabetes. Given the potential significance of autocrine activation of insulin secretion and [Ca2+]i changes, we have investigated some of the important elements that couple an insulin stimulus to insulin secretion and [Ca2+]i changes and further characterized the source and temporal characteristics of the [Ca2+]i changes. Type XI collagenase, HEPES, thapsigargin, wortmannin, nifedipine, U73122, U73343, bisindolylmaleimide I, and bovine insulin were obtained from Sigma and used without further purification. Fluo-4 acetoxymethylester was from Molecular Probes. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals for islet and cell culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were from Fisher unless noted and were of highest purity available. Islets were isolated from 20–30 g of CD-1 mice. Briefly, islets were isolated by ductal injection with collagenase type XI and dispersed into single cells by shaking in dilute (0.025%) trypsin/EDTA for 8 min at 37 °C. Cells were cultured on 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Nunclon) or 25-mm glass coverslips at 37 °C, 5% CO2, pH 7.4, in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and used on days 2–4 following isolation. Cell lines expressing the IRS-1 protein and IRS-1-specific knockouts were derived from breeding wild-type and IRS-1 (−/−) mice with mice expressing the SV40 T antigen (RIP-Tag) on a β-cell-specific promoter similar to the procedure used by Efrat et al. (22.Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9037-9341Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) to derive βTC3 cells. Tumors from 12–14-week-old RIP-Tag/IRS-1(+/−) and RIP-Tag/IRS-1(−/−) mice were manually dissected and placed in DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. The tumor capsule was disrupted, and the cells were gently dispersed with forceps. Tumor cells were purified by gravity sedimentation and seeded in a 48-well plate containing DMEM. IRS-1 (+/−) and IRS(−/−) clonal cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence and split 1:3 in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. βTC3 cells were cultured in 200-ml tissue culture flasks in DMEM containing 25 mm d-glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were passaged with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA at 70% confluence and plated onto 35-mm tissue culture plates (Nunclon) for single cell experiments. Cells were used on days 2–4 following passage. Microelectrodes were constructed of carbon fibers sealed in glass micropipettes and were polished to a 45° angle and cleaned prior to use (23.Huang L. Shen H. Atkinson M.A. Kennedy R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9608-9612Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24.Aspinwall C.A. Brooks S.A. Kennedy R.T. Lakey J.R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31308-31314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Amperometric measurements were made by positioning microelectrodes ∼1 μm from a cell and applying stimulant from a micropipette ∼ 30 μm from the cell as described elsewhere (23.Huang L. Shen H. Atkinson M.A. Kennedy R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9608-9612Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24.Aspinwall C.A. Brooks S.A. Kennedy R.T. Lakey J.R.T. J. Biol.

All experiments were performed with cells at 37 °C incubated in pH 7.4 Kreb's Ringer buffer (KRB) containing 118 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 3 mm d-glucose, and 20 mm HEPES. Stimulant solutions (100 nminsulin, 17 mm glucose, or 200 μmtolbutamide) were prepared by diluting appropriate stock solutions into KRB. Amperometry was performed using a battery to apply potential to a sodium-saturated calomel reference electrode as described previously (24.Aspinwall C.A. Brooks S.A. Kennedy R.T. Lakey J.R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31308-31314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For measurements of 5-hydrotryptamine (5-HT) secretion, dispersed β-cells were incubated in tissue culture medium containing 0.5 mm 5-hydroxytryptophan for 16 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Cells were used for secretion experiments immediately after loading. For detection of 5-HT, the potential at the working electrode was 0.65 V versus sodium-saturated calomel reference electrode. Data were low pass filtered at 100 Hz and collected at 500 Hz using a personal computer (Gateway 2000 P5–166) via a data acquisition board (Axon Instruments, DigiData 1200B). For amperometric data analysis, current spikes were used only if the signal-to-noise ratio was >10. All imaging experiments were performed on a Nikon RCM 8000 laser scanning confocal microscope, consisting of a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope, an argon-ion laser (INNOVA Enterprise 622, Coherent), associated optics, and mechanical and computer control units. Prior to imaging experiments, 25-mm coverslips containing adherent cells were loaded with 1 μm fluo-4 acetoxymethylester in KRB for 30 min at 37 °C. Dye solution was then replaced with KRB, and coverslips with adherent cells were placed into a 35-mm coverslip holder for immediate use. Temperature was maintained at 37 °C on the stage of the microscope through the use of a microincubator (Medical Systems, Corp., Greenvale, NY) and temperature controller (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Experimental buffers were the same composition as those used for amperometric measurements. Images were collected at 1 Hz (average of 32 frames) through a Nikon 40×, (NA 1.15) water immersion objective and 520 ± 10 nm band pass filter using the 488-nm excitation line of the laser. Images were stored on an optical disc cartridge (TQ-FH332, Panasonic) for later analysis. Confocal fluorescent images were played back from the optical disc cartridge, captured, and analyzed using Simca image analysis software (C-IMAGING Systems, Cranberry Township, PA) in combination with an 8-bit frame grabber. Regions of interest (ROI) consisting of either the entire cell or localized intracellular regions were drawn by free hand and applied to a series of images. The average intensity of the ROI was measured as a function of frame number. Because fluo-4 is a single wavelength dye, its emission is a function of both [Ca2+ ]i and dye concentration. [Ca2+ ]i changes were therefore expressed as F 1/F 0 ratios where F 0 was the fluorescence intensity of the initial image during the recording (25.Guerineau N.C. Bonnefont X. Stoeckel L. Mollard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26.Chanson M. Mollard P. Meda P. Suter S. Jongsma H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 282-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ca2+ response was analyzed as a percentage of increase compared with basal, and the amount of insulin secretion was analyzed as spikes per stimulation. All means are reported as ± 1 S.E. Statistical differences between means were evaluated using a two-tailed Student's ttest. For amperometric experiments, mouse β-cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin and exocytosis of 5-HT detected by amperometry to establish viability. Following successful repetitive stimulation with insulin, 100 nm wortmannin, 1 μm thapsigargin, 20 μm nifedipine, 10 μm U73122, or 2 μm bisindolylmaleimide I was added to the buffer and allowed to incubate for 5–10 min. The same cell was then stimulated again with insulin in the presence of the chemical added. For the [Ca2+ ]i imaging experiments, cells were stimulated by 100 μm tolbutamide for 5 s to establish viability. Cells that responded to tolbutamide were then stimulated with 100 nm insulin, and temporal changes of [Ca2+ ]i were monitored by fluo-4 fluorescence. Treatment with inhibitors was similar as in amperometric measurements. Before insulin stimulation, a control KRB stimulation was applied to the cell to ensure that Ca2+ changes and insulin secretion were not due to artifacts associated with the buffer application. We had previously reported that application of insulin to dispersed β-cells evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i(18.Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Our initial experiments were to further characterize this change in [Ca2+]i at single cells. As shown in Fig.1, application of 100 nminsulin, but not buffer solution, results in increased [Ca2+]i as monitored by fluo-4 fluorescence. Fig.1 C illustrates further analysis of the images shown in Fig.1 (A and B) as a plot of relative fluorescence intensity (F1/F0) within the cell as a function of time. Insulin induced increases in [Ca2+]iwere observed in 37 of 85 cells tested. All cells that were included in this sampling had first responded with a [Ca2+]irise after tolbutamide stimulation. The cells that responded to insulin displayed a variety of temporal patterns of [Ca2+]i changes (Fig.2). Of the 37 cells that responded to insulin, 9 (24%) exhibited biphasic or oscillatory response similar to that in Fig. 1 C or 2 D, 9 cells (24%) showed a transient peak response (Fig. 2 A), 14 cells (38%) generated an elevated plateau of [Ca2+]i that lasted more than one minute after stimulation (Fig. 2 B), and 5 cells (14%) had a slow increase of [Ca2+]i that did not peak or plateau after 2 min (Fig. 2 C). The maximal [Ca2+]i increase induced by insulin was significantly smaller than that typically induced by a depolarizing stimuli, 200 μm tolbutamide (Fig. 2, D andE), and occurred with a much slower onset than that observed with tolbutamide. The latency of responses to insulin was 12 ± 10 s, whereas that for tolbutamide was 1.5 ± 1 s. The heterogeneity of temporal pattern is similar to that reported previously for single cell studies of [Ca2+]ichanges induced by glucose in β-cells (27.Theler J.-M. Mollard P. Guerineau N. Vacher P. Pralong W.F. Schlegel W. Wollheim W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18110-18117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Different patterns for the time course of Ca2+ response to insulin stimulation as monitored by fluo-4 fluorescence.

E, comparison of maximal increase caused by application of 200 μm tolbutamide for 5 s compared to application of 100 nm insulin at same cells.Bars in A–D indicate the application of stimulant to the cell. A solid bar is for application of 100 nm insulin, and a dashed bar is for 200 μm tolbutamide. Control in A–C is application of KRB to the cell for the same time as the insulin. 5 min was allowed between stimulations at a cell.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relatively low success rate for insulin stimulation compared with tolbutamide stimulation is apparently due to cellular heterogeneity and the difficulty of detecting the insulin-induced signals. Cells that did not respond to insulin (n = 48) only gave a 72 ± 11% increase in [Ca2+]i with tolbutamide stimulation, whereas cells that did have a positive response to insulin (n = 37) averaged a 215 ± 38% increase in [Ca2+]i with tolbutamide stimulation. Thus, the nonresponding cells also had a statistically significant (p < 0.001) lower Ca2+ response to tolbutamide. Furthermore, the magnitude of the peak Ca2+response for insulin stimulation is small, averaging <30% that of the tolbutamide (Fig. 2 E). This small signal means that the insulin responses were more difficult to detect than tolbutamide responses. Thus, some of the cells that were counted as not responding may simply have had small responses that were not detectable. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the nonresponding cells consistently yielded lower [Ca2+]i responses to tolbutamide. In 18 (∼50%) of the cells that responded to insulin, the [Ca2+]i increase appeared initially in the interior of the cell rather than at the edge of the cell (Fig.1 B). In the remaining cells, the [Ca2+]i increase was observed simultaneously all across the cell, suggesting that the temporal resolution of the measurement was too low to locate the initiation of [Ca2+]i because of rapid diffusion of the Ca2+. A plot of the relative intensities (F 1/F 0) for the cell interior and the cytoplasm near the cell membrane is compared in Fig.1 D, which shows a higher [Ca2+]iincrease in the interior region. The observation of larger [Ca2+]i increase in the cell interior is in contrast to Ca2+ imaging performed with depolarizing stimuli, such as glucose, that display higher [Ca2+]i increases at the edge of the cell because of Ca2+ entry through l-type Ca2+channels (27.Theler J.-M. Mollard P. Guerineau N. Vacher P. Pralong W.F. Schlegel W. Wollheim W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18110-18117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent localization of the Ca2+changes observed following application of insulin suggests that the increase in [Ca2+]i is a result of mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores. This conclusion was further supported by the observation that the magnitude of [Ca2+]i changes were unaffected by removing extracellular Ca2+ from the medium or by including 20 μm nifedipine, a blocker of l-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, in the medium (Fig.4 B). In addition, cells treated with 1 μmthapsigargin, a potent inhibitor of the SERCA pump that depletes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores of Ca2+, had significantly lower insulin-induced [Ca2+]ichanges (Figs. 3 C and4 B) than control cells. These data suggest that the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by insulin is a result of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, especially the ER.Figure 3Effects of thapsigargin on insulin-stimulated insulin secretion and [Ca2+]i changes. A, amperometric detection of 5-HT exocytosis from single β-cell upon stimulation with 100 nm insulin in the absence of thapsigargin.

C, typical insulin induced [Ca2+]i traces of a cell in the absence of thapsigargin (trace 1) and a cell that had been incubated with 1 μm thapsigargin for 5 min (trace 2) before stimulation. Bars under traces indicate application of stimulant. Fluorescent data were collected and plotted as described in the legends to Figs. 1 and 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After observing intracellular Ca2+ mobilization following insulin stimulation, we investigated the possible requirement of Ca2+ mobilization on insulin-stimulated exocytosis. Exocytosis was monitored by amperometrically detecting release of 5-HT that had been allowed to accumulate in the secretory granules of the β-cells. The 5-HT method was used instead of direct detection of insulin at a modified electrode (23.Huang L. Shen H. Atkinson M.A. Kennedy R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9608-9612Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) because of the relative simplicity of this approach, especially for autocrine studies. The validity of the 5-HT method has been established by previous studies that demonstrated: 1) detection of exocytosis with a variety of insulin secretogogues (24.Aspinwall C.A. Brooks S.A.

Chem. 1996; 270: 3498-3505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar); 2) that insulin and 5-HT are released exclusively from the same vesicles (30.Aspinwall C.A. Huang L. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 5551-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); and 3) that direct detection of insulin and detection of 5-HT give comparable results for insulin stimulation (18.Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6360-6365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.3 A, application of 100 nm insulin to a single, isolated β-cell results in detection of a series of current spikes at the microelectrode indicative of exocytosis and subsequent detection of packets of 5-HT diffusing to the electrode (24.Aspinwall C.A.

Incubation of cells with 1 μm thapsigargin completely abolished insulin-induced exocytosis in all cells tested (n = 4; Figs. 3B and 4 A). In addition, insulin-stimulated insulin secretion, measured as number of exocytosis events detected per stimulation per cell, was not significantly affected by removal of extracellular Ca2+ or by treatment with 20 μmnifedipine (Fig. 4 A). The results from the thapsigargin treatment suggest an important role for Ca2+ released from the ER in evoking secretion. In addition, the Ca2+-free and nifedipine results indicate a minor, if any, role for extracellular Ca2+ entering the cell in insulin activation of exocytosis. We have previously demonstrated that insulin-stimulated insulin secretion in β-cells is mediated by β-cell insulin receptors (18.Aspinwall C.A. Lakey J.R.T. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13661-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To better understand the unique functional role of the α4 isoform, we report here an in-depth analysis of this Na,K-ATPase isoform in the rat. Our experiments show that it is expressed specifically in the mid-piece of the flagellum of mature sperm cells and that inhibition of the α4 isoform alone eliminates sperm motility, demonstrating for the first time a critical role for this isoform in normal sperm function. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method (Tri-Reagent, Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Total RNA samples (10 μg/sample) were denatured in 1 m glyoxal, 54% Me2SO, and 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8); separated using a 1% agarose gel in 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer; and then transferred to Sure Blot® nylon membrane (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY). Northern blots were screened for expression of α isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase using isoform-specific probes (17.James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Quantitation of mRNA levels was determined by exposing32P-labeled blots to a phosphor screen. Phosphor screens were scanned using a Storm 840 scanner and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Densitometry results were corrected to levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and are reported as mean volume integrated values ± S.E. between samples from three animals. Microsome preparation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (17.James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L.

Biol. 1999; 169: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) using the following dilutions of primary antibody: 0.5 μg/ml αb4 (20.Woo A.L. James P.F. Lingrel J.B J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), 1:1000 of α1 isoform-specific monoclonal antibody α6F (University of Iowa Developmental Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), 1:500 of α2 isoform-specific monoclonal antibody McB2 (generous gift from K. Sweadner), and 1:1000 of α3 isoform-specific monoclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO). Quantitation of protein expression levels was performed using scanned Western blots and ImageQuant software. Densitometry results are reported as mean volume integrated values ± S.E. between samples from three animals. Testes were harvested from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) and immediately placed in HistoPrepTM-buffered 10% Formalin (Fisher) overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were washed three times in PBS,1 dehydrated in ethanol, and stored in 80% ethanol until paraffin embedding. Tissue sections were cut at a thickness of 8–10 μm, fixed to glass slides (Fisher Premium Brand glass slides), and stored at 4 °C until further use. Immmunohistochemical staining of testis sections was performed as follows. Tissue sections were deparaffinized by washing in HemoD (Fisher) three times, rehydrated in a series of ethanol washes from 100 to 70%, and placed in PBS. Slides were then incubated in methanol containing 0.5% hydrogen peroxide for removal of endogenous peroxidase activity. Tissue sections were blocked for nonspecific binding by incubation in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum for 1 h and then placed in a solution containing αb4 (5.0 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. To observe secondary antibody interactions with tissue sections, additional slides were incubated overnight in the absence of primary antibody. The next day, sections were washed (0.1 m PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) and then exposed to biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. At the end of the hour, sections were washed before incubation with an avidin-biotin complex (Vector Labs, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were washed one final time, rinsed briefly in 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 6.0), incubated with diaminobenzidine for 4 min, rinsed briefly in Tris buffer (pH 7.6), incubated in a Tris cobalt solution (pH 7.2) for 4 min, and then placed in deionized water. Stained tissue sections were dehydrated in a series of ethanol washes from 70 to 100%, and coverslips were mounted using Permount (Fisher) diluted 1:1 with xylene. The whole epididymis was removed from adult (8–12 weeks of age) Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and placed in PBS. Epididymis tubules were carefully minced, and sperm were allowed to swim out freely into the buffer for 15 min at room temperature. The tissue was then removed, and sperm were either pelleted by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C or fixed to glass slides for immunocytochemical analysis. Sperm microsomes were prepared from frozen cell pellets as described for testis microsomes. Aliquots of sperm were fixed to glass slides overnight in HistoPrepTM-buffered 10% Formalin at 4 °C. The next morning, slides were washed in PBS and then used for immunocytochemical analysis. Diaminobenzidine detection of the α4 isoform in isolated sperm cells was performed from this point on as described above for the immunohistochemical analysis of testis sections. For immunofluorescent detection of the α4 isoform, slides were blocked for nonspecific binding by incubation in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2% normal donkey serum and then placed in a solution containing αb4 (5.0 μg/ml). Immunofluorescent detection of the α1 isoform required exposure of cells to PBS containing 2% SDS for 15 min, several washes in PBS, and then incubation in a solution containing α6F (1:100). On the third day, slides were washed (0.1 m PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) before incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody, either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or Texas Red® dye-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (both from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) diluted 1:100 for at least 1 h. Slides were washed a final time, and coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs, Inc.) for visualization of nuclei. Fluorescently labeled sperm cells were examined and photographed using an Axioplan 2 and Axiophot 2 light microscope equipped for fluorescence visualization (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). All ouabain binding competition assays were performed as described previously (20.Woo A.L. James P.F. Lingrel J.B J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22.Kuntzweiler T.A. Argüello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29682-29687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Three different sets of sperm microsomes from individual animals were analyzed to characterize each protein-ligand interaction. Purified sheep kidney enzyme was used as a positive control for individual assays. The K D for ouabain binding and IC50 values for Na+ and K+competition were determined as described previously (20.Woo A.L. James P.F. Lingrel J.B J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22.Kuntzweiler T.A. Argüello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29682-29687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and errors reported are the S.E. values from the mean for three samples. Sperm from whole epididymis were obtained as described above from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (23.Seed J. Chapin R.E. Clegg E.D. Dostal L.A. Foote R.H. Hurtt M.E. Klinefelter G.R. Makris S.L.

A drop of the sperm suspension was then diluted in warmed, modified Tyrode's albumin/lactate/pyruvate (TALP) solution (24.Roth T.L. Bush L.M. Wildt D.E. Weiss R.B. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (114 mm NaCl, 3.2 mm KCl, 2 mmNaHCO3, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4H2O, 10 mmsodium lactate, 2 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 0.5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 10 mm HEPES, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V), and 0.2 mm pyruvate). Ouabain solutions were prepared in TALP solution not more than 15 min before use and kept at 35 °C. The percentage of motile sperm in the presence and absence of ouabain was determined using a hemocytometer to count duplicate samples in varied order. Motility was assessed every hour by counting at least 200 sperm/sample, and sperm with any flagellar movement were scored as motile (25.Johnson L.R. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26.Wadi S.A. Ahmad G. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1999; 56: 513-521Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The assay was performed on five different animals on separate days. The results from 1 day's experiment, in duplicate, are shown and are representative of data collected in every experiment. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for duplicate samples from one animal on 1 day's experiment. Statistical analyses of differences in sperm motility in ouabain compared with sperm motility in buffer alone were performed using unpaired Student's t test with equal variance. A variety of changes occur in the mammalian testis as it matures into a sexually active adult, including initiation of testosterone production, establishment of the blood-testis barrier, and spermatogenesis (27.Pelliniemi L.J. Frojdman K. Paranko J. de Kretser D. Molecular Biology of the Male Reproductive System. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 21-66Google Scholar,28.Howards S.S. Lipshultz L.I. Niederberger C.S. Lamb D.J. Infertility in the Male. 3rd Ed. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St. Louis, MO1997: 106-110Google Scholar). One of the first indications of sexual maturity is the production of mature sperm, called spermatozoa, in testis, an event that occurs in the rat at the average age of 33–35 days (29.Nalbandov A.V. Reproductive Physiology: Comparative Reproductive Physiology of Domestic Animals, Laboratory Animals, and Man. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1964: 201Google Scholar). Determination of the stage of sexual maturity during which the α4 isoform is produced will provide useful information concerning its functional role in testis. Therefore, we began by examining its expression in both immature and mature animals, ages 2–12 weeks, at both the RNA and protein levels. Examination of total RNA isolated from testes from these animals revealed that the α4 isoform is not expressed until 4 weeks and reaches a maximum level, approximately three times the original amount, at 6 weeks (Fig. 1, A andB). The ubiquitous α1 isoform, on the other hand, is expressed at a constant level throughout the life of the animal (Fig.1 A). Western analysis of the α4 isoform protein levels in these testes revealed that it is not present in testis until after 4 weeks, subsequent to which it increases almost 3-fold, whereas the α1 isoform is constantly present (Fig. 1, C and D). The α4 isoform is therefore not omnipresent in testis; rather, its expression is regulated in parallel to the onset of sexual maturity. Immunohistochemistry was next used to define the localization of expression of the α4 isoform in rat testis. Structurally, the testis divides into three regions, the membranous tunica albuginea that envelops the testis, the coiled seminiferous tubules, and the interstitium (28.Howards S.S. Lipshultz L.I. Niederberger C.S. Lamb D.J. Infertility in the Male. 3rd Ed. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St. Louis, MO1997: 106-110Google Scholar). The seminiferous tubules contain populations of both somatic cells, called Sertoli cells, and germ cells, which, beginning at puberty in mammals, develop and mature through the process of spermatogenesis (27.Pelliniemi L.J. Frojdman K. Paranko J. de Kretser D. Molecular Biology of the Male Reproductive System. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 21-66Google Scholar, 28.Howards S.S. Lipshultz L.I. Niederberger C.S. Lamb D.J. Infertility in the Male. 3rd Ed. Mosby-Year Book, Inc., St. Louis, MO1997: 106-110Google Scholar). Spermatogenesis begins with round, immature germ cells and results in the production of elongated, mature sperm, which are released into the luminal space (30.Becker W.M. Deamer D.W. The World of the Cell. 2nd Ed. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 677Google Scholar). Intermediate forms of germ cells undergoing spermatogenesis include both round spermatocytes and elongating spermatids (30.Becker W.M. Deamer D.W. The World of the Cell. 2nd Ed. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 677Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical examination of adult testis sections identified the α4 isoform in mature sperm, and no staining that indicates expression of the α4 isoform in any other cell type, including Sertoli and Leydig cells, was observed (Fig.2 A). In addition, immunoreactivity of the secondary antibody alone in testis was nonexistent (Fig. 2 B). The expression of the α4 isoform in mature sperm suggests that it must be present in germ cells in earlier stages of spermatogenesis since mature sperm synthesize little to no new protein. Because spermatozoa represent a large population of cells in these adult testis sections, the strong α4 isoform-specific staining in these cells may mask the expression of this isoform in smaller populations of germ cells such as spermatocytes and spermatids. Before the onset of spermatogenesis, spermatogonia are the only germ cells present in the mammalian testis (29.Nalbandov A.V. Reproductive Physiology: Comparative Reproductive Physiology of Domestic Animals, Laboratory Animals, and Man. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1964: 201Google Scholar, 30.Becker W.M. Deamer D.W. The World of the Cell. 2nd Ed. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., New York1991: 677Google Scholar). Testes of animals in which spermatogenesis has recently begun contain only early to intermediate developmental stages of germ cells, with little to no spermatozoa. Investigation of testes from these animals therefore allows detection of the α4 isoform in developing germ cells in the relative absence of mature sperm. Toward this end, testis sections from animals 3–12 weeks old were examined for expression of the α4 isoform protein, and the presence of mature sperm was determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Testis sections from animals 3 and 4 weeks old do not express the α4 isoform protein (Fig. 2 B), nor do they contain mature, elongating spermatozoa (Fig. 2 B). Examination of testis sections from 6-week-old animals, however, revealed some α4 isoform protein expression in intermediate stages of developing sperm, possibly spermatids, and little to no spermatozoa present (Fig.2 B). Finally, testis sections from animals 8 and 12 weeks old express the α4 isoform protein in spermatozoa (Fig.2 B), similar to the pattern described above for adult testes (Fig. 2 A), and hematoxylin/eosin-stained tissues confirmed the abundance of mature sperm in the seminiferous tubule lumen (Fig.2 B). Again, testis sections incubated with the secondary antibody alone did not show any immunoreactivity (Fig. 2 B). The expression of the α4 isoform protein therefore immediately follows the onset of spermatogenesis, and its expression is localized to mature spermatozoa and some intermediate stages of developing sperm. Microsomes of isolated sperm collected from the epididymis of sexually mature rats were subsequently examined for expression of each of the four α isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase. Western blots containing microsome samples from testis, sperm, red blood cells, and brain were probed individually using α isoform-specific antibodies. These Western blots revealed that sperm express only the α4 and α1 isoforms; and compared with testis, the level of expression of the α4 isoform is very high, whereas that of the α1 isoform is low (Fig.3). As expected, whole testis expresses the α4 and α1 isoforms; red blood cells, included since they are the only cell contaminant in sperm preparations, express only the α1 isoform; and brain expresses the α1, α2, and α3 isoforms (Fig.3). The distributions of the α4 and α1 isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase were next examined in isolated sperm cells. Immunocytochemical localization of the α4 isoform by diaminobenzidine staining identified the α4 isoform specifically in the flagellum of the sperm, most heavily perceived in the mid-piece region of the tail (Fig.4 A). Sperm incubated without primary antibody did not show any staining (Fig. 4 B). Immunofluorescent labeling of the α4 isoform in sperm confirmed this pattern of expression (Fig. 4, C and D). The entire sperm flagellum was examined for α4 isoform expression by sequentially photographing sperm with first the head and then the tail in the focal plane (Fig. 4, C and D). This paired series of photographs showed that regardless of the focal plane, the expression pattern of the α4 isoform protein is localized to the mid-piece of the flagellum, and there is no detectable secondary antibody immunoreactivity (Fig. 4, C, D,F, and G). Visualization of the α1 isoform revealed its location in the same region of the sperm where the α4 isoform was found, whereas nonspecific secondary antibody binding to sperm was undetectable (Fig. 4, E and H). Therefore, both of the α isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase present in sperm are localized to the mid-piece of the flagellum and do not have distinct patterns of localization that are detectable at this level of resolution. The biochemical characteristics of the α4 isoform in sperm were next examined to define any distinguishing characteristics between it and the α1 isoform. Our laboratory (20.Woo A.L. James P.F. Lingrel J.B J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and others (21.Blanco G. Melton R.J. Sanchez G. Mercer R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13661-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have previously measured the biochemical characteristics of the α4 isoform using tissue culture cell expression systems, but it is important to examine this isoform in endogenous cells, as differences in the kinetics of the Na,K-ATPase are not only isoform-specific, but also tissue-specific (31.Munzer J.S.

James P.F. Lingrel J.B J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and are listed here as means ± S.E. between three unique samples: theK D for ouabain binding is 148.50 ± 23.44 nm, the IC50 for Na+ is 6.13 ± 0.62 mm, and the IC50 for K+ is 3.49 ± 0.35 mm. The results presented in this paper thus far have defined the α4 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase to be specific to sperm. The identification of the α4 isoform in spermatozoa and not in spermatogonia suggests that its biological role must be related to a specialized function of mature sperm, e.g. flagellar movement for sperm motility. The Na,K-ATPase is the molecular receptor for cardiac glycosides such as ouabain, which bind to and inhibit the activity of the enzyme (17.James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The effects of ouabain on sperm motility have been previously examined in other species, but the results were interpreted without considering the existence of Na,K-ATPase molecules carrying different α isoforms (33.Nelson L. McGrady A.V. Arch. Androl. 1981; 7: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Two α isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase have now been identified in rat sperm: the high affinity ouabain receptor, α4, and the low affinity ouabain receptor, α1. Because of their different pharmacological properties, the effects of ouabain inhibition of the α4 isoform alone on sperm motility were examined. Freshly isolated epididymal rat sperm were incubated in buffer containing either 1 × 10−5m ouabain, which will inhibit only the α4 isoform, or 1 × 10−2m ouabain, which will inhibit both the α4 and α1 isoforms. The percentage of motile sperm in each ouabain solution was counted each hour and compared with the percentage of motile sperm in buffer alone (Fig. 5). The results fr"
https://openalex.org/W2128325937,"The BRCA1 tumor suppressor has been implicated in a diverse spectrum of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle checkpoint control. CtIP was recently identified as a protein that associates with BRCA1 and two other nuclear factors, CtBP1 and Rb1. To understand the functions of CtIP, we have evaluated its biological properties with respect to those of BRCA1. Our results show that CtIP, like its associated factors, is predominantly a nuclear protein. A subset of the endogenous pool of CtIP polypeptides exists in a protein complex that includes both BRCA1 and the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1). At the protein level, CtIP expression varies with cell cycle progression in a pattern identical to that of BRCA1. Thus, the steady-state levels of CtIP polypeptides, which remain low in resting cells and G1 cycling cells, increase dramatically as dividing cells traverse the G1/S boundary. In contrast to BRCA1, however, the G1/S induction of CtIP expression is mediated primarily by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Finally, the interaction between CtIP and BRCA1 is shown to be stable in the face of genotoxic stress elicited by treatment with UV light, adriamycin, or hydrogen peroxide. Together, these results indicate that CtIP can potentially modulate the functions ascribed to BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and/or cell cycle checkpoint control.

Genet. 1996; 13: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To date, more than 200 different germline mutations of BRCA1 have been implicated in familial breast cancer (reviewed in Ref. 3.Couch F.J. Weber B.L. The Breast Cancer Information CoreHum. Mutat. 1996; 8: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although most of these are frameshift or nonsense mutations that grossly truncate the BRCA1 reading frame, in some cases breast cancer susceptibility has been attributed to more subtle defects that affect the BRCT coding sequences. These include missense mutations that cause single amino acid substitutions in either the first (A1708E) or second (M1775R) BRCT domain and a nonsense mutation that truncates the second BRCT domain by deleting 11 residues from the C terminus of BRCA1 (Y1853Δ). The fact that these mutations confer susceptibility to breast cancer implies that the BRCT domains play a crucial role in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. Although its molecular functions remain obscure, recent studies have implicated BRCA1 in several cellular processes, including cell growth control, transcriptional regulation, and the maintenance of genomic stability (reviewed in Ref. 4.Zhang H. Tombline G. Weber B.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).

In particular, the steady-state levels of BRCA1 products remain low or undetectable in resting cells as well as during the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, as cycling cells traverse the G1/S boundary, the expression of BRCA1 is induced such that the highest steady-state levels of BRCA1 gene products occur during the S and G2/M phases. At the G1/S transition, BRCA1 polypeptides also become hyperphosphorylated and aggregate within distinct nuclear structures (5.Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H.

Consistent with these observations, other lines of evidence implicate BRCA1 in one or more of the checkpoint pathways that control cell cycle progression. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not possess a true ortholog of BRCA1, ectopic expression of human BRCA1 inhibits the growth of budding yeast (14.Humphrey J.S. Salim A. Erdos M.R. Collins F.S. Brody L.C. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this growth inhibition is abolished by tumor-associated lesions in the BRCT domains of BRCA1, including the A1708E and M1775R missense mutations. It has also been reported that overexpression of wild type BRCA1 inhibits S phase progression (15.Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng X.Y. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and that a C-terminal segment of BRCA1 (residues 1293–1863) can ablate the G2/M checkpoint of human mammary epithelial cells, perhaps by dominant-negative inhibition of endogenous BRCA1 (16.Larson J.S. Tonkinson J.L. Lai M.T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3351-3355PubMed Google Scholar). Although sequence-specific DNA recognition by BRCA1 has not been observed, experiments with GAL4p fusion proteins have shown that the C-terminal sequences of BRCA1 affect RNA transcription both in vivo and in vitro. Two groups have reported that a hybrid polypeptide containing the DNA binding domain of GAL4p (residues 1–147) fused to the BRCT sequences of BRCA1 (residues 1528–1863) can activate the transcription of GAL4p-responsive reporter genes and that this transactivation potential is ablated by tumor-associated mutations such as A1708E, M1775R, and Y1853Δ (17.Chapman M.S.

A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Recently, a similar fusion protein that includes GAL4p residues 1–147 and BRCA1 residues 1560–1863 was shown to activate gene transcription in vitro(19.Haile D.T. Parvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2113-2117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and alter chromatin structure in vivo (20.Hu Y.F. Hao Z.L. Li R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that BRCA1 co-purifies with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex (21.Scully R. Anderson S.F.

In addition, a role for BRCA1 in processing nascent RNA transcripts is suggested by the observation that BARD1, a protein that associates with BRCA1 in vivo (25.Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat.

Science. 1999; 285: 1576-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We and others recently showed that BRCA1 interacts with the CtIP polypeptide (27.Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A.

Significantly, the binding of CtIP is mediated by the BRCT domains of BRCA1, and it is abolished by tumor-associated lesions that affect these domains, such as the A1708E, M1775R, and Y1853Δ mutations. Thus, the in vivo interaction of CtIP and BRCA1 is likely to be important for BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. Although the function of CtIP is not known, it was recently shown to bind several other key nuclear regulatory factors, including CtBP1 and Rb1 (29.Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M.

Given their common association with CtIP, it is intriguing that CtBP1 and Rb1 each function as co-repressors of RNA transcription (32.Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C.

Schaeper U. La Regina M. Bayley S. Chinnadurai G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 44.Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To explore the role of CtIP in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression, we have examined the basic biological properties of CtIP with respect to those of BRCA1. Our results indicate that CtIP is a nuclear protein expressed in a cell cycle-specific fashion similar to BRCA1. The highest steady-state levels of CtIP occur during the S and G2 stages of cell cycle progression, at a time when BRCA1 expression is also maximal. In addition, we found that a subset of cellular CtIP polypeptides exist in a protein complex with BRCA1 and its associated protein, BARD1, and that this complex remains stable in cells subjected to genotoxic stress. These data support the notion that CtIP interacts with and modulates the function of BRCA1. The HBL-100, T24, and HCT116 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection. To generate CtIP-specific antibodies, glutathioneS-transferase (GST)1 fusion proteins that contain different segments of human CtIP were produced inEscherichia coli. Each fusion protein was then purified as described below and used to immunize rabbits or mice. The 14-1 mouse monoclonal antibody was raised against a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 278 amino acids of CtIP (residues 620–897). Rabbit polyclonal antisera 210 and 211 were raised against a GST fusion containing the C-terminal 208 amino acids of CtIP (residues 690–897). Rabbit antisera 164 and 614 were generated by immunizing with a GST fusion containing CtIP residues 58–369. The CtIP/pSP6-FLAG expression plasmid was generated by inserting cDNA sequences encoding full-length CtIP into the pSP6-FLAG vector (25.Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). CtIP/pSP6-FLAG was then used as template for in vitrosynthesis of radiolabeled CtIP in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) containing [35S]methionine (ICN). To evaluate the CtIP-specific antibodies, 5-μl aliquots of the programmed lysate were diluted in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), incubated with the appropriate antibody reagent for 1 h at 4 °C, and immunoprecipitated as described below. To prepare mammalian cell lysates, HBL-100 and HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were lyzed in low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% SDS, protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm β-glycerophosphate 5 mm NaF and 0.1 mm vanadate). For immunoprecipitation/co-immunoprecipitation analysis of mammalian cell lysates, the appropriate amount of lysate was co-incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h. After adding 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (20% slurry, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the mixture was rocked at 4 °C for another 1–3 h. The beads were then washed twice with low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer, twice with high salt Nonidet P-40 buffer (1 m NaCl), and twice again with low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer. Finally, the beads were boiled for 10 min in 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue), and the supernatant was fractionated by electrophoresis. The BR-SZ/pSP6-FLAG expression plasmid, which encodes the C-terminal 336 amino acids of BRCA1 (the “SZ fragment,” BRCA1 residues 1528–1863), was generated by inserting BRCA1 cDNA sequences into the pSP6-FLAG vector. BR-SZ/pSP6-FLAG was then used as a template for in vitrosynthesis of the radiolabeled SZ polypeptide in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) containing [35S]methionine (ICN). Plasmids that encode the various GST-CtIP fusion proteins were generated by inserting appropriate CtIP cDNA sequences into the pGEX-KG expression vector (45.Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Each GST-CtIP fusion protein was then expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads, and retained as a 50% slurry in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors. For each GST pull-down assay, a 6-μl aliquot of the radiolabeled SZ fragment was mixed with 60 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (loaded with 20 μg of the appropriate GST-CtIP fusion protein) and 434 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer. Following a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. The bound SZ polypeptides were eluted by boiling the beads for 10 min in 25 μl of loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue). The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Plasmids encoding the various GAL4p and Vp16 hybrid polypeptides were constructed by inserting cDNA sequences into the pCMV-GAL4 and pVP-FLAG5 expression vectors, respectively (25.Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmids encoding wild type or mutant (C61G) versions of full-length BRCA1 were generated by inserting the corresponding cDNA sequences into the pCB6 vector. The mammalian two-hybrid assays were conducted in 293 cells as described (46.Tsan J.T. Wang Z. Jin Y. Hwang L.-Y. Bash R.O. Baer R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 217-232Google Scholar). T24 cells were synchronized and analyzed as described (47.Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Western analyses were conducted using 120 μg of cell lysate for BRCA1 immunoblots and 50 μg for CDK2, cyclin A, and CtIP immunoblots. In addition, total RNA was extracted from cells harvested at each time point, and 20-μg aliquots of RNA were evaluated by Northern filter hybridization. Each filter was hybridized in succession with radiolabeled cDNA probes for CtIP, BRCA1, cyclin A, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH). The intensity of each autoradiographic signal was then evaluated with Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics). Whole cell lysates and the membranous, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fractions were prepared from T24 cells as described (47.Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Equivalent volumes of each fraction (corresponding to 30 μg of whole cell lysate) were evaluated by direct immunoblotting with the CtIP-specific monoclonal antibody 14-1 or with monoclonal antibodies that recognize NuMA or α-tubulin (Santa Cruz). For detection of BRCA1, equivalent volumes of each fraction (corresponding to 200 μg of whole cell lysates) were immunoprecipitated with a BRCA1-specific antiserum (25.Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.-C.W. Hwang L.-Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the BRCA1-specific MS110 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) (9.Scully R. Ganesan S. Brown M. Caprio J.A.D. Cannistra S.A. Feunteun J. Schnitt S. Livingston D.M. Science. 1996; 272: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 107 cells were seeded onto each 150-mm culture dish. When the cultures reached 50–70% confluence (usually about 24 h after plating), the cells were subjected to genotoxic stress. For UV irradiation, six dishes of cells were washed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to 10 J/m2 UV light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene). The irradiated cells were then supplied with fresh tissue culture media and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 1 h before harvest. For adriamycin treatment, four dishes of cells were provided with fresh tissue culture medium containing 0.2 μg/ml adriamycin (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before harvest. For hydrogen peroxide treatment, six dishes of cells were provided with fresh tissue culture medium containing 10 mmhydrogen peroxide (48.Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). After incubating at 37 °C for 15 min, the cells were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline, supplied with fresh tissue culture medium without hydrogen peroxide, and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 1 h before harvest. To detect CtIP, 50-μg aliquots of the harvested cell lysate were subjected to Western analysis with the CtIP-specific 14-1 monoclonal antibody. To detect p53 and actin, 10-μg aliquots of the same lysates were immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody reagent (Santa Cruz). One-mg aliquots of the lysates were used to detect changes in the mobility of the p220 BRCA1 polypeptide (11.Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). We had previously shown that exogenous CtIP molecules associate in vivo with the endogenous BRCA1 polypeptides of mammalian cells (27.Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25388-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To establish whether endogenous CtIP also interacts with endogenous BRCA1, it was necessary to generate immunological reagents that specifically recognize CtIP. Therefore, three distinct segments of CtIP were expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with GST (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each fusion protein was purified and used as an immunogen to generate either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. The antibody reagents were then tested for immunoprecipitation of full-length CtIP polypeptides synthesized byin vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. Fig. 1shows that radiolabeled CtIP, which migrates with an apparent molecular weight of ∼120 kilodaltons upon SDS-PAGE, was immunoprecipitated with rabbit antisera raised against sequences from either the N-terminal (antiserum 164; CtIP residues 58–369) or C-terminal (antiserum 210; CtIP residues 690–897) halves of CtIP (lanes 2 and7, respectively) but not with the corresponding pre-immune sera (lanes 1 and 6). Radiolabeled CtIP was also immunoprecipitated by a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against CtIP residues 620–897 (antibody 14-1) (lane 12). As expected, immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled CtIP by antiserum 210 and monoclonal antibody 14-1, both of which recognize C-terminal sequences of CtIP, was blocked by an excess of the GST-CtIP(620–897) fusion protein (lanes 10 and 14) but not GST alone (lanes 8 and 13) or the GST-CtIP(58–369) fusion protein (lane 9). Likewise, immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled CtIP with antiserum 164, which was raised against an N-terminal segment of CtIP, was blocked by an excess of the immunogen, GST-CtIP(58–369) (lane 4) but not by GST alone (lane 3) or GST-CtIP(620–897) (lane 5). These results indicate that the each of the three antibody reagents recognizes CtIP in a highly specific manner. The rabbit antisera (164 and 210) were then used to immunoprecipitate endogenous CtIP from lysates of HBL-100 cells, an immortalized line of normal human mammary epithelial cells (49.Caron de Fromentel C. Nardeux P.C. Soussi T. Lavialle C. Estrade S. Carloni G. Chandrasekaran K. Cassingena R. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 160: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of CtIP in each immunoprecipitate was determined by immunoblotting with the CtIP-specific monoclonal antibody (14-1). As illustrated in Fig.2, a single endogenous CtIP band of ∼120 kilodaltons was detected in an untreated lysate of HBL-100 cells (lane 1). A band with the same electrophoretic mobility was also obtained by immunoprecipitation with CtIP-specific antisera 164 and 210 (lanes 3 and 7, respectively) but not with the corresponding pre-immune sera (lanes 2 and6, respectively). As expected, immunoprecipitation of endogenous CtIP by antiserum 164 was blocked by an excess of the immunogen, GST-CtIP(58–369) (lane 4), but not by GST alone (lane 5). The efficiency of immunoprecipitation with these antisera can be estimated by comparing the intensities of the CtIP bands obtained by immunoblotting the untreated HBL-100 lysate (lane 1) with those obtained by immunoblotting the HBL-100 immunoprecipitates (lanes 3 and 7). As seen in Fig. 2, approximately 3-fold more CtIP is observed in the immunoprecipitates (lanes 3 and 7) than in 0.1 mg of the untreated HBL-100 cell lysate (lane 1). Since the immunoprecipitates were each derived from 0.3 mg of HBL-100 cell lysate, it could be determined that under these conditions, both antisera immunoprecipitate endogenous CtIP with an efficiency that approaches 100%. The CtIP-specific antibodies were then used to test whether endogenous CtIP and BRCA1 polypeptides interact in vivo. Fig. 3 illustrates a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using a lysate of HBL-100 cells. An aliquot of the lysate (2.5 mg of total cellular protein) was immunoprecipitated with CtIP-specific antiserum 210 (lane 3), and smaller aliquots of the same lysate (0.4 mg) were immunoprecipitated with a BRCA1-specific antiserum (lane 5) or a BARD1-specific antiserum (lane 7). The immunoprecipitates were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of BRCA1 in each immunoprecipitate was determined by Western analysis with a BRCA1-specific monoclonal antibody. As expected, BRCA1 was immunoprecipitated with the BRCA1-specific antiserum (lane 5) and co-immunoprecipitated with the BARD1-specific antiserum (lane 7). Significantly, BRCA1 was also co-immunoprecipitated with the CtIP-specific antiserum (lane 3), but not with the corresponding pre-immune serum (lane 2), confirming that the endogenous BRCA1 and CtIP polypeptides are associated in vivo. Given that the CtIP-specific antisera immunoprecipitate CtIP polypeptides from these lysates quantitatively (Fig. 2), it is possible to estimate the fraction of cellular BRCA1 that exists in a CtIP-bound state. As seen in Fig. 3 A, the intensity of the BRCA1 band co-immunoprecipitated with the CtIP-specific antiserum (lane 3) is approximately 1.5-fold higher than that of the BRCA1 band obtained from 0.2 mg of untreated cell lysate (lane 1). Since the co-immunoprecipitated BRCA1 in lane 3 was derived from 2.5 mg of cell lysate, it can be calculated that roughly one-eighth of the cellular BRCA1 pool is bound to CtIP in unsynchronized HBL-100 cells. In contrast, a comparison of the intensities of the BRCA1 bands in lanes 1 and 7suggests that most BRCA1 polypeptides are associated with BARD1 in HBL-100 cells. A reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment is illustrated in Fig.3 B. In this case, HBL-100 lysates (1.2 mg of total cellular protein) were immunoprecipitated with the BRCA1-specific antiserum, and smaller aliquots of the same lysate (0.36 mg) were immunoprecipitated with CtIP-specific antiserum 210. As shown, end"
https://openalex.org/W1963814857,"We report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a novel human inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase) that has substrate specificity unlike previously described members of this large gene family. All previously described members hydrolyze water soluble inositol phosphates. This enzyme hydrolyzes only lipid substrates, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The cDNA isolated comprises 3110 base pairs and predicts a protein product of 644 amino acids and M r = 70,023. We designate this 5-phosphatase as type IV. It is a highly basic protein (pI = 8.8) and has the greatest affinity toward phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate of known 5-phosphatases. TheK m is 0.65 μm, 1/10 that of SHIP (5.95 μm), another 5-phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. The activity of 5-phosphatase type IV is sensitive to the presence of detergents in the in vitro assay. Thus the enzyme hydrolyzes lipid substrates in the absence of detergents or in the presence of n-octyl β-glucopyranoside or Triton X-100, but not in the presence of cetyltriethylammonium bromide, the detergent that has been used in other studies of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Remarkably SHIP, a 5-phosphatase previously characterized as hydrolyzing only substrates with d-3 phosphates, also readily hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the presence of n-octyl β-glucopyranoside but not cetyltriethylammonium bromide. We used antibodies prepared against a peptide predicted by the cDNA to identify the 5-phosphatase type IV enzyme in human tissues and find that it is highly expressed in the brain as determined by Western blotting. We also performed Western blotting of mouse tissues and found high levels of expression in the brain, testes, and heart with lower levels of expression in other tissues. mRNA was detected in many tissues and cell lines as determined by Northern blotting. We report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a novel human inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase) that has substrate specificity unlike previously described members of this large gene family. All previously described members hydrolyze water soluble inositol phosphates. This enzyme hydrolyzes only lipid substrates, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The cDNA isolated comprises 3110 base pairs and predicts a protein product of 644 amino acids and M r = 70,023. We designate this 5-phosphatase as type IV. It is a highly basic protein (pI = 8.8) and has the greatest affinity toward phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate of known 5-phosphatases. TheK m is 0.65 μm, 1/10 that of SHIP (5.95 μm), another 5-phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. The activity of 5-phosphatase type IV is sensitive to the presence of detergents in the in vitro assay. Thus the enzyme hydrolyzes lipid substrates in the absence of detergents or in the presence of n-octyl β-glucopyranoside or Triton X-100, but not in the presence of cetyltriethylammonium bromide, the detergent that has been used in other studies of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Remarkably SHIP, a 5-phosphatase previously characterized as hydrolyzing only substrates with d-3 phosphates, also readily hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the presence of n-octyl β-glucopyranoside but not cetyltriethylammonium bromide. We used antibodies prepared against a peptide predicted by the cDNA to identify the 5-phosphatase type IV enzyme in human tissues and find that it is highly expressed in the brain as determined by Western blotting. We also performed Western blotting of mouse tissues and found high levels of expression in the brain, testes, and heart with lower levels of expression in other tissues. mRNA was detected in many tissues and cell lines as determined by Northern blotting. inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase 4,5-P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate expressed sequence tag kilobase(s) rapid amplification of cDNA ends high pressure liquid chromatography immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif pleckstrin homology Bruton's tyrosine kinase phosphatidylinositol glycerophosphorylinositols cetyltriethylammonium bromide Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5-phosphatases)1 comprise a large family of enzymes that cleave the 5 position phosphate of several inositol phosphates and lipids including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P3) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P2) (1.Majerus P.W.

There are eight mammalian 5-phosphatases known to date, four yeast enzymes, and two putative 5-phosphatases in Caenorhabditis elegans. Drosophila and arabidopsis genes have also been identified. Deletions of mammalian 5-phosphatases in mice suggest that the enzymes serve mainly nonredundant functions in signaling reactions. Thus deletion of SHIP, a 5-phosphatase expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells, causes a severe myeloid proliferation and infiltration of the lungs (3.Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R.

Deletion of synaptojanin is accompanied by defects in neuronal signaling with a failure to nurse and early demise (4.Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y.

Deletion of OCRL, the gene mutated in Lowe syndrome, has no phenotype. However, when these mice were bred with type II 5-phosphatase-deficient mice, the double knockout resulted in embryonic lethality (5.Janne P.A. Suchy S.F. Bernard D. MacDonald M. Crawley J. Grinberg A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Westphal H. Nussbaum R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2042-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The mammalian 5-phosphatases have been previously classified into four groups based on substrate specificity (1.Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2.Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Group I hydrolyzes only the water soluble inositol phosphate substrates, group II hydrolyzes all four known 5-phosphatase substrates, group III was previously characterized by hydrolysis only of substrates with phosphate in the d-3 position, and group IV was represented as an activity that was specific for hydrolysis of only PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. We now report the cloning and characterization of a type IV enzyme. Initially we found that the enzyme only hydrolyzed PtdIns 3,4,5-P3; however, in further study of recombinant enzyme we find that under some conditions it will also utilize PtdIns 4,5-P2. Because multiple roles for inositol lipids in cell signaling have been reported, this enzyme represents a candidate enzyme for controlling these reactions (6.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar,7.Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The consensus sequences that define 5-phosphatases were used to search the sequence data bases using the BLAST algorithm. An EST from human infant brain, accession numberH10559, was identified as a putative 5-phosphatase. The EST was obtained from ATCC and sequenced. The 1.8-kb EST insert was used to screen a human fetal brain λzapII cDNA library (Stratagene) to obtain an additional sequence. 5′-RACE of human fetal brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions to obtain the 5′-sequence. However, the 5′-region of 5-phosphatase type IV contains a very high percentage of GC residues, including long stretches of multiple GC repeats, leading to secondary structure formation and stalling of the polymerase reaction. To improve the efficiency of amplification of difficult regions, the final polymerase chain reaction mixture contained 1.3 m betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) and 1.3% dimethyl sulfoxide (8.Hengen P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 225-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9.Henke W. Herdel K. Jung K. Schnorr D. Loening S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3957-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with the XmaI fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1834–2921, encoding the very C terminus of 5-phosphatase type IV protein and 3′-untranslated region. A gel-purified fragment was labeled by random priming with arediprime DNA-labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). β-Actin probe was used as a control. The Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for high level expression of 5-phosphatase type IV in cultured insect cells. cDNA (nucleotides 1–2135) was subcloned into the pFastBac1 vector to express full-length 5-phosphatase type IV protein. For purification, 5-phosphatase type IV was subcloned into the pFastBac HT vector. Cell extracts were harvested 48 h postinfection, and the protein was purified on Ni2+-NTA resin according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the addition of 5 mm MgCl2 in all buffers. Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were treated with a solution of 1% potassium oxalate in 50% ethanol. The plates were baked at 90 °C overnight. TLC plates were developed using a solvent mixture of chloroform/acetone/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (80:30:26:24:14 (v/v)). Phospholipid standards were stained with iodine. Radiolabeled phospholipids were detected by a PhosphoImager or autoradiography. Scrapings of radiolabeled phospholipids were counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. PtdIns 3[32P]4,5-P3 was synthesized essentially as described previously (10.Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.5 mg of PtdIns 4,5-P2 and 0.5 mg of phosphatidylserine were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 1 ml containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2. After brief sonication, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase immunoprecipitate was added followed by [γ-32P]ATP (2 mCi, 6000 Ci/mmol). After a 1-h incubation, the lipids were extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (1:1 (v/v)). The lipids were separated on TLC, and radiolabeled PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 was scraped from the plate and extracted from silica gel with chloroform/methanol. For enzyme assay, radiolabeled lipids were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.03% n-octyl β-glucopyranoside and briefly sonicated on ice. The assay of activity was performed as described previously (10.Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]PtdIns 4,5-P2 (3000 cpm/assay) was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CTAB followed by brief sonication. Alternatively, the dried radiolabeled [3H]PtdIns 4,5-P2 was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.03%n-octyl β-glucopyranoside. Reactions were started by the addition of the enzyme and carried out at 37 °C. Extraction of the lipids and analysis of the reaction products were as above. Deacylation of inositol lipids was as described previously (12.Lips D.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19911-19915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GroPIns derivatives were separated by HPLC on a PartiSphere SAX column (Whatman) with the gradient of 0–1.25m NaH2PO4, pH 4.5. The gradient consisted of a 0–5-min linear rise to 29% for pump B, a 5–35-min linear rise to 60% B, and a 35–45-min linear rise to 100% B followed by a 5-min wash with 100% B. Radiolabeled deacylated phospholipids were detected by a β-RAM Flow-Through System (In/US Systems, Inc., Tampa, Florida). Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases are defined by two essential domains, with the consensus sequences, FWXGDXN(F/Y)R and R/NXP(S/A)W(C/T)DR(I/V)L. Our method for screening for additional members of the family was a search of the human EST data base with the consensus sequences. One of the clones identified in the GenBankTM data base with the BLAST search was clone H10559, with a reported sequence FWFGDFNFR that corresponded to the consensus sequence of the 5-phosphatase domain I. The clone was sequenced and shown to encode a partial open reading frame that contained both 5-phosphatase domains. The 1.8-kb EST insert was used to screen a human fetal brain λzapII cDNA library (Stratagene). However, all clones isolated contained only partial coding sequence. To obtain additional N-terminal sequence, we used a 5′-RACE protocol and human fetal brain Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH). However, because of a very high GC content of the cDNA, the protocol was modified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (8.Hengen P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 225-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9.Henke W. Herdel K. Jung K. Schnorr D. Loening S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3957-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). An additional 300 base pairs were isolated containing a methionine codon. Although the full-length mRNA is 3.4 kb according to the Northern blot (see below), we believe that we have identified the starting methionine, because the putative initiation site is in the context of a good Kozak consensus sequence (13.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) and there is an in-frame stop codon 5′ of it. The composite cDNA of 3110 base pairs encodes an open reading frame of 644 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). It contains two 5-phosphatase domains,FWFGDFNFR andKQRTPSYTDRVLY (invariant consensus residues are in bold). The sequence of domain II is unusual; it encodes tyrosine instead of an invariable tryptophane residue in the consensus motif. Only one other putative 5-phosphatase gene from C. elegans has the same tryptophane to tyrosine substitution. This gene has not been characterized at the protein level. The four C-terminal residues CSVS represent an S-farnesylation signal. Of other mammalian 5-phosphatases, types I and II also have post-translational lipid modifications at their C termini. 5-Phosphatase type I has a CVVQ C-terminal isoprenylation site and is a substrate for purified farnesyltransferase (14.De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10419-10424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 5ptase type II has a CNPL prenylation motif and is likely to be geranyl-geranylated (15.Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16.Matzaris M. O'Malley C.J. Badger A. Speed C.J. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8256-8267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 5-Phosphatase type IV has relatively low similarity to other known mammalian 5-phosphatases (Fig. 1 B). There is only 10–20% amino acid identity with the closest identity of 19% to SHIP. There are two mouse EST clones found in the sequence data base that encode the partial sequence of the 5-phosphatase type IV homologue. We sequenced both of them, and the deduced amino acid sequences are 87% identical to the human protein in the coding portion of the clones. The 3′-untranslated regions have no similarity. 5-Phosphatase type IV has a very high content of proline residues (9.5%), particularly in the N-terminal portion (19%). The N-terminal region of the enzyme contains a Pro-rich domain class I (17.Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and thirteen PXXP sequences, a potential SH3 binding core. Surprisingly, 5-phosphatase type IV also contains a sequenceYVLLSSAAHGVLYMSL that corresponds to YXXL X (6–8) YXXL consensus, which is the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). ITAM modules function to link cell surface receptors to signaling effector molecules and are found in the cytoplasmic tails of T- and B-cell receptors, CD3, high affinity Fc receptors for IgE and IgA, and FcγRIIA. This is the first case where an ITAM sequence has been reported in a nonreceptor molecule. One of the clones isolated in the screen of the human brain library had a 102-nucleotide deletion spanning this region. It is likely to represent an alternatively spliced transcript, resulting in deletion of 34 amino acids including the putative ITAM domain. It will be of interest to study the functional role of this protein motif in 5-phosphatase type IV. Another member of the 5-phosphatase family, SHIP, is known to interact with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif of FcγRIIB in B cells. SHIP 1 is recruited to the phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif via its SH2 domain, providing the inactivation of the signal presumably by hydrolysis of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate-signaling molecules (18.Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because 5-phosphatase type IV is also a PtdIns 3,4,5-P3phosphatase, it may serve as a “double inhibitor,” both hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol signaling molecules and competing with immunoreceptors as a scaffolding base. Expression of 5-phosphatase type IV was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. In human tissues, 5-phosphatase type IV mRNA was present at highest levels in brain, heart, spleen, pancreas, and testis (Fig. 2, A and B). A major band of 3.6 kb was detected in all tissues; however, additional species of 4.9 and 9.5 kb are present as well and are most pronounced in testis. Other members of the 5-phosphatase family are known to exist as multiple spliced variants. Multiple splice forms of SHIP, SHIP2, synaptojanin, and 5-phosphatase type II have been reported (16.Matzaris M. O'Malley C.J. Badger A. Speed C.J. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol.

Cousens L.S. Majerus P.W. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 438-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Different splice variants may have different tissue and/or intracellular distribution as in the case of 5-phosphatase type II (16.Matzaris M. O'Malley C.J. Badger A. Speed C.J. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8256-8267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and synaptojanin 1 and synaptojanin 2 (20.Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21.Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2306-2311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). They may also lack a protein module, SH2 domain in the case of SIP110, a splice variant of SHIP (19.Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D.A. Chin S.M. Deuter-Reinhard M. Jefferson A.B. Norris F.A. Masiarz F.R. Cousens L.S. Majerus P.W. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 438-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A splice variant of synaptojanin 1 without an N-terminalSACI domain has been reported also (22.Woscholski R. Finan P.M. Radley E. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both synaptojanin 1 and synaptojanin 2 exist as multiple splice forms. The majority of synaptojanin 1 in brain is a 145-kDa isoform, whereas a 175-kDa isoform is ubiquitously expressed. The 175-kDa isoform is tightly bound to membranes compared with the 145-kDa isoform. Interestingly, these two isoforms arise from a small (27 nucleotide) deletion that deletes the stop codon and results in splicing of a long open reading frame found in the 3′-untranslated region of synaptojanin (20.Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The same pattern was observed in the case of synaptojanin 2, even though there is no homology between the alternatively spliced C-terminal portions of synaptojanin 1 and synaptojanin 2 (21.Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2306-2311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of 5-phosphatase type IV also contains a long open reading frame immediately following the stop codon. It is possible that alternatively spliced isoforms of 5-phosphatase type IV may arise by a mechanism similar to that found with synaptojanin genes. We did not encounter any isoforms with such an alternatively spliced C terminus in our clones of 5-phosphatase type IV or in the EST data base. However, a cDNA entry in GenBankTM (accession number U 45974) has a small deletion spanning the stop codon (TG versusTTTCTTGAAG) that would result in the addition of 50 amino acids to the C terminus of the protein. 5-Phosphatase type IV has a similar tissue distribution in mouse, with the highest level of expression in the testis, heart, and brain based on Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 D). We also tested several human cancer cell lines. The 5-phosphatase type IV mRNA is present in all cell lines tested in various amounts (Fig. 2 C). A very high level of 5-phosphatase type IV mRNA was detected in MOLT-4, a lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. This is of interest, given the presence of an ITAM module in the 5-phosphatase type IV, found typically in immune cell receptors. Four human tissues were examined for the presence of 5-phosphatase type IV protein: brain, liver, spleen, and kidney by Western blotting. A single band of apparent molecular mass of 68 kDa was detected in the brain (Fig.3 B) but not in the liver, spleen, or kidney. We also performed Western blots of several mouse tissues and found high levels of expression in brain, heart, and testes with lower levels expressed in thymus and lung (Fig. 3A). After prolonged exposure of the Western blot faint bands were seen in kidney, spleen and liver. The observed molecular mass correlates well with the predicted mass of 70 kDa based on the cDNA sequence. The staining was specific and disappeared when primary antibodies were preincubated with the peptide antigen prior to staining (Fig. 3 B,lane brain + peptide). We expressed the protein in Sf9 cells to study the catalytic activity of the enzyme. First, the full-length construct was expressed to confirm that the starting methionine supports initiation of protein synthesis. In accordance with the predicted molecular mass, a band of 70 kDa was detected in insect cells 48 h following infection with 5-phosphatase type IV baculovirus (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). To obtain a highly purified enzyme, we expressed His-tagged 5-phosphatase type IV followed by affinity purification on a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2). The purified enzyme was used in subsequent experiments to study its enzymatic activity. Known inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases can potentially utilize four different substrates, soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, as well as lipids, PtdIns 4,5-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. Substrate preference is the basis of classification of known 5-phosphatases into four groups as described above. We examined the ability of the type IV enzyme to hydrolyze all four potential substrates. It was unable to hydrolyze either of the soluble substrates, making it the first known 5-phosphatase that is not capable of metabolizing soluble substrates. In these experiments we used 10–50 times as much recombinant enzyme as in the experiments using lipid substrates, incubated for up to 40 min, and found no hydrolysis. Thus if the enzyme were able to hydrolyze at even 1% of the rates seen with lipids, we would have detected it. When lipid substrates were used, type IV enzyme readily utilized PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 converting it to PtdIns-P2 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner as shown below. To identify the product of the reaction, the substrate and the product of the reaction were deacylated and analyzed on HPLC (Fig. 4). The GroPIns-P2product migrated in the position corresponding to PtdIns 3,4-P2, confirming that the novel enzyme is an inositol 5-phosphatase. Of the known 5-phosphatases, SHIP is the most efficient enzyme that hydrolyzes PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. It is thought to be the primary enzyme that controls the level of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 in cells during activation of tyrosine kinase receptors. We compared the enzymatic activity of 5-phosphatase type IV and SHIP in hydrolyzing PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 (Fig.5 B). Based onK m values, 5-phosphatase type IV has almost 10 times greater affinity for the substrate than SHIP (0.65 versus5.95 μm, respectively). 5-Phosphatase type IV has a lowerV max (0.1145 μmol/mg/min) compared with aV max of 0.458 μmol/mg/min for SHIP. However, the catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) of the two enzymes is similar, taking into account that molecular weight of SHIP is twice as high as 5-phosphatase type IV. We compared the first order rate constants of three 5-phosphatases: 5-phosphatase type IV, SHIP, and OCRL, that represent three different types of 5-phosphatases that are capable of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 hydrolysis (Fig.6). SHIP has the highest Kapp, 35.4 + 4.02 min−1 μg−1; Kapp value for 5-phosphatase type IV is 16.00 + 2.87 min−1μg−1; and OCRL has the lowest Kapp value, 6.29 + 0.18 min−1 μg−1.Figure 6Kinetic of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3hydrolysis by phosphatidyl inositol 5-phosphatases.

Whereas the enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing PtdIns 3,4,5-P3presented in mixed vesicles without added detergent and in the presence of 0.03% n-octyl β-glucopyranoside or Triton X-100, its activity was completely inhibited in the presence of 2 mmCTAB (Fig. 7 A). The later detergent is present in standard assays for hydrolysis of PtdIns 4,5-P2. Thus, we re-evaluated the ability of type IV enzyme to hydrolyze PtdIns 4,5-P2 under different assay conditions. We compared the ability of three enzymes, OCRL, SHIP, and 5-phosphatase type IV to hydrolyze PtdIns 4,5-P2 with either n-octyl β-glucopyranoside or CTAB in the assay. Under standard assay conditions, with 2 mm CTAB, only OCRL effectively converted PtdIns 4,5-P2 to PtdIns 4-P, with no activity observed using either SHIP or type IV enzyme (Fig. 7 C). However, both type IV enzyme and, surprisingly, SHIP were capable of PtdIns 4,5-P2 hydrolysis when n-octyl β-glucopyranoside but not CTAB was added to the assay (Fig.7 B). The ability of SHIP to utilize PtdIns 4,5-P2 was unexpected, because in all previously reported studies SHIP was able to utilize only the d-3 phosphate-containing substrates. We compared the three 5-phosphatases for their ability to hydrolyze PtdIns 4,5-P2. The first order rate constants of OCRL, 5-phosphatase type IV, and SHIP were 63.05 + 10.54 min−1 μg−1, 41.99 + 25.07 min−1 μg−1, and 29.9 + 18.75 min−1 μg−1. Thus the classification of SHIP as an enzyme specific for d-3 phosphate containing substrates is incorrect as it readily cleaves PtdIns 4,5-P2under appropriate conditions. Which substrates are most important for either SHIP or type IV enzymes in vivo cannot be determined by these in vitro assays. Selective sensitivity to detergents has been reported for yeast inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (23.Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). PtdIns 4,5-P2-hydrolyzing activity of Inp51p is completely abolished in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100, whereas 5-phosphatase activity of the two other gene products, Inp52p and Inp53p, is detergent-insensitive. At the same time, polyphosphoinositide 3/4/5-phosphatase activities associated with the SACI-like domain of Inp52p and Inp53p is inhibited by detergent. It is possible that detergent sensitivity reflects the sensitivity of the enzymes to their lipid micro-environment in vivo. Recent years mark tremendous progress in understanding the important role that phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates play in cellular signaling. A role for PtdIns 4,5-P2 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking is well established (reviewed in Ref. 7.Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). There is also a growing body of evidence that PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 is an important second messenger (reviewed in Ref. 6.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Although practically absent in quiescent cells, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 is produced in response to cell stimulation predominately by phosphoinositide 3-kinase from PtdIns 4,5-P2, or by recently characterized phosphatidylinositol 4/5-kinase from PtdIns 3-P by a concerted reaction (24.Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 binds with high affinity to PH domains of several proteins, including ARNO, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ARF, Grp1 and cytohesin-1, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), PLCγ, Akt/PTB and it's kinase PDK. PH domains of proteins have varying degrees of binding preferences between PtdIns 3,4,5-P3, PtdIns 4,5-P2 and, in case of Akt/PTB, PtdIns 3,4-P2. The PH domain of Btk is the most PtdIns 3,4,5-P3-specific and binds PtdIns 3,4,5-P3with a K d of less than 1 μm, about 10 times less than PtdIns 4,5-P2. (26.Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This preferential binding to PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 must be physiologically important, because a mutation in the Btk PH domain that results in a significant reduction of the selectivity for PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 binding also causes agammaglobulinemia. An intact PH domain of Btk and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 production enhance phosphorylation and activation of Btk. One of the proposed downstream targets of Btk, PLCγ, also preferentially binds PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 over PtdIns 4,5-P2 via its PH domain. Thus, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 binding by PH domains of both Btk and PLCγ may lead to simultaneous translocation of the proteins to the plasma membrane and activation of PLCγ. A somewhat similar dual role of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 has been proposed in the activation of Akt in response to mitogenic stimuli (27.Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). PtdIns 3,4,5-P3binding to PH domains of Akt and PDK1 brings both proteins to the plasma membrane. In addition, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 binding to the PH domain of Akt exposes the Thr-308 residue, which is critical for phosphorylation and activation of Akt. PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 can also bind to SH2 domains, competing with phosphotyrosine. PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 binding to the SH2 domain of PLCγ leads to the enhanced ability of PLCγ to hydrolyze PtdIns 4,5-P2, providing a link between the levels of these two phosphoinositol lipids (28.Rameh L.E.

As with all signaling molecules, PtdIns 4,5-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 need to be present in the right place at a precise time, so it is of great interest to identify enzymes that control their intracellular levels. One way of control is removal of phosphate at thed-5 position by members of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase family of enzymes. Synaptojanin, a group II 5-phosphatase, is the key enzyme that mediates vesicular trafficking at the synapses via control of the PtdIns 4,5-P2 and, possibly, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 levels. SHIP, a group III 5-phosphatase, is a negative regulator of signaling initiated by growth factors in hematopoietic cells and FcγRIIB negative signaling in B cells, where it regulates the PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 levels. SHIP2, which is ubiquitously expressed, is likely to play a similar role in nonhematopoietic cells. Cloning and identification of a novel 5-phosphatase with a unique substrate specificity toward phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates will help to elucidate complex regulation of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 and PtdIns 4,5-P2levels in the cell.

Despite the well characterized structure of their cytoplasmic assembly domains, little is known about the role of the transmembrane segments in SNARE protein assembly and function. Here, we identified conserved amino acid motifs within the transmembrane segments that are required for homodimerization of synaptobrevin II and syntaxin 1A. Minimal motifs of 6–8 residues grafted onto an otherwise monomeric oligoalanine host sequence were sufficient for self-interaction of both transmembrane segments in detergent solution or membranes. These motifs constitute contiguous areas of interfacial residues assuming α-helical secondary structures. Since the motifs are conserved, they also contributed to heterodimerization of synaptobrevin II and syntaxin 1A and therefore appear to constitute interaction domains independent of the cytoplasmic coiled coil regions. Interactions between the transmembrane segments may stabilize the SNARE complex, cause its multimerization to previously observed multimeric superstructures, and/or be required for the fusogenic activity of SNARE proteins.

In detergent extracts from presynaptic nerve terminals, the single-span integral membrane SNAREs synaptobrevin (also referred to as VAMP) and syntaxin together with the peripheral membrane SNARE protein SNAP-25 form a stable ternary complex that is disassembled in vitro after binding of soluble α-SNAP by the ATPase NSF (5.Söllner T.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar), interaction between these SNARE partners bridges opposing vesicular and plasma membranes. Therefore, assembly and disassembly of ternary SNARE complexes would proceed in atrans-configuration that is regarded essential for vesicle docking, priming and/or fusion (8.Fasshauer D. Bruns D.

Protein domains involved in the binary and ternary interactions leading to SNARE complex formation have been originally identified by in vitro binding studies using recombinant soluble fragments of synaptobrevin II, syntaxin 1A, and SNAP-25 as follows: (i) the cytoplasmic domain of synaptobrevin II; (ii) a carboxyl-terminal, membrane-proximal region of syntaxin 1A; and (iii) carboxyl-terminal plus amino-terminal regions of SNAP-25 (16.Hayashi T.

More recently, structural studies confirmed that previously predicted cytoplasmic coiled coil domains of synaptobrevin II (H1, H2) and syntaxin 1A (H3) form a tightly packed parallel four-helical bundle together with two helices derived from SNAP-25 (HA and HB) in the SNARE complex (22.Sutton R.B.

Transmembrane domains are known to participate in oligomerization of many different integral membrane proteins. It is thought that TMS self-assembly is driven by a close packing of their characteristically shaped surfaces that are defined by their primary structures (reviewed in Ref. 27.Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 157-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the homodimeric structure originally observed for native synaptobrevin (28.Washbourne P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29.Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) is preserved with recombinant synaptobrevin II, where it depends on a specific amino acid motif within the TMS (31.Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct interaction of syntaxin and synaptobrevin TMSs in synthetic proteoliposomes was recently reported (32.Margittai M. Otto H. Jahn R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the synaptobrevin II homodimerization motif is conserved within the TMS of syntaxin 1A. This predicted the involvement of this motif in a homotypic interaction of syntaxin 1A as well as in its heterophilic binding to synaptobrevin II. Here, we (i) identify the minimal TMS amino acid motif required for synaptobrevin II homodimerization, (ii) show that a similar motif mediates syntaxin 1A homodimerization, and (iii) demonstrate that TMSs and cytoplasmic coiled coil domains cooperate in synaptobrevin/syntaxin heterodimerization. Rat syntaxin 1A cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with VENT polymerase (Biolabs) from a plasmid template as described previously for rat synaptobrevin II (31.Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with primers containing NheI (sense primer) andBglII (antisense primer) restriction sites. The amplified fragment was cut with NheI and BglII and ligated into the pET 21d (Novagen)-based plasmid pSNiR, previously cut withNheI and BamHI. In the resulting constructs, the amino termini of synaptobrevin or syntaxin are fused in frame to the carboxyl terminus of a tripartite fusion moiety consisting of the coding sequence of the HA marker epitope in case of synaptobrevin or the c-myc epitope for syntaxin, Staphylococcus aureusnuclease A, and a linker-region coding for 9 amino acids. Construction of plasmid pToxR-A16 was described previously (33.Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). All other pToxR constructs were made by ligating synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes encoding the desired sequences into plasmid pHKToxR(TMIl4)MalE (34.Kolmar H. Hennecke F. Götze K. Janzer B. Vogt B. Mayer F. Fritz H.-J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3895-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) previously cut with NheI and BamHI. All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. All mutants were made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis performed according to Kunkelet al. (35.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) on single-stranded templates (T7 Mutagene-kit, Bio-Rad). All mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing. ToxR activities were determined in quadruplicates in 3–11 independent experiments as described (33.Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol.

Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and the absorbance was read at 650 nm at a pathlength of 6 mm. To correct for slightly different membrane insertion efficiencies, the β-galactosidase activities elicited by the mutant sequences were normalized to the A 650 values obtained after 48 h of cell growth. Proteins, encoded by pSNiR vectors, were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLsyS (Novagen) as described (31.Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), solubilized with 2% (v/v) polyoxyethylene 9 lauryl ether (Sigma) for mild SDS-PAGE, or with 2% (w/v) CHAPS (Applichem, Darmstadt) in solubilization buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for all other applications. The usual concentration of recombinant protein after solubilization was ∼1 mg/ml. Biosynthetic labeling was performed by addition of 7.5 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (2:1) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per ml of bacterial culture 15 min after induction of expression with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. CHAPS-solubilized proteins (see above) were treated with DSS (Pierce) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Dimethyl sulfoxide never exceeded 2% (v/v) of the reaction volume. The samples were shaken for 5 min at room temperature, and reactions were then quenched with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for 10 min. The samples were precipitated with methanol (37.Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar) prior to SDS-PAGE. CHAPS-solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (∼20 μg/lane) and subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hybond-C pure). The membrane was blocked for 30 min in TBB (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 4% (w/v) nonfat dry milk powder). The blocking solution was replaced by 15 μg/ml 35S-labeled wt protein of the cognate SNARE partner in TBB while shaking was continued for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed twice for 10 min in TBS (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and once in TWB (TBS + 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Blots were air-dried and exposed to a BAS-MP imaging plate (Fuji, Japan) overnight, and bound35S-labeled protein was quantified using a BAS-1000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Japan). CHAPS-solubilized HA-tagged synaptobrevin II derivatives were incubated with wt35S-labeled syntaxin (final concentration 250 ng/μl) in solubilization buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. The monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (a kind gift of Dr. Lerner, Scripps Institute, San Diego, CA) was added at 20 ng/μl, and incubation was continued with shaking overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, pelleted (Hereaus Biofuge 4000 rpm) after 2 h, washed twice with buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100), twice with buffer B (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100), and once with buffer C (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100). After washing, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to a BAS-MP imaging plate (Fuji, Japan), and the amount of co-precipitated radiolabeled syntaxin was quantified using a BAS-1000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Japan). Proteins solubilized with 2% polyoxyethylene 9 lauryl ether were precipitated with methanol (37.Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar), redissolved in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) SDS, 6 m urea, 50 mmdithiothreitol, 20% (w/v) sucrose), separated by SDS-PAGE (5 μg/lane), and visualized by Western blotting using the HA-mAb 12CA5 for HA-tagged synaptobrevin or the myc-mAb 9E10 for myc-tagged syntaxin 1A as described (31.Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Minigels were run at 4 °C, and samples were not boiled prior to electrophoresis. We previously described an amino acid motif in the synaptobrevin II TMS that is essential for its homodimerization. Mutational analysis had identified 6 amino acid residues (Leu-99, Ile-102, Cys-103, Leu-107, Ile-110, and Ile-111) whose exchange to alanine significantly reduced self-interaction of the recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli as analyzed by SDS-PAGE under mild conditions. Simultaneous mutation of three of these residues (L99A/C103A/I111A = syb-mult) abrogated homodimerization almost completely (31.Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 A and2 A). To examine whether this motif is sufficient for synaptobrevin II TMS-TMS interaction, we compared a set of synaptobrevin II mutants for self-interaction by mild SDS-PAGE. Replacing the TMS by an oligoalanine sequence (syb-A15), which does not self-interact (33.Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), reduced homodimerization as efficiently as the previously characterized “mult” mutations (Fig.2 A). Grafting the critical 6 residues onto this oligoalanine background (syb-A8) completely restored homodimerization thus identifying them as minimal amino acid motifs responsible for synaptobrevin II TMS-TMS interaction. As mutation of alanine 104 previously did not influence homodimerization (31.Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J.

Wild type and mutated full-length proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting. A,the 66-kDa homodimer of syb-wt (synaptobrevin/nuclease A fusion = 33-kDa monomer) is disrupted upon different TMS mutations (syb-A15 and syb-mult) but preserved with a 6-residue TMS motif (syb-A8).B, the 100-kDa homodimer of syx-wt (syntaxin/nuclease A fusion = 50-kDa monomer) is disrupted upon TMS-deletion (syx-cyt) or mutation (syx-A15 and syx-mult) but appears even stronger with a conserved 6-residue TMS motif (syx-A8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A sequence comparison identified 5 (Ile-270, Cys-271, Leu-275, Ile-278, and Ile-279) out of the 6 positions to be conserved in the TMS of syntaxin 1A, the natural binding partner of synaptobrevin II (Fig.1 A). Therefore, we examined the potential role of this motif in syntaxin 1A homodimerization. Analysis of recombinant syntaxin 1A by SDS-PAGE under mild conditions indeed revealed its partial homodimerization. Dimer formation was almost completely abrogated when the TMS had been deleted (syx-cyt); its central 15 hydrophobic amino acids were replaced by the oligoalanine sequence (syx-A15) or mutated in three positions (syx-mult = M267A/C271A/I279A). Grafting the motif homologous to the synaptobrevin II homodimerization motif (Met-267, Ile-270, Cys-271, Leu-275, Ile-278, and Ile-279) onto the oligoalanine sequence (syx-A8) resulted in syntaxin homodimerization that was even stronger than that of the wt protein (Fig.2 B). Thus, syntaxin 1A also forms homodimers by sequence-specific self-interaction of its TMS based on an amino acid motif almost identical to that previously identified in synaptobrevin II. To examine whether the cytoplasmic coiled coil domains of synaptobrevin and syntaxin are involved in homodimerization, multiple mutations were made in positions relevant for binary and ternary SNARE protein interactions (Fig. 1 C) (Refs. 18.Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.-C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19.Hao J.C. Salem N. Peng X.R. Kelly R.B. Bennett M.K. J.

Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, and see below). These mutations had no detectable effect on homodimerization of both proteins, indicating that the cytoplasmic coiled coil domains do not self-interact (results not shown, but see Fig. 4). To examine self-interaction of the SNARE TMSs in the absence of the cytoplasmic domains and incorporated into membranes, we used the ToxR transcription activator system. We previously established this system as a sensitive tool to study TMS-TMS interactions using the structurally well characterized glycophorin A TMS dimer for reference (36.Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38.Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The ToxR protein is anchored by a single TMS of choice within the inner membrane of expressing E. coli cells where it is thought to exist in a monomer/dimer equilibrium. The dimeric form binds to the cholera toxin promoter thus activating expression of a downstreamlacZ gene in a reporter strain (Fig.3 A). β-Galactosidase expression is therefore diagnostic of ToxR self-assembly in the membrane. Here, we replaced the ToxR TMS by the synaptobrevin II or syntaxin 1A TMSs to study their self-interaction. The transcriptional activities of these chimeric ToxR proteins indicated that both SNARE TMSs self-interacted similarly well in the membrane. The degrees of interaction were comparable to that of a previously characterized membrane-spanning leucine zipper (33.Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and below that of the glycophorin A TMS (36.Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 38.Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Since the signals were reduced by the mult mutations to statistically significant degrees (Fig. 3 B; two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05), the interactions are sequence-specific and involve the same faces of the transmembrane helices as determined for full-length proteins in detergent solution. The weaker effects of the mult mutations found here as compared with detergent solution is assumed to result from higher protein concentrations and/or preorientation of the interacting domains in the membrane (39.Grasberger B. Minton A.P. DeLisi C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The minimal interaction motifs were determined using an oligoalanine host sequence (A16) previously shown to partially partition into the membrane where it stays largely monomeric (33.Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The 6-residue motifs, which were sufficient for homodimerization of full-length SNAREs in detergent (Fig. 2), partially restored self-interaction in the membrane. To obtain wild-type levels of homodimerization, however, these motifs had to be expanded by two additional conserved isoleucine residues completing the contiguous areas of interfacial residues (Figs. 3 B and 7). To exclude that different concentrations of the ToxR chimeric proteins in the membranes distorted the signals, we ascertained their similar expression levels by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, we assessed the efficiency of the ToxR constructs to integrate into the inner bacterial membrane by testing their ability to functionally complement the maltose-binding protein (MalE) deficiency of PD28 cells. Due to a deletion in MalE, this strain is unable to grow in minimal medium with maltose as the only carbon source (40.Bedouelle H. Duplay P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In cells expressing correctly inserted ToxR membrane proteins, however, the MalE domain allows maltose uptake and thus cell growth (36.Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). All constructs complemented MalE deficiency to comparable degrees, thus confirming their similarly efficient membrane integration; a ToxR protein with deleted TMS (ΔTM) did not support cell growth (Fig. 3 D) as expected (36.Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In sum, both SNARE TMSs are capable of self-assembling in membranes in the absence of the cytoplasmic domains. Conserved motifs of 8 amino acids are sufficient to mimic these homotypic interactions. Conservation of the self-interacting TMS motifs suggested that TMS-TMS interactions may also be important for heterodimerization of both proteins. This is in line with a recently reported contribution of the TMSs to synaptobrevin/syntaxin interaction (32.Margittai M. Otto H. Jahn R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the other hand, synaptobrevin II and syntaxin 1A are known to interact via cytoplasmic coiled coil domains in binary as well as in ternary complexes including SNAP-25 (16.Hayashi T. McMahon H.

Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The hallmark of coiled coil structures is that the a and d positions within repeatedabcdefg motifs form the hydrophobic core of the helix-helix interfaces. Mutating a and d positions of the H3 region of syntaxin previously resulted in loss of ternary as well as binary interactions (18.Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.-C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To compare the contribution of the cytoplasmic coiled coil domains and the TMSs to heterodimerization, we generated mutations in either part of synaptobrevin II and syntaxin 1A. To test these proteins (tagged with HA or myc epitopes, respectively) for their ability to form homo- and heterodimers, they were co-incubated, cross-linked with DSS, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Wild-type proteins formed homodimers plus an additional band of intermediate apparent molecular weight that was detected with both antibodies and thus identified as the heterodimer. This result suggests that homodimerization competes with heterodimerization. Mutating fivea and d positions in the coiled coil domains of synaptobrevin (syb-60/84) or syntaxin (syx-230/251) (Figs.1 C and 7) strongly reduced heterodimerization, as expected (Fig. 4). In comparison, the TMS mult mutations had a detectable but somewhat less pronounced effect on heterodimerization as assayed by DSS cross-linking or SDS-PAGE analysis under mild conditions (data not shown). To evaluate quantitatively the roles of coiled coil domains and TMSs in heterophilic interaction, we developed an overlay assay. Equal amounts of wt and mutant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 35S-labeled wt-binding partners. By quantifying bound radioactivity, different degrees of heterodimerization were determined for wt and mutants. The results confirmed the importance of both coiled coil domains for heterophilic binding (Fig.5 A). Importantly, the multiple TMS mutations (syb-mult and syx-mult) or replacement of the TMSs by the oligoalanine sequence (syb-A15 and syx-A15) also significantly decreased binding to their respective wt SNARE partner (Fig. 5). To identify the minimal amino acid motifs responsible for heterophilic TMS-TMS interaction, we tested the proteins with the minimal homodimerization motifs. In case of syntaxin 1A, the motif of 6 residues (syx-A8) was sufficient for wt level of heterodimerization with wt synaptobrevin II, whereas the 8-residue motif that completely restored homodimerization in the ToxR system (syb-A6) was required in the reverse configuration. By using an independent experimental approach, we investigated the influence of the mutations on the ability of synaptobrevin to co-precipitate 35S-labeled wt syntaxin from detergent solution. Upon co-incubation, we immunoprecipitated the synaptobrevin proteins and quantitated co-precipitated syntaxin upon SDS-PAGE. In agreement with the overlay assay (Fig. 5), the coiled coil mutant syb-60"

The enzyme is composed of 28 subunits arranged in four heptameric rings stacked upon one another to form a cylinder-shaped particle (1DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

In proteasomes from the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum, the subunits represent two homologous gene products, α and β, each present in 14 copies per particle (5Pühler G. Weinkauf S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, proteasome subunits represent 14 different gene products, 7 of which are homologous to the archaebacterial α subunit and 7 of which are homologous to the archaebacterial β subunit (3Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 8Heinemeyer W. Trondle N. Albrecht G. Wolf D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12229-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Despite such differences in subunit diversity, all proteasomes have similar overall architecture and subunit topology; the two outer rings are composed of α subunits and the two inner rings are composed of β subunits (6Grziwa A. Baumeister W. Dahlmann B. Kopp F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,9Kopp F. Dahlmann B. Hendil K.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Each α and β ring of eukaryotic proteasomes contains a complete complement of the seven respective gene products. Thus, all proteasomes are multisubunit dimers that exhibit C2 symmetry about an axis between the two inner rings. The crystal structures of the proteasome from both archaebacteria and yeast have been solved recently (10Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 11Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). The structures have confirmed, clarified, and greatly extended knowledge of structural and functional features of the enzyme obtained previously from biochemical and molecular studies. For example, it is now clear that the β subunits contain the catalytic sites. These sites consist of amino-terminal threonine residues which act as the nucleophiles for peptide bond hydrolysis (10Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 11Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R.

Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In archaebacteria, all 14 copies of the β subunit are probably active catalysts, whereas in yeast and mammals only six β subunits (i.e. two copies of three different subunits) are likely to be catalytically active. The active sites of the proteasome face an interior chamber formed by the center space of the two abutting β rings. This topology sequesters the active sites from proteins in bulk solution and may have evolved as a means of preventing inappropriate degradation of cellular proteins. The structure of the archaebacterial proteasome suggests that access of substrates to the catalytic sites is through 13-Å diameter openings formed by the centers of the outer α rings. In eukaryotic proteasomes, this opening is blocked by amino-terminal portions of α subunits, suggesting that the portal may be gated (11Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). A likely mechanism for control of substrate access to the proteasome involves binding of regulatory proteins to its terminal α rings. The binding of either of two such proteins, PA28 and PA700, greatly enhances the proteasome's hydrolysis of substrates (1DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms of activation are unclear, these proteins probably induce conformational changes in the proteasome that open the blocked pores. PA28 is a ring-shaped molecule that activates the proteasome's hydrolysis of short peptides (13Rechsteiner M. Realini C. Ustrell V. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 14Ma C. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dubiel W.

PA700 is a 700,000-dalton multisubunit complex that also activates the proteasome's degradation of short peptides (1DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 19Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Udvardy A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9055-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). For this activity, opening of pores in the proteasome structure is not sufficient for increased substrate access to catalytic sites because folded proteins are too large to pass through such narrow openings (23Rubin D.M. Finley D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 854-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 24Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, PA700 may unfold protein substrates prior to or in a mechanism linked with their translocation (25Braun B.C. Glickman M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5565-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis is required for numerous cellular regulatory processes, the interaction between PA700 and the proteasome is of critical physiological importance (27Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 28Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). In addition to proteasome activators, several protein inhibitors of the proteasome have been described. For example, Etlinger and colleagues have identified and purified two proteins that inhibit the proteasome (29Murakami K. Etlinger J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Li X. Gu M. Etlinger J.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9709-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These proteins have native molecular weights of 240,000 and 200,000 and are homomultimers of 40,000-dalton and 50,000-dalton subunits, respectively. Previously, we identified and purified a 31,000-dalton protein that we now call PI31 (for ProteasomeInhibitor of 31,000 daltons, Ref. 31Ma C. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This protein inhibits the hydrolysis of small synthetic substrates and large unfolded proteins by the 20 S proteasome. The possible relationships among these various inhibitor proteins, all of which have been isolated from red blood cells by relatively similar methods, have been unclear. We report here the primary structure of PI31, deduced from the sequence of a human cDNA clone, and demonstrate that it is a novel protein with an unusual domain structure. We also report structure-function analysis of PI31 by expression of the wild-type and mutant forms of the protein in Escherichia coli. Finally, we demonstrate that PI31 affects the interaction of the proteasome with PA28 and PA700. PI31 (31Ma C. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys.

Internal amino acid sequence of bovine PI31 was obtained by automated Edman degradation of tryptic peptides isolated by HPLC,1as described previously (33DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P.

A cDNA library was constructed from the poly(A)+ RNA of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. cDNA was synthesized with a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using oligo(dT)15 as a primer for synthesis of the first strand of cDNA. The cDNAs were ligated with EcoRI adapter containing a NotI site and then inserted into theEcoRI site of a ZAPII vector (Stratagene) for the construction of the phage library. On the basis of partial amino acid sequences of four tryptic peptides of purified bovine PI31 (see Fig.1), we selected regions of the sequences (underlined) of two proteolytic fragments, AVTVENSMIINVLEH and FDPFGPIGTSPSGPNPDHLPPPGYDD, and designed oligonucleotides for amplification by PCR with the first strand cDNA complementary to mRNA from HepG2 cells. The largest PCR product, approximately 540 base pairs in length was obtained using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-AC(C/T)GT(G/T)GAGAAT(T/A)(G/C)(T/C)ATGATTATTAATGT(G/T)CT(G/C)GA-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GTAGCCGGGGGGGGGCA(G/A)GTGGTCGGGGTTGGGGCC-3′. This DNA fragment was used as a probe to screen approximately 5 × 105 plaques of a cDNA library derived from HepG2 cells. The longest insert representing the cDNA (about 3.0 kilobase pairs in length) was subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The cDNA clone was sequenced by a double-strand strategy in an automatic DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Internal primers were constructed to analyze the internal sequence. PCR methodology was used to amplify PI31 DNA and to introduce new restriction sites flanking the PI31 sequence for subcloning into the expression vector. The sequences of the PCR primers used were: 5′-CTCCATATGGCGGGCCTGGA and 5′-GAGAAGCTTGAGGCCTTCACAGG. The NdeI andHindIII sites, respectively, are underlined. For expression studies, the DNA was subcloned into a pET-28a(+) expression vector (Novagen) at the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites. This vector also contains an amino-terminal polyhistidine sequence (His·TagTM (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPAGSH), Novagen) for affinity purification and a thrombin cleavage site for removal of the His·TagTM sequence from the purified fusion protein. The vector also contains a kanamycin resistance marker. For expression of recombinant PI31, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) were grown overnight in LBKan medium at 37 °C. When the cultures reached an A 600 = 0.6, induction was initiated with with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). After three hours cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed, and sonicated. A soluble extract was prepared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min and applied to a nickel-agarose column equilibrated with binding buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a 0–250 mm gradient of imidazole. Eluted fractions were assayed for PI31 activity and immunoreactivity to a PI31 antibody. Fractions containing PI31 were pooled and dialyzed extensively against Buffer H (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). In this expression protocol, approximately 12 mg of PI31 were produced per 100 ml of bacterial culture. Typical yields of 95% (10 mg/100 ml of bacterial culture) of purified PI31 were obtained. The PI31 was stored at −20 °C where it was stable indefinitely. As described previously, PI31 protein reacted weakly in a Bradford protein assay, resulting in underestimates of protein concentration by this method (31Ma C. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was therefore determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm and by quantitative densitometry of samples subjected to SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and compared with standard proteins of known concentration (Mark 12TM standards, Novex). PCR methodology was used to produce deletion mutants of PI31 using wild-type PI31 cDNA. Primers were designed to introduce theNdeI and HindIII restriction sites flanking the PI31 deletion sequences for subcloning into the pET-28a(+) expression vector at the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites. Expression of mutant PI31 proteins in E. coli and protein purification were performed as described above for wild-type PI31. Antibodies against bovine PI31 were produced in rabbits. Purified PI31 was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the protein was visualized by soaking the gel in cold KCl. This region of the gel was isolated, dialyzed extensively against 150 mm NaCl, and then crushed in a small volume of 150 mm NaCl. The crushed material was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant and homogenized with a PolytronTM homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments). Initial subcutaneous injections contained 200 μg of PI31 (with complete Freund's adjuvant) per rabbit. Two booster injections, each consisting of 100 μg of PI31 (with Freund's incomplete adjuvant) per rabbit, were given at 4 and 8 weeks after the initial injections. The rabbits were bled 2 weeks after the second booster injection. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were conducted as described previously (31Ma C. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys.

Functional activity of PI31 was assayed by quantitating inhibition of proteasome hydrolysis of either [methyl-14C]casein or small synthetic peptides as described previously (14Ma C. Slaughter C.A.

Left panel, PA28. 20 S proteasome (0.25 μg) was preincubated alone or with increasing concentrations of recombinant PI31 for 5 min at 37 °C. Purified PA28 was added to a final concentration of 110 nm (proteasome concentration, 7 nm), and the preincubation was continued at 37 °C for an additional 10 min in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Proteasome activity was then assayed by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of the synthetic peptide Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, as described previously (15Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control reactions were performed identically but contained no PA28.

Proteasome activity in the absence of PA700 and PI31 was 0.95 unit. Proteasome activity in the presence of PA700 but without PI31 had 44.5 units of activity. These activities were designated “control” for their respective conditions and assigned values of 100%. Activities in the respective conditions are reported as a percentage of this value. ▴, assays without PA700; ▪, assays with PA700.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Glycerol density gradient centrifugation was conducted as described previously with minor modifications (15Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW Ti55 rotor. The gradient solution ranged from 10 to 34% glycerol and contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol in a volume of 4.55 ml. Each tube was divided into 24, 200 μl fractions for subsequent assays. Circular dichroism spectra of wild-type and mutant forms of recombinant PI31 were recorded from 190 to 260 nm every 1 nm on an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter at 25 °C using a 2.0-mm path length cell. Samples were prepared in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA at a concentration of 7.8 μm. At this concentration approximately 50% of wild-type PI31 is dimeric. All analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge. Measurements obtained with absorbance optics using an An60Ti rotor. Data analysis was carried out using the Beckman Optima XLA/XLI software, version 4.0 (based on the Origin software, Microcal, Inc.). Sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation of PI31 was conducted in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Data were collected at 280 nm, 22,000 rpm at 4 °C. Three samples were analyzed with initial absorbances at 280 nm of: 0.32 (channel A), 0.18 (channel B), and 0.10 (channel C). The background absorbances were estimated by overspeeding at 42,000 rpm until a flat baseline was obtained. The base-line values (in optical density) were: 0.047 (channel A); 0.038 (channel B); −0.005 (channel C), and these values were used in the fitting. The data sets were edited according to the intensity scan taken at the start of the centrifugation. The data were analyzed using the Beckman software for various models (monomer alone, monomer/dimer, monomer/trimer, etc.). The equilibrium constants were calculated as monomer/n-mer constants. The quality of the fit was determined from the variance and from the distribution of the residuals. The best fits were these with the most random residuals. For the purposes of data analysis, the molecular weight was calculated from the sequence 31,575 (for the recombinant human PI31 with His·TagTM). Confirmation of this value was obtained by mass spectral analysis of the protein. The partial specific volume was calculated to be: 0.725 ml/g at 4 °C and 0.732 ml/g at 20 °C based upon amino acid composition using the program Sedterp, version 1.0. The solvent density was calculated as 1.008 g/ml at 4 °C and 1.006 g/ml at 20 °C, and the solvent viscosity was 1.60 cP at 4 °C and 1.02 cP at 20 °C using Sednterp 1.0. All sedimentation coefficient values were corrected to thes 20,w values. The Beckman software gives equilibrium constants in terms of absorbance units (at 280 nm), which were converted to concentration units using an extinction coefficient of 34,520 m−1 cm−1 (calculated from the amino acid composition of PI31 at 280 nm). The monomer/dimer equilibrium constants were calculated using the formula:K 1,2 (in units ofm−1) = K 1,2 (in units of abs−1) × 1.2ε/2. To determine the primary structure of the proteasome inhibitor, PI31, we identified and sequenced cDNA clones of this protein. Purified PI31 from bovine red blood cells was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC. Four selected peptides were subjected to automated Edman degradation which yielded sequences totaling 70 residues (Fig. 1). These sequences were used to construct corresponding oligonucleotides to screen a human liver cDNA library as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The nucleotide sequence of a putative PI31 cDNA clone and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1. The sequence contains 3064 nucleotides. A long open reading frame predicts a protein of 271 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 29,772, a value in excellent agreement with the molecular weight of 31,000 estimated by SDS-PAGE for bovine PI31. The clone contains a long 3′-untranslated region of 2158 nucleotides. The sequence AATAAA, a putative polyadenylation signal common to eukaryotic mRNAs, was located 21 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail. Each of four peptides determined by Edman degradation was identified in the deduced sequence. Although 10 of the 70 residues in this comparison were discrepant, these differences may result from species variation between humans and bovine. These results indicate that the identified clone represents human PI31. Computer-assisted comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of human PI31 with amino acid sequences in current data bases failed to identify proteins with significant similarity, indicating that PI31 is a novel protein. Inspection of the sequence revealed that PI31 is a proline-rich protein. Proline residues compose 13% (35 of 271 amino acids) of PI31, but are concentrated primarily at the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule, where 26% (30 of the last 117 amino acids) of the residues are prolines. The proline-rich region contains one triproline sequence and 6 diproline sequences, four of which are followed by glycine and two of which are followed by glycine and alanine. The sequence DPL occurs three times, and the sequence VDPLR occurs twice."
https://openalex.org/W2128699894,"In a signal sequence trap screening of the murine brain, we identified a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily designated TROY. TROY is a type I membrane protein of 416 amino acids with characteristic cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular domain and a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2 binding sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of 223 amino acids. In fact, activation of nuclear factor κB was induced by the overexpression of TROY and inhibited by dominant negative forms of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, indicating that TRAFs and nuclear factor κB are involved in the signal transduction of TROY. We also cloned a cDNA for a human counterpart, which showed a 75% homology with mouse TROY at the amino acid level. The extracellular domain of TROY exhibits an extensive homology with that of Edar, a receptor that specifies hair follicle fate. TROY mRNA is strongly expressed in brain and embryo and moderately expressed in the heart, lung, and liver but not the spleen. In the embryo, the expression level is particularly strong in the skin. Interestingly, in situ hybridization analysis of the embryo showed that TROY mRNA was exclusively expressed in the epithelium of many tissues. On the other hand, in neonatal mice, TROY is expressed in hair follicles like Edar as well as in the cerebrum, suggesting pleiotropic functions of TROY in development as well as in the adult mice. The Troy gene is located near the waved coat (Wc) locus, a mutant related to abnormalities in skin and hair.

Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF)1 mediate the action of tumor necrosis factor-related cytokines leading to cell death or to cell proliferation and differentiation (1.Banchereau J.

Most of the genes for TNFRSF encode type I transmembrane glycoproteins with an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning region, and a cytoplasmic region that activates cell functions. The characteristic pattern is found within the extracellular domain formed by cysteine-rich 40-residue repeats with a 25–30% homology. The majority of conserved positions are cysteine residues. The cysteine-rich repeats reflect the characteristic structural domain of the TNFRSF (4.Smith C.A. Davis T. Anderson D. Solam L. Beckmann M.P. Jerzy R. Dower S.K. Cosman D. Goodwin R.G.

Overall, this family of glycoproteins shows a relatively low level of sequence conservation, despite sharing a common fundamental structure. Cytoplasmic regions of the receptors show considerably more diversity than do extracellular regions in sequence and size.

On the other hand, the majority of TNFRSF members recruit the TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) family of intracellular adaptor molecules through cytoplasmic tails to promote cell survival by activation of downstream protein kinase cascades and, ultimately, transcription factors of the NF-κB and activator protein 1 family (16.Arch R.H.

Mouse brain and embryonic skin cDNA libraries were screened using biotinylated linear DNA probes coated with RecA proteins, as described previously (27.Honigberg S.M. Rao B.J. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9586-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28.Rigas B. Welcher A.A. Ward D.C. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To isolate a cDNA clone encoding a human counterpart of TROY, a human gliosarcoma cell line GI-1 cDNA library synthesized by random priming was screened using the mouse TROY cDNA coding region as a probe. Total RNAs of cell lines were extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and mouse embryo poly(A)+ RNA was purified with FastTrack2.0 (Invitrogen). Total RNA (30 μg) and 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were fractionated in a 0.7% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon filter (Amersham). Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot was obtained from CLONTECH. The Northern blot was hybridized with radiolabeled TROY cDNA. A 456-bpBamHI-HindIII cDNA fragment (coding region 151–607) of mouse TROY was inserted into a pBluescriptII KS vector. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for TROY were transcribed in vitro from linearized, gel-purified plasmids using T7 polymerase (antisense cRNA probe) and T3 polymerase (sense cRNA probe). Embryos were embedded in OCT compound (Miles, Elkhart, IN), frozen inn-hexane, and then cut and analyzed by in situhybridization using a modification of previously reported methods (30.Braissant O. Wahli W. Biochemica. 1998; 1: 10-16Google Scholar,31.Braissant O. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2748-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). When control sections were hybridized with identical quantities of sense cRNA, signals were nil (data not shown). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were plated in 6-well plates at a concentration of 106 cells/well. On the following day, using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the cells were transfected with 100 ng of pTK-lacZ, a thymidine kinase promoter-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid, to normalize for transfection efficiency, together with 100 ng of a reporter plasmid and various amounts of each expression vector. Total DNA (3 μg) was kept constant by supplementation with DNA derived from the pCOSI vector. A reporter plasmid, κB-luc, has five repeats of the NF-κB site upstream of a promoter derived from human T-cell lymphotrophic virus 1 and a luciferase reporter gene (32.Fujisawa J. Seiki M. Toita M. Miyatake S. Arai K. Yoshida M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1988; 79: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after the transfection, the cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the luciferase lysis buffer. The lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (33.Kashiwada M. Shirakata Y. Inoue J.I. Nakano H. Okazaki K. Okumura K. Yamamoto T. Nagaoka H. Takemori T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interspecific backcross progenies were generated by mating (C57BL/6J ×Mus spretus)F1 females and C57BL/6J males, as described previously (34.Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 35.Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Taylor B.A. Lee B.K. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 205 N2 mice were used to map the Troy locus (see text for details). The probe, a 1690-bp fragment of mouse cDNA, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using nick translation labeling kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A fragment of 9.6 kb was detected inPstI-digested C57BL/6J DNA, and a fragment of 15.5 kb was detected in PstI-digested M. spretus DNA. The presence or absence of the 15.5-kb PstI M. spretus-specific fragment was monitored in the backcross mice. A description of the probes and restriction fragment-length polymorphisms for the loci linked to Troy includingCtsg, Gjb2, and Fzd3 has been reported previously (36.Heusel J.W. Scarpati E.M.

One locus for our interspecific backcross has not been reported. The Blk probe, an 854-bp EcoRI fragment of mouse cDNA, detected co-segregated KpnI fragments. Recombination distances were calculated using Map Manager, version 2.6.5. Gene order was determined by minimizing the number of recombination events required to explain the allele distribution patterns. In the SST-REX method (23.Kojima T. Kitamura T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Ba/F3 clones transduced with cDNAs containing signal sequences showed factor-independent growth through surface expression of a constitutively active receptor for thrombopoietin as a fusion protein. Among the cDNA clones isolated by SST-REX from a mouse brain cDNA library, the LTI9 clone showed homology with members of the TNFR superfamily at the amino acid sequence level. Positions of cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich repeat were perfectly conserved. Full-length cDNAs obtained from oligo(dT)-primed cDNA libraries derived from mouse brain using the RecA screening method (27.Honigberg S.M. Rao B.J. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1995; 211: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were confirmed to contain a sequence that was identical to LTI9. These cDNAs contain an open reading frame of 1251 nucleotides. The putative initiation codon is preceded by a sequence (AGAGCC) in good agreement with the Kozak's consensus sequence for initiation of translation in eukaryotes (38.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). The termination codon is followed by a 3′ untranslated region of 2590 bp. A canonical polyadenylation signal is present 36 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail (39.Mason P.J. Elkington J.A. Lloyd M.M. Jones M.B. Williams J.G. Cell. 1986; 46: 263-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The protein putatively encoded by the TROY mRNA is a cysteine-rich protein of 416 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 45 kDa (Fig. 1). Two hydrophobic regions are present in the protein, representing the signal sequence and the transmembrane region. A hydrophobic stretch of 25 amino acids toward the C terminus (amino acids 169–193) was assigned as a transmembrane domain because it had a potentially single helical span. A cleavage site for the signal peptide was found between Cys (at position 29) and Glu (at position 30). Like other members of the TNFRSF, TROY contains the characteristic cysteine-rich motifs (C - x(4,6) - [FYH] - x(5,10) - C - x(0,2) - C - x(2,3) - C - x(7,11) - C - x(4,6) - [DNEQSKP] - x(2)- C) that have been shown by x-ray crystallography to represent a repetitive structural unit (40.Banner D.W.

Proteins. 1997; 27: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). TROY contains two perfect TNFR motifs and one imperfect motif in which C2 and C6 are not present. TROY exhibited a significant and extensive homology (33%) with all three motifs of Edar, the dl gene product (Fig.2) (21.Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22.Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of TROY spans amino acids 194–416 of the precursor protein and does not harbor the death domain discovered in the intracellular domains of CD95 (9.Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A.

A shorter clone, dTROY, was also identified from a cDNA library of mouse embryonic day 17.5 skin. The extracellular and transmembrane domains of dTROY were identical to those of TROY. However, the cytoplasmic tail of dTROY has only 21 amino acids and does not contain a TRAF2-binding consensus sequence (Fig.3). A consensus sequence of the 5′ boundary of the intron was present on the transition point from the common sequence to the unique sequence of dTROY, suggesting that dTROY contains the same sequence from the intron at the 3′ end. To confirm that dTROY was not an artifact, a dTROY-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed using a sense primer of the common sequence and an antisense primer of the unique sequence of dTROY. A band of dTROY was amplified from the total RNA of embryonic day 17.5 skin but not from mouse brain or liver (data not shown). A human counterpart of TROY expression in the human gliosarcoma cell line GI-1 was detected in the Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 4). A human counterpart was obtained from a cDNA library derived from the GI-1 cell line using RecA screening. This cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1269 nucleotides and encodes a cysteine-rich protein of 423 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46 kDa. The overall identity between human TROY and murine TROY at the amino acid level is 75%, with a 92% identity in the extracellular and transmembrane domain. The cytoplasmic tail of human TROY was 234 amino acids long and had a 57% homology with murine TROY (Fig. 1). Expression of TROY mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis using a cDNA for the open reading frame of TROY as a probe (Fig. 4). TROY mRNA was strongly expressed in the brain, with an approximate molecular size of 4.5 kb, which was close to the length of the TROY cDNA clone (3970 nucleotides) identified. TROY mRNA was detected in most tissues, but not in the spleen. In the embryo, the expression level was periodically increased and was particularly strong in the skin. TROY mRNA was also detected in human glioma U251 cells, GI-1 cells, A3-1 embryonic stem cells, and nullipotent embryonal carcinoma NF-1 cells (data not shown). Cellular localization of TROY mRNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in mouse embryo day 13.5. Interestingly, TROY mRNA was detected exclusively in the epithelium (i.e. neuroepithelium in the frontal and lateral lobes, the epidermis of the skin, bronchiolar epithelium, epithelium of the tongue, gastric epithelium, conjunctiva, and cochlea), whereas in neonatal mice, TROY mRNA was mainly detected in hair follicles like Edar and in neuron-like cells in the cerebrum but not in the epidermis of the skin (Fig. 5). Because the TRAF2-binding consensus sequence TLQE was found in the cytoplasmic domain of TROY, we asked whether TROY activates NF-κB through TRAF2. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transiently transfected with an interleukin 2 promoter-derived NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene (32.Fujisawa J. Seiki M. Toita M. Miyatake S. Arai K. Yoshida M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1988; 79: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and a TROY expression vector (Fig. 6). Co-transfection of TROY induced a >3.5-fold higher luciferase activity, as compared with that seen with the vector control. To determine whether TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are involved in NF-κB activation by TROY, we tested whether TROY-induced NF-κB activation was inhibited by dominant negative mutants of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 lacking the N-terminal zinc-binding domain required for NF-κB activation (42.Rothe M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Overexpression of dominant negative TRAF2, TRAF5, or TRAF6 blocked NF-κB activation in the reporter assay. These results demonstrated that TRAFs were involved in TROY-mediated NF-κB activation. The dTROY with a small cytoplasmic domain did not activate NF-κB. The mouse chromosomal location ofTroy was determined by interspecific backcross analysis, using progeny derived from matings of [(C57BL/6J × M. spretus)F1 × C57BL/6J] mice. This interspecific backcross mapping panel has been typed for over 2900 loci that are well distributed among all of the autosomes as well as the X chromosome (34.Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 113-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J and M. spretus DNAs were digested with several enzymes and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization for informative restriction fragment length polymorphisms using a mouse cDNA TROY probe. The 15.5-kb PstI M. spretusrestriction fragment length polymorphisms (see “Materials and Methods”) was used to follow the segregation of the Troylocus in backcross mice. Mapping showed that Troy is located in the central region of mouse chromosome 14 linked to Ctsg,Gjb2, Blk, and Fzd3. Although 161 mice were analyzed for every marker (shown in the segregation analysis; Fig.7), up to 191 mice were typed for some pairs of markers. Each locus was analyzed in pairwise combinations for recombination frequencies, using additional data. Ratios of the total number of mice exhibiting recombinant chromosomes to the total number of mice analyzed for each pair of loci and the most likely gene order are as follows: centromere - Ctsg (1:191) - Gjb2(2:180) - Troy – (2:171) - Blk – (4:175) -Fzd3. The recombination frequencies [expressed as genetic distances in cM ± the S.E.] are: centromere - Ctsg(0.5 ± 0.5) - Gjb2 (1.1 ± 0.8) - Troy(1.2 ± 0.8)- Blk (2.3 ± 1.1) -Fzd3. We compared our interspecific map of chromosome 14 with a composite mouse linkage map that shows the location of many uncloned mouse mutations (provided by the Mouse Genome Data Base, a computerized database maintained at The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) and found that Troy localized in the vicinity of the waved coat(Wc) locus, a mutant that presents abnormality in the skin and hair (49.Green M. Mouse News Lett. 1973; 49: 32Google Scholar, 50.Green M. Mouse News Lett. 1972; 47: 36Google Scholar, 51.Diwan S. Stevens L. Mouse News Lett. 1974; 51: 24-25Google Scholar). We isolated and characterized a newly identified member of TNFRSF, TROY, from a cDNA library of the murine brain using SST-REX. In structural analysis of the cDNA, the translation product of TROY was shown to be a type I transmembrane protein of 416 amino acid residues. Whereas the extracellular domain of TROY retains the characteristic structure of TNFRSF, the intracellular domain does not contain the death domain. During our characterization of TROY, Hu et al. (52.Hu S. Tamada K. Ni J. Vincenz C. Chen L. Genomics. 1999; 62: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported a novel member of the TNFRSF (TNFRSF19) that was identical to TROY, except that the cytoplasmic tail was shorter than that of TROY by 68 amino acids. In a search of the expressed sequence tag database, three clones (GenBankTM accession numbers AI551729, AA445805, and AI48211) encoding the C-terminal region of TROY were identified, all of which were identical to the C-terminal region of TROY, but not to that of TNFRSF19. Moreover, the cytoplasmic tail of human TROY identified in this study was similar to murine TROY but not to TNFRSF19 in size and sequence, indicating that TROY is a major and complete cDNA clone. When compared with other members of the TNFRSF, the closest known relative of TROY is a receptor called Edar (21.Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22.Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) that specifies hair follicle fate and is 33% identical to TROY in the extracellular domain. Mice with mutations in the Edar gene not only have defects in hair follicle induction but also lack sweat glands and have malformed teeth (21.Headon D.J. Overbeek P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 22.Monreal A.W. Ferguson B.M. Headon D.J. Street S.L. Overbeek P.A. Zonana J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The expression of TROY is strong in embryonic skin and hair follicles, as is the case for Edar. This high homology in the extracellular domain and the similarity of distribution between TROY and Edar strongly suggest that TROY also plays some role in the development of embryonic skin and induction of hair follicles. Whereas Edar harbors a death domain, TROY does not contain one and activates NF-κB through TRAF proteins. Therefore, it would be interesting to know how TROY and Edar functionally interact with each other. In this context, it is of interest that the gene for Troy is located near the waved coat (Wc) locus, a mutant of which presents abnormality in skin and hair. Heterozygotes of theWc locus have a wavy coat and whiskers and dry and scaly skin, and homozygotes die in utero (49.Green M. Mouse News Lett. 1973; 49: 32Google Scholar, 50.Green M. Mouse News Lett. 1972; 47: 36Google Scholar, 51.Diwan S. Stevens L. Mouse News Lett. 1974; 51: 24-25Google Scholar). The central region of mouse chromosome 14 shares regions of homology with human chromosomes 7q, 8p, 13q, and 14q. The draft sequence of human chromosome13q12.11–3 from the Sanger center has been registered in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory database and includes the sequence of human TROY (nucleotides 624–1586). It would be interesting to examine whether there is a similar genetic disease in the human. TROY exhibits a major TRAF2-binding consensus sequence in the cytoplasmic tail, and overexpression of TROY induced NF-κB activation, as noted in the reporter assay using luciferase. This activation was blocked by overexpression of dominant negative TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6. Like most members of the TNFRSF, TROY is perhaps homotrimerized by stimulation of its ligands and recruits TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 to the cytoplasmic tail, which promotes cell survival and proliferation by activating downstream protein kinase cascades and eventually activating transcription factors in the NF-κB and activator protein 1 family. Hu et al. (52.Hu S. Tamada K. Ni J. Vincenz C. Chen L. Genomics. 1999; 62: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that NF-κB activation is not induced by TNFRSF19, a truncated version of TROY lacking the C-terminal 77 amino acid residues of the cytoplasmic tail, indicating that the C-terminal region of TROY is essential for activation of NF-κB and for signal transduction. We also found a truncated form of TROY, dTROY, that harbors a smaller cytoplasmic tail than TROY. The consensus sequence of the 5′ boundary of the intron was found on the transition point from the TROY/dTROY common nucleotide sequence to the dTROY unique sequence, indicating that dTROY is an alternative splicing form containing an unspliced intron. Unlike TROY, dTROY can not induce NF-κB activation and may play a role as a decoy receptor such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 3 (53.Degli-Esposti M.A. Smolak P.J.

Nature. 1998; 396: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) for the CD90 ligand to negate a signal from a ligand for TROY. Expression of dTROY mRNA, detected using dTROY-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was found in the embryonic skin but not in the brain or liver. In the embryo, the expression level of TROY appears to be significantly increased during the late stages of embryogenesis and fluctuated from embryonic day 11.5 to embryonic day 15.5. Moreover, the TROY sequence was found as an expressed sequence tag in the mouse four-cell embryo (GenBankTMaccession number AU041881). These results suggest that TROY may play pleiotropic roles in embryogenesis. Of particular interest is the fact that homozygotes for the Wc locus result in embryonic lethality. In summary, TROY is a novel member of the TNFRSF that exhibits a similarity with Edar in structure and expression patterns, and the gene for TROY is located in the vicinity of Wc. The present data also suggest that TROY is involved in embryonic development and the development of skin and hair follicles. For further study, it is important to identify the cognate ligand, which is now under investigation. We thank Dedorah B.

Despite potential significance ofcis-prenyltransferase in plant growth and development, no gene of the enzyme has been cloned from higher plants. Using sequence information of the conserved region ofcis-prenyltransferase cloned recently fromEscherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and yeast, we have isolated and characterized the first plantcis-prenyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein is highly homologous in several conserved regions tocis-prenyltransferases from M. luteus, E. coli, and yeast. In vitro analyses using the recombinant protein overexpressed in E. coli revealed that the enzyme catalyzed the formation of polyprenyl diphosphates ranging in carbon number from 100 to 130 with a predominance of C120. The enzyme exhibited a higher affinity for farnesyl diphosphate than for geranylgeranyl diphosphate, with theK m values being 0.13 and 3.62 μm, respectively, but a lower affinity for isopentenyl diphosphate, with aK m value of 23 μm. In vitro rubber biosynthesis analysis indicated that theArabidopsis cis-prenyltransferase itself could not catalyze the formation of higher molecular weight polyprenyl diphosphates similar to natural rubber. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the gene was expressed at low levels inArabidopsis plant, in which expression of thecis-prenyltransferase in leaf and root was higher than that in stem, flower, and silique. These results indicate the tissue-specific expression of cis-prenyltransferase and suggest a potential role and significance of the enzyme in the polyisoprenoid biosynthesis in plants. cis-Prenyltransferase catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with allylic diphosphate to synthesize polyprenyl diphosphates that play vital roles in cellular activity.

The enzyme exhibited a higher affinity for farnesyl diphosphate than for geranylgeranyl diphosphate, with theK m values being 0.13 and 3.62 μm, respectively, but a lower affinity for isopentenyl diphosphate, with aK m value of 23 μm. In vitro rubber biosynthesis analysis indicated that theArabidopsis cis-prenyltransferase itself could not catalyze the formation of higher molecular weight polyprenyl diphosphates similar to natural rubber. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the gene was expressed at low levels inArabidopsis plant, in which expression of thecis-prenyltransferase in leaf and root was higher than that in stem, flower, and silique. These results indicate the tissue-specific expression of cis-prenyltransferase and suggest a potential role and significance of the enzyme in the polyisoprenoid biosynthesis in plants. farnesyl diphosphate Arabidopsis cis-prenyltransferase geranylgeranyl diphosphate gel permeation chromatography isopentenyl diphosphate polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-PCR isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside base pair(s) Prenyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of linear prenyl diphosphates involved in the biosynthesis of various isoprenoid compounds, including sterols, carotenoids, terpenes, quinones, glycosyl carrier lipids, prenyl proteins, and natural rubber. Based on the configuration of isoprene units in the final reaction products, prenyltansferases are classified into two classes:trans- and cis-prenyltransferase. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, trans-prenyltransferases catalyze the formation of isoprenoid compounds, such as geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP1; C15), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP; C20), which serve as initiating molecules to produce many other longer chain length isoprenoid compounds necessary for cellular growth and survival.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In contrast, only three cis-prenyltransferase genes have recently been cloned. Two genes are the structural genes for undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, which catalyzes the formation of undecaprenyl diphosphate (C55) that serves as a glycosyl carrier lipid during the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharide components in Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus (24.Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25.Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J.

The other is the gene encoding acis-prenyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of dolichols used for the glycosylation of proteins in yeast (27.Sato M. Sato K. Nishigawa S.-I. Hirata A. Kato J.-I. Nakano A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition to these genes whose functions have been verified by in vitro and in vivo analyses, several other hypothetical proteins from diverse sources have been suggested to becis-prenyltransferases based on the sequence alignments (Refs. 25.Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 27.Sato M. Sato K. Nishigawa S.-I. Hirata A. Kato J.-I. Nakano A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and GenBankTM accession numbers therein). Although the cis- and trans-prenyltransferases catalyze similar reactions of the sequential condensation between isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and allylic diphosphates in the presence of Mg2+ ions, no similarity in the sequence was found between cis- and trans-prenyltransferases. Thecis-prenyltransferases cloned from E. coli,M. luteus, and yeast and other hypothetical proteins share a low level of sequence homology (∼30% identity) among them. Several regions with highly conserved amino acid sequences were, however, identified. In order to understand the genomic structure ofcis-prenyltransferase and to verify the role of these conserved amino acid sequences for the catalytic activity of the enzyme, it is necessary to identify and clone more genes forcis-prenyltransferase from different organisms including animals and plants. In addition, it is of critical importance to test whether cis-prenyltransferase could catalyze the formation of higher molecular weight polymers similar to natural rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene), which is synthesized by the action of a rubber polymerase or rubber transferase that catalyzes the sequential condensation of IPP with allylic diphosphates similar tocis-prenyltransferase. In this study, using the sequence information of the conserved regions of cis-prenyltransferases isolated from microorganisms, we isolated and characterized a full-length cDNA encodingcis-prenyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana, thus designated ACPT. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous in several conserved regions to that ofcis-prenyltransferases from M. luteus, E. coli, and yeast. In vitro analysis of the recombinant protein revealed that the enzyme catalyzed the formation of polyprenyl diphosphates with predominant carbon number C120. In vitro rubber biosynthesis analysis indicated that the Arabidopsis cis-prenyltransferase itself could not catalyze the formation of high molecular weight polyprenyl diphosphate such as natural rubber. A. thalianasamples were obtained from mature plants grown under controlled greenhouse conditions. Total RNA was extracted by using a plant RNA isolation kit, and mRNA was isolated by using the Oligotex-dT™ mRNA kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with 0.5 μg of total RNA. Two primers, AC1 (5′-TGGATGGGAACCGG AGATGGGCC-3′) and AC2 (5′-TTCTCCACTTGTCCTAATCATTAA-3′), were designed according to the sequence information of cis-prenyltransferase from E. coli, M. luteus, yeast, and Arabidopsisgenomic sequences (accession no. AC003040). PCR was performed using 10 μl of the first-strand cDNA and two primers. PCR was performed for 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, with a 5-min preheat and a 7-min final extension at 72 °C. The PCR product was used to screen theArabidopsis cDNA library. The pGAD 424 library containing Arabidopsis cDNA inserts was a gift from G. T. Choi. The PCR product was used to screen 4 × 106 colonies of the cDNA library. Colony hybridization was performed at 60 °C in 2× SSC hybridization solution (32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA clones hybridized to the probe were sequenced. One clone carrying a full-length cDNA insert was chosen and designated pACPT. Plasmid DNA for sequencing reactions was prepared by the alkaline lysis method (28.Yang S.F. Plant Physiol. 1969; 44: 1203-1204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System kit (Promega). The sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using the dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and ABI prism™ 310 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Total RNAs of various tissues were prepared using RNA isolation kit (Quiagen) and were treated with DNase I to remove contaminating genomic DNA. Tissues were collected from 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants except young leaf (5 days) and old leaf (8 weeks). For Northern blot, total RNA (10 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted as for Southern blot. A 32P-labeled full-length ACPT cDNA was used as a probe. For quantitative RT-PCR, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (3 μg) by using reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT). A 200-unit reverse transcriptase (RT), 1 × RT buffer, 0.5 mm dNTP, and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primer (Promega) were added to the heat-denatured total RNA. After reverse transcription for 1 h at 37 °C, the first-strand cDNA was used for PCR performed in standard conditions: 5 min at 95 °C; 35 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s); 7 min at 72 °C. Two primers, 5′-GCGAGGATGGGTTACAAAGC-3′ (208 region) and 5′-TTCCCCAATTCTCTGTGGAG-3′ (414 region), were used for RT-PCR. As a control, 18 S ribosomal RNA standard primers (Ambion) were used. An equal volume of each PCR sample was separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The ACPT gene was cloned in theBamHI–EcoRI site of pET-22b(+) (Novagen) to construct pET-ACPT. The E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with pET-ACPT was grown to midstationary phase in TB medium (1.2% bactotreptone, 2.4% yeast extract, 0.4% glycerol, and 10% potassium phosphate solution) containing 500 μg/ml carbenicillin at 30 °C with vigorous aeration. The cultures were induced by adding IPTG to a concentration of 1 mm and then incubating for another 2 h. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were harvested, washed with 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min), and then disrupted by sonication. The expressed proteins were purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Quiagen). The lysate was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry at 4 °C for 60 min, and the mixture was loaded to a column. The column was washed four times with washing buffer, and the proteins were then eluted with 0.5 ml of elution buffer. The lysate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the standard method of Laemmli (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205492) Google Scholar). The purified protein was separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting, and the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membrane was incubated with Penta Anti-His antibody (Quiagen) for 1 h, and the proteins were detected using anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Enzyme activity was measured in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm FPP, and 80 μm[14C]IPP (55 mCi mmol−1, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction was initiated by the addition of indicated amounts of the recombinant enzyme. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and then treated with 1-butanol saturated with water to extract the products of the prenyltransferase reaction. The butanol phase was collected and washed with water saturated with NaCl. The extract was mixed with Ready Solv HP scintillation mixture (Beckman), and the radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). The washed organic extract was dried under N2, and the residues were hydrolyzed to the corresponding alcohols with potato acid phosphatase according to Fujii et al. (31.Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The alcohols were extracted with hexane and analyzed by TLC on a reverse phase RP-18 plate (Merck) with a solvent system of acetone/H2O (19:1). Normal phase TLC of the reaction products was also carried out on a Silica Gel-60 plate (Merck) with a solvent system of 1-propanol/aquesous NH3/H2O (6:3:1). The distribution of14C-labeled reaction products on the TLC plate was analyzed by a Bio-image analyzer BAS 1500 (Fuji). The positions of authentic standards were visualized with p-anisaldehyde spray reagent (Sigma). Rubber biosynthetic activity of the enzyme was measured according to the procedure as described (29.Oh S.K. Kang H. Shin D.H. Yang J. Chow K.S. Yeang H.Y. Wagner B. Breiteneder H. Han K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17132-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which is similar to the method used for the cis-prenyltransferase assay described above. After incubation for 5 h at 25 °C, the reaction products were extracted with benzene and dried under N2. The extract was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, filtered through a membrane of 0.4-μm porosity, and analyzed using a gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Gel permeation chromatography was carried out in a Waters high performance liquid chromatograph using three columns in series, a mixed bed polydivinylbenzene column with molecular weight cut-off from 100 to 10,000 (Jordi) and two polystyrene-divinyl-benzene copolymer gels having an exclusion limit of 4 × 107 and 6 × 104 (Supelco). Measurements were made at 35 °C using tetrahydrofuran as eluent at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1, and the reaction product was monitored by an evaporative light scattering detector (Alltech). The effluents were collected at 0.5-min intervals and assayed for radioactivity. The molecular weight of the reaction product was estimated by comparing the elution profile of the sample to that of standardcis-polyisoprene or polystyrene. PCR and cDNA library screening were employed to clone the gene. The fragment of the ACPT gene (0.5 kilobase pairs) was obtained by RT-PCR and used to screen 4 × 106 colonies of the cDNA library. Seven positive colonies were selected in the first screening, and of these only one colony was hybridized to the ACPT probe in the second screening. Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA insert was 1062 bp long and contained a 909-bp open reading frame. The ACPT contains a 26-bp-long 5′-untranslational region and a 127-bp-long 3′-untranslational region including a poly(A) tail of 33 bp. The ORF encodes for a 303-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 33 kDa (Fig. 1). The deduced protein is basic with an isoelectric point of 8.05, which is similar to that of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase in M. luteus (pI = 8.58) and RER2 (for return to theendoplasmic reticulum) gene in yeast (pI = 7.75). Hydropathy and transmembrane motif analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence show that ACPT is hydrophilic and has N terminus transmembrane helices large enough to span the lipid bilayers (data not shown), in contrast to other cis-prenyltransferases from yeast, M. luteus, and E. coli that do not have transmembrane helices. The predicted amino acid sequence of the ACPT has low similarity to those of cis-prenyltransferases from E. coli(SWISS-PROT Q47675; 30% identity), M. luteus (accession no.AB004319; 30% identity), and yeast S. cerevisiae (accession no. AB013497; 28% identity) (Fig. 2). Several regions with identical or highly conserved amino acids are, however, identified throughout the sequence. These conserved domains are likely to be functionally important for the catalytic activity and mechanism of chain elongation by cis-prenyltransferase. Our initial attempt to check the expression pattern of ACPT gene by Northern blot analyses failed due to the extremely low level of gene expression. Therefore, we performed a RT-PCR using total RNAs obtained from different tissues. The cycle number for RT-PCR was chosen in the linear range of PCR for the products. As shown in Fig. 3, the predicted size of 207 bp for ACPT was detected in all of the tissues used. Varied expression levels were observed among the different tissues. The expression of ACPT in root and leaf was higher than that in stem, flower, and silique. When the intensity of RT-PCR product in young leaf (5 days old) was set at 100 by Eagle-eye software (Stratagene), the relative intensities of RT-PCR products in other tissues were quantified as follows: mature leaf, 75; old leaf, 76; root, 51; stem, 28; flower, 33; and silique, 18. In order to modulate the amplification efficiency of PCR template and to compare the expression levels of the ACPT gene, a control reaction using the 18 S primers and Competimer™ provided by the manufacturer (Ambion) were performed. The ratio between 18 S primer and Competimer was 2:8, which is designed to detect the rare transcripts (Ambion). The intensities of the PCR products of ACPT in different tissues were weaker than that of control 18 S ribosomal RNA (Fig. 3), indicating that ACPT is expressed in an extremely small amount in Arabidopsis plant. In order to characterize the cis-prenyltransferase from A. thaliana, the enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli by using a pET-22b(+) expression system. Our first attempt to overexpress the recombinant ACPT based on the pGEX expression system failed, possibly due to a toxic effect of the gene that is involved in cell wall biosynthesis of host cells. Therefore, we used the pET-22b(+) expression system containing the pelB signal sequence to the N terminus of the ACPT gene so that the translated protein could be secreted to the periplasmic region. After inducing the E. coli with IPTG, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication. Since thecis-prenyltransferase is a membrane-bound protein, it was necessary to treat Triton X-100 at a 1% concentration to solubilize the protein from the membranes. The proteins were purified by using a His tag affinity column from the supernatant and analyzed by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). The major band at an expected size of 36 kDa (ACPT plus His tag) was clearly observed in the extract from the IPTG-induced cells. In contrast, no band was observed in the extract from the same E. coli cells but without IPTG induction. Since we do not have the antibody for ACPT, it was not feasible to directly detect the ACPT protein by Western blot. However, Western blot analysis of the ACPT-His tag fusion protein using the His tag antibody revealed that the major protein of 36 kDa in size is the translated product of the pET-ACPT construct (Fig. 4). To determine whether the gene we have cloned is really thecis-prenyltransferase, a standard activity assay ofcis-prenyltransferase was performed with IPP and FPP as substrates. In a time course experiment using the recombinant enzyme, it was clearly noted that [14C]IPP incorporation increased linearly with incubation time up to 3 h (data not shown). It was also observed that [14C]IPP incorporation increased with the amount of enzyme added in the reaction mixture (data not shown). Since Mg2+ ion is known to be required for the activity of cis-prenyltransferase from E. coli(25.Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of Mg2+ ion on catalytic activity of ACPT was investigated. No activity was observed in the absence of Mg2+ ion, and a rapid increase of enzyme activity was detected with the addition of Mg2+ ion up to 2 mm. A further addition of Mg2+ ion inhibited the activity (Fig. 5). Triton X-100 was absolutely required for the activity of bacterial undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase (25.Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the purification of recombinant ACPT, Triton X-100 was necessary to solubilize the protein from membrane. To test whether Triton X-100 is necessary for the activity of the enzyme, we investigated several times the ACPT activity with varying concentration of Triton X-100. Maximum activity was observed at 0.01% Triton X-100. However, the purified enzyme showed about 80% activity in the absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 5), indicating that ACPT is not strictly dependent on Triton X-100 for its activity. The substrate specificities of ACPT were investigated with different amounts of allylic diphosphate substrates (Fig.6). The substrate concentrations were plotted against the total extractable radioactivities. Between the two initiating molecules tested (trans,trans-FPP andtrans,trans,trans-GGPP), trans,trans-FPP was a better substrate than trans,trans,trans-GGPP, with enzyme saturation being achieved at 2 and 10 μm, respectively (Fig. 6). The condensing substrate, IPP, was a poor substrate, since the enzyme saturation was achieved at 200 μm. The data from Fig. 6 were used to calculate K m andV max values for the different substrates, according to Lineweaver-Burk analysis. The enzyme exhibits a higher affinity for trans,trans-FPP than for all-trans-GGPP, with the K m values being 0.13 and 3.62 μm, respectively. The enzyme shows a lower affinity for IPP, with a K m of 23 μm. The purified enzymes were incubated with FPP and [14C]IPP, and the reaction products were analyzed on TLC and GPC. The products formed were subsequently extracted, dephosphorylated enzymatically, and separated using reverse phase TLC (Fig. 7). The dephosphorylated reaction products migrated more slowly than the polyprenol standard with carbon number of 90, indicating that ACPT synthesized polyisoprenes with carbon number higher than 90. In order to determine the size distribution of polyisoprenes, the reaction products extracted with butanol were analyzed by GPC. The effluents were collected at 0.5-ml intervals, and their radioactivities were measured by liquid scintillation counter. The peak activity was observed at the point that corresponded to the polyisoprene with carbon number C120. In order to test whether ACPT can catalyze the formation of higher molecular weight polyisoprenes such as natural rubber, an in vitro rubber biosynthesis assay was conducted. Gel permeation chromatography analysis of the benzene extract of the reaction products indicated that the predominant reaction product of ACPT was prenyl diphosphate with carbon number 120, and no polymers with higher molecular size was produced. This result suggests that ACPT itself could not catalyze the formation of higher molecular weight rubber-like polymers. The plant cis-prenyltransferase from A. thaliana shares a common feature in its primary structure tocis-prenyltransferases from E. coli, M. luteus, and yeast. A number of conserved domains are identified throughout the sequence. However, the potential significance of these domains in substrate binding and catalytic activity remains to be investigated. The DDXXD motif conserved for the allylic substrate and IPP bindings in trans-prenyltransferase is not present in cis-prenyltransferase. Fortrans-prenyltransferase, aspartate residues are involved for the liganding of multiple Mg2+ ions required for the substrate binding (19.Ohnuma S. Hirooka K. Tsuruoka N. Yano M. Ohto C. Nakane H.

Absence of the conserved DDXXD motif in cis-prenyltransferase suggests that the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme is different from that oftrans-prenyltransferase. The gene related to ACPT we have cloned by PCR and cDNA library screening has been reported as a hypothetical protein based on anArabidopsis genomic sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence of ACPT with 303 amino acids is identical to the hypothetical protein in chromosome II BAC F26B6 (accession no. AC003040) with 290 amino acids, except 13 extra amino acids in ACPT and a few mismatch in N terminus. The ACPT also shares a high sequence homology (30% identity) with the hypothetical protein in chromosome II P1 MJB20 (accession no. AC007584), which is relatively short with 260 amino acids and lacks the corresponding amino acids in its N terminus. In order to investigate the copy number ofcis-prenyltransferase in Arabidopsis, high molecular weight total DNA was prepared by using a plant genomic isolation kit (Omega Biotek), digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, blotted on a nylon membrane by capillary method, and was subjected to Southern blot analysis. The presence of these two related genes with high sequence homology was supported by two to three signals in Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA of A. thaliana(data not shown). Arabidopsis cis-prenyltransferase contains additional 30 amino acids in N terminus compared with the enzymes from E. coli, M. luteus, and yeast. Hydropathy and PSORT analyses revealed that this extra N-terminal amino acid sequence of ACPT is hydrophobic and has transmembrane helix motif, which contrasts with other cis-prenyltransferases from E. coli,M. luteus, and yeast that do not contain the motif. During the purification of ACPT, we were not able to detect the enzyme in the soluble faction of the cell lysate in the buffer not containing Triton X-100. The addition of Triton X-100 to the cell lysis buffer was required to solubilize the enzyme from the membranes and to purify the recombinant protein. These results suggest that ACPT does exist in association with membrane in plants. The enzyme displayed higher affinity for trans,trans-FPP than for all-trans-GGPP (Fig. 6). This characteristic was also observed in cis-prenyltransferase from rat liver microsome (33.Ericsson J. Thelin A. Chojnack T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19730-19735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We do not have direct evidence for the biological function ofcis-prenyltransferase in plants. The prokaryoticcis-prenyltransferase, undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, catalyzes the formation of undecaprenyl diphosphate (C55) that serves as a glycosyl carrier lipid during the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharide components (24.Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25.Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J.

The eukaryoticcis-prenyltransferase is involved in the biosynthesis of dolichols that are used for the posttranslational glycosylation of proteins (27.Sato M. Sato K. Nishigawa S.-I. Hirata A. Kato J.-I. Nakano A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the analysis of ACPT transcripts inArabidopsis, we were not able to detect the mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Our RT-PCR analysis of the transcripts indicated that ACPT is expressed in low levels in various tissues including leaf, stem, flower, and silique, but at slightly higher levels in roots and leaves. The tissue-specific expressions suggest a functional role of the enzyme in Arabidopsis growth and development. Rubber polymerase or rubber transferase belongs to a family ofcis-prenyltransferases that catalyze the formation of polyprenyl diphosphates by sequential condensation of IPP to allylic diphosphate. Our primary interest is to identifycis-prenyltransferase involved in rubber biosynthesis. The present data revealed that Arabidopsis cis-prenyltransferase itself could not catalyze the formation of rubber. It is possible that in addition to cis-prenyltransferase other factors such as rubber elongation factor and termination factor are required for the synthesis of rubber. It is also possible that a rubber polymerase is an entirely different protein from cis-prenyltransferase, as suggested by Oh et al. (29.Oh S.K. Kang H. Shin D.H. Yang J. Chow K.S. Yeang H.Y. Wagner B. Breiteneder H. Han K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17132-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Identification and isolation of more cis-prenyltransferases from different rubber producing plant species are necessary to further determine whethercis-prenyltransferase is related to rubber polymerase. We are currently searching for the related genes ofcis-prenyltransferase from various rubber producing plant species. In conclusion, we have isolated and characterized the first plantcis-prenyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous in several conserved regions to those of cis-prenyltransferases fromM. luteus, E. coli, and yeast. In vitro analysis of the recombinant protein overexpressed inE. coli revealed that the enzyme catalyzes the formation of polyprenyl diphosphates with predominant carbon number C120. In vitro rubber biosynthesis analysis indicated that cis-prenyltransferase could not catalyze the formation of higher molecular weight polyprenyl diphosphates such as natural rubber. The cis-prenyltransferase was expressed in low levels in all tissues of Arabidopsis tested, but at slightly higher levels in roots and leaves, and only barely in siliques. The results described here represent an important step in understanding the primary structure of cis-prenyltransferase in higher plants and provide a basis for the further investigation of the catalytic mechanism of chain elongation in polyprenyl diphosphates biosynthesis. We are grateful to G. T. Choi for providing the Arabidopsis cDNA library and to M. H. Lee for help in growing Arabidopsis. We thank Pill-Soon Song for critical reading of the manuscript."

Blood. 1987; 70: 605-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). vWF mediates the adhesion of platelets to sites of injury by forming a bridge between components of the subendothelium and platelet receptor sites on glycoproteins (GP)Ib/IX/V and IIb/IIIa. The interaction with vWF stabilizes adherent platelets and permits them to remain attached under the shear stresses encountered in the arterial circulation (3.De Marco L. Girolami A. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4.De Marco L. Girolami A. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Although plasma vWF does not bind to circulating platelets, the interaction can be induced by the addition of the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin, by subjecting a platelet-vWF suspension to shear stress, or by immobilization of vWF onto vascular subendothelium or other surfaces. It has been assumed, but not proven, that modulation of GPIb/IX binding activity involves conformational changes in vWF, with exposure of functional sites that are normally hidden when the protein is in solution. The vWF-binding site for platelet GPIb is localized in the first of three repeated A domains (vWF-A1). We previously reported the crystal structure of a recombinant vWF-A1 domain (7.Emsley J. Cruz M. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10396-10401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The A1 domain (amino acids 479–717) contains 2 cysteine residues that form an intramolecular disulfide bond (Cys509–Cys695). The amino acid sequence residing between the two cysteines, Ser510–Leu694, adopts a globular structure in which the hydrophobic β sheet forms a central core that is surrounded by amphipathic α helices (7.Emsley J. Cruz M. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10396-10401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The vWF-A1 domain of vWF has been studied extensively, and it is well established that the GPIb-binding site resides within this region (8.Pietu G. Meulien P. Cherel G. Diaz J. Baruch D. Courtney M.

Biochem. 1991; 196: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several attempts have been made to identify those amino acid residues that are critical for vWF-A1 function. However, despite these studies, which have employed deletion or alanine scanning mutagenesis (13.Kroner P.A. Frey A.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13460-13468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), only a double mutation at Glu596 and Lys599 has been reported to impair the binding of vWF to platelet GPIb/IX/V (14.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Other mutations impair either the binding or the activity of the modulator botrocetin. Three naturally occurring mis-sense mutations have been identified in the A1 domain, which impair hemostasis. Patients carrying these three mutations (G561S, F606I, and I662F) have a variant form of von Willebrand's disease called type 2M disease (15.Rabinowitz I. Tuley E.A. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M.

Jozwiak M.A. Christopherson P.A. Cox G.J. Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which is characterized by low vWF antigen levels and disproportionately low ristocetin cofactor activity but normal vWF multimer structure. Paradoxically, despite a clear hemostatic defect, botrocetin-induced binding of patient vWF to platelets remains normal. The unusual phenotype induced by these mutations has been reproduced by the study of recombinant vWF carrying the type 2M mutations (15.Rabinowitz I. Tuley E.A. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Firkin B.G. Howard M.A. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9846-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16.Hillery C.A. Mancuso D.J. Sadler J.E. Ponder J.W. Jozwiak M.A. Christopherson P.A. Cox G.J. Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This disparity between the clinical and laboratory findings suggests that additional testing of the type 2M vWD mutants, perhaps under flow conditions, may be necessary to understand how these mutations perturb hemostasis. We have previously reported the expression and characterization of a recombinant vWF-A1 protein that inhibits the interaction of full-length vWF with GPIb (17.Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that recombinant vWF-A1 binds to GPIb without the need for modulators and is an effective inhibitor of ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. As previously noted, we have also determined the crystal structure of the vWF-A1 domain (7.Emsley J. Cruz M. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10396-10401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the current study, we used the crystal structure of the vWF-A1 domain to identify candidate residues that might interact with the GPIbα polypeptide in the platelet GPIb-IX-V complex. Residues that were located on the surface of the domain and might serve as contact sites between vWF and the GPIbα polypeptide subunit were selected for mutagenesis. We then expressed recombinant mutant vWF-A1 and analyzed both the inhibition of ristocetin-dependent platelet agglutination and the support of flow-dependent platelet adhesion by these mutants. We have identified a cluster of amino acids on the front and upper anterior faces of the vWF-A1 domain which, we believe, constitute the GPIb interaction site and mediate platelet attachment to vWF. Mutations were introduced into vWF-A1 cDNA with a PCR-based mutagenesis strategy. Two rounds of PCR amplification were performed. First, each oligonucleotide primer with the desired nucleotide substitution was combined with an end primer and amplified. Second, the resultant DNA fragment was then combined with the opposite end primer to produce the vWF-A1 cDNA fragment. The outside primers introduced BamHI andHindIII restriction sites for cloning. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted into pQE9 as described previously (17.Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid residues mutated were as follows: R524S, S526R, E557Q, D560S, D560R, G561S (type 2M vWD), H563T, Q583R, K585E, Q590R, E596A, Q604R, S607R, Q628R, R629E, H656E, L659R, and K660E. Each of the mutant plasmids was sequenced to confirm both the presence of the desired mutation and the lack of any other mutations. Escherichia coli M15 [pREP4] (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) containing each of the pQE9-vWF-A1 variants was cultured overnight at 37 °C in 30 ml of 25 g/liter tryptone, 15 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.3, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was diluted 1:30 and grown to an A 595 of 0.8. The culture was adjusted to 1.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing a final concentration of 250 μg/ml lysozyme and allowed to stand for 15 min at 4 °C. The bacterial cells were lysed in the presence of 1.25 mg/ml deoxycholic acid and 7 μg/ml DNase I. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min and the pellet washed with lysis buffer containing 3 m urea, 2.5% Triton X-100, and 10 mm EDTA followed by recentrifugation. For the purification of the vWF-A1 proteins, the washed pellet was solubilized by the addition of 6.5 m guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The solubilized proteins were diluted 40-fold in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.8. They were passed over a Ni2+-chelated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.8 buffer. vWF-A1 proteins eluted from the column with 350 mm imidazole. The isolated proteins were adsorbed to and eluted from a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The highly purified proteins were dialyzed against 25 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.8. Ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination was carried out in siliconized glass cuvettes at 37 °C with constant stirring at 1,200 rpm in a 4-channel aggregometer (Bio/Data Corp. Horsham, PA). A suspension of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) containing 2 μm each of vWF-A1 mutant was prepared. After 5 min incubation at 37 °C, agglutination was initiated by the addition of ristocetin (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Blood was collected from healthy donors, and platelets were obtained by centrifugation of platelet-rich plasma. Platelets were washed twice in HEPES buffer (145 mmNaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1% glucose, and 0.2% human serum albumin, pH 7.4), resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 108/ml, and used within 2 h of purification. vWF from human plasma (20 μg/ml) and purified recombinant vWF-A1 protein (diluted to 100 μg/ml with 10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4) were loaded into capillary tubes (rectangular glass tubes with a cross-section of 300 μm × 30 mm) (Vitro dynamics Inc., Rockaway, NJ) by capillary action and stored overnight at 4 °C. Coated-capillary tubes were subsequently rinsed and incubated with PBS containing 1% human serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C to block nonspecific interactions. Protein-coated capillary tubes were taped to the stage of an inverted phase contrast microscope and Tygon plastic tubing (Norton Performance Plastic Corp., Akron, OH) attached to each end. For attachment assays, platelets were resuspended at concentrations of either 1 or 2 × 108/ml in HEPES buffer and drawn through the capillary tubes at shear rates of 50 or 600 s−1 for 5 min, respectively. The wall shear stress was calculated from the momentum balance on a Newtonian fluid, assuming a viscosity of 1.0 centipoise (18.Buttrum S.M. Hatton R. Nash G.B. Blood. 1993; 82: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Attached platelets and their motion were observed with phase contrast objectives and quantitated by analysis of videotape images. The number of platelets attached per unit area (0.67 mm2) was quantitated using four fields of view for each data point. All experiments were performed in duplicate on different days. For antibody inhibition studies or competition studies, platelets were incubated with 1:200 dilution of monoclonal antibody 6D1 ascites or 2 or 4 μm wild type vWF-A1 protein, respectively, for 15 min at room temperature before the attachment assay. We also used a parallel plate flow chamber that was assembled as described by the manufacturer (Glycotech, Rockville, MD). Purified recombinant vWF-A1 protein (diluted to 150 μg/ml with 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was added to a glass coverslip and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Coated coverslips were subsequently rinsed and incubated with TBS. The adsorbed proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, after rinsing the unadsorbed A1 protein, residual binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS (TBS-T) for 30 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were then washed with TBS-T, and the coupled A1 protein was detected with TBS-T containing 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed five times with TBS-T, and the substrate (o-phenylenediamine) was added. After 30 min of substrate conversion, 0.050 ml were transferred to microtiter plates, and the reaction was stopped with the addition of 0.01 ml of 2 nH2SO4. Plates were read at 490 nm. Net specific binding was determined by subtracting OD values from coverslips coated only with bovine serum albumin from the total binding values obtained. The vWF-A1-coated coverslip formed the lower surface of the chamber, and a silicone rubber gasket determined the flow path height of 254 μm. The flow chamber was assembled and filled with TBS. A syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA) was used to aspirate blood through the flow chamber. The flow rate of 0.48 and 0.6 ml/min produced a wall shear rate of 300 and 1500 s−1, respectively (18.Buttrum S.M. Hatton R. Nash G.B. Blood. 1993; 82: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blood was collected from healthy adult donors into syringes containing 3.8% of sodium citrate as anticoagulant. Blood was then perfused for 2 min, and the coated coverslip was washed with TBS. Attached platelets were observed with phase contrast objectives and recorded with a VCR (Sony). The number of adherent platelets was determined by overlays on a 36-square grid on at least 6–8 frames and counting and averaging the number of platelets in 12 randomly selected squares. The data points represent the average of 2–3 individual experiments. For some experiments, the whole frame was counted. For antibody inhibition studies or competition studies, whole blood was incubated with 100 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 6D1 or 2 or 4 μm wild type vWF-A1 protein for 5 min at 37 °C before the adhesion assay. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels assessed the purity of the fragments (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Platelets adhered to immobilized multimeric vWF and to the recombinant A1 domain at all flow rates tested. In fact, highly purified recombinant A1, when immobilized, seemed to support platelet adhesion as well as multimeric vWF at 600 s−1 (Fig. 1). Since it was impossible to determine the molecular weight of vWF multimers, which are heterogeneous, it was difficult to make a precise comparison. However, at a concentration of 20 μg/ml, multimeric vWF supported the adhesion of 180 ± 23 platelets/mm2surface area at a flow rate of 600 s−1. A concentration (100 μg/ml) of vWF-A1 supported 260 ± 15.5 platelets/mm2 at the same flow rate. After 5 min of perfusion over surfaces coated with either protein, only single adherent platelets were observed in the flow chamber. By solving the crystal structure of vWF-A1, we were able to inspect the structural model and select amino acid residues that might serve as contact sites for GPIb. The selections were made based on their position within the folded domain and the orientation and chemical nature of their side chains. Based on experience with other proteins, we hypothesized that the residues that mediate binding were most likely to be solvent-accessible and on the surface of the A1 domain. We also avoided residues that we could show were involved in internal hydrogen or hydrophobic interactions that, if modified, would perturb the global structure of the domain. In addition, we also created one of the mutations causing type 2M vWD, G561S. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein containing the mutation E596A, which was previously reported to be essential for the GPIb-vWF interaction (14.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), resulted with an additional mutation, T594S. Despite the mis-sense mutation, we proceeded to report its effect in this study. Mutant vWF-A1 proteins were expressed and purified, as described for wild type vWF-A1. The average yield of the mutant proteins was between 2 and 4 mg/liter of bacterial culture. All the proteins migrated identically to wild type vWF-A1 protein, when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and non-reducing conditions (data not shown). As previously reported for the wild type vWF-A1 protein, differential migration under reduced and non-reduced conditions provided evidence for the formation of a disulfide bond between Cys509 and Cys695 (17.Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the process of purification, all of the mutants were adsorbed to and eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns, suggesting that none of the mutations impaired heparin binding. This was expected, as the heparin-binding site is located in a different part of the A1 domain (20.Sobel M. Soler D.F. Kermode J.C. Harris R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8857-8862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we tested the reactivity of the mutants with a conformationally specific vWF-A1 domain antibody. 2A.G. McLeod, H. Yuan, and R. I. Handin, submitted for publication. This antibody blocks the interaction of vWF with platelet GPIb/IX/V in RIPA and in flow assays. Compared with wild type, 15 mutants bound normally (>80% wild type binding) indicating that they are correctly folded. Mutants H563T and Q590R bound >60% of wild type. Only the mutation R524S had the lowest binding activity (<15%).2 Some mutants were also tested with the monoclonal antibody, LJ-RG-46 (21.Mohri H. Fujimura Y. Shima M. Yoshioka A. Houghten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17901-17904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which recognizes an epitope on vWF-A1 that is not in the same area as the point mutations. They bound normal compared with wild type (data not shown). The ability of the recombinant vWF-A1 proteins to compete with multimeric vWF for binding to the GPIb complex was then analyzed. As previously reported 2 μm wild type vWF-A1 protein completely inhibited ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination (RIPA) (17.Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison, the introduction of mutations G561S, H563T, T594S/E596A, Q604R, S607R, and Q628R greatly impaired the ability of the mutant proteins to compete with multimeric vWF in the RIPA assay (Fig. 2). Mutations R524S, S526R, E557Q, D560S, Q583R, K585E, R629E, and H656E inhibited RIPA between 40 and 60%, whereas the mutations D560R, Q590R, L659, and K660E inhibited RIPA between 25 and 35%. To better evaluate the effect of these mutations in a more physiologically relevant setting, we next studied the ability of mutant proteins to support flow-dependent platelet adhesion at a low shear rate of 50 s−1. In some cases there was a close correlation between the two assays. Those mutations that retained less than 25% of their inhibitory activity in the RIPA assays, D560R, G561S, H563T, T594S/E596A, Q604R, and S607R, completely lost their ability to support capillary tube adhesion (Fig.3 A). E557Q and D560S, which inhibited RIPA by 40%, supported 60% of wild type adhesion. There were also some minor discrepancies, which could be explained by the fact that the flow assay does not require a modulator like ristocetin. R524S, which inhibited RIPA by 50%, only supported 10% of normal platelet adhesion. Q590R and R629E were fully active in the adhesion assay but retained only 50% of their RIPA inhibitory activity. The remaining mutants retained only 25% of wild type adhesive activity. It is important to point out that mutation of the same six residues Gly561, His563, Thr594/Glu596, Gln604, and Ser607 had the most marked effect on both the RIPA and the low shear adhesion assays. Fig. 3 A also shows that the interaction of platelets with immobilized vWF-A1 can be blocked by the addition of the monoclonal anti-GPIb antibody 6D1 or by the addition of soluble wild type vWF-A1 protein. As seen in Fig. 3 B, the results obtained at calculated shear rates of 600 s−1 were comparable to those obtained at a shear rate of 50 s−1. There are several limitations to the capillary tube flow system. A large volume of perfusate is needed to obtain high shear rates, and the system uses extensively washed platelets, without added red blood cells. Accordingly, we repeated the studies in a parallel plate perfusion chamber under both intermediate (300 s−1) and high shear (1500 s−1) conditions using whole blood as the source of platelets. Fig. 4 shows a representative photomicrograph of attached platelets after 2 min of perfusion with whole blood at high shear stress. Mutation G561S completely abolished the ability of vWF-A1 to support platelet adhesion and E557Q partially inhibited adhesion. Mutation K660E supported near normal platelet adhesion. Fig. 5 A shows the quantitative analysis of attached platelets at intermediate shear (300 s−1) and Fig. 5 B at high shear (1500 s−1) rates. The five mutant proteins with no adhesive activity at low (50 s−1) shear stress gave similar results at intermediate and high shear. There were several new and discrepant observations at higher shear. Mutations S526R, K585E, and R629E that inhibited RIPA by 40–50% and had 25–100% adhesive activity at low shear retained 25–95% activity at the higher shears rates. However, mutations E557Q, D560S, Q583R, and H656E that also retained 45–60% inhibitory activity in the RIPA and had a 70 to 30% activity at low shear fell to 10 to 0% at the two higher shear rates. Interestingly, R524S that inhibited RIPA by 50% had no activity at the two measured shear rates. Unexpectedly, K660E, which inhibited RIPA by 30% and had a 25% activity at low shear, had more activity at intermediate (55%) and high (90%) shear. Q590R, Q628R, and L659R, which retained 25–100% activity at low shear, fell to 0% activity at the two higher rates of shear stress. The type of amino acid substitution, as well as the position of the substitution, can influence the results. Conversion of Asp560 to Ser rather than Arg reduced activity at low shear to 50% of wild type activity and completely abolished activity at higher shear. In contrast, D560R, which had no adhesive activity at low shear, resulted with >40% activity at higher shears. The inhibition of platelet adhesion at high shear stress with soluble wild type vWF-A1 protein or monoclonal antibody 6D1 was similar to low shear conditions (Fig. 5 B). Protein-coated coverslips analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the anti-polyhistidine antibody demonstrated that the adsorption of protein on coverslip was similar for all the recombinant proteins (data not shown). It is well established that vWF mediates the flow-dependent adhesion of platelets to vascular subendothelium via its A1 domain (6.Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we reported the expression of a recombinant vWF-A1 protein that binds directly to GPIb and competes with multimeric vWF in the RIPA assay (17.Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21238-21245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have demonstrated that recombinant vWF-A1 protein also supports flow-dependent platelet adhesion to capillary tubes and microslides in an ex vivo perfusion chamber as effectively as full-length vWF multimers. Since each vWF-A1 molecule only contains a single GPIb/IX/V interaction site, this suggests that a single contact between a platelet and vWF may be sufficient to arrest flow and permit stable flow-dependent adhesion. This was somewhat surprising, as it is well known that high molecular weight vWF multimers are more effective in RIPA assays and are necessary for optimal hemostasis in vivo (22.Fischer B.E. Kramer G. Mitterer A. Grillberger L. Reiter M. Mundt W. Dorner F. Eibl J. Thromb. Res. 1996; 84: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although each vWF multimer contains multiple vWF-A1 domains and, therefore, potential platelet-binding sites, the relatively compact globular shape of vWF may limit the number of A1 domains that can participate in hemostasis. We and others (23.Slayter H. Loscalzo J. Bockenstedt P. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8559-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Fowler W.E. Fretto L.J. Hamilton K.K. Erickson H.P. McKee P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have previously reported that vWF has a loosely coiled oblate ellipsoid with average dimensions of 250 × 50 Å. There is now evidence, obtained by atomic force microscopy, that some unfolding of vWF occurs when it is immobilized and subjected to shear stress (25.Siedlecki C.A. Lestini B.J. Kottke-Marchant K.K. Eppell S.J. Wilson D.L. Marchant R.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the calculated size of the unfolded form of vWF is still substantially less than what one would predict for fully extended vWF polymers, suggesting that even in immobilized vWF multimers only a fraction of the total number of vWF-A1 interaction sites may be available for platelet adhesion. Another explanation is that the platelets in the perfusion chamber are interacting with multiple independent vWF-A1 domains that are immobilized and arrayed on the capillary tube. This could occur if some fraction of the immobilized vWF-A1 molecules were spaced optimally and mimicked the geometry of available vWF-A1 domains in the immobilized polymeric vWF. The data derived from the flow chamber studies also provide evidence that the folding and conformation of the isolated vWF-A1 domain is similar to that found in full-length vWF as both support flow-dependent platelet adhesion equally well. We have used the two previously described flow systems as they provided an efficient and physiologically relevant method to study the function of small quantities of recombinant mutant proteins. The analysis is also simplified as it utilizes recombinant vWF-A1 protein rather than the more heterogeneous vWF multimers. Using flow-dependent adhesion as one of the functional end points, since the recombinant vWF-A1 domain expressed is fully active, also eliminates the need for a modulator like ristocetin. The close correlation between the reduced capacity of mutant forms of vWF-A1 to support adhesion and inhibit RIPA helps to validate the RIPA assays and supports our contention that the residues we have identified play a role in platelet adhesion. There is some clinical data suggesting a region of vWF-A1 that could mediate binding to platelet GPIb. There are three mutations, G561S, F606I, and I662F, that have been described in patients that have nearly normal levels of vWF protein but significant impairment of hemostasis and clinical bleeding, a variant called type 2M von Willebrand's disease. These A1 domain mutations impair vWF binding to GPIb but do not affect vWF binding to collagen and heparin (15.Rabinowitz I. Tuley E.A. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Firkin B.G. Howard M.A. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9846-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16.Hillery C.A. Mancuso D.J. Sadler J.E. Ponder J.W. Jozwiak M.A. Christopherson P.A. Cox G.J. Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although these mutations decrease ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination, the 2M vWF mutant proteins can still be activated by botrocetin (15.Rabinowitz I. Tuley E.A. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Firkin B.G. Howard M.A. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9846-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16.Hillery C.A. Mancuso D.J. Sadler J.E. Ponder J.W. Jozwiak M.A. Christopherson P.A. Cox G.J. Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1572-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study is the first to analyze the effect of the type 2M mutation, G561S, on the isolated vWF-A1 domain. The result obtained with this mutant confirmed the clinical observation of a hemostatic defect. The importance of this residue can be explained by inspection of the crystal structure (Fig.6) which demonstrates that Gly561 is surface-exposed and lies at the center of the putative GPIb-binding surface (see below). The two other amino acid residues implicated in type 2M vWD, Phe606 and Ile662, are buried in the hydrophobic core of the domain, so that their effect on GPIb binding must be indirect, perhaps via destabilization of the global fold. Kroner and Frey (13.Kroner P.A. Frey A.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13460-13468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Matsushita and Sadler (14.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using deletion and alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the vWF-A1 domain attempted to define the GPIb contact site. Since studies with full-length vWF require modulators like ristocetin and botrocetin to induce vWF binding to platelet GPIb, they encountered mutations that impaired modulator binding that were not located in the GPIb-binding site. However, the mutation of two residues, Glu596 and Lys599, clearly reduced the vWF interaction with GPIb (14.Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study, mutations of Thr594 and Glu596 also confirmed the observations reported by these other groups who used recombinant full-length vWF in their studies. Interestingly, Glu596lies very close to Gly561 in the three-dimensional structure. The residues chosen for mutagenesis in our study were completely exposed on the surface of the domain and did not form hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, van der Waals interactions or have other contact with the rest of the domain. Mutations were carefully designed to avoid creating additional bonding interactions. As we were trying to disrupt a large interface with a point mutant, the mutations were designed to be as radical as possible (either uncharged-to-charged or charge reversal), with the introduced side chain larger rather than smaller than the wild type residue. In practice, most of the residues were changed to either glutamate or arginine. Six of the 18 mutant proteins showed impaired activity at all shear rates tested, whereas 4 others retained activity under all conditions. These results define a putative GPIb-binding surface encompassing the front and upper faces of the vWF-A1 domain (Fig. 6). This surface is adjacent to but distinct from the surfaces implicated in heparin and botrocetin binding and from the site of the vWD type IIB mutations, which cluster on the lower surface of the domain. The location is also distinct from the epitope of the function-blocking antibody, NMC-4, which binds to the right-hand face of the domain (26.Celikel R. Varughese K.I. Madhusudan A. Yoshioka A. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Six additional mutants showed activity at low shear but greatly reduced activity (<10%) at high shear, and one (K660E) showed increased activity with increased shear. This suggests, first, that the functional assay employed is critical. RIPA, a popular assay of vWF function, proved to be the least sensitive assay. Flow-dependent adhesion, particularly at high shear (1500 s−1), was the most stringent assay and picked up the highest percentage of mutants with impaired vWF function. A possible molecular explanation for these shear-dependent results comes from our studies of the homologous integrin I domain. Recent studies have shown that the I domain of integrin α2β1 switches conformation to a high affinity state when it engages ligand and that this involves a reorganization of the upper surface of the domain (27.Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations to residues that change position in the two conformations have different effects on binding activity under staticversus flow conditions, suggesting that adhesion under static conditions detects binding to the low affinity conformation (28.Smith C. Estavillo D. Emsley J. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4205-4209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If the vWF A1 domain undergoes analogous conformational changes, it could explain the shear-dependent results and the contrasting effects of certain mutations. The crystal structure of a complex between A1 and a suitable fragment of GPIbα will be required to test this hypothesis and to interpret completely the mutational data. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that a mutation introduced in the critical area that we have defined markedly reduces the ability of the A1 domain to support flow-dependent adhesion and also causes a bleeding diathesis in patients with type 2M vWD. This not only helps validate that we have identified the appropriate region of the vWF-A1 domain but that our ex vivo analytic model using isolated recombinant domain proteins is valid. Finally, these studies demonstrate that it is possible to make accurate predictions about protein function from the analysis of three-dimensional protein structure and to confirm these postulates by site-specific mutagenesis and functional analysis of the recombinant polypeptides derived from a much larger homopolymer.

Treatment of the cells with high concentrations of glucose (15–33 mm) caused phosphorylation of serine residues of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), leading to reduced electrophoretic mobility of it. The phosphorylation of IRS-1 with high glucose treatment was blocked only by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors. The high glucose treatment attenuated insulin-induced association of IRS-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. A metabolic effect of insulin, stimulation of glycogen synthesis, was also inhibited by the treatment. In contrast, insulin-induced association of Shc and Grb2 was not inhibited. Treatment of the cells with high glucose promoted the translocation of PKCε and PKCδ from the cytosol to the plasma membrane but not that of other PKC isoforms. Finally, PKCε and PKCδ directly phosphorylated IRS-1 under cell-free conditions. We conclude that a high concentration of glucose causes phosphorylation of IRS-1, leading to selective attenuation of metabolic signaling of insulin. PKCε and PKCδ are involved in the down-regulation of insulin signaling, and they may lie in a pathway regulating the phosphorylation of IRS-1.

Kajimoto Y. Watada H. Kaneto H. Kishimoto M. Umayahara Y. Fujitani Y. Kamada T. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Once chronic hyperglycemia is established, however, hyperglycemia in turn damages pancreatic beta cell and aggravates insulin resistance, forming a vicious circle that is collectively called glucose toxicity (2.Rossetti L. Clin. Invest. Med. 1995; 18: 255-260PubMed Google Scholar). The pathophysiological importance of such self-perpetuating effects of hyperglycemia is well recognized; however, the underlying mechanism of glucose toxicity is still largely unknown. In the important insulin target tissues, the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, previous studies have suggested that an increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway eventually suppresses membrane expression of the GLUT4 glucose transporter, which is responsible for increased insulin resistance (3.Chen H. Ing B.L. Robinson K.A. Feagin A.C. Buse M.G. Quon M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 135: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Indeed, by continuous exposure of the cell to glucosamine per se, insulin resistance could be created (4.Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10155-10161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, however, Hrekso et al. (5.Hresko R.C. Heimberg H. Chi M.M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20658-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) found that glucosamine-induced insulin resistance may result from intracellular ATP-depletion. In another insulin target tissue, the liver, glucose transport across the plasma membrane cannot be a rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism due to abundant membrane expression of the GLUT2 glucose transporter with a high K m value (6.Fukumoto H. Seino S. Imura H. Seino Y. Eddy R.L. Fukushima Y. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), irrespective of the presence or absence of insulin. In the hepatocyte, therefore, insulin resistance results from impaired insulin receptor down-signaling. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of hyperglycemia-induced impairment of insulin receptor-down signaling in the hepatocyte has mostly been unknown. On the other hand, the pathological importance of hepatic insulin resistance in glucose homeostasis has recently been reappraised (7.Bergman R.N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 359-385PubMed Google Scholar). With these facts as background, we systematically examined in the present study how hyperglycemia disturbs insulin receptor down-signaling in the hepatocyte. Human recombinant insulin was obtained from Eli Lilly Co. (Indianapolis, IN). d-Glucose, sucrose, PMA,1 phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and wortmannin were purchased form Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), H7 and H89 from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan), and PD98059 and GF109203X from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). FK-366, an aldose reductase inhibitor, was a gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). All culture media, the serum, and the reagents for the cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10), a carboxyl-terminal anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibody (αIRS-1), anti-p85 polyclonal antibody (αp85), and rat recombinant IRS-1 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Shc monoclonal antibody (αShc), anti-Shc polyclonal antibody (αShc-poly), anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibody (αGrb2), and anti-PKC monoclonal antibodies against PKCα, PKCβ, PKCγ PKCε, and PKCδ were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-Akt polyclonal antibody (αAkt) and anti-phospho specific Akt polyclonal antibody (αpAkt), which recognizes threonine-308 phosphorylation, were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant human PKCε and PKCδ were obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, were obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10% heat-inactivated calf serum. Two days after plating, the medium was changed to F-12K containing 7 mmd-glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum, and the culture was continued for 2 more days. The cells were then cultured in serum-free F-12K medium containing 7 mmd-glucose for 12 h. Subsequently, the experimental treatment was carried out for the indicated periods with various concentrations ofd-glucose. PKC inhibitors (H7 and GF109203X), a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin), a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor (PD98059), a protein kinase A inhibitor (H89), or an aldose reductase inhibitor (FK-366) was included in some experiments as needed. In some experiments, the cells were exposed to 100 nm insulin for 10 min after 6 h of incubation with 33 mmd-glucose. Whole cell extracts were prepared by exposing the cells to 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 μm pepstatin) for 1 h at 4 °C as described (8.Yamauchi K. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17716-17722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were then subjected to Western blotting using antibodies such as 4G10, αIRS-1, αp85, αShc, αGrb2, αAkt, αpAkt, and αPKCs, visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and quantified by densitometry. For immunoprecipitation, the whole cell extracts were 5× diluted with the lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and incubated with 4 μg of αIRS-1 or αShc-poly for 2 h at 4 °C. Fifty microliters of protein A-agarose was then added, and incubation was carried out for another 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotted as described above. 32P-Labeled phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (9.Yamauchi K. Hashizume K. Ichikawa K. Ohtsuka H. Ohara N. Miyamoto T. Kobayashi M. Yamada T. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1991; 38: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were eluted from the gel using electrophoresis and were subjected to acid hydrolysis in 6 m HCl for 2 h at 110 °C. Phosphoamino acids were separated on the thin layer cellulose plates by electrophoresis at pH 3.5. As standard phosphoamino acids, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were added to all radioactive samples analyzed. The 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. The accumulation of glycogen was determined as described previously (10.Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). After serum deprivation and treatment with 7 or 33 mm glucose for 6 h, the cells were washed three times with serum-free F-12K medium and incubated with 7 mm glucose andd-[U-14C]glucose (2 μCi/well) in the presence or absence of insulin for 2 h. Then, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 30% KOH, and the radioactivity was counted as an index of incorporation of labeled glucose into glycogen. The cytosolic and membrane fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation as described previously (11.Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HepG2 cells were removed from the plates using a rubber policeman and homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 μm pepstatin. Then, the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was obtained as cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed with the same buffer, resuspended in the buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was collected as the membrane fraction. To the 100-μl cytosolic or membrane fractions, 50 μl of 3× Laemmli buffer was added; this mixture was boiled for 5 min and Western blotted after electrophoresis. Protein was measured with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoprecipitated IRS-1 was prepared from ten 100-mm dishes of HepG2 cells according to the immunoprecipitation protocol as described above, except that protein phosphatase inhibitors, such as sodium fluoride, sodium pyrophosphate, and sodium orthovanadate, were not included here. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 by PKCs was quantified by the incorporation of 32P from [r-32P]ATP into IRS-1 (12.Kanety H. Hemi R. Papa M.Z. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9895-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One microgram of immunoprecipitated IRS-1 or 1 μg of recombinant rat IRS-1 was incubated with 1 μg of PKCε or PKCδ in the absence or presence of 200 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol in Hepes buffer containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.03% Triton X-100. Phosphorylation was initiated by incubation with 10 mmMgCl2 and 100 μm [γ-P32]ATP (3 μCi/nmol) at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated 3 min later by addition of 10 mm ATP and 30 mm EDTA for 3 min. The resulting samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the autoradiography was taken. For mobility shift assay, recombinant IRS-1 incubated with PKCε or PKCδ as described above except using nonradioactive ATP. The resulting samples were then subjected to Western blotting using αIRS-1 antibody. Statistical significance of difference was evaluated by analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significance difference (StatView, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. As shown in Fig.1 A, electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 was decreased by the treatment of the cells with high (33 mm) d-glucose for 6, 12, and 24 h. The shift was not observed in the lysate prepared from the cells treated with 33 mmd-glucose for 48 h (Fig.1 A). The glucose effect on the mobility shift of IRS-1 was clearly concentration dependent (Fig. 1 B). One hundred nanomolar insulin reduced electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 in the presence of 7 mmd-glucose (Fig. 1 B, second lane from left). To rule out the possibility that the glucose effect on the electrophoretic mobility shift of IRS-1 is due to increased medium osmolarity, the effects of sucrose and glucose were compared in parallel. Twenty-six millimolar sucrose in the presence of 7 mmd-glucose did not at all affect the electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1, and 33 mmd-glucose significantly reduced the mobility of IRS-1 (Fig.2 A). The result implies that the electrophoretic mobility shift of IRS-1 caused by highd-glucose is due to specific modification of IRS-1 by the sugar, and the hyperosmolar effect was ruled out. In marked contrast to IRS-1, the electrophoretic mobility of Shc was not at all altered by the high glucose treatment of the cell (Fig.2 B). We considered that high glucose-induced reduction of electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 may be due to phosphorylation of IRS-1 molecule, as in the case of insulin stimulation. It is well established that insulin stimulation reduces electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 due to phosphorylation of IRS-1 (13.Dimitrijevic S.M. Ryves W.J. Parker P.J. Evans F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 259-267PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the possibility of high glucose-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was explored in the following experiments. First, involvement of protein kinases in the process of glucose-induced reduction of the electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 was examined by the use of inhibitors of various protein kinases and an inhibitor of aldose reductase at effective concentrations (10.Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11264-11275Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, 33 mmd-glucose-induced reduction of electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 was inhibited by appropriate concentration of H7 (10 μm) and GF109203X (200 nm) (PKC inhibitors). However, a low concentration (10 nm) of GF109203X, which inhibits conventional but not novel PKC, was without effect. High glucose-induced electrophoretic mobility shift of IRS-1 was not at all affected by wortmannin (PI 3-kinase inhibitor), PD98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor), or H89 (protein kinase A inhibitor). An aldose reductase inhibitor (FK-366) was also without effect on the high glucose-induced mobility shift of IRS-1, implying that intracellular accumulation of polyol is not responsible for it. As a next step, phosphorylation of IRS-1 by high glucose was directly analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4, serine and threonine residues of IRS-1 were phosphorylated by the treatment of the cells with 33 mmd-glucose for 6 h. In order to confirm the evidence, we examined the effect of PMA that is expected to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues of IRS-1 through activation of PKC. A significant increase in phosphorylation of these amino acids was observed after treatment with 100 nmPMA (Fig. 4). Only a trace amount of phosphoamino acids was detected in IRS-1 derived from the cells incubated with a basal concentration (7 mm) of d-glucose (Fig. 4). In the cells treated with 33 mmd-glucose for 6 h, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 took place normally, as in the control cells (Fig.5 A). However, insulin-induced association of IRS-1 and p85 was severely inhibited in the glucose-treated cells (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and association of it with Grb2 were both unaffected by the treatment of the cell with high glucose (Fig. 5 C). Akt is a key molecule mediating the metabolic effects of insulin in the liver. It lies downstream of PI 3-kinase and facilitates glycogen synthesis by inactivating glycogen synthase kinase-3 (18.van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 19.Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 A, the treatment of the cells with a high concentration of glucose clearly blocked the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt. As expected from reduced phosphorylation of Akt, the insulin-induced glycogen synthesis was markedly suppressed by the treatment with high glucose (Fig.6 B). Activation of PKC is expected to induce translocation of it from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (11.Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); therefore, membrane translocation of PKC upon exposure to high glucose was examined. As shown in Fig.7, treatment of the cells with 33 mmd-glucose promoted membrane translocation of PKCε and PKCδ but not of PKCα, PKCβ, PKCγ, or PKCλ. Immunoprecipitated IRS-1 of HepG2 cell was incubated with recombinant PKCε or PKCδ. As shown in Fig.8 A, upon addition of diacylgycerol and phosphatidylserine, PKCε and PKCδ phosphorylated themselves as described previously. At the same time, PKCε and PKCδ phosphorylated the immunoprecipitated IRS-1 (Fig. 8 A). Recombinant rat IRS-1 was also phosphorylated by the PKCs, as shown in Fig. 8 B. PKC phosphorylation of IRS-1 was associated with decreased electrophoretic mobility, as shown in Fig. 8 C. Insulin resistance in diabetes, especially in type 2 diabetes, was discovered more than 30 years ago (20.Yalow R.S. Glick S.M. Roth J. Berson S.A. Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 357-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and it is now well established that insulin resistance occurs in all insulin target tissues, such as skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver (7.Bergman R.N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 359-385PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Oakes N.D. Cooney G.J. Camilleri S. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through extensive research on the molecular basis of insulin receptor down-signaling (23.Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 24.Thorens B. Charron M.J. Lodish H.F. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the complexity of intracellular insulin signaling network has been gradually delineated. The two important biological actions of insulin, metabolic and growth-promoting actions, are mediated by activation of the PI 3-kinase (23.Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and Shc-Grb2 pathways (26.Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), respectively, although there appears to be a certain overlap between the two. IRS-1 is a proximal signaling molecule to all of these, and tyrosine phosphorylation of it by insulin facilitates association of IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase and association of IRS-1 and Shc. This leads to activation of the signaling cascades. Despite such advancement of the research in insulin receptor down-signaling, the locus of glucose toxicity in producing insulin resistance was not clear, especially in the liver. In this study, using HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, we investigated how hyperglycemia preferentially impairs the metabolic branch of insulin receptor-down signaling. Although it is ideal to carry out the study using the primary hepatocytes, it is practically impossible to analyze phosphorylation of the signaling molecules using the primary hepatocytes, most likely due to potent phosphatase activity of the hepatocytes under experimental conditions such as those used with the primary cell culture. We found that long term exposure of the cells to high concentration of glucose results in serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1, most likely through activation of PKCε and PKCδ. The phosphorylation of IRS-1 accompanied selective inhibition of insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 and p85 (a subunit of PI 3-kinase), and inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, a key regulator of glycogen synthesis. Also, we demonstrated that high glucose inhibited insulin-induced glycogen synthesis in this study. In sharp contrast, high glucose did not at all attenuate insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc or association of it with Grb2. PI 3-kinase was implicated to stimulate glycogen synthesis and prevent apoptosis through phosphorylation of Akt (27.Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28.Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), whereas signaling through Shc-Grb2 pathway activates the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase system to enhance cellular proliferation (29.Ouwens D.M. van der Zon G.C. Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Moller W. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Maassen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33116-33122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our data are rather straightforward. High glucose-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 selectively impairs metabolic down-signaling of insulin primarily by inhibition of IRS-1/p85 association. As far as we are aware, this is the first report showing the molecular mechanism of glucose toxicity in the liver-derived cell. We speculate that similar mechanism is operating in other insulin target tissues, the skeletal muscle and the adipose tissue, leading to insulin resistance. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 by high glucose was previously reported in pancreatic beta cells, but the functional significance of it was unknown (30.Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that high glucose induces electrophoretic retardation of IRS-1 due to phosphorylation of the molecule, indicating that a certain protein kinase is activated by high glucose in the cell. Although we did not directly show glucose-responsive protein kinase activity, PKC inhibitors prevented the high glucose-induced electrophoretic mobility shift of IRS-1, strongly suggesting the involvement of PKC. A known activator of PKC, PMA, mimicked the effect of high glucose. Furthermore, translocation of PKCε and PKCδ, but not other isoforms of PKC, from cytosol to the plasma membrane was found upon exposure to high glucose. A low concentration of the PKC inhibitor (10 nm GF109203X), which selectively inhibits conventional PKC (31.Asada A. Zhao Y. Kondo S. Iwata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28392-28398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), did not attenuate high glucose-induced IRS-1 mobility shift. But a high concentration of GF109203X (200 nm), which inhibits both conventional and novel PKCs (32.Douglas D.N. Fink H.S. Ridgway N.D. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), reduced the mobility shift. These results suggested that novel PKCs play an important role for IRS-1 phosphorylation induced by high concentration of glucose. The mechanism of activation of novel PKCs as PKCε and PKCδ by high glucose may be due to de novosynthesis of diacylglycerol (33.Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2295) Google Scholar). As PKCs activate many intracellular protein kinases, such as Raf-1 kinase (34.Magnuson N.S. Beck T. Vahidi H. Hahn H. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether PKC directly phosphorylates IRS-1 or phosphorylates it via activation of other kinase(s). We showed that PKCε and PKCδ directly phosphorylate IRS-1 under the cell-free conditions and decreased its electrophoretic mobility. Thus, we provided a strong evidence in support of the idea that IRS-1 is phosphorylated by PKC in the cells treated with high glucose, although we did not directly demonstrate it. We observed that IRS-1-PI 3-kinase system is selectively attenuated by high glucose. In other words, signaling for the growth-promoting effect of insulin remained intact with ambient high glucose. Because insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells is mainly regulated by plasma glucose concentration, a combination of mild hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia is common in type 2 diabetes. Provided that growth-promoting action of insulin is not impaired under that circumstance, hyperinsulinemia will excessively stimulate cell proliferation. Accordingly, we speculate that selective attenuation of metabolic branch of insulin signaling by glucose toxicity contributes to the development and progression of diabetic vascular complications. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is known to be one of the mediators of insulin resistance (22.Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Treatment of cultured adipocytes with TNFα induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and the phosphorylated IRS-1 in this setting acted as an inhibitor of the insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase activity in vitro (25.Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Karasik A. Elhanany E. Kanety H. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Although we did not measure the concentration of TNFα in the medium, the addition of TNFα antibody to the culture media at a concentration sufficient to neutralize 10 nm TNFα did not at all block the observed high glucose effects in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Also, high glucose did not decrease insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 5 A). In addition, overproduction of TNFα by the hepatocyte upon exposure to high glucose has not been reported. Therefore, we consider that involvement of TNFα in the in the process of hepatic glucose toxicity is most unlikely. Increased intracellular hexosamine, through impairment of membrane translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporter, has been claimed to be responsible for insulin resistance in the primary adipocytes, 3T3L adipocytes, and the skeletal muscle. However, we think this is not the case in our experiments, in which insulin resistance was studied in the liver-derived cells. First, in contrast to the adipocytes and skeletal muscles, glucose transport at the membrane is not the rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism. Second, we did not see retardation in electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 in 3T3L1 adipocytes (data not shown). In summary, we demonstrated that a high concentration of glucose selectively attenuates the metabolic branch of insulin receptor down-signaling in a hepatoma cell line, HepG2 cells. Highly selective alteration in phosphorylation status and functional coupling of the signaling molecules involved in the metabolic action of insulin were shown. We consider that a similar, if not identical, mechanism may be operating in the liver of the patients with diabetes in whom hepatic insulin resistance is one of the important contributing factors for sustained hyperglycemia. FK-366, an aldose reductase inhibitor, was a generous gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical (Osaka, Japan)."

The poorly viable homozygous rt mutant flies show strong defects in embryonic muscle development, indicating an essential role of the PMT family members not only in lower but also in higher eucaryotes. Very recently, a PMThomologue from humans (POMT1) has been cloned (17.Jurado L.A. Coloma A. Cruces J. Genomics. 1999; 58: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interspecies comparison revealed that POMT1-homologous sequences are present in mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, affirming that the PMT gene family is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. However, despite their evolutionary conservation and functional importance, still little is known about the biochemical and biophysical properties of these key enzymes of proteinO-mannosylation. Of the PMT family members, those from S. cerevisiae, especially ScPMT1, have been studied most thoroughly. ScPmt1p is an integral membrane glycoprotein of 817 amino acids located at the endoplasmic reticulum (18.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J.

ScPmt1p-catalyzed transfer of mannose from Dol-P-β-d-mannose (with inversion of its anomeric configuration) to serine/threonine residues of specific protein acceptors can be assayed both in vitroand in vivo (18.Strahl-Bolsinger S.

Biophys. 1995; 316: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that ScPmt1p glycosylates a restricted spectrum of peptides (18.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27.Lehle L. Bause E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 799: 246-251Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28.Lorenz C. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Ernst J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Concordantly, in vivo studies demonstrated that the individual mannosyltransferases ScPmt1p to ScPmt6p recognize specific protein substrates (29.Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the structural basis for the substrate specificities is unknown. Recently, we have analyzed the transmembrane topology of S. cerevisiae Pmt1p to establish a basis for the identification and characterization of structurally and functionally important protein domains. Both genetic and biochemical evidence supports a seven-transmembrane helical model (30.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) wherein a large, central, hydrophilic segment that is oriented toward the lumen of the ER is flanked by five amino-terminal and two carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning domains. The ScPmt1p amino terminus faces the cytoplasm, while the carboxyl terminus faces the lumen of the ER. In the current study, a structure-function analysis of ScPmt1p was performed. Using deletion mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the N-terminal third of the protein is essential for ScPmt1p-ScPmt2p complex formation. Moreover, the central hydrophilic region does not participate in ScPmt1p-ScPmt2p interaction but rather bears part of the catalytic unit. Inside this region, we recognized highly conserved sequence motifs that can be considered as hallmarks of thePMT family. In addition, numerous, perfectly conserved, single amino acid residues were found throughout the entire sequence of ScPmt1p. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate the functional importance of these highly conserved residues for ScPmt1p mannosyltransferase activity. The S. cerevisiae pmt1 deletion strain pmt1Δ (MATα, his3-Δ200, leu2–3,-112, lys2–801,trp1-Δ901, ura3–52,suc2-Δ9, pmt1::HIS3) (12.Lussier M. Gentzsch M. Sdicu A.-M. Bussey H. Tanner W. J. Biol.

Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used for all DNA manipulations (33.Sambrook J. Fritcsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All cloning and transformations were carried out in Escherichia coli hosts SURE®2 or ABLETMK (Stratagene). PCR fragments were routinely checked by sequence analysis. A total of six copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were fused to the C terminus ofPMT1. Thereto, a NotI site was introduced immediately upstream of the PMT1 stop codon by recombinant PCR (34.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar) on pSB53 DNA using the oligonucleotides Al4 (30.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), oligo133 (5′-tcactagcatgcggatccaccttcagcaaatg-3′; SphI site in boldface type), oligo136 (5′-gctgttttggaacgcggccgctaaatttcccagtactctccac-3′;NotI site underlined), and oligo137 (5′-ctgggaaatttagcggccgcgtcccaaaacagcccttttttctac-3′). The PCR fragment was subcloned as aPflMI-SphI fragment into PflMI-,SphI-digested pC731 (30.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pSB54. To delete the NotI site from the multiple cloning site, pSB54 was cut with SacII and XbaI, treated with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), and religated. In the resulting plasmid (pSB55), two copies of a 111-bp NotI fragment encoding three copies of the HA epitope isolated from pAxl2 (35.Roemer T. Madden K. Chang J. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were cloned, creating pSB56. Six copies of the HA epitope and the first 430 bp of the 3′-untranslated region of PMT1 were amplified by PCR on pSB56 with the primer pair oligo133 and oligo142a (5′-agtagtcgaccgcggccgcatcttttacccatac-3′;SalI site in boldface type and NotI site underlined). The PCR fragment was digested with SalI andSphI and subcloned into pC731 or pP616 (30.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) cut withXhoI and SphI, resulting in pSB63 and pSB64, respectively. The plasmid pSB53 was cut withSphI and NarI, treated with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), and religated to remove a HindIII site from the multiple cloning site. Subsequently, an internal 683-bpHindIII fragment was removed, resulting in the deletion of the PMT1 coding region from bp +916 to bp +1599. The created plasmid (pSB79) was digested with RsrII and XhoI and ligated with a 432-bp RsrII–XhoI fragment isolated from pSB56 fusing six copies of the HA epitope to the C-terminal region of the deletion construct. EcoRI toSalI sites were removed from the multiple cloning site of pK1 (30.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) resulting in pVG6. Subsequently, the creation of aSalI site at bp position +783 of PMT1 was attained by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene with oligonucleotides vg4 (5′-gatttgactaagtcGAccaagtccatcttc-3′; exchanged bases in uppercase type) and vg5 (5′-gaagatggacttggTCgacttagtcaaatc-3′). From the resulting plasmid (pVG8), the PMT1 coding sequence from bp +598 to bp +783 was removed by digestion with PstI and SalI and replaced by the oligonucleotide adapter vg6 (5′-gtctactctactaag-3′)/vg7 (5′-tcgacttagtagagtagactgca-3′; SalI and PstI overlaps are underlined), creating pVG10. pVG11 was constructed by subcloning a 1150-bp PmlI–KpnI fragment from pVG10 into pSB56 digested by PmlI andKpnI. Deletion of the PMT1coding region from bp +481 to bp +633 was achieved by recombinant PCR (34.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications.

The PCR fragment was digested with Bsp1407I and HindIII and subcloned into pVG6 (see above) cut with the same. A 1166-bpPmlI–KpnI fragment of the resulting plasmid was then subcloned into pSB56 (cut with PmlI andKpnI). Deletion of the PMT1coding region from bp +225 to bp +372 was achieved by recombinant PCR (34.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J.

The PCR fragment (cut with PmlI and PstI) was subcloned into pSB56 cut with the same. PMT1 point mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Plasmid pSB56 was used as template DNA. pSB105 (R64A) was made using the primer pair oligo252 (5′-gctgtctttacagcggtcattGCattgcatggcttggcatggc-3′; exchanged bases in uppercase type)/oligo253 (5′-gccatgccaagccatgcaatGCaatgaccgctgtaaagacagc-3′); pSB112 (E78A) was made using the primer pair oligo254 (5′-gacagcgtggtgtttgatgCagtacatttcggtgggtttgcc-3′)/oligo255 (5′-ggcaaacccaccgaaatgtactGcatcaaacaccacgctgtc-3′); pSB113 (D96A) was made using the primer pair oligo256 (5′-cattagggggacttacttcatggCtgtgcatcctcctcttgc-3′)/oligo257 (5′-gcaagaggaggatgcacaGccatgaagtaagtccccctaatg-3′); pSB114 (R138A) was made using the primer pair oligo258 (5′-cgacgccatacgtgttgatgGCatttttctctgcttctttggg-3′)/oligo259 (5′-cccaaagaagcagagaaaaatGCcatcaacacgtatggcgtcg-3′); pTZ6 (K234A) was made using the primer pair oligo185 (5′-ggtatggcatcttcatccGCatgggttggtcttttcacgg-3′)/oligo186 (5′-ccgtgaaaagaccaacccatGCggatgaagatgccatacc-3′); pTZ5 (W253A) was made using the primer pair oligo183 (5′-gtatctggagactaGCgttcatgattggggatttgac-3′)/oligo184 (5′-gtcaaatccccaatcatgaacGCtagtctccagatac-3′); pTZ4 (H346A/H348A) was made using the primer pair oligo181 (5′-ccatgggcggttatttgGCttctGCttcacacaattatccagc-3′)/oligo182 (5′-gctggataattgtgtgaaGCagaaGCcaaataaccgcccatgg-3′); pTZ1 (Q359A/Q360A) was made using the primer pair oligo187 (5′-ccagctggttcggaacaaGCaGCaagcactttatatcc-3′)/oligo188 (5′-ggatataaagtgcttGCtGCttgttccgaaccagctgg-3′); pSB104 (N370A) was made using the primer pair oligo264 (5′-ctttatatcctcacatggatgccGCtaacgattggttgttggaac-3′)/oligo265 (5′-gttccaacaaccaatcgttaGCggcatccatgtgaggatataaag-3′); pTZ7 (R398A) was made using the primer pair oligo196 (5′-ccgatggtaccaaggtcGCactattccacactg-3′)/oligo197 (5′-cagtgtggaatagtGCgaccttggtaccatcgg-3′); pSB115 (L399A) was made using the primer pair oligo274 (5′-ccgatggtaccaaggtcagaGCattccacactgttacaagatg-3′)/oligo275 (5′-catcttgtaacagtgtggaatGCtctgaccttggtaccatcgg-3′); pTZ3 (L408A/H411A) was made using the primer pair oligo191 (5′-ctgttacaagatgtagaGCacactctGCtgaccataagccacccg-3′)/oligo192 (5′-cgggtggcttatggtcaGCagagtgtGCtctacatcttgtaacag-3′); pSB108 (L408A) was made using the primer pair oligo266 (5′-ctgttacaagatgtagaGCacactctcatgaccataagccacc-3′)/oligo267 (5′-ggtggcttatggtcatgagagtgtGCtctacatcttgtaacag-3′); pSB102 (H411A) was made using the primer pair oligo268 (5′-acaagatgtagattacactctGCtgaccataagccacccgtttc-3′)/oligo269 (5′-gaaacgggtggcttatggtcaGCagagtgtaatctacatcttgt-3′); pTZ8 (R469A) was made using the primer pair oligo200 (5′-ggacacaaagtttGCattgagacatgctatgacaggc-3′)/oligo201 (5′-gcctgtcatagcatgtctcaatGCaaactttgtgtcc-3′); pTZ9 (H472A) was made using the primer pair oligo202 (5′-ggacacaaagtttagattgagaGCtgctatgacaggctg-3′)/oligo203 (5′-cagcctgtcatagcaGCtctcaatctaaactttgtgtcc-3′); and pTZ2 (Q493A/E495A) was made using the primer pair oligo189 (5′-cttgggggttcgaaGCacaaGCagttacctgtgcctcc-3′)/oligo190 (5′-ggaggcacaggtaactGCttgtGCttcgaacccccaag-3′). Multiple sequence alignments of PMT family members were prepared with ClustalW (36.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in synthetic complete medium (37.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 209-210Google Scholar). At a concentration of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml, 50 ml of cells were harvested; washed with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 mm MgCl2; and resuspended in 200 μl of the same buffer plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.25 mm TLCK, 50 μg/ml TPCK, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. An equal volume of glass beads was added, and the cells were lysed by vortexing, for 1 min, four times (with 1-min intervals on ice). The bottom of the tube was punctured, and the lysate was collected. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellet (cell walls) was stored at −20 °C. Crude membranes were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C (Sorvall SS34 rotor); resuspended in 250 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 15% glycerol; and stored in liquid nitrogen. Yeast cells were grown to 2–4 × 107 cells/ml in synthetic complete medium. A total of 1010 cells were harvested; washed with H2O; resuspended in 10 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol; and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C under moderate shaking. Cells were washed with 20 ml of spheroplasting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.2 m sorbitol), resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer plus 8 mg of Zymolyase (103,000 units; Seikagaku Corp.), and digested for 1.5 h at 30 °C under moderate shaking. Cells were washed in 10 ml of spheroplasting buffer and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.2 msorbitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml TPCK, 0.25 mmTLCK, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cell lysis was carried out on ice in a 5-ml Dounce homogenizer by homogenizing the spheroplast suspension 8–10 times. The cell lysate was cleared three times for 5 min at 2,400 rpm. The supernatant was loaded onto an 11-step sucrose gradient (18–60%). The subcellular fractionation was carried out according to Schröder et al. (38.Schröder S. Schimmöller F. Singer-Krüger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) with the following modification. The gradients were centrifuged for 2.5 h in a TST41.14 rotor (Kontron Instruments) at 35,700 rpm. 30-μl aliquots from each gradient fraction were analyzed by Western blot. A total of 2.5 μl of crude membranes were suspended in 20 μl of PNGase buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, 35 mm EDTA, 0.02% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors as above) and digested with 0.5–1 unit/μl of endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 30 °C. Mock samples were incubated without enzyme. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 5× SDS-sample buffer. 15–50 μg of membrane protein (see above) were incubated in the in vitro assay for Dol-P-Man:proteinO-mannosyltransferase Pmt1p, as described previously (18.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The pentapeptide acetyl-YATAV-NH2 was used at a final concentration of 3.5 mm. Chitinase (Cts1p) was isolated from cell walls (see above), and Hsp150p was isolated from the medium as described by Gentzsch and Tanner (29.Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (39.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies anti-Pmt1p (18.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J.

Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Amersham ECL system. Crude membranes were isolated as described above and resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.35% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.25 mm TLCK, 50 μg/ml TPCK, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Proteins were solubilized by vortexing on an Eppendorf shaker 5432 for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 rpm (Sorvall SS34 rotor) to yield the DOC extract. Pmt1pHA and Pmt1pHA mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated from 300 μl of DOC extract with 10 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose (16B12; Babco) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and once with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline. Subsequently, the precipitates were resuspended in 20 μl of 3× SDS-sample buffer. The proteinO-mannosyltransferase Pmt1p from S. cerevisiae is an integral ER membrane protein of 817 amino acids that is modified by three N-linked carbohydrate chains (11.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Immervoll T. Deutzmann R. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8164-8168Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we presented a seven-transmembrane helical model of the topology of Pmt1p (30.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Pmt1p amino terminus is located in the cytoplasm, the carboxyl terminus in the ER lumen. A large hydrophilic region, facing the lumen of the ER, is separated from the N terminus by five, and from the C terminus by two, membrane-spanning domains (Fig.1). The functions of the various regions of Pmt1p are unknown. To identify domains important for Pmt1p mannosyltransferase activity, we created a series of deletion mutants (Δ732–817 to Δ76–124; Table I; schematically shown in Fig. 2). For immunological detection, six copies of the HA epitope (45.Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) were fused to the C terminus of Pmt1p and the individual mutants. The C-terminal HA epitope does not interfere with mannosyltransferase activity, since wild type Pmt1p and epitope-tagged Pmt1pHA have identicalin vitro as well as in vivo mannosyltransferase activities when expressed in the strain pmt1Δ (12.Lussier M.

The precise function of PKCμ is not known. The present studies demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved during apoptosis induced by 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and other genotoxic agents. PKCμ cleavage is blocked in cells that overexpress the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein or the baculovirus p35 protein. Our results demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved by caspase-3 at the CQND378S site. Cleavage of PKCμ is associated with release of the catalytic domain and activation of its kinase function. We also show that, unlike the cleaved fragments of PKCδ and θ, overexpression of the PKCμ catalytic domain is not lethal. Cells stably expressing the catalytic fragment of PKCμ, however, are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress. In addition, expression of the caspase-resistant PKCμ mutant partially inhibits DNA damage-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved by caspase-3 and that expression of the catalytic domain sensitizes cells to the cytotoxic effects of ara-C and other anticancer agents.

U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The recently identified PKCν exhibits a high degree of homology to PKCμ and has been designated to this subclass (4.Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Treatment of human tumor cell lines with genotoxic agents is associated with induction of apoptosis (5.Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Gunji H. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 741-743PubMed Google Scholar). Efforts to define the role of PKC in apoptosis in part have been complicated by the expression of multiple isoforms in different cell types and their involvement in both pro- and antiapoptotic signaling cascades. Studies have demonstrated that PKC ζ and ι selectively interact with Par-4 and abrogate its anti-apoptotic effects (7.Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Mosca J. Cell. 1996; 86: 777-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). PKCα has been shown to phosphorylate Bcl-2 and suppress apoptosis in Pre-B REH cells (8.Ruvolo P.P.

Other studies have shown that PKCδ and θ are proteolytically cleaved and activated by caspase-3 during apoptosis induced by diverse anticancer agents (9.Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H.

Caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PKCδ and θ occurs in the third variable region, which separates the regulatory and catalytic domains. Cleavage of PKCδ and θ isoforms by caspase-3 results in release and activation of the catalytic domain (10.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R.

The findings that proteolytic cleavage of PKCδ and θ is inhibited by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein or of the baculovirus p35 protein have supported their involvement in apoptosis (9.Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 11.Datta R.

Other studies have demonstrated that overexpression of the kinase-active PKCδ and θ catalytic domains, but not full length or kinase-inactive fragments, results in induction of certain features characteristic of apoptosis (10.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp.

Conversely, PKCζ, which plays a critical role in cell survival, is cleaved and inactivated by caspase-3 during UV-induced apoptosis (12.Frutos S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10765-10770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast to other PKC isoforms, PKCμ and its mouse homologue PKD has unique enzymatic features and a distinct substrate specificity (13.Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14.Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23126-23133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that PKCμ is involved in novel signaling pathways. PKCμ is located in the Golgi bodies and is involved in basal transport processes (16.Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the 14-3-3τ protein interacts with PKCμ and negatively regulates its activity (17.Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.-C. Altaman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that overexpression of PKCμ reduces sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced but not ceramide-induced apoptosis (18.Johannes F.-J. Horn J. Link G. Haas E. Siemienski K. Wajant H. Pfizenmaeir K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of PKCμ in intracellular signaling cascades during apoptosis remains unclear. The present studies demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved during apoptosis induced by 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and other genotoxic agents. The results demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved by caspase-3 at the CQND378S site between regulatory and catalytic domains. Cleavage of PKCμ results in activation of its kinase function. We also show that overexpression of the cleaved catalytic domain sensitizes cells to the cytotoxic effects of genotoxic agents. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Human osteosarcoma cell lines SAOS2 and U2OS were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. U-937 cells overexpressing Bcl-XL, CrmA, and p35 were prepared as described (19.Datta R. Manome Y. Taneja N. Boise L.H. Weichselbaum R.R. Thompson C.B. Slapak C.A. Kufe D.W.

Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PKCμ catalytic fragment (CF; amino acids 391–912) generated by polymerase chain reaction from the full length (FL) PKCμ cDNA was subcloned into the pEF-neo vector (21.Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate a PKCμCF-expressing line, U-937 cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad, 0.25 V, 960 μF) with pEF-neo or pEF-PKCμCF. Transfectants were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml geneticin sulfate. Cells were treated with ara-C (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), etoposide (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Princeton, NJ), or cisplatin (Sigma). Irradiation was performed with a γ-ray source (Cesium 137, Gamma Cell 1000, Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd., Ontario) at a fixed dose rate of 13 Gy/min. Cell lysates were prepared as described (21.Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose paper. The residual binding sites were blocked by incubating the filters with 5% dry milk in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.05% Tween 20). The filters were incubated with anti-PKCμ polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-caspase-3 (21.Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing twice with PBST, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL detection system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Analysis of DNA fragmentation was performed as described (21.Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were harvested, washed, and incubated in 50 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) for 6 h at 50 °C. The samples were incubated with 50 μl of 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) containing 2% (w/v) agarose at low melting point and 40% sucrose for 10 min at 70 °C. The DNA was separated in 2% agarose gels. After treatment with RNase, the gels were visualized by UV illumination. HeLa cells were suspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells per ml and transfected by electroporation (0.22 V, 960 μF). Analysis of DNA content was performed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (Becton-Dickinson). The number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content were determined with a MODFIT LT program (Verity Software house, Topsham, ME). The C-terminal PKCμ fragment (PKCμ (349–912)) generated by polymerase chain reaction from the full length PKCμ cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. PKCμ (D348A), PKCμ (D378A), and PKCμ (D391A) were generated in two steps by overlapping primer extension. [35S]Methionine-labeled PKCμ wild type, mutants, and PKCμ (349–912) were synthesized by coupled transcription and translation reactions (Promega, Madison, WI). Labeled proteins were incubated with 5 μg/ml Escherichia coli-derived caspase-3 in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm EDTA at room temperature for 30 min (22.Bump N.J.

The reaction products were analyzed using electrophoresis in 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then by using autoradiography. Full length PKCμ proteins prepared by coupled transcription and translation were incubated with caspase-3 alone or in the presence of recombinant p35 (20.Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J.

Protein kinase assays were performed as described (PKC assay kit; Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) using glycogen synthase as a substrate. Proteins prepared from U-937 and U-937/μCF cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PKCμ antibody. Immune complex kinase assays were performed by incubating the immunoprecipitates in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of glycogen synthase substrate) for 10 min at 30 °C. An equal volume of the reaction was spotted on phosphocellulose paper. The filters were then washed twice with 1% phosphoric acid and once with 95% ethanol. The amount of radiolabeled phosphate incorporated into the peptide was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Previous studies have demonstrated that ara-C induces apoptosis of human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells (6.Gunji H. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 741-743PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCμ is cleaved during apoptosis, we treated U-937 cells with ara-C and harvested the cells at various times. Immunoblot analysis of the lysates with an anti-PKCμ antibody demonstrated time-dependent decreases in the 110-kDa PKCμ protein and increases in a 60-kDa cleaved fragment (Fig.1). The kinetics of cleavage of PKCμ coincided with the activation of caspase-3 and the appearance of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1). Because ara-C incorporates into DNA and induces DNA strand breaks (23.Kufe D.W. Major P.P. Egon E.M. Beardsley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8997-9000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Fram R.J. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4050-4053PubMed Google Scholar), we studied the effects of other classes of DNA-damaging agents on proteolytic cleavage of PKCμ. Ionizing radiation (IR) induces DNA strand breaks either by direct interaction with DNA or through the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates (25.Hall E.J. Astor M. Fry M. Oleinick N. Waldron C. Am. J. Clin. Oncol. 1988; 11: 220-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cisplatin induces DNA intrastrand cross-links (26.Sherman S.E. Lippard S.J. J. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1153-1181Crossref Scopus (978) Google Scholar), whereas etoposide induces DNA strand breaks as a result of forming a complex with topoisomerase II and the DNA 5′ terminus (27.Liu L.F. Rowe C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with IR, cisplatin, or etoposide was associated with the cleavage of PKCμ to a 60-kDa fragment (Fig.2 A). As shown with ara-C, cleavage of PKCμ coincided with the induction of DNA fragmentation by these agents (Fig. 2 A). Treatment of osteosarcoma cell lines SAOS2 and U2OS with cisplatin also resulted in cleavage of PKCμ to a 60-kDa fragment (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that treatment of different cell types with diverse DNA-damaging agents is associated with the cleavage of PKCμ during apoptosis.Figure 2PKC μ is cleaved during apoptosis induced by diverse genotoxic agents. A, U-937 cells were treated with 20 Gy of IR, 100 μm cisplatin (CDDP), or 3 μg/ml etoposide (ETOPO) and harvested after 6 h. Immunoblot analysis of the lysates was performed with anti-PKCμ antibody (upper panel). DNA fragmentation was assessed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels (lower panel).

Although exposure of U-937/neo cells to ara-C resulted in cleavage of PKCμ, there was no detectable cleavage in ara-C-treated U-937/Bcl-xL cells (Fig.3). The cowpox virus protein CrmA and baculovirus protein p35 have been shown to prevent apoptosis by inhibiting caspases. Previous studies have demonstrated that apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents is mediated by a CrmA-insensitive and p35-sensitive mechanism (20.Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J. Talanian R.V.

Using the previously characterized U-937 transfectants stably overexpressing CrmA or p35, we found that CrmA expression has no effect on ara-C-induced proteolysis of PKCμ (Fig. 3). By contrast, cleavage of PKCμ was inhibited following ara-C treatment of U-937/p35 cells (Fig. 3). These findings indicated that PKCμ is cleaved by a p35-sensitive caspase-like protease. DNA damage-induced apoptosis is associated with the activation of caspase-3 (20.Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Weichselbaum R.R. Wong W.W. Kufe D.W. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCμ is cleaved by caspase-3, PKCμFL labeled with [35S]methionine was incubated with purified recombinant caspase-3. PKCμ was cleaved to 60- and 50-kDa fragments by caspase-3 (Fig. 4 A). In addition, incubation of PKCμ with cytosol from ara-C-treated apoptotic U-937 cells resulted in the appearance of similarly cleaved PKCμ fragments, whereas lysates from untreated cells had little, if any, effect (Fig.4 A). The finding that the apparent molecular masses of the two cleaved fragments (60 and 50 kDa) were together approximately equal to the full length PKCμ suggested that one site in PKCμ is sensitive to protease cleavage. Caspase-3 prefers a DXXD-like substrate with an Asp residue at both the P1 and P4 positions (30.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). PKCμ has two DXXD sites between the cysteine-rich and PH domains, either of which can yield cleaved fragments of approximately the same size as those observed on immunoblots (Fig. 4 B; schematic of PKCμ structure). To define the caspase-3-mediated cleavage site in PKCμ, we constructed a C-terminal (μ349–912) PKCμ fragment (Fig. 4 B). Incubation of in vitro translated C-terminal PKCμ fragment (m349–912) with purified recombinant caspase-3 resulted in cleavage to a 60-kDa fragment (Fig. 4 C). Similar findings were obtained with lysates from ara-C-treated cells but not after incubation of the C-terminal PKCμ fragment with control lysates (Fig. 4 C). Immunoblot analysis of caspase-3-cleaved μ349–912 with an antibody reactive at the C terminus (amino acids 893–912) demonstrated detection of the 60-kDa cleaved fragment (data not shown). These findings indicated that the PKCμ cleavage site is located at the N terminus of μ349–912. Consequently, to identify the cleavage site in PKCμ, we generated three PKCμ mutants with substitution of Asp residues in DDND348S, CQND378S, and DHED391S by Ala (D348A, D378A, and D391A). Incubation with caspase-3 resulted in cleavage of wild type, D348A and D391A mutants to the predicted size fragment (Fig. 4 D). By contrast, there was no detectable caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the D378A mutant. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved by caspase-3 at the CQND378S site (Fig. 4 D). To determine whether cleavage of PKCμ is associated with activation of the kinase function, we incubated in vitro translated PKCμFL with recombinant caspase-3 and assessed activity by phosphorylation of glycogen synthase peptide. The results demonstrate that cleavage of PKCμFL with caspase-3 is associated with increases in the PKCμ kinase function (Fig. 5 A). By contrast, preincubation of recombinant caspase-3 with p35, which inhibits PKCμ cleavage, blocked the increase in kinase activity (Fig.5 A). To define the functional significance of PKCμ cleavage, we transfected HeLa cells with PKCμCF cloned into a vector expressing the green fluorescence protein (GFP). GFP-positive transfectants were selected by flow cytometry and assayed for sub-G1 DNA content. There were no apparent effects of PKCμCF expression on growth or apoptosis (data not shown). U-937 cells were also transfected with the PKCμCF cDNA inserted in the pEF-Neo expression plasmid. Cells transfected with pEF-PKCμCF overexpressed PKCμCF protein as compared with cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 5 B). Anti-PKCμ immunoprecipitates from U-937/neo and U-937/μCF cells were assayed for phosphorylation of the glycogen synthase peptide. The results demonstrate over a 2-fold increase in PKCμ activity in U-937/μCF as compared with U-937/neo cells (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these findings support activation of PKCμ activity by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PKCμFL to PKCμCF. Because exposure of cells to genotoxic agents induces cleavage of PKCμ, we asked if PKCμCF affects the sensitivity of cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The U-937/neo and U-937/μCF cells were treated with 100 nm ara-C and assayed for DNA fragmentation. In U-937/neo cells, internucleosomal DNA cleavage was observed at 24 h after ara-C treatment (Fig.6 A). However, exposure of U-937/μCF cells to ara-C resulted in induction of DNA cleavage, which was detectable as early as 6 h (Fig. 6 A). To assess whether the expression of PKCμCF sensitizes cells to other genotoxic agents, we treated the transfectants with 20 ng/ml etoposide or 10 μm cisplatin and assayed for DNA fragmentation. Although there was no apparent effect of etoposide or cisplatin on U-937/neo cells at 14 h, these agents induced characteristic DNA ladders in U-937/μCF cells (Fig. 6 B). Apoptosis was also monitored by analyzing cells for sub-G1 DNA content. Treatment of U-937/μCF cells with ara-C, cisplatin, or etoposide was associated with increases in the percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA as compared with that found following transfection of empty vector (Table I). Similar results were obtained in another cell population, designated U-937/μCF -1, which expresses a lower level of PKCμCF and kinase activity (Table I and data not shown). To define further the role of PKCμ in apoptosis, we transfected HeLa cells with wild type PKCμ or the caspase-3-resistant PKCμD378A mutant and vector expressing GFP. After 24 h, the transfected cells were exposed to cisplatin and incubated for additional 14 h. GFP-positive cells were then analyzed for sub-G1 DNA content. Compared with cells transfected with wild type PKCμ, overexpression of PKCμD378A partially inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, these results indicate that the cleavage of PKCμ contributes to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and that PKCμCF expression sensitizes cells to the apoptotic effects of diverse genotoxic drugs.Table IEffects of PKCμCF overexpression on DNA damage-induced apoptosisCell typeUntreatedara-CCisplatinEtoposideU-9374.3 ± 0.48.1 ± 0.212.8 ± 1.48.5 ± 1.2U-937/μCF5.4 ± 0.815.8 ± 1.252.9 ± 5.629.8 ± 2.1U-937/μCF-14.9 ± 0.312.5 ± 0.727.2 ± 1.723.5 ± 3.6Cells were treated with 100 nm ara-C, 10 μmcisplatin, or 20 ng/ml etoposide for 16 h.

PKC isoforms function in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (1.Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Pathol. 1997; 50: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The classic, novel, and atypical PKCs all possess a highly conserved catalytic domain (1.Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of PKCμ and its mouse homologue PKD, however, exhibit little similarity to the other PKC family members (2.Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J.

Nonetheless, PKCμ contains a tandem-repeat of cysteine-rich, zinc-finger-like motifs that bind phorbol esters (2.Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PKCμ, like members of the PKC family, is activated by phorbol esters and phospholipids (14.Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32.Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Dieterich S. Oberhagemann P. Link G. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The activity of most PKC family members is controlled by a pseudosubstrate region in the regulatory domain that functions as an inhibitor of the active site in the catalytic domain (1.Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). PKCμ/PKD, however, lacks the typical pseudosubstrate region, and in contrast to the other PKC isoforms, contains a PH domain (2.Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Diverse signaling and cytoskeletal proteins contain PH domains that regulate their subcellular localization and activation (33.Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Studies of PKCμ have shown that mutants with deletions or amino acid substitutions in the PH domain exhibit increased basal kinase activity (34.Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These findings have indicated that the PKCμ PH domain functions as a negative regulator of the catalytic domain. The present studies demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved between the cysteine-rich and PH domains during induction of apoptosis. The results also demonstrate that the C-terminal cleavage product, which contains the catalytic domain, exhibits an increased basal kinase activity. Together, these results suggest that cleavage in this region relieves the inhibitory effects of PH domain on the catalytic function. Previous work has demonstrated that the PKCδ and PKCθ, but not the classic or atypical, isoforms are cleaved in apoptotic cells (9.Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20317-20320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent classic PKCs contain the conserved regulatory regions C1 and C2, whereas the Ca2+-independent novel PKCs, including PKCδ and PKCθ, lack the C2 domain. Cleavage of the classic PKCs in the third variable (V3) region by calpains I and II deletes the C1 and C2 regulatory regions and results in catalytically active fragments (35.Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Endo M. Tanaka C. The Biology and Medicine of Signal Transduction. Raven Press, New York1990: 472-477Google Scholar). By analogy, cleavage of PKCδ in the V3 region by the caspase-3 cysteine protease deletes the C1 regulatory region and releases an active catalytic fragment (10.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for caspase-3-mediated cleavage of the PKCθ V3 region (11.Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20317-20320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by ara-C and other genotoxic agents. The finding that expression of the baculovirus p35 protein blocks cleavage of PKCμ supported involvement of a cysteine protease. In addition, the demonstration that CrmA expression had no effect on PKCμ cleavage indicated lack of involvement of a caspase-1-like protease. In this context, previous work has demonstrated that DNA damage-induced apoptosis is mediated by the CrmA-insensitive, p35-sensitive pathway (20.Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J. Talanian R.V.

Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein blocks PKCμ cleavage. Bcl-xLinhibits cytochrome c release from mitochondria in response to genotoxic stress (28.Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c activates caspase-9 by an Apaf-1-dependent mechanism and thereby activation of caspase-3 (36.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Taken together, our findings in cells treated with genotoxic agents suggested that PKCμ, like PKCδ and PKCθ, is cleaved by a caspase-3-dependent mechanism. Caspases have an absolute requirement for an Asp residue at the P1 position in their substrates. Moreover, caspase-3 prefers an Asp residue at both the P1 and P4 positions and cleaves most known substrates at DXXD motifs (30.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that PKCδ and PKCθ are cleaved by caspase-3 at DMQD330N and DEVD354K, respectively (10.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 11.Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20317-20320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we predicted that PKCμ would be cleaved by caspase-3 at one or both of the two consensus DXXD sites (DDND348S and DHED391S). However, mutation of Asp residues at the P1 positions and incubation of mutant proteins with caspase-3 revealed that PKCμ is not cleaved at these two consensus DXXD motifs. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that caspase-3 cleaves PKCμ at an unconventional CQND378S site. In concert with these results, recent studies have demonstrated caspase-3-mediated cleavage of other proteins, such as DNA topoisomerase I, amyloid-β-precursor protein, and p21-activated protein kinase, also occurs at unconventional sites (37.Samejima K. Svingen P. Basi G. Kottke T. Mesner Jr., P. Stewart L. Durrieu F. Poirier G. Alnemri E. Champoux J. Kaufmann S. Earnshaw W. J. Biol.

The present findings thus demonstrate that, despite the presence of two DXXD motifs, PKCμ is cleaved by caspase-3 at the CQND378S site. The available evidence indicates that PKCμ is involved in diverse cellular events. In B cells, PKCμ activity is up-regulated after cross-linking of CD19 with the B cell receptor complex (40.Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Klaus S.J. Chandran K.A. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PKCμ associates with the Syk tyrosine kinase, phospholipase Cγ (40.Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Klaus S.J.

Other studies have demonstrated that PKCμ is negatively regulated by the 14-3-3τ signaling protein (17.Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.-C. Altaman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The findings that mouse PKCμ localizes to Golgi and functions downstream of the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins have also suggested that PKCμ is involved in protein secretion (16.Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 41.Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van Lint J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that PKCμ is cleaved in the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress. The functional significance of PKCμ cleavage is supported by the demonstration that cells expressing the PKCμ catalytic fragment are more sensitive to the apoptotic effects of genotoxic agents. Studies in cells expressing full-length PKCμ have demonstrated that TNF-induced apoptosis is inhibited by enhanced expression of NF-κB-dependent protective genes, including the inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (18.Johannes F.-J. Horn J. Link G. Haas E. Siemienski K. Wajant H. Pfizenmaeir K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These findings in cells expressing full length PKCμ or the catalytic fragment suggest that caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PKCμ reverses a protective function and confers sensitivity to an apoptotic response. In studies of PKCδ and PKCθ, cleavage by caspase-3 results in the release of catalytic fragments that contribute to induction of apoptosis (10.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 11.Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20317-20320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). By contrast, although cleavage of PKCμ is not sufficient to induce apoptosis, our findings indicate that expression of PKCμCF sensitizes cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Thus, the findings with PKCδ, PKCθ, and PKCμ collectively support a pro-apoptotic response involving caspase-3-mediated cleavage and expression of catalytic domains that are active in the absence of lipid second messengers."

Stable expression of ryanodine receptor (RyR) in these cells enables rapid and reversible changes of both cytosolic Ca2+ and ER Ca2+ content via activation of the RyR/Ca2+release channel by caffeine and ryanodine. Sustained depletion of the ER Ca2+ store leads to apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary cells, whereas co-expression of Bcl-xL and RyR in these cells prevents apoptotic cell death but not necrotic cell death.

Malfunctions in this process contributes to many diseased states, such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and AIDS (1.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Characteristic features of apoptosis include DNA fragmentation, condensation of nuclear chromatin, cell membrane blebbing, and activation of a number of specific biochemical pathways (2.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Although the sequence of events from the initial apoptotic trigger leading up to DNA fragmentation and eventual cell death is not completely understood, several genes that play essential roles in the regulation of apoptosis have been identified. Among them are the ones encoding a family of Bcl-2-related proteins that either inhibit (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) or facilitate apoptosis (e.g. Bax and Bad) (3.Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 4.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested a central role for Ca2+ in the initiation of apoptosis. Many apoptotic stimuli, including growth factor withdrawal (5.Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of surface antigen receptors (6.McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Amador-Perez J.F. Orrenius S. Jondal M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1801-1806PubMed Google Scholar), are known to alter the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol and the storage of Ca2+ in the intracellular organelles (7.McConkey D.J. Scanning Microsc. 1996; 10: 777-794PubMed Google Scholar). Compounds that directly affect the intracellular Ca2+homeostasis, such as Ca2+ ionophores and thapsigargin (TG),1 have been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cells (8.Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 9.Martikainen P. Kyprianou N. Tucker R.W. Isaacs J.T.

Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the elevated cytosolic Ca2+ does not necessarily correlate with apoptosis (12.Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13.Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ per se, or the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ store serves as the primary trigger for apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 has been implicated with changes in intracellular Ca2+ (5.Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miespeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), but the cellular mechanism underlying the correlation between Bcl-2 and Ca2+ remains largely unknown.Ca2+ release from the ER can occur through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and/or ryanodine receptor (RyR), both of which function as Ca2+ release channels in the ER membrane. The level of IP3R has been shown to increase in lymphocytes induced to undergo apoptosis, and lymphocytes deficient in IP3R are resistant to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (15.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 16.Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S-H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dantrolene, an agent that blocks Ca2+ release from the ER could prevent apoptosis in cultured PC-12 cells (17.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Matson M.P. J Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β1, one of the potent inducers of apoptosis, has been shown to up-regulate the expression of a form of RyR in pulmonary epithelial cells (18.Andjelic S. Khanna A. Suthanthiran M. Nikolic-Zugic J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2527-2534PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V. Science. 1992; 257: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ release channels in the ER appear to play important roles in the signal transduction pathway of apoptosis.In the present study, we examined the possibility that depletion of the ER Ca2+ stores by activation of RyR/Ca2+release channel can directly induce apoptosis in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We have stably transfected CHO cells with the RyR and Bcl-xL genes, and measured the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ as well as ER Ca2+ content through activation of the Ca2+ release channel with caffeine and ryanodine. The changes in morphology and chromatin structure of cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis were characterized with confocal microscopic imaging and DNA laddering assays. Our data show that depletion of ER Ca2+ store can serve as a trigger for apoptosis in CHO cells, and the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-xL likely occurs at a stage downstream of ER Ca2+ release.DISCUSSIONStable expression of RyR enables rapid and reversible changes of Ca2+ release across the ER membrane, thus providing a convenient means for studying the role of Ca2+ signaling in apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that depletion of ER Ca2+ stores is capable of inducing apoptosis in CHO cells, which is in agreement with previous studies showing that inhibition of the ER Ca2+-ATPase by thapsigargin leads to apoptotic cell death (8.Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 9.Martikainen P. Kyprianou N. Tucker R.W. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4693-4700PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Wei H. Wei W. Bredesen D.E. Perry D.C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11.Reynolds J.E. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-xL in our system appears to be independent of changes in ER Ca2+release and capacitative Ca2+ entry. This suggests that Bcl-xL prevents apoptosis at a step that is downstream of ER Ca2+ homeostasis.The presence of RyR in the ER membrane of CHO-RyR cells has several advantages over the endogenous IP3R present in the parental CHO cells. First, it allows control of Ca2+ release in a reversible manner with caffeine, as well as control of the ER Ca2+ content with ryanodine. With the combined application of caffeine and ryanodine, it is possible to achieve a status of sustained depletion of the ER Ca2+ store, and such status offers important tests to the cellular mechanism of Ca2+signaling in apoptosis. In contrast, the IP3R exhibits desensitization upon binding of IP3, and opening of the IP3R channel shows substantial inactivation when the cytosolic Ca2+ reaches low micromolar concentrations (34.Amundson J. Clapham D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These intrinsic properties of the IP3R channel help to maintain the ER Ca2+ homeostasis, but they also prevent broader manipulations of Ca2+ movement across the ER membrane. Another advantage with the heterogonous expression of RyR is the possibility of producing mutant Ca2+ release channels with altered responses to caffeine or regulation by cytosolic Ca2+ (36.Hayek S.M Zhao J. Bhat M. Xu X. Nagaraj R. Pan Z. Takeshima H. Ma J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For example, the E4032A-RyR1 mutant, which differs from the wt-RyR1 in only a single amino acid substitution, shows no response to caffeine and ryanodine. Through comparison between CHO-WT and CHO-E4032A cells, we show that overexpression of RyR does not affect the proliferation and propagation properties of the CHO cells.Inhibition of the ER Ca2+-ATPase by TG has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types (8.Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 9.Martikainen P. Kyprianou N. Tucker R.W. Isaacs J.T.

Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). But, TG-induced Ca2+ release from ER is a relatively slow process compared with the Ca2+ spikes generated by activation of IP3R or RyR/Ca2+ channels. Studies from other investigators have demonstrated that, in addition to changes in the global cytosolic [Ca2+], the spatial and temporal patterns of Ca2+ signals also play important roles in cellular responses (37.Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 38.Putney Jr., J.W.

Based on morphological characterization (Hoechst dye staining of the nuclear chromatin) and DNA laddering assays, our data clearly show that sustained activation of the RyR channel by caffeine and ryanodine could lead to apoptosis in CHO-RyR but not in CHO-E4032A cells (Fig. 2). Compared with the caffeine- and ryanodine-induced apoptosis in CHO cells, we found the Ca2+signals generated by extracellular ATP through IP3pathway did not induce significant apoptosis, i.e. the extent of cell death was smaller and the time-dependent changes in cell viability was significantly delayed. Considering that IP3R only provides transient Ca2+ spikes which may not be sufficient to trigger apoptosis, our data are in agreement with the work by Szalai et al. (39.Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) showing that IP3-linked mitochondrial Ca2+ signals induced apoptosis only in cells that were pretreated with apoptotic stimuli.Sustained depletion of the ER Ca2+ store by caffeine and ryanodine results in activation of the capacitative Ca2+entry pathway, and thus causing sustained elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ (29.Pan Z. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 191AGoogle Scholar, 40.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). This elevated cytosolic Ca2+could have a number of effects on the cellular functions. To distinguish the effect of elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ from that of depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores on the apoptosis of CHO cells, we have added EGTA to the extracellular medium and pretreated the cells with membrane permeable Ca2+chelator, BAPTA-AM. Both of the methods, by which the sustained elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ can be prevented, failed to inhibit apoptosis in CHO-RyR cells after caffeine and ryanodine treatment. The presence of BAPTA in the cytosol adds to a buffering capacity of the cell to cytosolic Ca2+ and itself alone did not have a significant effect on cell viability (at 10 μmconcentration). Since the number of cells undergoing necrosis in RyR-xL cells following stimulation by caffeine and ryanodine was significantly reduced by BAPTA, the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ might be important in the execution phase of the necrotic death. Together, our data suggest that depletion of the ER Ca2+ stores rather than elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ lead to apoptosis.Overexpressing Bcl-xL protein prevented RyR-xL cells from apoptosis. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-xL in our system appears to be independent of changes in ER Ca2+ release and capacitative Ca2+ entry. This suggests that Bcl-xL prevents apoptosis at a step that is downstream of ER Ca2+homeostasis. Immunocytochemistry studies reveal that Bcl-xL and other Bcl-2 family proteins are primarily localized to the ER, the nucleus, and, for the most part, the outer membrane of mitochondria (41.Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3522) Google Scholar, 42.Ichimiya M. Chang S.H. Liu H. Berezesky I.K. Trump B.F. Amstad P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C832-C839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies by Rizzuto et al. (43.Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar, 44.Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Brini M. Chiesa A. Filippin L. Pozzan T. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) showed that mitochondria and ER form a close network, providing the possibility that the active site of ER Ca2+ release may be directly coupled with the mitochondria Ca2+ uptake (45.Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The protective effect of Bcl-xL on apoptosis could in part reflect its effect on the mitochondria's Ca2+ handling capacity. However, it remains controversial whether Bcl-2-related proteins enhance mitochondria's Ca2+ loading capacity or it prevents intracellular Ca2+ stores from overloading (46.Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E.

Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Further studies to investigate the relationship between ER Ca2+ release and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and to understand the effect of Bcl-xL on the communication between ER and mitochondria should provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in the initial phase of apoptosis. Apoptosis, an evolutionarily conserved programmed cell death process, plays a central role in both development and homeostasis of tissues. Malfunctions in this process contributes to many diseased states, such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and AIDS (1.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Characteristic features of apoptosis include DNA fragmentation, condensation of nuclear chromatin, cell membrane blebbing, and activation of a number of specific biochemical pathways (2.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Although the sequence of events from the initial apoptotic trigger leading up to DNA fragmentation and eventual cell death is not completely understood, several genes that play essential roles in the regulation of apoptosis have been identified. Among them are the ones encoding a family of Bcl-2-related proteins that either inhibit (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) or facilitate apoptosis (e.g. Bax and Bad) (3.Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 4.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested a central role for Ca2+ in the initiation of apoptosis. Many apoptotic stimuli, including growth factor withdrawal (5.Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of surface antigen receptors (6.McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Amador-Perez J.F. Orrenius S. Jondal M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1801-1806PubMed Google Scholar), are known to alter the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol and the storage of Ca2+ in the intracellular organelles (7.McConkey D.J. Scanning Microsc. 1996; 10: 777-794PubMed Google Scholar). Compounds that directly affect the intracellular Ca2+homeostasis, such as Ca2+ ionophores and thapsigargin (TG),1 have been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cells (8.Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 9.Martikainen P. Kyprianou N. Tucker R.W. Isaacs J.T.

Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the elevated cytosolic Ca2+ does not necessarily correlate with apoptosis (12.Li J. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3203-3211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 13.Reynolds J.E. Li J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ per se, or the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ store serves as the primary trigger for apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 has been implicated with changes in intracellular Ca2+ (5.Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miespeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), but the cellular mechanism underlying the correlation between Bcl-2 and Ca2+ remains largely unknown. Ca2+ release from the ER can occur through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and/or ryanodine receptor (RyR), both of which function as Ca2+ release channels in the ER membrane. The level of IP3R has been shown to increase in lymphocytes induced to undergo apoptosis, and lymphocytes deficient in IP3R are resistant to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (15.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 16.Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S-H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dantrolene, an agent that blocks Ca2+ release from the ER could prevent apoptosis in cultured PC-12 cells (17.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Matson M.P. J Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β1, one of the potent inducers of apoptosis, has been shown to up-regulate the expression of a form of RyR in pulmonary epithelial cells (18.Andjelic S. Khanna A. Suthanthiran M. Nikolic-Zugic J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2527-2534PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V. Science. 1992; 257: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ release channels in the ER appear to play important roles in the signal transduction pathway of apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the possibility that depletion of the ER Ca2+ stores by activation of RyR/Ca2+release channel can directly induce apoptosis in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We have stably transfected CHO cells with the RyR and Bcl-xL genes, and measured the changes in cytosolic Ca2+ as well as ER Ca2+ content through activation of the Ca2+ release channel with caffeine and ryanodine. The changes in morphology and chromatin structure of cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis were characterized with confocal microscopic imaging and DNA laddering assays. Our data show that depletion of ER Ca2+ store can serve as a trigger for apoptosis in CHO cells, and the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-xL likely occurs at a stage downstream of ER Ca2+ release. DISCUSSIONStable expression of RyR enables rapid and reversible changes of Ca2+ release across the ER membrane, thus providing a convenient means for studying the role of Ca2+ signaling in apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that depletion of ER Ca2+ stores is capable of inducing apoptosis in CHO cells, which is in agreement with previous studies showing that inhibition of the ER Ca2+-ATPase by thapsigargin leads to apoptotic cell death (8.Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 9.Martikainen P. Kyprianou N. Tucker R.W. Isaacs J.T.

Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-xL in our system appears to be independent of changes in ER Ca2+release and capacitative Ca2+ entry. This suggests that Bcl-xL prevents apoptosis at a step that is downstream of ER Ca2+ homeostasis.The presence of RyR in the ER membrane of CHO-RyR cells has several advantages over the endogenous IP3R present in the parental CHO cells. First, it allows control of Ca2+ release in a reversible manner with caffeine, as well as control of the ER Ca2+ content with ryanodine. With the combined application of caffeine and ryanodine, it is possible to achieve a status of sustained depletion of the ER Ca2+ store, and such status offers important tests to the cellular mechanism of Ca2+signaling in apoptosis. In contrast, the IP3R exhibits desensitization upon binding of IP3, and opening of the IP3R channel shows substantial inactivation when the cytosolic Ca2+ reaches low micromolar concentrations (34.Amundson J. Clapham D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These intrinsic properties of the IP3R channel help to maintain the ER Ca2+ homeostasis, but they also prevent broader manipulations of Ca2+ movement across the ER membrane. Another advantage with the heterogonous expression of RyR is the possibility of producing mutant Ca2+ release channels with altered responses to caffeine or regulation by cytosolic Ca2+ (36.Hayek S.M Zhao J. Bhat M. Xu X. Nagaraj R. Pan Z. Takeshima H. Ma J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For example, the E4032A-RyR1 mutant, which differs from the wt-RyR1 in only a single amino acid substitution, shows no response to caffeine and ryanodine. Through comparison between CHO-WT and CHO-E4032A cells, we show that overexpression of RyR does not affect the proliferation and propagation properties of the CHO cells.Inhibition of the ER Ca2+-ATPase by TG has been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types (8.Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 9.Martikainen P. Kyprianou N. Tucker R.W. Isaacs J.T.

Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27739-27743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). But, TG-induced Ca2+ release from ER is a relatively slow process compared with the Ca2+ spikes generated by activation of IP3R or RyR/Ca2+ channels. Studies from other investigators have demonstrated that, in addition to changes in the global cytosolic [Ca2+], the spatial and temporal patterns of Ca2+ signals also play important roles in cellular responses (37.Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 38.Putney Jr., J.W.

Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3522) Google Scholar, 42.Ichimiya M. Chang S.H. Liu H. Berezesky I.K. Trump B.F. Amstad P.A. Am.

Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) showed that mitochondria and ER form a close network, providing the possibility that the active site of ER Ca2+ release may be directly coupled with the mitochondria Ca2+ uptake (45.Csordas G. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The protective effect of Bcl-xL on apoptosis could in part reflect its effect on the mitochondria's Ca2+ handling capacity. However, it remains controversial whether Bcl-2-related proteins enhance mitochondria's Ca2+ loading capacity or it prevents intracellular Ca2+ stores from overloading (46.Murphy A.N. Bredesen D.E.

Further studies to investigate the relationship between ER Ca2+ release and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and to understand the effect of Bcl-xL on the communication between ER and mitochondria should provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in the initial phase of apoptosis.

In the present study, we show that in presence of p57Kip2, MyoDAla200, a MyoD mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by cyclin-Cdk complexes, displayed activity 2–5-fold higher than of MyoDAla200 alone in transactivation of muscle-specific genes myosin heavy chain, creatine kinase, and myosin light chain 1. Furthermore, p57Kip2 increases the levels of MyoDAla200 in cotransfected cells. This result implies that p57Kip2 may regulate MyoD through a process distinct from its function as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. We report that overexpression of p57Kip2 increased the half-life of MyoDAla200. This increased half-life of MyoD involves a physical interaction between MyoD and p57Kip2but not with p16Ink4a, as shown by cross-immunoprecipitation not only on overexpressed proteins from transfected cells, but also on endogenous MyoD and p57Kip2from C2C12 myogenic cells. Mutational and functional analyses of the two proteins show that the NH2 domain of p57Kip2 associates with basic region in the basic helix-loop-helix domain of MyoD. Competition/association assays and site-directed mutagenesis of the NH2 terminus of p57Kip2 identified the intermediate α-helix domain, located between the Cdk and the cyclin binding sites, as essential for MyoD interaction. These data show that the α-helix domain of p57Kip2, which is conserved in the Cip/Kip proteins, is implicated in protein-protein interaction and confers a specific regulatory mechanism, outside of their Cdk-inhibitory activity, by which the p57Kip2 family members positively act on myogenic differentiation.

The retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor protein pRb inhibits cell proliferation by repressing a subset of genes that are controlled by the E2F family of transcription factors and which are involved in progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (1.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4312) Google Scholar). Upstream of pRB is the basic cell cycle machinery consisting of various cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks)1 that regulate pRB and its related proteins through phosphorylation. Cyclin-dependent kinases are themselves regulated by a number of regulators including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Ckis) (2.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Ckis induce cell cycle arrest in response to anti-proliferative signals, including contact inhibition and serum deprivation (3.Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Tempst P. Robert J.M.

The Ink4 family includes p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, and p18Ink4c, which specifically bind and inhibit Cdk4 and Cdk6; and p19ARF, which has a tumor suppression function dependent upon the p53 (9.Haber D.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). p21Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2, members of the other family of inhibitors, the Cip/Kip family, have the ability to inhibit all G1/S phase Cdks complexes (10.Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 11.Sherr C.J.

Although p21Cip1 expression during development correlates with terminally differentiating tissues, mice lacking p21Cip1have normal development (13.Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). p27Kip1-deficient mice have a grossly normal development but display several phenotypes that seem to be linked to cell proliferation (14.Nakayama K.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of p57 mRNA in various adult human tissues suggests that its distribution is more restricted than that of p21Cip1and p27Kip1 (17.Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 18.Lee M.H. Reynisdottir I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The p57Kip2 gene is located in 11p15.5, a region suggested to be involved in sporadic cancers and the Beckwith-Wiedmann syndrome (17.Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Specific loss of the maternal allele has been observed in several types of childhood tumors including Wilm's tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma, suggesting a genomic imprinting, which has been confirmed both in mice and human. Generation of null mice for p57Kip2 has revealed a phenotype close to the syndrome observed in human. Mice died upon birth and showed macroglossia, omphalocele, gigantism, various levels of limb shortening, and an important modification in the skeletal muscle distribution, suggesting that p57Kip2 has an important role during development (19.Yan Y. Frisén J. Lee M.-H. Massagué J. Barbacid M. Gene Dev. 1997; 11: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20.Zhang P. Liegois N.J. Wong C. Finegold M. Hou H. Thompson J.C. Silverman A. Harper J.W. DePinho R.A. Elledge S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The lack of p21Cip1 or p27Kip1 functions does not lead to gross developmental defects, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms during development. Such a redundant mechanism has been recently shown; mice lacking both p21Cip1 and p57Kip2 display severe defects in skeletal muscle development (and other tissues including lung). These two Ckis cooperate as terminal effectors of signaling pathways that impinge on cell cycle control and differentiation and control muscle differentiation at the myogenin step (21.Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To undergo differentiation, myogenic cells have to exit the cell cycle through the G1 checkpoint. Myogenic differentiation is under the control of a family of muscle-specific transcription factors (MRFs), which includes MyoD (22.Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar), myogenin (23.Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2050-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), also known as herculin (27.Miner J.H. Wold B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3617-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These proteins share a central basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain that is involved in DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (29.Davis R.L. Cheng P. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). This 70-amino acid region accounts for their ability to form heterodimers with the E protein bHLH factors (30.Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D.

Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), to transactivate muscle genes, and to efficiently convert non-muscle cells to a myogenic lineage (32.Weintraub H. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L Thayer M.J. Adam M.A. Lassar A.B. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). MyoD is expressed in proliferating myoblasts prior to terminal differentiation (33.Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Cheng P. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Science. 1988; 242: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A number of molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain the functional inactivation of MyoD in proliferating myoblasts and the coupling of muscle differentiation with the cell cycle arrest (34.Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 4: 1454-1461Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar). These include inhibitory phosphorylation of the myogenic bHLH proteins (35.Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P.

Lockson D. Turner D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar), and either direct or indirect inhibition by the cyclin D-dependent kinases (39.Rao S.S. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5259-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 40.Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that overexpression of cyclin D-Cdk complexes inhibited myogenic transcriptional activation mediated by MyoD (41.Guo K. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 791-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and that cell cycle arrest correlates with the induction of p21Cip1 by MyoD (42.Guo K. Wang J. Andres V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3823-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 43.Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The role of Cdks in inhibiting muscle differentiation has been substantiated by the observation that forced expression of p21Cip1 and/or p16Ink4a in mitogen-stimulated myoblasts facilitates muscle differentiation in the absence of mitogen deprivation suggesting that an active cyclin-Cdk complex suppresses MyoD function in proliferating myoblasts (40.Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Spicer D.B. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). It has been recently proposed that Cdk phosphorylation of MyoD can target this protein for rapid degradation (44.Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent data show that direct phosphorylation of MyoDSer200 by Cdk1 or Cdk2 plays a crucial role in modulating MyoD half-life and myogenic activity (45.Kitzmann M. Vandromme M. Schaeffer V. Carnac G. Labbé J.-C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (3176): 3767Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast to Cdk1 and Cdk2, cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes fail to phosphorylate MyoD (46.Zhang J.-M. Wei Q. Zhao X. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cyclin-Cdk-mediated inhibition of myogenesis by cyclin D1 involves nuclear translocation of Cdk4 by cyclin D1 and the subsequent formation of a MyoD-Cdk4 complex that specifically inhibits the transactivation functions of MyoD in absence of Cdk4 kinase activity (46.Zhang J.-M. Wei Q. Zhao X. Paterson B.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, degradation of MyoD by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is inhibited by the specific DNA sequence to which MyoD binds independently of its phosphorylation state. Formation of a proteolysis-resistant complex seems to be dependent on dimerization and DNA binding of MyoD proteins (47.Abu-Hatoum O.A. Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that half-life of MyoDAla200, which is not phosphorylatable in vivo by the cyclin-Cdk complexes, is augmented in the presence of p57Kip2, suggesting that a mechanism distinct from phosphorylation-dependent degradation stabilizes MyoD. We show that MyoD but not its partner E12 physically interacts with p57Kip2. Mutational and functional analyses of the two proteins demonstrate that the NH2 domain of p57Kip2 associates with the basic domain of MyoD. Moreover, competition/association and site-directed mutagenesis of the NH2-terminal domain of p57Kip2 define the intermediate α-helix structure, located between the cyclin and the Cdk binding sites, as the important structural element involved in this interaction. These results strongly suggest that p57Kip2 may function in myogenic differentiation via two distinct mechanisms; one is an inhibitor of active cyclin-Cdk complexes, which control the G1 phase of cell cycle and the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of MyoD (48.Reynaud E.G. Pelpel K. Guillier M. Leibovitch M.-P. Leibovitch S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7621-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the second mechanism, via a physical interaction, stabilizes MyoD independently of its phosphorylation state during the course of myogenic differentiation. pEMSV-MyoD, pEMSV-MyoD mutants, and pEMSV-E12 were generous gifts from the Weintraub laboratory. pEMSV-MyoDAla200 mutant was obtained from M. Kitzmann (45.Kitzmann M. Vandromme M. Schaeffer V. Carnac G. Labbé J.-C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (3176): 3767Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Expression vectors pCMV-HA-MyoD was generated by cloning three hemagglutinin epitope tags (3Tag HA) at the amino terminus of cDNA insert in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The reporter plasmid MCK-Luc (p1256MCK), generously provided by S. Hauschka, contains the promoter-enhancer region from the mouse muscle creatine kinase. pEX10X-p57Kip2 was kindly supplied by J. Massagué. CMV-p16Ink4a was a kind gift from B. Heinglein. Cyclin D1 and Cdk4 were kindly supplied by C. Sherr. To create expression vectors, fragments containing the complete coding sequences were cloned into pcDNA3 expression vectors (Invitrogen) and/or in pEMSV scribe. Expression vectors pCMV-HA-p57Kip2, pCMV-HA-Cdk4, and pCMV-HA-cyclin D1 were generated by cloning three hemagglutinin epitope tags (3Tag HA) at the amino terminus of cDNA inserts in pcDNA3. pGEX-2TK-p57Kip2 was obtained by inserting in frame theNcoI-HindIII fragment from pEX10X-57Kip2, into the NcoI-HindIII sites of plasmid pGEX-2TK expression plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX-2T-p57ΔCKI was constructed by inserting in frame theSmaI-PvuII fragment from pGEX-2TK-p57Kip2, at the SmaI site of pGEX-2T expression plasmid. pGEX-2TK-p57ΔCKI was constructed by deleting aNcoI-BglII fragment, of the pGEX-2TK-p57Kip2. pGEX-3X-p57ΔPAC was obtained by deleting the PvuII-SmaI fragment of pEX10X-p57Kip2, the plasmid at this stage was closed, amplified, and used to generate a deleted p57-containing fragmentNcoI-HindIII inserted in-frame into pGEX-2TK expression vector. pGEX-3X-p57PAC was obtained by inserting in-frame thePvuII-SmaI fragment, obtained from pGEX-2TK-p57Kip2, at the SmaI-filled site of pGEX-3X. pGEX-2TK-p57ΔQT was generated by inserting in-frame theBlpI-filled-in HindIII fragment, obtained from pEX10X-p57Kip2, at the SmaI site of pGEX-2TK. pGEX-2TK-p57QT was generated by inserting in frame the SmaI fragment, obtained from pGEX-2TK-p57Kip2, at theSmaI site of pGEX-2TK. p57Kip2 mutant R33L was generated by polymerase chain reaction with a 5′ primer (5′-GAGCTGGGCCTCGAGCTGCGGATGC-3′) and a 3′ primer (3′-GCATCCGCAGCTCGAGGCCCAGCTC-3′) using pEMSV-scribe p57Kip2 wild type as template and the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Ozyme) as instructed by the manufacturer. The Rsa mutated insert was then subcloned in-frame in pGEX-3X expression plasmid at theEcoRI site filled in by the Klenow polymerase to create pGEX-p57R33L. The mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 and the fibroblastic cell line C3H10T1/2 were maintained in growth medium supplemented with antibiotics (a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and with 20% and 15% of fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively. C2C12 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure as described previously (49.Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were transfected by using polyethylenimine essentially as described (50.Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergy M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5639) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 104cells/well were plated onto 24-well plates. On the following day, cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids, as indicated in legends of the figures. The total amount of DNA used for each plate was normalized with the respective empty expression vector. Luciferase activity was determined in aliquots of cell extracts from harvested cells 48 h after transfection in growth medium. One hundred nanograms of the pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Invitrogen) was included in transfections as an internal control for transfection efficiency. All luciferase activities were determined with equivalent quantities of proteins in triplicate and repeated at least twice. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with either pCDNA3-HA-MyoD or pCDNA3-HA-MyoDAla200alone or with pEMSV-p57Kip2 in six-well plates as described above. Transfected cells were treated with cycloheximide (Sigma) at 15 μg/ml for the indicated times and harvested for Western blot analyses. HA-MyoD and HA-MyoDAla200 were detected using anti-HA antibodies (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For each experiment, α-tubulin was used as an internal control. Western blots were scanned and quantified by using a GelScan (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterial expression of proteins was performed inEscherichia coli BL21. Protein induction, cell lysis, and affinity purification with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were done as described previously (51.Lenormand J.L. Benayoun B. Guillier M. Vandromme M. Leibovitch M.P. Leibovitch S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 583-593Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In brief, GST-MyoD and GST-p57Kip2 fusion proteins were prepared and the fusion proteins were not eluted but washed four times at 4 °C in NTEN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0, 5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Fusion proteins were collected on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then the purity of the GST and GST fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and estimated to be 70–80% of purity by Coomassie Brillant Blue staining of the gels. 35S-Labeled proteins were prepared by coupledin vitro transcription-translation using the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (51.Lenormand J.L. Benayoun B. Guillier M. Vandromme M. Leibovitch M.P. Leibovitch S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 583-593Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The programmed lysates (1–10 μl) were incubated with GST alone and GST fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in NTEN buffer at room temperature and then mixed with one volume of 2× SDS loading buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE by using standard procedures. For the competition/association assays, GST-p57Kip2-covered beads were first incubated with 35S-labeled in vitro translated MyoD for 2 h at 4 °C. Then, unbound35S-labeled MyoD protein was removed by three wash cycles of binding buffer. Increasing amounts of labeled cyclin D1, Cdk4, or cotranslated cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes were then added to the binding reactions, and the resulting mixtures were subjected to a GST pull-down assay. The reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were detected by autoradiofluorography and quantified by using PhosphorImager. Whole cell extracts from cultured cells were prepared in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation EGTA buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min in a microcentrifuge set at maximum speed, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C in small aliquots. For immunoprecipitation, precleared cell lysates in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 80 μm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2–3 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Immunocomplexes bound to protein G-Sepharose were collected by centrifugation and washed several times in immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiofluorography (35S-labeled proteins) and/or autoradiography. For immunoblot analysis, total cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation EGTA buffer and processed as described previously (52.Leibovitch S.A. Guillier M. Lenormand J.L. Leibovitch M.P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1617-1622PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses were performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels with a 5% polyacrylamide stacking gel. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% skim milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: polyclonal C20 anti-MyoD diluted 1/500, polyclonal E-17 anti-mouse p57Kip2 diluted 1/250, polyclonal C-22 anti-Cdk4 diluted 1/1000, and polyclonal M-156 anti-p16 diluted 1/250 were provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was provided by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal anti-myosin light chain 1 clone MY-21 diluted 1/200, monoclonal anti-myosin heavy chain clone MY-32 diluted 1/400, and anti-α-tubulin clone DM1A diluted 1/500 were supplied by Sigma. Membranes were washed and incubated 1 h with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1/10,000 with polyclonal antibodies and 1/4,000 with monoclonal antibodies. After several washes, membranes were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Exposure was done with Agfa Curix RP2 films and intensifying screens. Phosphorylation of MyoD is one of the crucial mechanisms that control its activity in eukaryotic cells, and recent reports show that in proliferating myoblasts phosphorylation of MyoD at serine 200 (44.Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) by Cdk1 or Cdk2 (45.Kitzmann M. Vandromme M. Schaeffer V. Carnac G. Labbé J.-C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (3176): 3767Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) appears to play a major role in modulating MyoD half-life and myogenic activity. We have recently shown that p57Kip2 can stabilize MyoD protein by inhibiting cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity in growing myoblasts (48.Reynaud E.G. Pelpel K. Guillier M. Leibovitch M.-P. Leibovitch S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7621-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays were performed to compare the effects of p57Kip2 on MyoD wild type (MyoDwt) and MyoDAla200-mediated expression of muscle specific genes. C3H10T1/2 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding p57Kip2 and/or MyoDwt and MyoDAla200 along with a skeletal muscle reporter construct containing 1256 base pairs from the muscle creatine kinase promoter driving expression of luciferase (MCK-Luc). MCK-Luc was not expressed in C3H10T1/2 cells when transfected alone, but it was efficiently activated by cotransfection with a MyoDwt or MyoDAla200 expression vectors (Fig.1, lanes 1–3). Co-expression of p57Kip2 not only increased the transactivation of MCK-Luc by MyoDwt but also by MyoDAla200 in a dose-dependent manner. In our experiments, we observed, respectively, a 15- and 6-fold increase in the level of Luc expression driven by the MCK-Luc construct in the presence of p57Kip2 (Fig. 1, lanes 5and 6). The control plasmid MCK-Luc alone (Fig. 1,lane 1) or p57Kip2 alone were inactive on MCK activity (Fig. 1, lane 4). During the course of differentiation, other muscle specific proteins were likewise up-regulated in cells cotransfected with p57Kip2and MyoDAla200 compared with the transfection of MyoDAla200 alone. These include myosin heavy chain and myosin light chain 1 and, surprisingly, MyoDAla200 (Fig.1 B). Expression of Cdk4, a stable protein in muscle cell, was not modified after p57Kip2 transfection.

Two CaR constructs in the second IC loop, F707A CaR and to a lesser extent L704A CaR, demonstrated reduced activation of PLC, despite levels of protein expression comparable with the wild-type (wt) CaR.

Eight residues in the third IC loop were involved in PLC signaling. The responses to high [Ca2+]o in cells expressing CaRs with Ala substitutions at these sites were <35% of the wt CaR. The L798A, F802A, and E804A CaRs were dramatically impaired in their responses to [Ca2+]o even up to 30 mm. Substitutions of Leu-798 with other hydrophobic residues (Ile, Val, or Phe), but not with acidic, basic, or polar residues, produced reduced responses compared with wt. Phe-802 could be replaced with either Tyr or Trp with partial retention of the ability to activate PLC. Glu-804 could only be substituted with Asp or Gln and maintain its signaling capacity.

Ca2+-sensing receptor G-protein-coupled receptor phospholipase C metabotropic glutamate receptor type B γ-aminobutyric acid receptor intracellular wild type base pair inositol phosphate human embryonic kidney cells tandem Ala CaRs1 are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and couple to PLC activation, inhibition of cyclic AMP formation, and opening of nonselective cation channels (1.Brown E.M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Receptors in the CaR/mGluR subfamily share several structural features. These include a large extracellular amino-terminal domain, seven membrane-spanning regions, three IC loops, and a large cytoplasmic tail (see Fig. 1 a). The extracellular domains of CaRs and mGluRs are known to be critical for ligand recognition (11.Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12.Brauner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Biol.

Mol Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutants of the CaR, implicated in the pathogenesis of abnormal Ca2+-sensing in vivo, occur predominantly in the large amino-terminal domain of this receptor (14.Bai M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 115-125PubMed Google Scholar,15.Pearce S.H. Trump D. Wooding C. Besser G.M. Chew S.L. Grant D.B. Heath D.A. Hughes I.A. Paterson C.R. Whyte M.P. Thakker R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Point mutations in this domain, responsible for either gain-of-function or loss-of-function, indicate its key role in the Ca2+-sensing function of the receptor. IC domains of receptors in the CaR/mGluR subfamily are likely, by analogy to other GPCRs, to be responsible for coupling to G-protein-mediated signal transduction (10.Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 16.Pin J.P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J.

A comparison of CaRs with the mGluR 1–8 indicates limited sequence conservation in their second IC loops (<10%) but striking conservation (67 to 85%) in their third IC loops (see Fig. 1 b). This observation suggests these latter regions likely share similar function. Mutagenesis of mGluR1 and R5 previously demonstrated that specific residues in IC loops 2 and 3 contribute to PLC activation, whereas other residues were involved in the regulation of cyclic AMP formation (5.Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Domains of comparable functional significance in the CaR have, to date, not been identified. Studies of kindred with familial benign hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism indicated that a CaR with a mutation at residue 795 (R795W) in the amino-terminal portion of the third IC loop had a reduced ability to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ (18.Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The remaining residues within the second and third IC loops have not been carefully examined. In these studies, we mutated amino acids in IC loops 2 and 3 of the bovine CaR to identify the positions of key signaling residues and structural requirements at those sites. Phe-707 in the second IC loop and 2 residues in the third IC loop, Leu-798 and Phe-802, proved critical to the activation of PLC. Glu-804 proved essential for efficient cell surface expression of CaRs. This work supports the presence of several functional determinants in IC loops 2 and 3 in the stimulation of PLC by and expression of CaRs in mammalian cells. The full-length bovine parathyroid CaR cDNA (1.Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Edward Brown (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The Chameleon double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit and pBluescript II SK- (pBS) were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). pcDNA1/Amp and pCEP4 were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Restriction enzymes were from Stratagene, Life Technologies, Inc., and Promega (Madison, WI). Fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti rabbit IgG for immunocytochemistry was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Other supplies were from previously noted sources (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,19.Chang W. Tu C. Bajra R. Komuves L. Miller S. Strewler G. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SmaI fragment (nucleotides 248–3819) of the wt bovine parathyroid CaR was ligated into pBS (wt CaR/pBS) as described previously (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and used as the template for mutagenesis. Mutagenesis was performed using the Chameleon kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, in each reaction a selection primer was used to convert a unique KpnI site in wt CaR/pBS to an SrfI site, and a mutagenic primer was used to introduce the desired mutation and a new restriction site (i.e. NotI, NspV, SpeI,HindIII, SmaI, Nar I, orDraI). Primers were mixed and annealed with heat-denatured plasmid cDNA template. Synthesis of the (−) strand of plasmid cDNA was achieved by DNA polymerase and ligase. The reaction mixture was then treated with KpnI to linearize any double-stranded wt CaR cDNA. Uncut circular hybrid cDNA was then transformed into XL-mutS blue Escherichia coli. cDNA amplified from this transformation containing both wt and mutant cDNA was again treated with KpnI to linearize the remaining wt CaR cDNA. This DNA mixture was then re-transformed into XL-1 blue E. coli. Transformants were selected on Luria-Bertani broth agar plates containing ampicillin. After DNA amplification, mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Biomolecular Resource Center, University of California, San Francisco). Subcloning of mutant CaR constructs into pcDNA1/Amp for transient transfections were done by gel-purifying the 2213-bpPinAI-XbaI fragment, which contained the mutations in the second IC loop, and ligating this insert into the 6308-bp PinAI-XbaI fragment of wt CaR/pcDNA1/Amp. The latter construct was made by ligating the 3619-bp fragment of wt CaR/pBS into pcDNA1/Amp cut withNotI and HindIII. For constructs with mutations in IC loop 3, a 1073-bp XhoI-XbaI fragment from the relevant pBS mutant CaR construct was gel-purified and ligated into the 7448-bp XhoI-XbaI fragment of wt CaR/pcDNA1/Amp. To generate mutant CaR constructs for stable transfections, the Srf1 site in mutant CaR/pBS constructs was first converted back to KpnI site by mutagenesis. TheKpnI- NotI fragment comprising the mutant CaR cDNA of interest was then subcloned into pCEP4 as described (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) and transfected as described previously using CaCl2 precipitation (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For transient expression, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline after a 24-h incubation and then plated in 6-well culture plates. After allowing 48 to 72 h for attachment and growth, InsP production and receptor expression were assessed. For stable expression of CaR constructs, transfected cells were selected in medium containing hygromycin B (200 μg/ml) for at least 4 weeks before experiments. Total InsP accumulation was measured in triplicate after labeling transfected HEK293 cells with [3H]myoinositol (2 μCi/ml) for 18 to 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum as described (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). [3H]InsP accumulation in the presence of LiCl (10 mm) was measured after a 60-min incubation with different [Ca2+]o at 37 °C. Total [3H]InsPs were extracted from cells and isolated by anion-exchange chromatography (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20.Shoback D.M. McGhee J.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2833-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Results in all experiments are reported as the average fold-increase in total [3H]InsP and calculated as total [3H]InsPs produced by increasing [Ca2+]o/basal [3H]InsPs at 0.5 mm Ca2+. Experiments in both transiently and stably transfected cells were repeated at least three times unless otherwise indicated. Crude membrane protein fractions were prepared from HEK293 cells, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19.Chang W. Tu C. Bajra R. Komuves L. Miller S. Strewler G. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were blotted with one of two affinity-purified rabbit antisera (21825B, 50 nm or 321113A, 10 nm) (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19.Chang W. Tu C. Bajra R. Komuves L. Miller S. Strewler G. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL™) assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein expression of all mutant CaR constructs was tested by immunoblotting at least twice along with wt controls. Immunocytochemistry with 3,3′-diaminobenzidene- and fluorescein-conjugated antibodies was performed on cells grown on chamber slides, fixed for 30 min, incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, and then stained as previously detailed (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19.Chang W. Tu C. Bajra R. Komuves L. Miller S. Strewler G. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibody was either a CaR antiserum (21825A; 500 nm), this antiserum preincubated with 100-fold excess peptide, or non-immune rabbit serum. The antiserum was raised against a peptide derived from the extracellular domain of the bovine parathyroid CaR (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19.Chang W. Tu C. Bajra R. Komuves L. Miller S. Strewler G. Shoback D. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-staining, slides were counterstained with aqueous hematoxylin. For fluorescein staining, coverslips with cells were mounted on glass slides using Gel-Mount (Biomeda, Forster City, CA) without counterstaining and examined with a Leica TCS NT/SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). All mutants were analyzed from at least two separate transfections along with wt CaR-expressing cells. Coverslips were coded and then examined by two blinded observers, who assessed staining patterns without knowledge of the mutation status. Differences between wt and mutant CaR responses were tested by analysis of variance with the F-test using Excel 98 (MicroSoft, Seattle, WA). To assess the importance of residues in the second IC loop of the bovine parathyroid CaR to signal transduction, we constructed seven mutants in which four sequential amino acids were converted to Ala (tandem Ala (TA) constructs) (see Fig. 1 a). The signaling properties of these mutants and the wt CaR were initially assessed in HEK293 cells by their ability to produce InsPs in response to raising [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 5.0 mm. In cells transiently expressing wt CaRs, this increment in [Ca2+]o produced a 6.0 ± 0.8-fold increase in total InsPs (Fig. 2 a). High [Ca2+]o had no effect on cells transfected with vector only (Fig. 2 a). The ability of the TA mutants of the second IC loop of CaR to increase InsPs varied. InsP responses in cells expressing Ala (708–711) and Ala (712–715) CaR mutants were comparable with the wt CaR (Fig. 2 a). InsP responses to high [Ca2+]o in cells expressing Ala(716–719), Ala(720–723), and Ala(724–727) CaRs were reduced by 30–40% compared with wt CaR (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2 a). The most striking result, however, was seen in cells expressing Ala(700–703) and Ala(704–707) CaR mutants. Their ability to generate InsPs with a 4.5 mm increment in [Ca2+]o was only 1.0 ± 0.2- and 0.1 ± 0.1-fold (p < 0.001versus control), respectively. This was only 17 and 2% of wt CaR responses for the Ala(700–703) CaR and Ala(704–707) CaR, respectively (Fig. 2 a). Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry with anti-CaR antiserum confirmed that the sizes, intensity, and patterns of the protein bands detected in cells expressing all seven TA mutant CaR constructs were comparable with those of wt CaR-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig.2 b and data not shown). Protein bands in membranes from both wt and mutant CaR-expressing cells were ≈140 and 160 kDa and of equivalent intensity. Thus, differences in the relative quantity or forms of receptor proteins expressed do not explain the reduced signaling properties of these two mutants. To identify specific signaling determinants within the amino-terminal part of the second IC loop, we mutated residues 700–707 individually to Ala and assessed the ability of these point mutants to support InsP production. Cells transiently transfected with L705A and V706A CaR cDNAs responded to raising [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 5.0 mm with 9.5–10-fold increases in InsPs, comparable with the responses of the wt CaR (10.7 ± 0.3-fold) in these experiments. Cells transiently expressing the mutants T700A, N701A, R702A, and V703A CaRs had mildly reduced InsP responses to the same increment in [Ca2+]o of 6–9-fold. These were ≈15 to 40% lower than the wt CaR (Fig.3 a). The most dramatic defects, however, were observed in cells expressing L704A and F707A CaR mutants. A 4.5 mm increment in [Ca2+]o produced increases in InsPs of only 2.9 ± 0.4 (L704A CaR; p < 0.01 versuswt) and 0.2 ± 0.1-fold (F707A CaR; p < 0.001versus wt), which is only 27 and 2% of wt CaR responses, respectively (Fig. 3 a). Dose-response studies showed that the L704A CaR mutant had an ED50 for Ca2+ that was right-shifted to 7.3 ± 0.09 mm Ca2+ (p < 0.01, compared with ≈5.5 ± 0.2 mm Ca2+for wt CaR; see Fig. 3 b). This mutant and the wt CaR produced comparable maximal InsP responses (R max) of 6.8 ± 1.1 and 7.3 ± 1.1-fold increases at 30 mm Ca2+, respectively. In contrast, the F707A CaR mutant generated anR max of only a 0.91 ± 0.3-fold increase over basal (p < 0.001 versus wt) (Fig.3 b). Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed comparable levels of receptor expression for the eight single-site mutants including L704A and F707A CaRs in HEK293 cells (Fig.3 c and data not shown). To confirm that the signaling defects of the IC loop 2 mutants were not related to transient expression, we stably transfected wt and mutant L704A and F707A CaRs into HEK293 cells. Responses of the wt CaR-expressing cells to [Ca2+]o were much greater in stablyversus transiently transfected cells, as previously reported (3.Chang W. Pratt S. Chen T.-H. Nemeth E. Huang Z. Shoback D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), due to higher levels of receptor expression. In cells stably expressing wt CaRs, increasing [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 5.0, 10, or 30 mm increased InsPs by 36.5 ± 2.7-, 47.0 ± 4.6-, or 36.7 ± 5.4-fold, respectively (Fig.3 d). Experiments with cells stably expressing L704A and F707A CaRs confirmed the severe reduction in InsP responses to high [Ca2+]o (see Fig. 3 d), similar to the results from transient transfections. The ED50 was significantly right-shifted from 3.3 ± 0.1 (wt CaR) to 5.1 ± 0.2 mm Ca2+ (L704A CaR) (p< 0.03) (Fig. 3 d), similar to the shift observed in transient transfections (Fig. 3 b). TheR max at 30 mm Ca2+ of the L704A CaR was also significantly reduced to a 21.2 ± 5.6-fold-increase compared with that of the wt CaR, which yielded 47.0 ± 4.5-fold increases in InsPs in stably transfected cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3 d). In contrast, we had observed no substantial difference between maximal signaling (at 30 mm Ca2+) of the L704A CaR and the wt CaR in transient transfections (Fig. 3 b). The F707A CaR, however, remained severely impaired in its ability to activate PLC in stably transfected cells. Its ED50 was 6.6 ± 0.2 mm Ca2+, which was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than that of the wt CaR (3.3 ± 0.1 mm Ca2+). The R max of this mutant averaged a 7.3 ± 0.6-fold increase at 30 mm Ca2+, which was only 16% of wt CaR responses (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 d). Both L704A and F707A CaRs were expressed at levels comparable with wt CaR by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 3 e and data not shown). Overall, these findings suggest that the signaling defects seen with L704A or F707A CaR mutants were not due to substantial reductions in receptor expression or alterations in receptor processing. These results support the idea that Leu-704 plays a secondary role, whereas Phe-707 is absolutely essential in PLC-mediated signal transduction by the CaR. To test whether the phenyl side chain of Phe-707 is essential for activation of PLC, we mutated this residue to others with functional groups of different sizes and charges (e.g. Val, Leu, Glu, His, Tyr, and Trp). Substitution of Phe-707 with the hydrophobic residues Val or Leu produced CaR mutants that did not respond to raising [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 5.0 mm(Fig. 3 f). HEK293 cells transiently expressing F707E CaRs, in which Phe was converted to a negatively charged amino acid, were also unresponsive to raising [Ca2+]o to 5.0 mm (Fig. 3 f). Substitution of Phe-707 with positively charged His yielded a CaR mutant whose response to 5 mm Ca2+ was reduced by ≈75% compared with the wt receptor (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3 f). Substitution of Phe-707 with Trp, an even bulkier side group than Phe, generated a CaR mutant that was markedly impaired in its ability to activate PLC (Fig. 3 f). Substitution of Phe-707 with Tyr produced a receptor whose ability to increase InsPs was ≈50% that of wt responses (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 f). The CaRs mutated at position 707 that we studied were expressed at levels comparable with the wt CaR by immunoblotting (data not shown). These results suggested that there was relatively little tolerance for changes of the nonpolar aromatic side chain of Phe-707 in mediating CaR signaling through PLC. Failure of the Trp substitution to maintain CaR function further suggested that an aromatic side chain larger than Phe also disrupted the function that this residue serves in the CaR. To assess contributions of the third IC loop of the CaR in signal transduction, we next individually mutated amino acids 794–807 to Ala (except 805, which is an Ala in the wt sequence) and assessed the ability of these mutants to activate PLC in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). Mutations of 11 residues in this region produced CaRs with altered signaling responses, which we divided into two groups (Fig.4 a). Group 1 mutants, including K794A, N801A, and F807A CaRs, were able to increase InsPs with raising [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 5.0 mm by ≈6.8–7.7-fold. Their responses, however, were ≈55–63% that of the wt CaR (12.2 ± 1.1-fold) and were statistically significantly reduced (p < 0.01versus wt; Fig. 4 a). Group 2 mutants, comprising the eight remaining CaR constructs, were more impaired than group 1 mutants; their InsP responses to the same increment in [Ca2+]o were <35% that of the wt CaR (p < 0.003; see asterisks in Fig.4 a). Dose-response studies were performed on the eight group 2 mutants. Three distinct patterns of responses emerged (Fig. 4, b andc). TheR max of the N803A CaR was a 14.4 ± 0.6-fold increase in InsPs at 30 mm Ca2+, which was comparable with the wt CaR (15.2 ± 1.2-fold). The ED50 of this mutant (≈7.3 mmCa2+) was, however, modestly shifted to the right compared with wt CaR (≈3.5 mm Ca2+) (Fig.4 b). Four mutants exhibited both reducedR max and increased ED50 values (i.e. R796A, K797A, P799A, and K806A CaRs). Their ED50 values ranged from 6 to 8 mmCa2+, and their responses to 30 mmCa2+ were only ≈36–60% that of the wt CaR responses (p < 0.01; Fig. 4 c). Three mutant receptors (L798A, F802A, and E804A CaRs) were unable to activate PLC even at 30 mm Ca2+. Their responses to high [Ca2+]o were only 1.2–1.8-fold above basal (at 0.5 mm Ca2+) and were equivalent to the increases in the vector controls at 30 mm Ca2+(1.4 ± 0.2-fold; Fig. 4 b). To address whether any of the above signaling abnormalities could be attributed to defective receptor expression, we analyzed CaR expression by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The levels and patterns of CaR protein bands for both wt and mutant CaRs were similar (Fig.4 d). Immunocytochemistry of cells expressing the Ala mutants was performed and showed that cell surface expression in all but one mutant (E804A CaR) was comparable with the wt CaR (see Fig.5). Cells expressing this mutant had less receptor staining on the membrane and increased staining in intracellular organelles (Fig. 5: wt versus E804A). These observations supported the idea that the marked decreases in PLC activation observed with the Ala mutants of the third IC loop of CaR (except for E804A) were likely due to defective receptor-effector signaling and not due to reduced expression of the receptor. Since E804A CaRs were so aberrant in their expression pattern, their ability/inability to mediate PLC activation could not be tested. The three sites identified above (798, 802, and 804) were then further mutagenized to address the amino acid requirements at these positions to support PLC activation and efficient receptor expression. The observation that a CaR mutant with Ala substituted for Leu-798 did not activate PLC equivalently to the wt CaR led us to hypothesize that the size of the hydrophobic residue at this position was critical for signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, we substituted Leu-798 with amino acids with different types of side chains. As shown in Fig. 6 a, only the substitution of Leu-798 with very closely related Ile produced a receptor that could increase InsPs at 30 mmCa2+ to levels comparable with the wt CaR. The ED50 for the L798I CaR was modestly shifted to the right from 5 to 7.5 mm Ca2+. All other substitutions for Leu-798 (namely Val, Phe, Glu, Pro, and Lys) produced CaRs that were marked defective (i.e. reduced by > 75%) in their ability to activate PLC, even with [Ca2+]o as high as 30 mm (Fig. 6,a and b). The substitution of a basic (Lys) or acidic (Glu) residue for Leu-798 was poorly tolerated, as was the nonpolar rigid side chain of Pro. High [Ca2+]o-induced InsP responses of cells expressing these three mutant CaRs were equivalent to vector controls (Fig. 6 b). Taken together, these findings underscored the importance of a specific, nonpolar hydrocarbon side chain at position 798 in the ability of CaRs to mediate PLC activation. To examine the role of the side chain at position 802 in the CaR in PLC activation, we mutated this Phe to Val, Leu, Glu, His, Tyr, and Trp. As expected, closely related Tyr was essentially interchangeable with Phe. The F802Y CaR mutant increased InsPs similarly to the wt CaR (Fig.7 a). Substitution of Trp, a bulkier residue than Phe, produced a mutant with anR max ≈ 60"

The stimulation of these early signal pathways by mox-LDL was inhibited by desensitization of the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor and specific LPA receptor antagonists, was independent of the αIIbβ3-integrin, and was mimicked by LPA. Stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and Syk activation were independent of the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ and were suppressed by genistein and two specific inhibitors of the Src family tyrosine kinases, PP1 and PD173956. In contrast to PP1 and PD 173956, genistein prevented shape change by mox-LDL. The results indicate that mox-LDL, through activation of the LPA receptor, stimulates two separate early signal pathways, (a) Src family and Syk tyrosine kinases, and (b) Ca2+ entry. The activation of these early signaling pathways by mox-LDL probably plays a role in platelet responses subsequent to shape change.

Soft, lipid-rich plaques containing LDL and oxidized LDL (1.Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Watson A.D. Lusis A.J.

Indeed, previous studies indicate that oxidatively modified LDL stimulates platelets, mildly oxidized LDL (mox-LDL) being more active than heavily oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) (5.Meraji S. Moore C.E. Skinner V.O. Bruckdorfer K.R. Platelets. 1992; 3: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6.Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). mox-LDL or minimally modified LDL (mm-LDL) could also be present in the circulation. A subfraction of LDL that consists of electronegative, small dense, slightly oxidized LDL particles has been found in peripheral blood (7.Sevanian A. Bittolo B.G. Cazzolato G. Hodis H. Hwang J. Zamburlini A. Maiorino M. Ursini F. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 419-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An interaction of platelets with circulating mm-LDL may explain the enhanced platelet aggregation often observed in patients with cardiovascular disease. Indeed, a higher prevalence of small dense circulating LDL particles in coronary heart disease and in conditions commonly associated with atherogenesis has been described (8.Slyper A.H. JAMA. 1994; 272: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The interaction of circulating mm-LDL with platelets may favor intravascular thrombus formation at hemodynamically critical sites of stenotic coronary and carotid arteries. Whereas ox-LDL has often toxic effects on cells (9.Hughes H. Mathews B. Lenz M.L. Guyton J.R. Arterioscler.

The elucidation of signal transduction mechanisms of mox-LDL and mm-LDL may provide a basis for new preventive and therapeutic strategies in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disorders. In platelets, LDL and ox-LDL bind with high affinity to specific sites that are different from the classic LDL receptor (12.Pedreno J. de Castellarnau C. Cullare C. Ortin R. Sanchez J.L. Llopart R. Gonzalez-Sastre F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 401-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Pedreno J. de Castellarnau C. Cullare C. Sanchez J. Gomez-Gerique J. Ordonez-Lianos J. Gonzalez-Sastre F. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The glycoproteins IIb and IIIa (αIIbβ3integrin) have been identified as binding sites for LDL on platelet membranes but not intact platelets (14.Koller E. Koller F. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12412-12418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Pedreno J. Fernandez R. Cullare C. Barcelo A. Elorza M.A. de Castellarnau C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the αIIbβ3 integrin is probably not a receptor for LDL, a recent study shows that it is important in mediating platelet sensitization by LDL (16.Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we studied the platelet signal transduction mechanisms of mox-LDL activated during shape change, the earliest platelet response. Shape change can be induced by mox-LDL selectively without the formation of thromboxane A2 and the release of substances such as ADP or von Willebrand factor, which on their own activate platelets and elicit intracellular signal pathways (6.Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17.Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Shape change also occurs without αIIbβ3integrin outside-in signaling induced by bound fibrinogen (17.Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Therefore, the signal pathways observed during shape change are a direct consequence of the interaction of mox-LDL with its receptor and not mediated by secondary activation of other receptors. Since we have observed recently that mox-LDL contains lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and stimulates platelet shape change through activation of LPA receptor(s) (18.Siess W. Zangl K.J. Essler M. Bauer M. Brandl R. Corrinth C. Bittman R. Tigyi G. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6931-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the early signal transduction mechanisms elicited by mox-LDL were also mediated by activation of the LPA receptor. We found that mox-LDL stimulates through activation of the LPA receptor and independently of the αIIbβ3 integrin two separate signal transduction pathways in human platelets, the Src family kinase- mediated stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and Syk as well as the stimulation of Ca2+ influx. The LPA receptor antagonistsN-palmitoyl tyrosine phosphoric acid (NPTyrPA) andN-palmitoyl serine phosphoric acid (NPSerPA) were kindly provided by Dr. Gabor Tigyi (University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN) and Dr. Robert Bittman (Queens College of City University of New York) (19.Bittman R.

Platelets from thrombasthenic patients were obtained from Dr. C. M. Kirchmaier (Blutspendedienst Hessen, Frankfurt, Germany) and Dr. B. Kehrel (Medizinische Klinik, Universität Münster). All other materials were obtained as reported previously. LDL was isolated in the continuous presence of EDTA as described (6.Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). LDL was dialyzed at 4 °C using a N2-saturated buffer (pH 7.4) containing NaCl (150 mm), chloramphenicol (0.15 mm), and EDTA (1 mm) and then stored at 4 °C in darkness under N2. All LDL concentrations are given in terms of their protein content. mox-LDL, which has been chemically characterized previously, was prepared from EDTA-free LDL by Cu2+-triggered oxidation exactly as described (6.Weidtmann A.

LDL lipid peroxidation was determined as described (6.Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Shape change was measured by recording the light transmission in a LABOR aggregometer (Fresenius, Bad Homburg, Germany) (20.Negrescu E.V. Luber de Quintana K. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RGDS (2 mm) was added to the platelet samples to prevent the possible formation of platelet microaggregates during platelet stirring. In some experiments, platelets were pretreated with EGTA (1 mm) and BAPTA-AM (2–20 μm, dependent on the platelet concentration) for 20 min at 37 °C to chelate any increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in stimulated platelets. Cytoskeletal fractions were prepared by using a modification of the method described by Jennings et al. (21.Jennings L.K. Fox J.E. Edwards H.H. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6927-6932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, platelet suspensions (0.6 ml) were lysed before or at various intervals after agonist addition by adding equal volumes of ice-cold 2× Triton lysis buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm Tris-HCI, 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μm pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples (1.2 ml) were left on ice for 30 min and spun at 15,600 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed once in 1 × Triton X-100 (1%) lysis buffer. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Syk was immunoprecipitated by using anti-Syk IgG2a bound to protein A-Sepharose or covalently conjugated to agarose as described (22.Negrescu E.V. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26547-26553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Proteins from platelet suspensions, cytoskeletal fractions, or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide (8%) gel electrophoresis on 1.5 mm × 20 cm gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes and detected as described (20.Negrescu E.V. Luber de Quintana K. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The dilutions of the mixed primary phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 and 4G01 were each 1:2.000; the dilutions of the monoclonal anti-Fyn, anti-Src, and polyclonal anti-Syk antibodies were 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:1000, respectively. The dilutions of the horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were 1:15,000 and 1:2500, respectively. The specificity of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies was tested by competition with phosphotyrosine (1 mm). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots were stripped by incubating the nitrocellulose membrane in buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mmTris·HCl, and 100 mm mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) for 30 min at 70 °C and reprobed with specific antiprotein tyrosine kinase antibodies. Blots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), exposed to Kodak films, and analyzed by densitometry. For measurement of the cytosolic Ca2+ - concentration, suspensions of washed platelets (1 × 109/ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with Fura-2/AM (4 μm) in the presence of bovine albumin (1 mg/ml) (23.Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 109/ml in the presence of bovine albumin (1 mg/ml). Aliquots of platelets were diluted to 0.2 × 109/ml and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before CaCl2 (1 mm) or EGTA (5 mm) was added. Fluorescence measurement was then performed in a thermostatically controlled chamber (37 °C) while stirring using a Delta-Scan 1 double beam fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International) as described previously (24.Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cuvettes were thoroughly rinsed between measurements with 70% EtOH and double distilled H2O to remove residual amounts of agonists. Calculations of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations were performed as described (24.Rasmussen U.B. Gachet C. Schlesinger Y. Hanau D. Ohlmann P. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Pouyssegur J. Cazenave J.P. Pavirani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14322-14328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet suspensions were incubated at 37 °C in aggregometer cuvettes while stirring and exposed to native or mox-LDL. Aliquots (0.05 ml) were transferred to 0.5 ml of fixation solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 75 mm sodium cacodylate. Platelets were centrifuged onto glass plates and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. After being critical point-dried with carbon dioxide, the specimens were sputter-coated with gold. The chemiluminescence signals of the immunoblotted protein bands were measured by densitometry (Sharp JX 325 and Ultroscan XL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to take into account variations of the amount of Syk immunoprecipitated, the densitometric values of tyrosine-phosphorylated Syk were divided by the corresponding values of Syk. Absorption of proteins in unstimulated control samples was set to 100%. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of individual experiments from different blood donors. The range of linearity of the densitometric measurements of tyrosine-phosphorylated Syk was determined by a dilution series of protein samples of mox-LDL-stimulated platelets. Human platelets were pretreated with aspirin and resuspended in buffer containing apyrase and RGDS in order to inhibit aggregation and secretion by mox-LDL (6.Weidtmann A. Scheithe R. Hrboticky N. Pietsch A. Lorenz R. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and to eliminate positive feedback amplification mechanisms (17.Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), thereby enabling us to study the direct consequences of interaction of mox-LDL with its platelet receptor(s). Platelets exposed to mox-LDL showed a rapid shape change (Fig.1 a). Concentration-response curves indicated that shape change could be induced by concentrations of mox-LDL as low as 10–15 μg/ml. Shape change upon exposure of platelets to mox-LDL was also observed by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 1 b). Platelets changed their shape from discoechinocytes in control samples to spheroid cells with an irregularly folded and deeply invaginated plasma membrane and many pseudopods in samples stimulated by mox-LDL. The results show that mox-LDL induces shape change of platelets similar to activation by physiological agonists. In contrast to mox-LDL, native LDL (0.5 mg/ml) did not induce shape change (data not shown). Since shape change is often associated with Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+-dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation (17.Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and since we had recently observed that shape change by mox-LDL was mediated by LPA-receptor activation (18.Siess W. Zangl K.J. Essler M. Bauer M. Brandl R. Corrinth C. Bittman R. Tigyi G. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6931-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), we investigated whether mox-LDL increased cytosolic Ca2+during shape change and whether it was dependent on LPA receptor activation. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (1 mm), both LPA and mox-LDL induced a rapid reversible increase of cytosolic Ca2+ during shape change (Fig.2 a). Ca2+mobilization induced by LPA and mox-LDL showed a rapid homologous desensitization (LPA/LPA and mox-LDL/mox-LDL) and cross-desensitization (LPA/mox-LDL and, vice versa, mox-LDL/LPA) and was specifically inhibited by the LPA receptor antagonist NPTyrPA (Fig.2 a) and NPSerPA (data not shown) (19.Bittman R. Swords B. Liliom K. Tigyi G. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 391-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Liliom K. Bittman R. Swords B. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 616-623PubMed Google Scholar). NPTyrPA did not inhibit the cytosolic Ca2+ increase evoked by ADP, PAF (Fig. 2 a), and YFLLRNP (data not shown). These results demonstrate that mox-LDL stimulates Ca2+ mobilization in platelets through the activation of one or more LPA receptors. The cytosolic Ca2+ rise above basal level was after LPA (1 μm), 153 ± 43 nm, and after mox-LDL (0.2 mg/ml), 60 ± 24 nm (mean ± S.D.,n = 7). In the presence of EGTA, the cytosolic Ca2+ increase elicited by LPA (1 μm) was very small (25 ± 11 nm; mean ± S.D.,n = 5), indicating that LPA induced mainly Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane and relatively little Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores (Fig.2 b). Similarly to LPA, the cytosolic Ca2+increase induced by mox-LDL (0.2 mg/ml) was almost completely abolished by EGTA (Fig. 2 b). Concentration-response curves of LPA and stimulations by mox-LDL performed in the presence of EGTA showed that mox-LDL and low concentrations of LPA were able to induce shape change without an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig.3, a and b). The EC50 of LPA for the induction of shape change and cytosolic Ca2+ increase was 18 ± 4 nm and 1.6 ± 0.5 μm, respectively. This accounts for an at least 90-fold difference in dose for the induction of these two responses. In order to investigate whether shape change induced by LPA and mox-LDL proceeds independently of Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores, we next treated platelets for 20 min with (in addition to EGTA) BAPTA-AM, which enters platelets and inhibits any cytosolic Ca2+ increase due to mobilization from intracellular stores (20.Negrescu E.V. Luber de Quintana K. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23.Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 c, LPA (100 nm) induced no increase of cytosolic Ca2+ but elicited in the same platelet suspension a maximal shape change response, and intracellular BAPTA, which completely abolished the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ caused by the mobilization from intracellular stores in ADP-stimulated platelets, delayed the shape change but barely affected the maximal response after LPA stimulation. Similar observations were made when platelets were stimulated with mox-LDL; BAPTA-AM and EGTA treatment caused a delay of the shape change without significantly affecting the maximal response (TableI, right column). We conclude that shape change induced by LPA and mox-LDL proceeds through a pathway that does not involve an increase of cytosolic Ca2+Table IAssociation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p62, p68, and p130 and the tyrosine kinases Src, Fyn, and Syk with the cytoskeleton during shape change induced by mox-LDL.

Open table in a new tab Suspensions of washed human platelets (8 × 105cells/μl) were incubated with Me2SO (0.1%, control) for 20 min or BAPTA-AM (20 μm) for 20 min and EGTA (1 mm) for 1 min before exposure to mox-LDL (0.5 mg/ml) for 20 or 40 s. Cytoskeletal fractions were isolated and processed for immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are mean ± S.D. of six experiments. We investigated further whether the shape change induced by mox-LDL was associated with an increase of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, since we have previously observed that the Ca2+-independent shape change elicited by thrombin receptor activation of human platelets occurred with the tyrosine kinase-mediated phosphorylation of specific proteins (20.Negrescu E.V. Luber de Quintana K. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1057-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We found that both mox-LDL and LPA stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 62-, 68-, and 130-kDa molecular mass during shape change (Fig. 4). In contrast, native LDL did not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (data not shown). Stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by LPA and mox-LDL showed a rapid homologous desensitization (LPA/LPA and mox-LDL/mox-LDL) and cross-desensitization (LPA/mox-LDL and, vice versa, mox-LDL/LPA; data not shown) and was specifically inhibited by the LPA receptor antagonist NPTyrPA (Fig. 4). Thus, mox-LDL stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation during shape change through activation of LPA-receptor(s). Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins reached maximum levels (2–3-fold) 15–30 s after the addition of mox-LDL and decreased subsequently (see below). Platelets contain several protein tyrosine kinases that may be stimulated by mox-LDL. We studied the tyrosine kinase Syk, because previous studies have shown that this kinase is rapidly activated in human platelets stimulated by thrombin and other agonists including high concentrations of LPA (26.Taniguchi T.

Ozaki Y. Kume S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, mox-LDL rapidly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, which is known to increase its enzymatic activity. Tyrosine phosphorylation reached maximum levels 15–30 s after the addition of mox-LDL and declined subsequently. In 21 experiments using platelets from different donors, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was measured before and 30 s after exposure to mox-LDL (0.5 mg/ml) (i.e. the time point of maximal shape change) and was found to increase 2.5 ± 1.0-fold over basal level (mean ± S.D.). Dose-response curves of mox-LDL showed that the extent of stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, p130, and the kinase Syk correlated with the degree of platelet shape change (Fig. 5 c and data not shown). Because the αIIbβ3-integrin is a possible binding protein and a signaling molecule for LDL on platelets (14.Koller E. Koller F. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12412-12418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. van Rijn H.J. Akkerman J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the αIIbβ3-integrin is involved in the platelet response to mox-LDL. Studies were performed using (a) thrombasthenic platelets deficient in αIIbβ3-integrin (<5% of control), (b) EGTA pretreatment that dissociates αIIbβ3-integrin, and (c) RGDS that inhibits ligand (fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, fibronectin) binding to the αIIbβ3-integrin. The stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of p62, p68, p130, and Syk during shape change induced by mox-LDL was in thrombasthenic platelets not different from that seen in control platelets (Fig.6). Also, concentration-response curves of mox-LDL showed that the magnitude of shape change responses was similar in thrombasthenic and control platelets (data not shown). Furthermore, EGTA pretreatment did not inhibit the stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation during shape change induced by mox-LDL (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the αIIbβ3-integrin does not participate in the early platelet response induced by mox-LDL and that outside-in signaling through the αIIbβ3-integrin is not involved in the stimulation of protein tyrosine kinases by mox-LDL. Shape change is associated with a profound reorganization of the cytoskeleton (17.Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Resting discoid platelets contained 3–5% of tyrosine-phosphorylated p62, 6–9% of p68, and 10–20% of p130 in the actin-rich cytoskeleton. During platelet shape change induced by mox-LDL, the content of tyrosine-phosphorylated p62, p68, and p130 increased maximally 2.9-, 7.2-, and 2.4-fold, respectively (Table I). One possible mechanism for the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins is the translocation of protein-tyrosine kinases"
https://openalex.org/W2063018977,"Aldose reductase (AR), a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, has been implicated in the etiology of secondary diabetic complications. However, the physiological functions of AR under euglycemic conditions remain unclear. We have recently demonstrated that, in intact heart, AR catalyzes the reduction of the glutathione conjugate of the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (Srivastava, S., Chandra, A., Wang, L., Seifert, W. E., Jr., DaGue, B. B., Ansari, N. H., Srivastava, S. K., and Bhatnagar, A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10893–10900), consistent with a possible role of AR in the metabolism of glutathione conjugates of aldehydes. Herein, we present several lines of evidence suggesting that the active site of AR forms a specific glutathione-binding domain. The catalytic efficiency of AR in the reduction of the glutathione conjugates of acrolein, trans-2-hexenal, trans-2-nonenal, andtrans,trans-2,4-decadienal was 4–1000-fold higher than for the corresponding free alkanal. Alterations in the structure of glutathione diminished the catalytic efficiency in the reduction of the acrolein adduct, consistent with the presence of specific interactions between the amino acid residues of glutathione and the AR active site. In addition, non-aldehydic conjugates of glutathione or glutathione analogs displayed active-site inhibition. Molecular dynamics calculations suggest that the conjugate adopts a specific low energy configuration at the active site, indicating selective binding. These observations support an important role of AR in the metabolism of glutathione conjugates of endogenous and xenobiotic aldehydes and demonstrate, for the first time, efficient binding of glutathione conjugates to an aldo-keto reductase.

Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that increased flux of hexoses via the AR-catalyzed pathway is one of the underlying causes of tissue injury and dysfunction associated with hyperglycemic states such as diabetes mellitus and galactosemia. In experimental models of diabetes and galactosemia, pharmacological inhibition of AR attenuates, prevents, and/or delays several pleiotropic complications (1.Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2.Yabe-Nishimura C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 31: 21-33Google Scholar). Conversely, in transgenic animals, lens-specific up-regulation of AR accelerates sugar cataract (3.Lee A.Y. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2780-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), providing evidence for a critical role of this enzyme in the genesis of hyperglycemic injury. Nonetheless, clinical trials with AR inhibitors have yielded uncertain results (4.Kador P.F. Robison Jr., W.G. Kinoshita J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 691-714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Sarges R. Oates P.J. Prog. Drug Res. 1993; 40: 99-161PubMed Google Scholar), and the long-term efficacy of these drugs in treating diabetic complications remains to be demonstrated. Although the variable results obtained in clinical trials of AR inhibitors may be due, in part, to their poor specificity and an inappropriate dosing schedule, a major impediment to their long-term clinical acceptance relates to a lack of understanding of the normal physiological role of AR. Recent evidence suggests that AR and its isoforms may be involved in several physiological functions such as cell growth and/or differentiation. The expression of AR as well as a similar murine aldo-keto reductase, FR-1 (fibroblast growth factor-regulated protein-1), is enhanced by growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor (6.Jacquin-Becker C. Labourdette G. Glia. 1997; 20: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7.Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol.

Moreover, an AR-related protein is one of the most prominent antigens up-regulated during hepatocarcinogenesis (9.Zeindl-Eberhart E. Jungblut P.R. Otto A. Rabes H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14589-14594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, AR may be involved in several cell type-specific functions such as osmoregulation (10.Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fructose (11.Hers H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 22: 202-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and tetrahydrobioprotein (12.Park Y.S. Heizmann C.W. Wermuth B. Levine R.A. Steinerstauch P. Guzman J. Blau N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) synthesis, and the metabolism of corticosteroids (13.Wermuth B. Monder C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the most general role of AR may be detoxification of reactive aldehydes. Both AR and FR-1 display high catalytic efficiency with unbranched saturated and unsaturated aldehydes (14.Srivastava S. Chandra A. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Ansari N.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15.Vander Jagt D.L. Kolb N.S. Vander Jagt T.J. Chino J. Martinez F.J. Hunsaker L.A. Royer R.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Since such aldehydes are the major bioactive end products of lipid peroxidation (18.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar) and reduction diminishes their bioactivity, these enzymes may be important components of the cellular antioxidant defenses. In vitro studies indicate that the high efficiency of AR in catalyzing the reduction of lipid-derived aldehydes is, in part, due to the high hydrophobicity of the enzyme's active site, which interacts favorably with long alkyl chains (17.Srivastava S. Watowich S.J. Petrash J.M. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the active site residues of AR do not form extensive hydrogen bonds with the substrates, the enzyme appears to be ill-suited for the reduction of hydrophilic aldehydes such as glucose. These characteristics of the enzyme suggest that a more general role of AR may be reduction of medium- to long-chain aldehydes. However, in most cells, reduction to alcohol is a minor metabolic fate of aldehydes which are readily oxidized to acids. For instance, oxidation to 4-hydroxynonanoic acid accounts for 40–50% of the metabolism of 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal, whereas the alcohol 1,4-dihydroxynonene represents only a minor (<10%) component (18.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar,19.Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L. Seifert Jr., W.E. DaGue B.B. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10893-10900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Additionally, unsaturated aldehydes, because of their high electrophilicity, readily form covalent adducts with glutathione. As a result, in most glutathione-competent cells, unsaturated aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation are likely to be readily conjugated with glutathione, and aldehyde oxidoreductases are likely to be presented with an glutathione-aldehyde conjugate, rather than the free aldehyde. Indeed, our studies show that in addition to reducing 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal, AR is also an efficient catalyst for the reduction of the glutathione adduct of 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (14.Srivastava S. Chandra A. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Ansari N.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17.Srivastava S. Watowich S.J. Petrash J.M. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the specificity of the enzyme for glutathione-aldehyde conjugates of varying structure has not been examined, and the role of glutathione in facilitating aldehyde binding to the active site of AR remains poorly defined. This study was therefore undertaken to identify the kinetic and structural features of AR that determine its interaction with glutathione conjugates. Alkanals and trans-2- andtrans-4-alkenals were purchased from Aldrich. Glutathione,S-alkyl derivatives of glutathione, γGlu-Cys, Cys-Gly, γGlu-Cys-Glu, NADPH, dl-glyceraldehyde,dl-dithiothreitol (DTT), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), menadione, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and [3H]glutathione were purchased from Sigma. Sephadex G-25 columns (PD-10) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). All reagents used were of analytical grade. Gly-Cys-Gly and homoglutathione (γGlu-Cys-βAla) were purchased from Bachem. All other peptides were synthesized commercially. Recombinant human placental AR was prepared and purified as described previously (20.Petrash J.M. Harter T.M. Devine C.S. Olins P.O. Bhatnagar A. Liu S.-Q. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSH was incubated with individual compounds at a 1:1 molar ratio in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by following the decrease in the λmax of aldehydes. Free GSH content was monitored by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The conjugates were purified by HPLC using a Rainin reverse-phase ODS C18 column (1 × 30 cm) pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Approximately 1 ml of conjugate (1–10 μmol) was applied to the column, and the eluant was monitored at 220 nm. The conjugates were eluted using a gradient consisting of solvent A and solvent B (acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient was established such that solvent B reached 10% in 20 min and 25% in 35 min and held at 25% for 30 min. In an additional 10 min, solvent B reached 60%. In this system, the conjugates eluted with a retention time of 30–45 min. The concentration of the glutathione conjugates was determined by amino acid analysis. After lyophilization, the conjugates were hydrolyzed in a vapor-phase automated hydrolyzer (Perkin-Elmer). The resulting amino acids were derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate to form phenyl isothiocyanate-derivatives, which were extracted and transferred to an on-line 130/A HPLC apparatus for analysis using an Applied Biosystems 420/H PTC amino acid analyzer/hydrolyzer. In each assay, 100–300 pmol (0.1–0.2%) of the sample were analyzed, which is well within the range of sensitivity of the instrument (25 pmol to 2 nmol). The molecular identity of the GS-aldehyde conjugates was established by electrospray mass spectrometry. The electrospray mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a Micromass ZMD single quadrapole electrospray mass spectrometer. The tuning and calibration solution consisted of polypropylene glycol 2000 in water/methanol (50:50, v/v) containing 0.1% acetic acid. Additional calibration aroundm/z 300 was performed by using GSH, which displayed a well resolved peak at m/z 307. The capillary, cone, and extractor were operated at 3.5, 40, and 3 V, respectively, with 40 p.s.i. N2 at a flow rate of 0.5 liter/min. The source block and desolvation temperatures were set at 80 and 200 °C, respectively. Typically, a 10–20 μmsolution of the conjugates was prepared in acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) and injected into the ion source of the spectrometer using a Harvard syringe pump at a flow rate of 5–10 μl/min. The mass spectrometer was set to scan fromm/z 100 to m/z 750 with a step size of 0.5, a dwell time of 2 ms, and a scan speed of 45. When dimers of dehydrated ions were observed, the cone voltage and the source block temperature were varied to optimize formation of the parent molecular ion. Before each experiment, stored recombinant AR was reduced by incubation with 0.1 mDTT at 37 °C for 1 h in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Excess DTT was removed by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10) pre-equilibrated with N2-saturated 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmEDTA. All operations were carried out at 4 °C to prevent oxidation of the enzyme. The DTT-free, reduced enzyme was stored under N2 and used within 1 h. Enzyme activity was measured at room temperature in a 1-ml reaction system containing 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), 10 mmglyceraldehyde, and 0.15 mm NADPH. The reaction was monitored by measuring the disappearance of NADPH at 340 nm using a Gilford Response II spectrophotometer or a Varian Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μmol of NADPH/min. The control cuvette (blank) contained all components of the reaction mixture except the enzyme. The substrate concentration was varied over a range extending from 0.2 to 5–7 times the K m. Initial velocity was measured at seven to nine different concentrations of each substrate. Individual saturation curves used to obtainV max and K m were fitted to the general Michaelis-Menten equation using a nonlinear iterative fitting program (21.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) (Equation 1), v=(Vmax·S)/(Km+S)Equation 1 where v is the enzyme velocity and S is the substrate concentration. Data conforming to linear uncompetitive and noncompetitive or competitive inhibition were fitted to Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, respectively, v=(Vmax·S)/(Km+S(1+I/Kii))Equation 2 v=(Vmax·S)/(Kms(1+I/Kis)+S(1+I/Kii))Equation 3 v=(Vmax·S)/(Kms(1+I/Kis)+S)Equation 4 where I is the inhibitor concentration andK ii and K is are the intercept and slope inhibition constants, respectively. In all cases, the best fit to the data was chosen on the basis of the standard error of the fitted parameter and the lowest values of ς, which is defined as sum of the squares of the residuals divided by the degree of freedom,i.e. n − 1, where n represents the number of velocity measurements. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. The structure of GS-propanal was constructed from the coordinates of glutathione (Protein Data Bank code 1gra) (22.Becker K. Savvides S.N. Keese M. Schirmer R.H. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and 2-cyclopropylmethylenepropanal (Protein Data Bank code 1hrn) (23.Tong L. Pav S. Lamarre D. Pilote L. LaPlante S. Anderson P.C. Jung G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with the starting conformation of glutathione the same as that in the crystal structure of glutathione reductase. The chemical structure of GS-propanal is shown in Fig. 1. For AR, the 1.76-Å structure complexed with NADP+ and glucose 6-phosphate was used (Protein Data Bank code 2aq) (24.Harrison D.H. Bohren K.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Gabbay K.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2011-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) as the starting model. GS-propanal was positioned in the active site of AR using program O (25.Wilson D.K. Tarle I. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9847-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The aldehyde moiety of GS-propanal was positioned such that the carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde is 2.9 Å from both the NE2 atom of His110 and the hydroxyl group of Tyr48and is in the same position as the carboxylate oxygen of zopolrestat (25.Wilson D.K. Tarle I. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9847-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This resulted in the carbonyl moiety being parallel to the nicotinamide ring of NADPH. Two distinct starting orientations of GS-propanal, termed orientations 1 and 2, were examined. The propanal group was oriented similarly in both models, and the positioning of the GS-propanal residues γGlu1 and Gly3 was switched in the two models. The energy of the GS-propanal·AR complex was minimized to reduce both steric strain and close van der Waals contacts. Molecular dynamics calculations were then performed for 0.5 ps at 300 K to enable the bound GS-propanal to sample a large part of the conformational space within the AR active site. A 200-step conjugate gradient energy minimization was performed after the molecular dynamics calculation to generate the final models of the GS-propanal·AR complex. All energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations were performed with the X-PLOR program (50.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Force-field terms for GS-propanal were constructed from analogous amino acids parameters. To maintain the geometry of the catalytic site, the aldehyde moiety of GS-propanal was constrained with weak distance restraints (nuclear Overhauser effect Restraints) to be within 2.9 Å of the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr48 and the NE2 atom of His110. In the first series of experiments, the effect of glutathione conjugation on the catalytic efficiency of AR in reducing unsaturated aldehydes was examined. For this, glutathione conjugates of acrolein,trans-2-hexenal, trans-2-nonenal, andtrans,trans-2,4-decadienal were prepared by incubating the alkenals with GSH at room temperature and neutral pH. The conjugates formed were purified by HPLC, and their concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. In some experiments, [3H]GSH was used to conjugate alkenals; and after HPLC purification, the concentration of the conjugates was calculated based upon the radioactivity. Upon ESI+/MS, the conjugates displayed intense molecular ions with m/z values corresponding to a 1:1 adduct between glutathione and the alkenal (Table I). Appropriate dilutions of the conjugates were used for the measurement of AR activity. Since conjugation removes unsaturation at C-3, the kinetic constants obtained with the conjugates were compared with the corresponding aldehyde saturated at this position. Under the experimental conditions used, the aldehydes and their conjugates followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. To ensure that no side reactions or unexpected interactions contaminated the calculated values of the kinetic parameter, the products generated by AR catalysis were examined. For this, the ESI+/MS spectra of the glutathione conjugates before and after reduction by AR were compared. As shown in Fig. 2 for GS-propanal, incubation with AR led to an increase in them/z value of the conjugate from 364.4 to 366.4, consistent with the reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol. No significant formation of other ions was detected. Single reduction products were also obtained with other glutathione conjugates (data not shown).Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for aldose reductase-catalyzed reduction of aldehydes and glutathione-aldehyde conjugatesSubstratem/zK mk catk cat/K mμmmin −1min −1μm −1Propanal5120 ± 32028.1 ± 1.70.005 ± 0.0003GS-propanal364.413.2 ± 187.9 ± 8.76.8 ± 0.7Hexanal8.4 ± 123.4 ± 0.82.9 ± 0.1GS-hexanal406.37.2 ± 174.0 ± 6.610.6 ± 1.0Nonanal25.1 ± 736.9 ± 4.61.5 ± 0.2GS-nonanal448.39.3 ± 766.0 ± 8.97.3 ± 0.9trans-4-Decenal44 ± 134.2 ± 4.50.8 ± 0.1GS-trans-4-decenal460.44.2 ± 155.4 ± 9.913.8 ± 2.3The enzyme activity was determined in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, (pH 7.0) using the indicated aldehyde or GS-aldehyde conjugate in the presence of 0.15 mm NADPH.

The m/z values of the glutathione conjugates were determined by ESI+/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinetic constants are expressed as means ± S.E. With each of the aldehydes tested, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) was significantly higher for the conjugate than for the corresponding free aldehyde (Table I). The increases in the catalytic efficiency were, however, variable. A greater enhancement (>1000-fold) of the catalytic efficiency was observed with the small-chain aldehyde acrolein than with intermediate-chain aldehydes such as hexenal and nonenal (3.5–5-fold). The medium-chain unsaturated conjugate GS-trans-4-decenal was reduced with a 16-fold greater efficiency than trans-4-decenal. These results suggest that conjugation with glutathione enhances the catalytic efficiency of AR, particularly for small-chain or unsaturated aldehydes. To examine the specificity of glutathione in facilitating the aldehyde binding/catalysis at the active site, we measured the kinetic parameters of AR with conjugates in which the peptide backbone was systematically varied while retaining the Cys–aldehyde bond. For this analysis, propanal adducts were used because GS-propanal displayed the greatest enhancement of catalytic efficiency over propanal. The conjugates were prepared by incubating the indicated thiol peptides with acrolein. The propanal conjugates formed intense molecular ions upon ESI+/MS, which accounted for >90% of the signal. Some of the conjugates examined, e.g. those with cysteine and Cys-Gly, formed 1:2 adducts (two aldehydes conjugated with the amino acid or the peptide). These adducts were not used for further analysis. The remaining conjugates displayed strict 1:1 stoichiometry. Of these, some, e.g. Gly-Cys-Gly and γGlu-Cys-Glu, displayed additional peaks (data not shown) that were assigned to dehydrated forms of the conjugate. However, since no peaks corresponding to 1:2 adducts were observed, these conjugates were tested as potential AR substrates. The m/z values of the parent peptides and synthesized conjugates are listed in Table II.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters for aldose reductase-catalyzed reduction of peptide-propanal conjugatesPeptidem/zK mk catk cat/K mPeptideConjugateμmmin −1min −1μm −1γGlu-Cys-Gly308.3364.313.0 ± 1.687.9 ± 8.76.6 ± 0.7αGlu-Cys-Gly308.5364.31.5 ± 0.329.3 ± 2.019.5 ± 1.4γ-Aminobutyric acid-Cys-Gly263.1319.210.1 ± 1.032.7 ± 1.63.2 ± 0.2Gly-Cys-Gly236.2292.233.7 ± 7.179.2 ± 8.42.3 ± 0.3γGlu-Cys-Glu379.1435.39.3 ± 1.143.7 ± 2.64.7 ± 0.3γGlu-Cys-Ala322.2378.324.2 ± 3.028.8 ± 1.41.2 ± 0.06Gly-Cys-Glu308.3364.32.6 ± 0.549.6 ± 1.819.1 ± 0.7γGlu-Cys251.2307.33.2 ± 0.244.5 ± 0.813.9 ± 0.2N-Acetyl-Cys-Glu293.2349.11.6 ± 0.318.0 ± 0.711.2 ± 0.5N-Acetyl-Cys-Gly221.1277.31.6 ± 0.316.9 ± 1.410.6 ± 0.9N-Acetyl-Cys163.8220.263.1 ± 1.7154.2 ± 6.20.86 ± 0.1γGlu-Cys-Ala-Gly379.2435.412.7 ± 3.018.3 ± 1.31.4 ± 0.1αGlu-Cys-Ala-Gly379.2435.372.1 ± 14.235.6 ± 3.40.49 ± 0.05αGlu-Ala-Cys-Gly379.0435.329.6 ± 4.327.6 ± 0.90.93 ± 0.03The m/z values of the peptides were determined by ESI+/MS.

Modification of the N-terminal glutamate (γGlu1) had profound effects on the catalytic efficiency with which the enzyme catalyzed the reduction of the conjugate. As compared with GS-propanal (in which the amide bond is between the γ-carboxyl of glutamate and the amine of cysteine), the propanal conjugate of αGlu-Cys-Gly (in which cysteine is linked to the α-carboxyl of Glu) was reduced with much higher efficiency by the enzyme, indicating sensitivity of the active site to the geometry of the N-terminal amide linkage. However, removal of the γ-carboxyl of Glu or substitution of Glu with Gly diminished catalytic efficiency by 50–65% (compare γ-aminobutyric acid-Cys-Gly and Gly-Cys-Gly with GSH), suggesting that the presence of Glu at the N terminus enhances catalytic efficiency due to specific interaction between the enzyme and the γ-carboxyl group of Glu. The catalytic efficiency was equally sensitive to alterations in C-terminal glycine. Although γGlu-Cys-Glu was reduced with efficiency slightly lower than GSH, substitution of the C-terminal glycine with alanine led to a marked reduction in activity and poor catalytic activity. However, transposition of glycine to the N terminus led to a peptide whose conjugate was more efficiently reduced than GSH, indicating that an α-amide linkage at the N terminus facilitates catalysis. This is consistent with the higher catalytic efficiency observed with αGlu-Cys-Gly than with GSH. Moreover, removal of the C-terminal glycine, which led to a smaller molecule, enhanced catalysis. The high catalytic efficiency observed with dipeptides was comparable when either glycine or glutamate was linked with cysteine (cf. N-acetyl-Cys-Gly and N-acetyl-Cys-Glu), suggesting that smaller molecules with less structural constraints during binding are more efficiently reduced by the enzyme. A further decrease in the length of the peptide backbone led, however, to a sharp decline in the catalytic efficiency, and the smallest adduct,N-acetylcysteine-propanal, was among the poorest substrates tested, indicating that residues linked to cysteine interact specifically with the active site, providing additional anchoring and stabilization. The catalytic efficiency was also decreased upon increasing the size of the peptide backbone. Thus, γGlu-Cys-Ala-Gly was reduced much less efficiently than GSH, and no improvement was evident when the N-terminal glutamate of the tetrapeptide was linked via the α-carboxyl rather than the γ-carboxyl.

https://openalex.org/W2145900952,"Three-amino acid extension loop (TALE) homeobox proteins are highly conserved transcription regulators. We report that two members of this family, Meis2 and TGIF, which frequently have overlapping consensus binding sites on complementary DNA strands in opposite orientations, can function competitively. For example, in theD1A gene, which encodes the predominant dopamine receptor in the striatum, Meis2 and TGIF bind to the activator sequence ACT (−1174 to −1154) and regulate transcription differentially in a cell type-specific manner. Among the five cloned splice variants of Meis2, isoforms Meis2a–d activate theD1A promoter in most cell types tested, whereas TGIF competes with Meis2 binding to DNA and represses Meis2-induced transcription activation. Consequently, Meis2 cannot activate theD1A promoter in a cell that has abundant TGIF expression. The Meis2 message is highly co-localized with the D1A message in adult striatal neurons, whereas TGIF is barely detectable in the adult brain. Our observations provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that Meis2 and TGIF differentially regulate their target genes. Thus, the delicate ratio between Meis2 and TGIF expression in a given cell type determines the cell-specific expression of theD1A gene. We also found that splice variant Meis2e, which has a truncated homeodomain, cannot bind to theD1A ACT sequence or activate transcription. However, Meis2e is an effective dominant negative regulator by blocking Meis2d-induced transcription activation. Thus, truncated homeoproteins with no DNA binding domains can have important regulatory functions.

Human TGIF (5′-TG-3′interacting factor) is known to bind to the retinoid X receptor (RXR)-responsive element in the cellular retinol-binding protein II promoter, which contains an unusual DNA target for homeobox proteins. The interactions of TGIF and RXRα with this element occur on overlapping areas and generate a mutually exclusive binding. In addition, TGIF inhibits 9-cis-retinoic acid-dependent RXRα-induced transactivation of this promoter (13.Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The interplay of a variety of transcription factors like the homeoproteins plays an important role in the regulated, tissue-specific, and developmental expression of eukaryotic genes. These factors exert their effects on target genes by both activating and repressing transcription. Such complex regulation is particularly evident in the brain, where a large number of genes are expressed with unique regional distributions. For example, specificity of the biological effects of dopamine is determined at least in part by the intricate spatial and temporal regulation of genes encoding its receptors. To date, five G protein-coupled dopamine receptors encoded by different genes have been cloned. Based on their homology and pharmacological criteria, they are classified into two subtypes, D1-like (D1A and D5 or D1B) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) receptors (14.Dearry A. Gingrich J.A. Falardeau P. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Bates M.D. Caron M.G. Nature. 1990; 347: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 15.Gingrich J.A. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Among these, the D1A subtype is the predominant dopamine receptor in the striatum, the brain region that is innervated by dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra which degenerate in Parkinson's disease (16.Hornykiewicz O. Pharmacol. Rev. 1966; 18: 925-964PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in the functional state of dopamine receptors in neuropsychiatric disorders and with chronic dopaminergic therapy are thought to underlie long term complications such as parkinsonian motor response fluctuations and tardive dyskinesias (17.Lee T. Seeman P. Tourtellotte W.W. Farley I.J. Hornykiewicz O. Nature. 1978; 274: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18.Mouradian M.M. Juncos J.L. Fabbrini G. Schlegel J. Bartko J.J. Chase T.N. Ann. Neurol. 1988; 24: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Our previous analysis of the human D1A receptor gene revealed that the region between nucleotides −1173 and −1154 (ACT) may function for its neural cell-specific expression (19.Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the ACT sequence is highly conserved between human, pig, and rat D1A genes (20.Lee S.-H. Yajima S. Mouradian M.M. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 34: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We now sought to identify cell- or tissue-specific transcription factors that bind to this sequence using the yeast one-hybrid screen. We found that human Meis2 and TGIF differentially regulate transcription of theD1A gene by binding to complementary DNA sequences within its ACT region. The murine neuroblastoma cell line NS20Y was a gift from Dr. Marshall Nirenberg (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).

Res. 1999; 34: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) were ligated into pHISi and pLacZ to generate pHISi-ACT and pLacZ-ACT, respectively, for screening a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). The plasmid from the single positive blue clone was sequenced, and its homology was analyzed using BLAST. The Meis2b cDNA isolated from the yeast one-hybrid screening was sequenced and oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to screen a SuperScript™ human brain cDNA library using GeneTrapper system (Life Technologies). These PCR primers were: forward, 5′-AGTATGGGATCCGCTGTCAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGCTGCCGTCTCTTTCATC-3′. All positive clones were sequenced, and five different Meis2 splice variants were identified and designated pCMV-Meis2a–e, respectively. The coding region of TGIF cDNA was cloned using RT-PCR with total RNA from human brain (CLONTECH) using primers: forward, 5′-CGGGATCCTCCAGAATGAAAGGCAAGAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCTCGAGTTAAGCTGTAAGTTTTGC-3′, designed to haveBamHI and XhoI sites (underlined), respectively. The amplified TGIF cDNA was digested withBamHI and XhoI and subcloned into the respective sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA-TGIF. To construct an expression vector having only the TGIF homeodomain, the cDNA region covering amino acid residues 31–97 was amplified by PCR using pcDNA-TGIF as template with primers 5′-AACTGCAG ATGGCTGGCTCAGGCAAGAGAAGG-3′ (PstI site underlined; inserted ATG codon italicized) and 5′-GAGCTCGAGCATGTCAGGGAGGAGCCTGCG-3′ (XhoI site underlined). The product was digested with PstI andXhoI and ligated into the same sites of pCMV/myc/nuc (Invitrogen) in frame with the nuclear localization signal of the vector. The insert in the resultant plasmid pTGIF-HD was confirmed by sequencing. In vitro transcription/translation (Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out with pCMV-Meis2a–e and pcDNA-TGIF in a reaction mixture containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The labeled proteins were then electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE to determine that they were of the predicted sizes. Human Genomewalker kit (CLONTECH) was used to isolate a genomic fragment harboring the exon/intron junction region of Meis2e. After designing two gene-specific primers (GSP1 and GSP2) within the exon region of Meis2e, PCR was performed with GSP1 (5′-CTTCACCTGGTACAGGTGACGATGA-3′) and AP1 (adaptor primer 1), followed by a second PCR with GSP2 (5′-TCATGAGAGCATGGCTCTTCCAGCA-3′) and AP2 (nested adaptor primer 2). The second PCR yielded a 1.2-kilobase pair product, which was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Mouse Multiple Tissue and Embryonic Stages cDNA Panel (CLONTECH) was used to amplify Meis2e isoforms. To separate the Meis2efragment from other Meis2 isoforms, PCR was performed with sense primer P1 (5′-GATGATGCAACCTCAACCCAC-3′, located between nucleotides 919 and 939) and antisense primer P2 (5′-ATCCAACACAAAGCTCCC-3′, located between nucleotides 1354 and 1372) (Fig. 2 A). PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel, and the 355-bp fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and sequenced. P2 primer sequence is identical between human and mouse Meis2 (11.Oulad-Abdelghani M. Chazaud C. Bouillet P. Sapin V. Chambon P. Dolle P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The two base substitutions (T924C and C936G in primer P1) in the mouse did not affect the outcome of this PCR with murine tissues. To identify Meis2 isoforms expressed in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-MC cell lines, RT-PCR was performed using sense primer P1 paired with either antisense primer P2 or P3 (5′-ATTGGGGGTCCATGTCTT-3′, located between nucleotides 1608 and 1625). These PCR products were electrophoresed in a 3% agarose gel. Transfections were carried out by the standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (Invitrogen). Briefly, HepG2, OK, SK-N-MC, and SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/dish and cultured overnight before transfection. Various plasmids at the indicated concentrations in each figure were used. Total amount of DNA was kept constant by adding pcDNA3.1. After transfection periods of 6 h (OK) or 18 h (SK-N-MC, SH-SY5Y, and HepG2), cells were incubated in fresh medium for an additional 48 h. CAT protein was quantified by the CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. The coding regions of Meis2a–e were amplified by PCR using pCMV-Meis2a–e as templates with primers containing either EcoRI or XhoI sites, and sequences were confirmed. All five Meis2a–e cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 to produce GST fusion proteins and designated pGEX-Meis2a–e, respectively. The resultant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21. Fusion proteins of Meis2 isoforms were induced by 0.1 misopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified using glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For gel mobility shift assays, wild-type and mutant ACT probes (Fig. 1) were synthesized using an ABI DNA synthesizer. One strand was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with the cold complementary strand. Double-stranded, end-labeled DNA probe (20 kcpm/binding reaction; 5 fmol) was incubated with 200 ng of GST-Meis2 fusion proteins in a final volume of 20 μl at room temperature for 30 min. In some experiments, a polyclonal antibody to GST was co-incubated with GST-Meis2 fusion proteins for 30 min at room temperature prior to adding the probe. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in 1× Tris/glycine buffer as described previously (19.Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV-Meis2a was digested withEcoRI and XhoI, and the Meis2a insert was subcloned in pGEM-3Zf(−) to generate pGEM-Meis2a. Antisense probe was transcribed from the SP6 promoter after linearizing withEcoRI, and the sense probe was transcribed from the T7 promoter after linearizing with HindIII. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were transcribed according to the protocol of the kit's supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and hydrolyzed to approximately 200-bp fragments by alkaline hydrolysis. [35S]UTP-labeled D1A probes were transcribed from pGEM-mD1A that had been linearized with EcoRI for generation of sense probe from the SP6 promoter or withHindIII for generation of antisense probe from the T7 promoter using the SP6/T7 transcription kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Fourteen-μm-thick sections of the mouse striatum were subjected to simultaneous hybridization with two probes as described (21.Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992Google Scholar). To identify transcription factors that bind to the D1A ACT region, the yeast one-hybrid screen was performed. A double-stranded oligonucleotide having three tandem repeats of the ACT sequence (Fig.1) was subcloned into pHISi and introduced into yeast cells. The resultant strain was transformed with a human brain cDNA library. Plasmids prepared from seven positive colonies that grew on selection medium were transformed into yeast strain containing the pLacZ-bait construct. One of these seven clones was found to be a true positive after the lacZ expression test. Sequence analysis of the positive clone indicated that it is the human homologue of murine Meis2b. The Meis2b cDNA insert in the library plasmid was fused in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain. To obtain full-length Meis2 clones, PCRs were carried out using a SuperScript™ human brain cDNA library (Life Technologies) and five splice variants were isolated (Fig.2 A). These clones were designated Meis2a to Meis2e, analogous to the nomenclature of murine Meis2 isoforms (11.Oulad-Abdelghani M. Chazaud C. Bouillet P. Sapin V. Chambon P. Dolle P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HumanMeis2a, Meis2b, Meis2c, andMeis2d use the same exons as in murine Meis2cDNAs. Meis2a, which includes all exons, andMeis2b, which lacks exon 3(A), encode isoforms that end at the first termination codon. On the other hand, Meis2c, which lacks exon 4, and Meis2d, which lacks both exons 3(A) and 4, encode isoforms that end at the second termination codon. Comparison of human and mouse Meis2a and Meis2b sequences revealed 100% amino acid identity. In Meis2c, the two species differ by a single amino acid at position 439, whereas in Meis2d they differ by two amino acids at positions 394 and 432. Meis2e, which had not been identified previously, has the same start codon as that ofMeis2a–d, but an early termination codon TAA within the homeodomain due to alternative splicing resulting in deletion of exon 1 and a frameshift. Thus, the Meis2e protein has a truncated homeodomain (Fig. 2, A and B). To exclude the possibility that Meis2e could be an artifact of library construction, 3′ genomic walking was performed with gene-specific primers to determine the exon-intron boundary in the deleted region. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences indicated that the splice donor site of this alternatively spliced product obeys the GT-AG rule (data not shown) (22.Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). The splice acceptor site at this exon has been reported previously in the mouse (11.Oulad-Abdelghani M. Chazaud C. Bouillet P. Sapin V. Chambon P. Dolle P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To verify the endogenous expression of the Meis2e splice variant in biological tissues, PCR was carried out on cDNA obtained from multiple adult mouse tissues as well as from different embryonic stages (CLONTECH) using a primer pair designed to separate Meis2e from the other four Meis2 isoforms (Fig. 2 C). In addition to a doublet band representing 454 bp for variants “a” and “c” and 433 bp for variants “b” and “d,” a 355-bp fragment was amplified and cloned. Upon sequencing, the latter was confirmed to represent Meis2e. The relative abundance of Meis2e in different tissues was quite variable with highest level in muscle and lowest levels in brain, heart, and kidney. The ability of all five Meis2 cDNA isoforms to encode proteins was verified by in vitro translation and the products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 D). All Meis2a–e isoforms were expressed and electrophoresed slower than expected from their calculated molecular weights, probably because of the abundance of prolines and stretches of acidic residues (9.Nakamura T. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2235-2242PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm whether Meis2 can indeed bind to the ACT sequence, gel mobility shift assays were carried out using GST fusion proteins of each human Meis2 isoform (Fig.3). All GST-Meis2 fusion proteins were able to shift the target ACT oligonucleotide probe except GST-Meis2e, which has a truncated homeodomain. This finding indicates that the homeodomain in Meis2 is essential for consensus sequence recognition and binding. The specificity of this DNA-protein interaction was verified by complete inhibition in the presence of cold wild-type ACT oligonucleotide and by lack of Meis2a–d binding to a mutant ACT probe. Furthermore, the shifted Meis2a–d bands were supershifted with a GST polyclonal antibody, indicating that they represent GST-Meis2 fusion proteins. Interestingly, Meis2a–d showed two shifted bands (Fig. 3, lanes 2–5), although purified GST-Meis2a–d fusion proteins ran as single major bands of the expected sizes on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The latter observations suggest that Meis2 proteins could form homodimers similar to murine Meis1 (23.Shen W.F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Lawrence H.J. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We had previously demonstrated that theD1A promoter in pCATD1–1197 harboring the ACT region is expressed in a neuronal cell-specific manner (19.Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study this observation further, Meis2 Northern analysis was initially carried out using RNA from various cell lines in order to select appropriate cells for Meis2 co-transfection with pCATD1–1197. All neuronal cell lines tested (NS20Y, SK-N-MC, NB41A3, SH-SY5Y) had endogenous Meis2 expression, whereas non-neuronal cells HepG2 and OK did not (Fig.4). To determine whether Meis2 isoforms could increase the activity of pCATD1–1197 in non-neuronal cells, OK and HepG2 cells were co-transfected with Meis2a–e expression constructs and with pCATD1–1197 template plasmid. All co-transfected Meis2 isoforms were able to increase CAT expression significantly in both cell lines, except Meis2e, which lacks the homeodomain necessary for DNA binding (Fig. 5 A). These results indicate that Meis2 proteins can function as activators ofD1A gene transcription even in non-neuronal cells. Meis2b could increase CAT activity in HepG2, but not in OK cells, a finding that remains of unclear significance. The specificity of the Meis2d effect on pCATD1–1197 was investigated by co-transfecting OK cells with two additionalD1A promoter-CAT constructs, pCATD1–1154 and pCATD1–1120, which lack the ACT region (Fig. 5 B). This experiment demonstrated that the Meis2d effect is specific to pCATD1–1197, which harbors the ACT sequence. Interestingly, although Meis2e cannot bind to the ACT sequence (Fig. 3), it potently inhibits Meis2d-induced pCATD1–1197 activation in OK cells (Fig.5 C). The latter finding indicates that the NH2-terminal region of Meis2 proteins could play a role in regulating D1A gene transcription in addition to their homeodomains, which recognize target DNA sequences. The physiological significance of Meis2-induced activation of pCATD1–1197 transcription was addressed next by investigating changes in endogenous D1A mRNA levels in OK cells. This cell line was chosen because of the absence of Meis2 mRNA (Fig. 4) to allow interpretation of reconstitution experiments. In addition, although these cells had no detectableD1A mRNA in our Northern analysis (Fig. 4), they have previously been shown to express this dopamine receptor (24.Nash S.R. Godinot N. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 918-925PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that they have the basal transcription machinery to express this gene. Total RNA was prepared from cells transfected with pCMV-Meis2d or with control vector (pcDNA3.1) and Northern analysis was performed (Fig. 5 D). Meis2d significantly increased the endogenous D1A message compared with control vector-transfected cells. The functional relevance of our findings in cell lines was further addressed by investigating the cellular co-localization ofMeis2 and D1A messages within the adult striatum, the brain region in which both genes are highly expressed (12.Toresson H. Mata de Urquiza A. Fagerstrom C. Perlmann T. Campbell K. Development. 1999; 126: 1317-1326PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Okazawa H. Imafuku I. Minowa M.T. Kanazawa I. Hamada H. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Simultaneous hybridization of a digoxigenin-labeledMeis2a probe and a radiolabeled D1A probe revealed considerable overlap between the two signals (Fig.6). While some cells expressMeis2 alone, very few neurons expressD1A alone. This observation could reflect the important activating function of this nuclear protein on theD1A dopamine receptor gene. To study the effect of Meis2 overexpression on the D1A gene in human neuronal cell lines, SK-N-MC and SH-SY5Y cells expressing different amounts of D1A mRNA (Fig. 4) were co-transfected with all five Meis2 expression constructs and pCATD1–1197. Compared with the results in SK-N-MC cells, Meis2a–d induced robust increases of CAT activity in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig.7 A). The minimal changes with Meis2c and Meis2d in SK-N-MC cells are of unclear biologic significance. The decrease with Meis2e in both cell lines could be explained by repression of endogenous Meis2 activity. Since Meis2e is a potent repressor of Meis2d-induced pCATD1–1197 activity (Fig. 5 C), the expression levels ofMeis2e were checked in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-MC cells looking for a clue for the notable inability of Meis2a–d to activate theD1A promoter in the latter cell line. RT-PCR with primer pairs P1 and P2, designed to amplify a 355-bpMeis2e cDNA, failed to detect the expected fragment in either cell line but could amplify a complex band corresponding toMeis2a–d (Fig. 7 B). In addition, RT-PCR using primers P1 and P3 could amplify each of the Meis2a–dcDNAs in both cell lines but not Meis2e (Fig.7 C). Thus, the difference between these two cell lines with respect to Meis2a–d-induced activation of pCATD1–1197 (Fig.7 A) could not be explained by differences inMeis2e expression since neither cell had this truncated isoform. To gain further insight into the inability of Meis2a–d to activate transcription in SK-N-MC cells, careful examination of the ACT sequence led to the observation that a TGIF consensus sequence actually overlaps with the Meis2 consensus sequence with the opposite orientation (Fig.1). Furthermore, TGIF and Meis2 mRNAs are expressed at different levels in the cell lines tested, with relatively high TGIF in cells that have low or noD1A mRNA (Fig. 4). Therefore, to investigate the role of TGIF in regulating Meis2 effects on theD1A gene, the TGIF cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR from a human brain cDNA library and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The ability of TGIF to bind to the ACT region was tested by gel mobility shift assay using in vitrotranslated protein (Fig. 7 D). TGIF indeed bound to the wild-type ACT probe but not to the mutant ACT probe. Cold competitor significantly competed off TGIF binding. The overlapping TGIF and Meis2 binding sites within theD1A ACT sequence raised the possibility that the two proteins could compete for binding to the same target. In addition, TGIF has been known as a transcriptional repressor (13.Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To address this hypothesis, first, competitive gel shift assay was performed.In vitro translated TGIF and GST-Meis2a fusion protein were added to the gel shift reaction mixture and electrophoresed in a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 7 E). Addition of rising amounts of Meis2a with a constant amount of TGIF diminished TGIF binding to DNA. At the same time, presence of TGIF suppressed the relative intensity of the band shifted by rising amounts of Meis2a. Second, to investigate whether the in vitro competition of TGIF for the Meis2 recognition site has a functional impact within cells, SH-SY5Y cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for TGIF and for Meis2a and with pCATD1–1197. Co-expression of increasing amounts of TGIF resulted in a dramatic inhibition of Meis2a-induced pCATD1–1197 activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7 F). Since TGIF has its own repressor domain (26.Wotton D. Lo R.S. Swaby L.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the possibility that it blocks Meis2a-induced activation of theD1A promoter without necessarily displacing Meis2a was entertained next. pTGIF-HD expressing only the homeodomain of TGIF fused to a nuclear localization signal significantly repressed Meis2a-induced activation of pCATD1–1197 in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 G), indicating that TGIF competes with Meis2 function by displacing it from its target DNA. However, full-length TGIF appeared more potent than its homeodomain alone in repressing the Meis2 effect. In our search for transcription factors that regulate the humanD1A dopamine receptor gene, we have identified two TALE superclass homeobox genes, Meis2 andTGIF, which share overlapping and complementary common binding sites in the activator ACT sequence of theD1A promoter. The yeast one-hybrid screen employed with the ACT sequence as bait led to the isolation of Meis2 only but not TGIF. The very low expression of TGIF in the adult brain could explain the latter observation. The consensus DNA sequence for the murine Meis1 binding site has been previously characterized (23.Shen W.F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Lawrence H.J. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and the third helix of the homeodomain has been shown to be important for its DNA binding (27.Ekker S.C. von Kessler D.P. Beachy P.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4059-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28.Treisman J. Gonczy P. Vashishtha M. Harris E. Desplan C. Cell. 1989; 59: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Since murine Meis1 and Meis2 as well as human Meis2 have an identical amino acid sequence within their homeodomains (11.Oulad-Abdelghani M. Chazaud C. Bouillet P. Sapin V. Chambon P. Dolle P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), human Meis2 likely binds to the same consensus DNA sequence as murine Meis1. Thus, it was not surprising that we cloned Meis2 with the yeast one-hybrid screen since the D1A ACT bait contains a consensus sequence for Meis1 binding, TGACAG, albeit in the opposite orientation relative to the promoter (Fig. 1). Alternatively spliced variants that lack the homeodomain have been recognized in several homeobox genes such as Drosophila bicoid (29.Berleth T. Burri M. Thoma G. Bopp D. Richstein S. Frigerio G. Noll M. Nusslein-Volhard C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), Xenopus XIHbox 2 (30.Wright C.V. Cho K.W. Fritz A. Burglin T.R. De Robertis E.M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4083-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and Xenopus Xhox 36 (31.Condie B.G. Brivanlou A.H. Harland R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the precise functional role of these variants is unclear. In the present study, we identified five alternatively splicedMeis2 isoforms (Meis2a–e) in biological tissues, one of which, Meis2e, has a truncated homeodomain. In contrast to Meis2a–d, which transactivate theD1A promoter in pCATD1–1197 through the ACT sequence, Meis2e cannot because of its inability to bind to its target sequence. Furthermore, the homeodomain-lacking Meis2e inhibits Meis2d-induced transcriptional activation of pCATD1–1197. It, thus, appears that Meis2e acts as a natural dominant transcriptional repressor of Meis2 proteins. Another homeodomain-lacking protein, CSX1, has been reported to transactivate a reporter gene (32.Shiojima I. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Oka T. Yamazaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These observations collectively suggest that homeodomain-lacking proteins can act either as dominant negative regulators or as positive regulators by a homeodomain-independent mechanism. One of these homeodomain-independent mechanisms could be protein-protein interactions. For example, the amino termini of Meis1 and Pbx1a are known to be necessary and sufficient for their dimerization in solution and their interaction enhances transcriptional activity ofHoxb2 (33.Jacobs Y. Schnabel C.A. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the NH2termini of Meis2 proteins bind to an unidentified factor, and that Meis2e could interrupt such interactions without binding to the target DNA sequence. Whether such an interacting factor is a DNA-binding protein or not, Meis2e could act as a dominant negative regulator. The present study revealed that the consensus sequences for Meis2 and for TGIF binding sites usually overlap. These sequences are on complementary DNA strands and in opposite orientations. In theD1A promoter, for example, the target site for TGIF is in the same orientation as the promoter whereas that for Meis2 is in the reverse orientation (Fig. 1). Many genes, in fact, have similar overlapped sequences such as CRBPII (34.Nakshatri H. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 890-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lactoferrin (35.Liu Y.H. Teng C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21880-21885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), complement factor H (36.Munoz-Canoves P. Vik D.P. Tack B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20065-20068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and myosin heavy chain (37.Flink I.L. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11233-11237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 39.Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Although the Meis2 consensus site is in the reverse orientation relative to the 5′-3′ orientation of the D1A promoter, Meis2a–d have positive regulatory effects on pCATD1–1197. Our finding is consistent with the recent report that murine Meis1 can activate transcription even if its recognition site has an orientation opposite that of the promoter (33.Jacobs Y. Schnabel C.A. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The effect of sequence orientation of the TGIF consensus binding site remains to be investigated. While Meis2a–d proteins activate transcription of theD1A gene, TGIF represses it by binding to complementary DNA sequences. Therefore, the ratio between TGIF and Meis2 concentrations would be a critical factor for the transcriptional regulation of their target genes. Our gel shift experiments revealed a competition for binding to the ACT sequence between Meis2 and TGIF (Fig. 7 E). In addition, our co-transfection experiments indicated that TGIF or its homeodomain down-regulate Meis2-induced transactivation of the D1A promoter (Fig. 7,F and G), supporting the importance of Meis2 displacement from its target DNA. However, full-length TGIF was more potent than its homeodomain alone, suggesting an additional functional role of the TGIF repressor domain in modulating this effect. Thus, the inability of Meis2 to activate the D1A promoter in SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 7 A) may well be due to the high steady-state levels of TGIF expression in this cell line demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the relatively low TGIF expression in HepG2 and OK cells could account for the ability of Meis2 to activate pCATD1–1197 in both cell lines (Fig.5 A), and account for the ability of Meis2 to increase endogenous D1A message levels in OK cells (Fig.5 D). Furthermore, comparison of mRNA levels in different cell lines revealed that the presence of more Meis2 relative to TGIF is a requisite for endogenous D1A expression (Fig. 4). Hence, our studies provide both in vitro and in vivoevidence that the balance between Meis2 and TGIF is involved in the intricate regulation of D1A gene transcription. During development, Meis2 is highly expressed in the lateral ganglionic eminence of embryonic day 12.5 mouse telencephalon, suggesting that it can be a marker of striatal neuronal progenitors (12.Toresson H. Mata de Urquiza A. Fagerstrom C. Perlmann T. Campbell K. Development. 1999; 126: 1317-1326PubMed Google Scholar). Similar in situ hybridization studies have shown that the D1A dopamine receptor gene is also highly expressed in the striatum from day 14 embryos (40.Jung A.B. Bennett Jr., J.P. Brain Res. Dev.

Thus, Meis2 expression begins prior to that of the D1A gene prenatally supporting the ability of Meis2 to activate theD1A gene during striatal development. Furthermore, Meis2 and D1A messages are highly co-localized within the same neurons of the adult striatum (Fig. 6), providing the anatomic requisite for their functional interaction. In conclusion, the foregoing observations indicate that truncated homeoproteins such as Meis2e can function as dominant negative repressors of transcription. Detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal expression patterns of Meis2e compared with Meis2a–d can shed light on the mechanism of action of Meis2 proteins. In addition, since TGIF and Meis2 consensus sites usually overlap on complementary strands and in opposite orientations, and since TGIF represses Meis2-induced transactivation, their relative abundance in the cell determines the expression level of their target genes such as that encoding theD1A dopamine receptor."

The I domain is inserted between β-sheets 2 and 3 of the predicted β-propeller domain of the integrin α subunit. We deleted the I domain from the integrin αM and αL subunits to give I-less Mac-1 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), respectively. The I-less αM and αL subunits were expressed in association with the wild-type β2subunit on the surface of transfected cells and bound to all the monoclonal antibodies mapped to the putative β-propeller and C-terminal regions of the αM and αLsubunits, suggesting that the folding of these domains is independent of the I domain. I-less Mac-1 bound to the ligands iC3b and factor X, but this binding was reduced compared with wild-type Mac-1. In contrast, I-less Mac-1 did not bind to fibrinogen or denatured bovine serum albumin. Binding to iC3b and factor X by I-less Mac-1 was inhibited by the function-blocking antibody CBRM1/32, which binds to the β-propeller domain of the αM subunit. I-less LFA-1 did not bind its ligands intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and -3. Thus, the I domain is not essential for the folding, heterodimer formation, and surface expression of Mac-1 and LFA-1 and is required for binding to some ligands, but not others.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). These molecules are heterodimers composed of an α subunit and a β subunit (2.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). The β2 subfamily of integrins contains four members that have a common β2 subunit associated with distinct α subunits. The β2 subfamily includes the integrins Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18, αM/β2), LFA-1 1 (CD11a/CD18, αL/β2), p150,95 (CD11c/CD18, αX/β2), and αD/β2 (3.Gahmberg C.G. Tolvanen M. Kotovuori P. Eur. J.

Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Human patients with a defective β2 subunit have a disease known as leukocyte adhesion deficiency characterized by the inability of phagocytic cells to bind and to migrate across the endothelium (5.Anderson D.C.

This results in severe bacterial and fungal infections in these patients, indicating the crucial role of these integrins in normal immune responses. Mac-1 is predominantly expressed on myeloid and natural killer cells, where it mediates numerous physiological functions, including phagocytosis of foreign particles (7.Anderson D.C. Miller L.J.

The extracellular regions of the Mac-1 and LFA-1 α subunits have several distinct domains. The N-terminal region of the integrin α subunits contains seven repeats of 60 amino acids each (23.Corbi A.L. Miller L.J. O'Connor K. Larson R.S. Springer T.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4023-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These repeats have been predicted to fold into a β-propeller domain similar to the β-propeller seen in the G-protein β subunit (24.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Studies with monoclonal antibodies showed that the predicted β-propeller in the α subunit folds correctly only with the association of the β2 subunit (25.Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26.Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

All the β2 integrin α subunits have an inserted domain known as the I domain between β-sheets 2 and 3 in the predicted β-propeller of the α subunit (24.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The I domain has ∼200 amino acids that can fold independently of the other regions of the α subunit (27.Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 28.Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol.

The structures of I domains from Mac-1, LFA-1, α2β1, and α1β1 have been solved, and they have a dinucleotide-binding fold with a unique cation coordination site known as the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (29.Lee J.-O.

Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Recent studies with mAbs have shown that the I domain and most of the region C-terminal to the β-propeller fold independently of the β2 subunit (26.Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of the αM subunit has been predicted to fold into multiple β-sandwich domains (26.Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The β2 subunit contains an “I domain-like” region in the N-terminal region. Electron micrographs of integrins show that the N-terminal regions of the α and β subunits fold into a globular head connected to the membrane by a long stalk-like region composed of the C-terminal regions (35.Nermut M.V.

Recombinant I domain from Mac-1 can bind ICAM-1, and fibrinogen but does not bind factor X (28.Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although most function-blocking mAbs to Mac-1 bind to the I domain, mAb CBRM1/32 blocks binding to ligands by binding to the upper surface of the β-propeller domain (40.Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J.

A. 1998; 95: 4870-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the case of LFA-1, both the isolated I domain (43.Randi A.M. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12395-12398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and peptides from the β-propeller domain encompassing putative cation-binding motifs (44.Stanley P. Bates P.A. Harvey J. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1790-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have been reported to bind to ICAM-1. Mutagenesis studies showed that the I domain-like region of the β2 subunit is also involved in ligand binding of both Mac-1 and LFA-1 (45.Bajt M.L. Goodman T. McGuire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These studies point to the fact that sequences outside the I domain might be involved in ligand binding. In this study, we examined the effect of the removal of the I domain on the structure and function of Mac-1 and LFA-1. We demonstrate that the folding of the β-propeller domain and other α subunit regions is independent of the I domain. The I domain is not essential for the formation of α/β heterodimers for both Mac-1 and LFA-1. I-less Mac-1 can bind at reduced levels to some Mac-1 ligands, including factor X and iC3b, but does not bind to the ligands fibrinogen and denatured BSA. Binding to iC3b and factor X is blocked by mAb to the β-propeller domain. In contrast, I-less LFA-1 cannot bind to its ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-3. This study demonstrates a role for the α subunit β-propeller domain in the binding of some ligands by Mac-1 and underlines the complexity of ligand binding by integrins. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin.

Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12403-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by overlap polymerase chain reaction (48.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Similarly, the DNA fragment encoding Asn129–Val308 was deleted from the αL subunit cDNA in plasmid AprM8 (50.Larson R.S. Corbi A.L. Berman L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) by overlap polymerase chain reaction. Transient transfection of 293T cells was as described previously (51.Heinzel S.S.

Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7.5 μg each of αM and β2 subunit cDNAs were transfected into 293T cells in 6-cm plates. Cells were detached 48 h post-transfection with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA for adhesion assays and flow cytometry. Stable expression in K562 cells was as described previously (53.Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the I-less mutant cDNAs of αM and αL were subcloned into the pEFpuro vector and cotransfected with the wild-type β2 subunit into K562 cells by electroporation. Transfectants were selected in medium supplemented with 4 μg/ml puromycin. Clones of K562 transfectants that expressed similar levels of surface wild-type and I-less integrins were selected for further study. Flow cytometry was performed on K562 and 293T cell transfectants as described previously (53.Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling, 293T cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes and transfected with the appropriate cDNA constructs; 24 h later, they were washed twice with methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium and labeled with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine in 2 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 16 h. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (26.Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except that the cell lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose bound to a nonspecific myeloma IgG1. In addition, 1 mm Mg2+ and 0.15 mmCa2+ were included in all the buffers. For the Mac-1 adhesion assay, 50 μl of purified iC3b (2 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 μl of factor X (80 milliunits/ml; Sigma), 50 μl of fibrinogen (1 mg/ml; Sigma), or 50 μl of BSA (1 mg/ml) denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min was coated onto plastic in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH) by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 400 μl of blocking buffer (0.05% polyvinylpyrrolidone in phosphate-buffered saline) for 60 min at 37 °C. K562 cells expressing wild-type or I-less Mac-1 were labeled with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester as described previously (54.Petruzzelli L. Maduzia L. Springer T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 854-866PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in L-15 medium and 0.5% human serum albumin. For cation treatment, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution lacking calcium and magnesium ions (Sigma) and resuspended in the same buffer with the appropriate cations as indicated. Cell suspensions (5 × 104 cells in 50 μl) were added to the ligand-coated wells containing 50 μl of stimulatory and/or inhibitory mAb at a concentration of 20 μg/ml (10 μg/ml final concentration) or buffer alone. Cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at room temperature and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Unbound cells were removed by a microplate autowasher (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) using six washes with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The wash program dispensed 250 μl of buffer and a 100-μl volume remained after aspiration under a pressure of 2 p.s.i. Fluorescence intensity of the bound cells and the total input cells was measured on a fluorescence concentration analyzer (IDEXX, Westbrook, ME). The bound cells were expressed as a percentage of the total input cells in each sample well. For the LFA-1 adhesion assay, the LFA-1 ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 were purified from human tonsil lysate using R6.5 and IC3/1 antibody affinity columns (19.Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 55.de Fougerolles A.R. Qin X. Springer T.A. J. Exp.

The LFA-1 adhesion assay conditions were identical to those used for Mac-1 adhesion assays, except that the nonspecific sites were blocked by 2% BSA. To examine the role of the I domain in the folding and function of Mac-1 and LFA-1, the I domain was deleted from the α subunit of these integrins. The length of the deleted region was determined based on the predicted length of the I domain as defined by x-ray crystal structures (29.Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 31.Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The I-less αM subunit lacked Glu131–Gly321, and the I-less αLsubunit lacked Asn129–Val308 (Fig.1). The N and C termini of the I domain are close to one another; and therefore, no linker segment was added. To study the assembly and cell-surface expression of I-less Mac-1, stable transfectants expressing I-less and wild-type Mac-1 were generated in K562 cells. The expression of Mac-1 was determined by immunofluorescent flow cytometry. The antibody CBRM1/30, which binds to αM only when it is associated with β2 (26.Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), bound equally well to both I-less and wild-type Mac-1 (Fig.2, C and F). The antibody CBRM1/1 to the Mac-1 I domain bound to wild-type Mac-1, but not to I-less Mac-1, confirming that the I domain was deleted (Fig. 2,B and E). Similarly, the I-less αLsubunit was coexpressed with the wild-type β2 subunit in K562 cells. mAb TS2/4, which reacts with the αL subunit β-propeller domain only when complexed with the β2subunit (25.Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), reacted equally well with the transfectants expressing I-less and wild-type LFA-1 (Fig. 2, I and L). mAbs to the I domain did not bind to the I-less mutant, confirming the deletion of the I domain (Fig. 2, H and K). These results show that the I domain deletion did not affect the assembly and cell-surface expression of αL/β2 and αM/β2 heterodimers.Figure 2Heterodimer formation of wild-type and I-less Mac-1. Shown are the results from immunofluorescent flow cytometry of wild-type (WT) or I-less Mac-1 and LFA-1 stably expressed on K562 cells. A–F, K562 cells that express wild-type or I-less Mac-1 were stained with a nonbinding control (X63 IgG;A and D), mAb CBRM 1/1 to the αMsubunit I domain (B and E), or mAb CBRM1/30 to the αM subunit C-terminal segment (C andF). G–L, K562 cells that express wild-type or I-less LFA-1 were stained with a nonbinding control (X63 IgG;G and J), mAb TS1/22 to the αLsubunit I domain (H and K), or mAb TS2/4 to the αL subunit β-propeller domain (I andL).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm αβ complex formation, transiently transfected 293T cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and subjected to immunoprecipitation. The I-less and wild-type αM subunits were immunoprecipitated in association with the β2 subunit by both mAb CBRM1/30 to αM and mAb CBR LFA1/2 to β2 (Fig.3). The I-less αM subunit was lower in molecular mass than the wild-type αMsubunit, as expected. Furthermore, the relative amounts of α and β subunits were similar in wild-type and I-less Mac-1 immunoprecipitates. To determine whether the I domain is required for the folding of other domains in Mac-1 and LFA-1, we tested the binding of a panel of mAbs previously mapped to different domains/regions of Mac-1 and LFA-1 (25.Huang C.

Antibodies that bind to the β-propeller domain and the C-terminal region of the αM subunit bound equally well to wild-type and I-less αM/β2 (TableI).

The folding of the different domains of the I-less αL/β2 complex was similarly studied using a panel of antibodies. mAbs to the αL β-propeller domain and C-terminal region reacted equally well with wild-type and I-less LFA-1. In addition, a panel of mAbs that bind to the β2subunit I-like domain and C-terminal cysteine-rich region bound to I-less and wild-type LFA-1 to comparable levels (TableII). Thus, the folding of other domains of Mac-1 and LFA-1 is independent of the I domain.Table IIReactivity of antibodies to wild-type and I-less LFA-1 determined by immunofluorescent flow cytometrymAbEpitopeWT LFA-1I-less LFA-1TS1/22I domain+−TS2/6I domain+−MAY.035I domain+−CBR LFA1/1I domain/β-propeller+−CBR LFA1/10β-Propeller++TS2/4β-Propeller++S6F1β-Propeller++G25.2β-Propeller/C terminus++NKI-L16β-Propeller/C terminus++CBR LFA1/3β-Propeller/C terminus++6.5EI-like domain++MAY.017I-like domain++TS1/18I-like domain++YFC51I-like domain++CBR LFA1/2β2 Cys-rich region++CBR LFA1/7β2 Cys-rich region++Stably transfected K562 cells and transiently transfected 293T cells expressing wild type (WT) or I-less LFA-1 were stained with the indicated antibodies.

To study the role of the I domain in Mac-1 function, we tested the binding of wild-type and I-less Mac-1 to various Mac-1 ligands, including iC3b, factor X, fibrinogen, and denatured BSA. Both wild-type and I-less Mac-1 transfectants bound to iC3b in the presence of the activating antibody CBR LFA1/2 (Fig. 4 A). The binding of I-less Mac-1 transfectants was reduced by 70% compared with wild-type Mac-1 transfectants, showing that the I domain is required for maximal binding of Mac-1 to iC3b. The binding of I-less Mac-1 transfectants to iC3b was completely inhibited by the function-blocking β-propeller antibody CBRM1/32 and was unaffected by mAb CBRM1/1 to the I domain (Fig. 4 A). The binding of wild-type transfectants was blocked by both mAb CBRM1/32 to the β-propeller and mAb CBRM1/1 to the I domain, consistent with previous results (40.Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and with an important contribution by both domains to iC3b binding. The binding of wild-type Mac-1 to iC3b is dependent on divalent cations. Similarly, I-less Mac-1 bound to iC3b in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+, but not in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 4 B), showing that divalent cations are essential for the binding of I-less Mac-1 to iC3b. Wild-type and I-less Mac-1 on K562 cells bound to immobilized factor X, although, the binding of I-less Mac-1 was lower than that of wild-type Mac-1 (Fig. 4). The binding of I-less Mac-1 was inhibited by mAb CBRM1/32 to the β-propeller domain, but not by an I domain mAb. Binding by wild-type Mac-1 was inhibited by mAb to both the I domain and the β-propeller domain (Fig.5). In contrast to results with iC3b and factor X, binding to fibrinogen and denatured BSA was dependent on the Mac-1 I domain. I-less Mac-1 showed little or no binding to fibrinogen (Fig.6 A) and no binding to denatured BSA (Fig. 6 B), whereas wild-type Mac-1 showed robust binding. In agreement with this and in contrast to the results with iC3b and factor X, mAb CBRM1/32 to the β-propeller domain gave only partial inhibition of binding to fibrinogen and heat-denatured BSA (Fig. 6, A and B). The I domain mAb CBRM1/1 gave complete inhibition of binding to fibrinogen and denatured BSA. To test whether LFA-1 lacking the I domain can bind to ligands, stable K562 transfectants were examined for their ability to bind to purified ICAM-1 and ICAM-3. Without activation, wild-type LFA-1 on the surface of K562 cells showed little binding to either ICAM-1 or ICAM-3, as previously reported (53.Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Lub M. van Vliet S.J. Oomen S.P. Pieters R.A. Robinson M. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Activating mAbs differentially activated LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 and ICAM-3. Whereas all three of the activating antibodies CBR LFA1/2, Kim185, and Kim127 increased wild-type LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 (Fig. 7 A), only Kim127 enhanced LFA-1 binding to ICAM-3 (Fig. 7 B). However, the I-less LFA-1 mutant did not bind to ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 in the presence of activating mAbs. We further examined ligand binding by I-less LFA-1 in 293T cell transfectants, in which β2integrins are constitutively active. In the absence of activation, wild-type LFA-1 showed strong specific binding to ICAM-1, but little binding to ICAM-3; binding to ICAM-3 was greatly enhanced by the activating antibodies CBR LFA1/2, Kim185, and Kim127 (data not shown). In contrast to wild-type LFA-1, I-less LFA-1 expressed on 293T cells did not bind to ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 in the presence or absence of activating mAbs (data not shown). Thus, the I domain is essential for LFA-1 binding to its ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-3. We examined the role of the I domain in the folding, heterodimer formation, and ligand binding of the β2 integrins Mac-1 and LFA-1. In the absence of the I domain, the LFA-1 and Mac-1 α and β subunits were well expressed on the surface of transfected cells and formed heterodimers as shown by reactivity with mAbs to the α subunit β-propeller domain and the β subunit I-like domain that require α and β subunit association for reactivity (25.Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26.Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, association of the α and β subunits was demonstrated by coprecipitation with mAb directed against the αM and β2 subunits. The reactivity of multiple mAbs that recognize distinct epitopes in the β-propeller domain was of particular interest because the I domain is inserted between β-sheets 2 and 3 of the predicted β-propeller domain. The integrity of the β-propeller domain after deletion of the I domain is consistent with its predicted structure. Binding of mAbs that map to multiple segments C-terminal to the β-propeller domain in the Mac-1 α subunit was also unaffected by I domain deletion. Furthermore, binding of mAbs that recognize multiple epitopes in the β2 subunit I-like domain and cysteine-rich region was unaffected by I domain deletion. These results demonstrate that other domains in integrins fold independently of the I domain and complement previous results that the I domain folds independently of other integrin domains (25.Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27.Michishita M. Videm V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that multiple sites in Mac-1 contribute to ligand binding and that the importance of the I domain relative to other integrin domains is dependent on the ligand. We found that I-less Mac-1 can bind to iC3b, but the binding was reduced compared with wild-type Mac-1. Previous studies showed that iC3b can bind recombinant I domain (28.Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis results indicate that the I-like domain of the β2 subunit is also required for binding to iC3b (45.Bajt M.L. Goodman T. McGuire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on these data and our results, we hypothesize that there are ligand-binding sites both within and outside the I domain in Mac-1. Simultaneous binding to both of these sites in Mac-1 may generate strong binding to iC3b. Mac-1 can also bind to factor X in the absence of the I domain, although as with iC3b, the binding of I-less Mac-1 to factor X is much lower than that of wild-type Mac-1. Our results are consistent with the previous finding that recombinant I domain does not bind factor X (28.Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that at least one factor X-binding site is located outside the I domain. Although inhibition with mAb suggests that the I domain is important for binding to factor X, it appears that this binding is too weak to be detected with the isolated I domain. mAb to the Mac-1 I domain and mAb CBRM1/32 to the β-propeller domain each gave essentially complete inhibition of binding to iC3b and factor X. Although there was residual ligand binding after the I domain was deleted, the mAbs may give more complete inhibition by simultaneously restricting access to both the I domain and the top of the β-propeller domain. mAb CBRM1/32 recognizes the species-specific residue Arg534 in loop 2–3 at the top of β-sheet 6 (W6) in the predicted β-propeller (26.Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The I domain is inserted at the top of the β-propeller between W2 and W3 and is thus on the same “top” face of the β-propeller, an important ligand-binding interface for integrins that lack I domains (24.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 57.Irie A. Kamata T. Takada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7198-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We found that the I domain is essential for the binding of Mac-1 to fibrinogen and heat-denatured BSA. Deletion of the I domain completely abrogated the binding of Mac-1 to these ligands. Consistent with these data, mAb to the I domain completely blocked the binding of wild-type Mac-1 to fibrinogen and denatured BSA, and mAb to the β-propeller domain only partially inhibited binding. These data suggest that fibrinogen and heat-denatured BSA bind only to the I domain or that the I domain is more essential than secondary contacts elsewhere in the integrin. This is consistent with earlier studies showing that recombinant I domain binds fibrinogen with high affinity (28.Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our results and previous work with isolated I domains, we propose that there are at least three functionally distinct ligand-binding mechanisms for Mac-1. Some ligands such as iC3b have ligand-binding regions both within and outside the I domain, and these sites can independently bind the ligand. For other ligands including factor X, sites both within and outside the I domain contribute to ligand binding, but the I domain by itself cannot bind the ligand. Finally, for ligands including fibrinogen and denatured BSA, the I domain is essential for ligand binding. The β2 integrin LFA-1 binds to the Ig superfamily members ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-3 (19.Marlin S.D. Springer T.A.

Extensive mutagenesis studies have shown that several regions of LFA-1 are required for ligand binding, including the I domain and the β2 subunit I-like domain conserved region (41.Huang C.

Med. 1996; 183: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments with the isolated I domain demonstrated that efficient ligand binding requires other domains of the LFA-1 molecule (59.Knorr R. Dustin M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have used different expression systems and different cell types to analyze the binding of I-less LFA-1 to its ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-3. Our data show that I-less LFA-1 does not bind to ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 under multiple conditions that support wild-type LFA-1 binding. Leitinger and Hogg (60.Leitinger B. Hogg N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) independently reached the same conclusion using an I domain deletion of LFA-1 in a paper published while this manuscript was in review. These results suggest that the I domain is absolutely essential for ligand binding in LFA-1. However, our data do not exclude the role of other domains of the LFA-1 molecule in making additional contacts or in modulating I domain-mediated ligand binding. In summary, we have characterized the folding, heterodimer formation, and ligand binding of the β2 integrins Mac-1 and LFA-1 in the absence of their I domains. Our data show that the I domain is not essential for the proper folding, heterodimer formation, and surface expression of these integrins. I-less Mac-1 does bind some ligands such as iC3b and factor X, but it does not bind other ligands such as fibrinogen and denatured BSA. These results indicate that there are several different ligand-binding sites in Mac-1. In contrast, LFA-1 does not bind its ligands in the absence of the I domain, indicating that the I domain is a crucial ligand-binding site in LFA-1. This study underscores the complexity of ligand binding by these I domain-containing β2 integrins."
https://openalex.org/W2089930510,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are ubiquitous intracellular Ca2+ release channels whose functional characterization by transfection has proved difficult due to the background contribution of endogenous channels. In order to develop a functional assay to measure recombinant channels, we transiently transfected the rat type I IP3R into COS-7 cells. Saponin-permeabilized COS cells transfected with type I IP3R showed a 50% increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca2+ release at saturating [IP3] (10 μm) but no enhancement at subsaturating [IP3] (300 nm). However, cotransfection of the IP3R and human sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA)-2b ATPase cDNA resulted in 60 and 110% increases in Ca2+ release at subsaturating and saturating doses of IP3, respectively. IP3 or adenophostin A failed to release 45Ca2+ from microsomal vesicles prepared from cells expressing either type I IP3R or SERCA cDNAs alone. However, microsomal vesicles prepared from cells doubly transfected with IP3R and SERCA cDNAs released 33.0 ± 0.04% of the A23187-sensitive pool within 30 s of 1 μm adenophostin A addition. Similarly, the initial rate of 45Ca2+ influx into oxalate-loaded microsomal vesicles was inhibited by IP3 only when the microsomes were prepared from COS cells doubly transfected with SERCA-2b and IP3R DNA. The absence of a functional contribution from endogenous IP3Rs has enabled the use of this assay to measure the Ca2+ sensitivities of IP3-mediated45Ca2+ fluxes through recombinant neuronal type I (SII(+)), peripheral type I (SII(−)), and type III IP3Rs. All three channels displayed a biphasic dependence upon [Ca2+]cyt. Introduction of mutations D2550A and D2550N in the putative pore-forming region of the type I IP3R inhibited IP3-mediated45Ca2+ fluxes, whereas the conservative substitution D2550E was without effect. This assay therefore provides a useful tool for studying the regulatory properties of individual IP3R isoforms as well as for screening pore mutations prior to more detailed electrophysiological analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2011079503,"[18F]-2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) is a glucose analog currently utilized for positron emission tomography imaging studies in humans. FDG taken up by the liver is rapidly released. This property is attributed to elevated glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-Pase) activity. To characterize this issue we studied the relationship between Glc-6-Pase activity and FDG release kinetics in a cell culture system. We overexpressed the Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit in a Glc-6-Pase-deficient mouse hepatocyte (Ho-15) and in A431 tumor cell lines. Glc-6-Pase enzyme activity and FDG release rates were determined in cells transfected with the Glc-6-Pase gene (Ho-15-D3 and A431-AC3), in mock-transfected cells of both cell lines, and in wild-type mouse hepatocytes (WT10) as control. Although the highest level of Glc-6-Pase activity was measured in A431-AC3, Ho-15-D3 cells showed much faster FDG release rates. The faster FDG release correlated with the level of glucose 6-phosphate transporter (Glc-6-PT) mRNA, which was found to be expressed at higher levels in Ho-15 compared with A431 cells. Overexpression of Glc-6-PT in A431-AC3 produced a dramatic increase in FDG release compared with control cells. This study gives the first direct evidence that activity of the Glc-6-Pase complex can be quantified in vivo by measuring FDG release.

This enzyme is a key protein in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Its function is to dephosphorylate glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), so that free glucose can be transported out of cells and released into the blood. Thus, the activity of this enzyme controls liver glucose production. Defects of the Glc-6-Pase enzyme system cause glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD-1), which manifests with severe hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly caused by accumulation of glycogen. The Glc-6-Pase enzyme system is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and has multiple components (1.Chen Y.-T. Burchell A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 935-966Google Scholar). Current understanding of this system postulates that Glc-6-P is transported into the microsome by a Glc-6-P translocase (Glc-6-PT) (2.Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once inside the microsome, Glc-6-P is dephosphorylated by the Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit, and finally phosphate and glucose are transported out of the microsome via specific transport proteins (T2 and T3, respectively). The cDNA and gene for Glc-6-PT have been recently described (3.Lin B. Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Pan C.J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4.Pan C.J. Lin B. Chou J.Y. J. Biol.

[18F]-2-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) is a glucose analog currently utilized for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in humans. FDG uptake has been used for many years to measurein vivo regional glucose utilization (5.Phelps M.E. Huang S.C. Hoffman E.J. Selin C. Sokoloff L. Kuhl D.E. Ann. Neurol. 1979; 6: 371-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar). This tracer competes with glucose for phosphorylation by hexokinase or glucokinase. After it is phosphorylated, FDG-6-phosphate (FDGlc-6-P) does not undergo glycolysis. In tissues with elevated glucose metabolic rates, such as tumors, with low or absent dephosphorylating activity, FDGlc-6-P is trapped inside cells. This property allows for imaging of areas with increased FDG retention and has been extensively applied to visualize, stage, and monitor progression of tumors (6.Conti P.S. Lilien D.L. Hawley K. Keppler J. Grafton S.T. Bading J.R. Nucl. Med. Biol. 1996; 23: 717-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in organs such as the liver, FDG is taken up and rapidly released, presumably for the presence and activity of the Glc-6-Pase enzyme (7.Gallagher B.M. Fowler J.S. Gutterson N.I. MacGregor R.R. Wan C.N. Wolf A.P. J. Nucl. Med. 1978; 19: 1154-1161PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary data indicate that in patients with GSD-1, FDG is more avidly retained in the liver compared with normal subjects (8.Gjedde A. Wagner H. Szabo Z. Buchanan J.W. Principles of Nuclear Medicine. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1995: 54-71Google Scholar). The different steps in FDG metabolism, developed from the seminal work by Sokoloff and co-workers (9.Sokoloff L. Reivich M. Kennedy C. Des Rosiers M.H. Patlak C.S. Pettigrew K.D. Sakurada O. Shinohara M. J. Neurochem. 1977; 28: 897-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar, 10.Reivich M. Kuhl D. Wolf A. Greenberg J. Phelps M. Ido T. Casella V. Fowler J. Hoffman E. Alavi A. Som P. Sokoloff L. Circ. Res. 1979; 44: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) using [14C]deoxyglucose, can be described by the two tissue compartment model. Kinetic analysis of dynamic PET-FDG studies allows estimation of the rate constants for each step (Fig.1). The current understanding of FDG metabolism is that the k 4 parameter is tightly linked to the presence and activity of the Glc-6-Pase enzyme system. Therefore, in vivo measurement of k 4for FDG may provide a non-invasive quantitative method to evaluate liver Glc-6-Pase function and also be a tool to monitor the effectiveness of gene therapy in patients with GSD type 1. To characterize further this issue, we have analyzed the FDG turnover properties of cultured cells and verified if correlations exist between Glc-6-Pase activity and whole cell FDG release kinetics. We have studied three different cell lines as follows: A431, derived from a human epidermoid carcinoma; Ho-15 cells, derived from the liver of a Glc-6-Pase-deficient mouse (11.Lei K.J. Chen H. Pan C.J. Ward J.M. Mosinger Jr., B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); and a hepatocyte cell line derived from a normal mouse as control (WT10). In the first two cell lines we isolated clones that overexpress the Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit by transfection. Furthermore, A431 cells were also infected with a recombinant adenovirus containing the human Glc-6-PT cDNA (Ad-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG) to overexpress the Glc-6-PT. The Glc-6-Pase-deficient mouse hepatocyte cell line (Ho-15) and normal mouse hepatocyte cell line (WT10) were established by transformation of primary hepatocytes from a Glc-6-Pase-deficient mouse and a normal mouse, respectively, by the SV40 temperature-sensitive A255 virus (12.Chou J.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum and 100 nm dexamethasone at 34 °C (permissive temperature). In all experiments herein described, cells were placed in an incubator at 37 °C the night before use. A431 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C (13.Giard D.J. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. Arnstein P. Kersey J.H. Dosik H. Parks W.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). A431 cells were permanently transfected with the pCR3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) plasmid alone or containing the full coding sequence (nucleotides 65–1165, GenBankTM accession number U01120) for the human liver Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit. Transfected clones were established by selection in medium containing the neomycin analog G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., 75 μg/ml). Ho-15 were permanently transfected with the pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid (Invitrogen) containing the full coding sequence (nucleotides 46–1425, Gen Bank GenBankTM accession number U00445) for the mouse liver Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit. The need for a different construct was dictated by the fact that cells were derived from a knockout mouse and thus were constitutively neomycin-resistant. A parallel transfection with pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid alone was also performed. Transfected clones were established by selection in medium containing zeocin (Invitrogen, 100 μg/ml). Expression of the transfected gene in both cell lines was verified by Northern blot analysis. Fifteen μg of total RNA were denatured by heating at 65 °C for 15 min and loaded onto a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel containing ethidium bromide (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed for 2 h at 100 V. The ethidium signal was captured using a Molecular Dynamics 595 Fluorimager (Sunnyvale, CA), and the gel contents were subsequently transferred to nylon membranes using a Turboblotter apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). After UV cross-linking, the membranes were hybridized with the following 32P-labeled probes. For human β-actin an oligonucleotide complementary to bases 1101–1148 of the cDNA (GenBankTM accession number X00351) was used. For human Glc-6-Pase an oligonucleotide complementary to bases 1121–1165 of the cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberU01120) was used. For mouse Glc-6-Pase an oligonucleotide complementary to bases 1373–1417 of the cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U00445) was used. All oligonucleotide probes were labeled at the 5′-end. For the detection of mouse β-actin, the human cDNA plasmid purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was used after labeling by random priming. After hybridization the membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 70 °C, exposed overnight on imaging plates, and analyzed using a FUJI BAS-1500 PhosphorImager (Stamford, CT). All probes were tested on commercially available Northern blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) prior to use in the experiments reported. Alternatively, the presence of mouse Glc-6-Pase mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR, using standard procedures. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers as primers, and the PCR step was performed using 22-base oligonucleotides designed to amplify a 541-bp portion of the cDNA corresponding to bases 66–606 of the mouse Glc-6-Pase gene (GenBankTM accession numberU00445). The presence of mRNA for the Glc-6-PT protein in the A431 and Ho-15 cells was assessed by Northern blot. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method (15.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18 (5209): 5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was obtained by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to a Nytran membrane by electroblotting. The filters were hybridized at 62 °C in a buffer containing 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 8× Denhardt, 1% SDS, 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and a uniformly labeled mouse Glc-6-Pase, Glc-6-PT, or β-actin riboprobe. The hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG construct containing the eight-amino acid FLAG marker peptide, DYKDDDDK (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak Co.), at the N terminus of human Glc-6-PT has been described (4.Pan C.J. Lin B. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13865-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus containing the hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG (Ad-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG) carrying the viral E1-deleted mutation was generated through homologous recombination in 293 cells between a co-transfected linearized transfer vector (pAv6-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG) and the large ClaI fragment of wild-type adenoviral Ad5 as described previously (16.Engelhardt J.F. Ye X. Doranz B. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6196-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 17.Yang Y. Nunes F.A. Berencsi K. Gonczol E. Engelhardt J.F. Wilson J.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). pAv6-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG transfer vector contained the entire coding region (nucleotides 166–1486) of the human Glc-6-PT cDNA under the control of the RSV promoter. Overexpression of Glc-6-PT was achieved by infecting A431 cells or A431-AC3 cells for 24 h at 37 °C with lysates containing Ad-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG obtained from Ad-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG-infected 293 cells. The amounts of virus used were determined in preliminary experiments by testing Glc-6-PT protein production by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Scientific Imaging System) as described previously (4.Pan C.J. Lin B. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13865-13869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The immunocomplex was detected with the horseradish peroxidase-linked chemiluminescent system using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate obtained from Pierce. Northern blot analysis on total RNA was also performed to compare hGlc-6-PT mRNA expression before and after infection. Glc-6-Pase enzyme assays were performed by measuring the ability of fully disrupted microsomes to hydrolyze [3H]2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate ([3H]DGlc-6-P). Mouse liver microsomes were prepared as described previously from fresh tissue, disrupted, and stored frozen at −70 °C at a concentration of 10 mg of protein/ml (18.Banhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Microsomes from cultured cells were isolated with the same centrifugation procedure, disrupted, and resuspended in buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS, at pH 7.2. [3H]DGlc-6-P was synthesized incubating [3H]DG (1 mCi, 60 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) with 10 units/ml agarose-immobilized hexokinase in 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.6 containing 40 mm KCl, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at 33 °C in a shaking water bath. The hexokinase beads were separated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected and applied to AG 1X-8 resin (Bio-Rad). The columns were washed with water to remove unbound [3H]DG, and then [3H]DGlc-6-P was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl. The Glc-6-Pase assays were carried out at 33 °C in a total volume of 250 μl. Each sample contained 0.1 μCi of [3H]DGlc-6-P and microsomal protein at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. In the control samples no microsomal extract was added to determine background dephosphorylation. Between 5 and 60 min after addition of the radioactivity, aliquots of the mixture were collected and the reaction terminated by adding to 0.5 ml of 0.3 mZnSO4. After mixing, 0.5 ml of a saturated solution of Ba(OH)2 were added, and after vortexing the tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Aliquots of the supernatant were counted for each sample, and relative amounts of [3H]DG formed were determined (19.Fulceri R. Bellomo G. Gamberucci A. Benedetti A. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The rate of [3H]DGlc-6-P dephosphorylation is expressed as the background subtracted percentage of the initial [3H]DGlc-6-P present transformed per min. [18F]FDG was prepared in the NIH Cyclotron facility by standard means (20.Adams H.R. Channing M.A. Divel J.E. Dunn B.B. Kiesewetter D.O. Plascjak P. Regdos S.L. Simpson N.R. Eckelman W.C. Emran A. Chemists' Views of Imaging Centers. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 175-188Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 12-well multiwell plates at a density of 2.5 × 105/well and allowed to grow for 3 days. On the day of the experiment, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum, containing [18F]FDG (∼1 × 106 cpm/well) for 60 min. After 60 min one plate for each clone was washed twice with fresh medium and incubated for different times in cold medium containing 1 g/liter glucose (5.5 mm). At each time point triplicate wells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell-associated counts were recovered by lysing the cells in 1 m NaOH. Radioactivity in cells and medium was then determined for each sample. Protein concentrations in the cell extracts were monitored throughout the experiment to verify that cells were not detaching from the plate during the washes. Cell-associated radioactivity was plotted as the percent of the activity present at time 0 (end of uptake period). In separate experiments, cells were solubilized after extensive washing in 0.1 m NaOH at different times following the 60-min incubation in uptake medium. The fraction of intracellular FDGlc-6-P in these samples was determined with the ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2 method described above. Transfection of A431 cells with the plasmid containing the human Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit gene yielded numerous G418-resistant clones. In 13 clones Glc-6-Pase mRNA expression was determined. The positive clone with the highest level of Glc-6-Pase mRNA expression (A431-AC3) and one mock-transfected clone were selected for further characterization (Fig. 2). RT-PCR analysis of A431 wild-type (A431-WT) and A431-mock cells for the presence of human Glc-6-Pase mRNA was negative. The presence of mRNA for mouse Glc-6-Pase in WT10, used as control, was confirmed by RT-PCR (not shown). Glc-6-Pase enzyme activity was determined on fully disrupted microsomes prepared from A431-WT, A431-AC3, and A431-mock. Mouse liver tissue and WT10 hepatocytes were also measured as control (Fig.3). Values for A431-AC3 were 2.5-fold higher compared with mouse liver (1.08 ± 0.23%/min, mean ± S.D. versus 0.44 ± 0.05, respectively). Dephosphorylating activities in A431-WT and A431-mock were comparable to those found in background (control) tubes. Glc-6-Pase activity in WT10 was 5 times lower than in mouse liver. The FDG release kinetics for the A431 cells are shown in Fig.4 in comparison with WT10. Both A431-AC3 and A431-mock show slower release rates than the hepatocytes. The A431-AC3 showed only a slight increase in release rate, compared with the A431-mock clone (half-times were 230 and 300 min, respectively). Release rates in WT10 were much more rapid than in both these cells (half-time = 119 min). Transfection efficiency of the Ho-15 cell line with the mouse Glc-6-Pase-containing plasmid was very low. We obtained 8 zeocin-resistant clones; however, only 3 of these clones could be further characterized due to the poor growth of the remaining clones. Out of these 3, a single clone (Ho-15-D3) was found to express the mouse Glc-6-Pase mRNA. Transfection of Ho-15 with the mock plasmid yielded similar efficiency. A mock-transfected clone and the Ho-15-D3 underwent further analysis. Mouse Glc-6-Pase mRNA expression of these cell lines and of RNA extracted from mouse liver is shown in Fig.5. The level of mRNA expression in Ho-15-D3 cells is similar to that of mouse liver. Mouse Glc-6-Pase mRNA was not detectable in Ho-15-WT and mock-transfected cells by RT-PCR as well. Microsomal Glc-6-Pase enzyme activity was approximately 4 times lower in Ho-15-D3 cells compared with mouse liver (Fig.6). Compared with the Ho-15-WT and mock-transfected cells, however, values obtained in Ho-15-D3 cells were 3–4 times higher. Activity in Ho-15-D3 cells was very similar to that found for WT10 (see Fig. 3). FDG release in Ho-15-D3 is much more rapid compared with the mock-transfected clone (Fig. 7). Half-times were 120 and 361 min, respectively. In a separate experiment, a zeocin-resistant clone obtained by transfection with the mouse Glc-6-Pase containing plasmid (Ho-15-D1), in which Glc-6-Pase mRNA expression, however, was negative by Northern blot, showed release rates similar to those of the Ho-15-mock cells (not shown). The chemical form of intracellular FDG was determined in all cell lines tested. At the end of the uptake period, 95 ± 0.1% (mean ± S.D.) of intracellular radioactivity is in the form of FDGlc-6-P in both A431-mock and A431-AC3 cells. In Ho-15-mock and Ho-15-D3, these values were 97.4 ± 0.2 and 97.1 ± 0.2%, respectively. These ratios do not change with time, and 120 min after the uptake period, virtually all intracellular radioactivity is in the form of FDGlc-6-P in Ho-15-mock and Ho-15-D3 cells (99.5 ± 0.1% in both cell lines). A431 and Ho-15 cells, along with the respective transfected clones, were also tested for the expression of Glc-6-PT mRNA by Northern blot (Fig. 8). Expression in Ho-15 cells and Ho-15-D3 was found to be much higher than in A431 and A431-AC3 cells. To obtain higher levels of Glc-6-PT expression, A431-WT and A431-AC3 cells were infected with Ad-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis for the presence of the FLAG epitope (Fig. 9 A). The levels of expression of Glc-6-PT mRNA (Fig. 9 B) were considerably higher in infected compared with untreated cells. In A431-AC3 cells overexpressing Glc-6-PT, a dramatic increase in FDG release was observed compared with untreated A431-AC3 cells (Fig.10 A). The increase in FDG release rate was directly proportional to the amount of Ad-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG used for infection. There was no effect of Ad-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG infection on the FDG release of A431-WT cells (Fig.10 B).Figure 10A, FDG release in A431-AC3 cells 24 h after addition of Ad-hGlc-6-PT-5′FLAG at 1 (●), 0.1 (×), and 0.01× (▵) dilution, compared with untreated cells (○) (same titers as in Fig. 9).

FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) gives us the opportunity to better understand the effect of this enzyme system on FDG efflux kinetics. In the present study we have investigated the relationship between the presence of these factors and FDG release in whole cells. In our first approach to understanding the role of these proteins, we have analyzed the effect of Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit expression on FDG release from A431 cells. These cells are derived from a human epidermoid carcinoma. Cancer cells, in general, are believed to have low or absent Glc-6-Pase activity, which was confirmed in A431-WT cells by mRNA analysis (Fig. 2). Enzymatic activity in these cells, as assessed by the dephosphorylation assay, was similarly found to be very low compared with that measured in the mouse liver microsome preparation where Glc-6-Pase activity is known to be present. Overexpression by transfection of the human Glc-6-Pase mRNA in these cells was successful, and very high levels of expression were obtained in the A431-AC3 clone as proven both by the Northern blot experiment (Fig. 2) and the enzymatic activity assay (Fig. 3). However, release kinetics of FDG in these cells were not influenced by the presence of the Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit (Fig. 4). It is surprising to note that FDG release in A431-AC3 cells is much slower than in the WT10, even though A431-AC3 extracts show much higher dephosphorylating activity than the ones obtained from the hepatocytes. Furthermore, FDG release in A431-AC3 cells is only 30% faster than that found in the mock-transfected A431, indicating very little effect, if any, of the transfected protein on the FDG release process in these cells. These data are in agreement with the notion that for the Glc-6-Pase system to function it requires more than the catalytic unit alone (24.Burchell A. Allan B.B. Hume R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to believe that the other components of the Glc-6-Pase enzyme system are involved in Glc-6-Pase-dependent FDG release. These components must be present in liver-derived cells. Therefore, our next approach was to study how this protein affects FDG release in hepatocytes derived from a normal mouse and in hepatocytes derived from a Glc-6-Pase-deficient mouse (Ho-15) (11.Lei K.J. Chen H. Pan C.J. Ward J.M. Mosinger Jr., B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Comparison of the behavior of these two cell lines constitutes an optimal model for studying the effect of the Glc-6-Pase protein on FDG release. Glc-6-Pase activity is present in WT10, and it is present at higher levels compared with Ho-15 cells. In WT10, however, Glc-6-Pase activity is lower than in microsomes extracted directly from mouse liver. Glc-6-Pase activity can be reestablished in the Ho-15 cells by transfection, and the levels of Glc-6-Pase activity achieved in the Ho-15-D3 clone are similar to those found in WT10 (Figs. 3 and 6). FDG release rates of the mock-transfected Ho-15 cells are ∼3 times slower than in the Ho-15-D3 cells (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the release rates of the Ho-15-D3 cells are nearly identical to those measured for the WT10, indicating unequivocally the role of the Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit in promoting FDG release of these two liver-derived cell lines. Intracellular FDG was found to be virtually all in the form of FDGlc-6-P, in each of the cell lines tested. This suggests that the residence time of FDG intracellularly is very short and that the molecule is rapidly transported out of the cell if it is not in phosphorylated form, regardless of which cell line is being analyzed. These data support the relationship between the ability to dephosphorylate in Ho-15-D3 cells and the increased release rates of FDG, indicating that dephosphorylation is indeed controlling the release of radioactivity. Similar evidence is also provided by PET studies in humans (25.Choi Y. Hawkins R.A. Huang S.C. Brunken R.C. Hoh C.K. Messa C. Nitzsche E.U. Phelps M.E. Schelbert H.R. J. Nucl. Med. 1994; 35: 818-823PubMed Google Scholar). The k 2 rate constant for FDG in the liver has been found to be in the order of 1 min−1 (half-time of less than 1 min). Therefore, in vivo, the intracellular residence time of free FDG is very short as well. The overall release process is under the control of the k 4 parameter which is slower (0.014 min−1, half-time of approximately 50 min) indicating that the rate at which FDGlc-6-P is being transformed into FDG is controlling the release of radioactivity. The high level of expression of Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit in A431-AC3 cells and relatively unchanged FDG release rates compared with A431-WT cells may be explained by the fact that FDGlc-6-P does not come in contact with the catalytic unit at all. Other evidence is provided by the fact that intracellular radioactivity remains in phosphorylated form even though Glc-6-Pase activity is very high in the cellular extracts. In experimental studies in COS-1 cells, Glc-6-P transport into microsomes was found to be increased by simultaneous transfection of Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit and Glc-6-PT, rather than the overexpression of each protein individually, suggesting that adequate levels of both components of the system are required (26.Hiraiwa H. Pan C.J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The low levels of Glc-6-PT RNA expression in A431 cells, compared with Ho-15 hepatocytes (Fig. 8), suggest that inadequate amounts of Glc-6-PT protein produced in A431-AC3 cells may be the rate-limiting factor in FDG release. To test this hypothesis, the protein was overexpressed in A431-WT and A431-AC3 cells (Fig. 9). Our results show that FDG release in A431-AC3 cells, overexpressing Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit and Glc-6-PT, occurs at higher rates than in A431-WT cells, A431-WT cells overexpressing the Glc-6-PT alone, or A431-AC3 cells overexpressing the catalytic unit alone. These results show that simultaneous overexpression of Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit and Glc-6-PT in A431 cells is necessary to increase FDG release to levels similar to those measured in hepatocytes. Finally, our data show that FDG is released from all cells we tested at measurable rates even in the total absence of the Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit. In A431 cells, FDG is released with a half-time of 300 to 230 min (k = 0.002–0.003 min−1). In PET studies in humans,k 4 values for tissues with low Glc-6-Pase activity such as gray matter of the brain have been reported to be 0.0055 min−1 (half-time of approximately 126 min) (27.Reivich M. Alavi A. Wolf A. Fowler J. Russell J. Arnett C. MacGregor R.R. Shiue C.Y. Atkins H. Anand A. et al.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1985; 5: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of FDG both in vitro andin vivo, therefore, appears to be mediated at least in part by the action of Glc-6-Pase-independent mechanisms of FDGlc-6-P dephosphorylation. We have shown, for the first time, a direct dependence between FDGlc-6-P dephosphorylation and FDG release in cultured cells. Increasing Glc-6-Pase catalytic unit activity in A431 cells to higher levels than in mouse liver does not influence FDG release kinetics, whereas increasing activity in Ho-15 cells results in a dramatic increase in FDG release. When Glc-6-PT is expressed at higher levels in A431-AC3 cells, release of FDG is also increased. These data are in agreement with evidence that adequate levels of Glc-6-PT are necessary to preserve Glc-6-Pase-dependent hydrolysis and subsequent release of glucose-, DG-, or FDG-6P. These results support the use of dynamic PET-FDG liver imaging to study in vivo functional status of the entire Glc-6-Pase system. This non-invasive method may be of clinical value to monitor the effectiveness of gene therapy in patients with GSD-1.

https://openalex.org/W2035802964,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases stimulated by phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate (PMA) have been shown to inhibit interleukin-6-induced activation of STAT3 (Sengupta, T. K., Talbot, E. S., Scherle, P. A., and Ivashkiv, L. B. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 11107–11112). In the present study we demonstrate that in addition to STAT3, also tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, signal transducer gp130, and phosphotyrosine-phosphatase SHP2 underlies negative regulation by MAP kinases. Stimulation of Erks by basic fibroblast growth factor or a constitutively active mutant of Raf also led to down-regulation of STAT activity. Using chimeric receptor mutants we show that tyrosine 759 of glycoprotein 130 is crucial for the inhibitory effect of MAP kinases. Inhibition is also dependent on gene transcription and translation indicating that newly synthesized proteins are involved. Both PMA and basic fibroblast growth factor rapidly stimulate mRNA expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) and this induction is strongly reduced by an inhibitor of MAP kinase activation. Together with recent results demonstrating that SOCS-3 can bind in vitro to a phosphorylated tyrosine 759 peptide of glycoprotein 130 these data suggest SOCS-3 to be instrumental in the inhibition of the Janus kinase/STAT pathway by MAP kinases.

PIAS bind to activated STAT dimers and prevent STAT-mediated gene activation. How PIAS are regulated is currently unknown. A number of other mediators have been reported to down-regulate Jak/STAT activation, e.g. transforming growth factor β, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, and angiotensin II (14.Bright J.J. Sriram S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1772-1777PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sengupta T.K. Schmitt E.M. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was recently shown to inhibit IL-6-induced STAT3 activation via the Erk/MAP kinases (17.Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this inhibition, however, remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that PMA does not only inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 but also tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, gp130, and SHP2. The inhibitory effect of PMA was found to be strictly dependent on tyrosine 759, the known recruitment site for SHP2, of the IL-6 signal transducer gp130. Furthermore, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a physiological activator of MAP kinases (18.Geer v.d., P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar), negatively regulates IL-6-induced STAT activation in a similar fashion. Since both, PMA and bFGF, led to a rapid induction of SOCS-3 mRNA expression we propose that not only STAT activation but also activation of the MAP kinase pathway induces the expression of the inhibitory SOCS-3 protein thereby resulting in the down-regulation of the Jak/STAT pathway. PD98059 and SB202190 were from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Anisomycin, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide were from BIOMOL (Hamburg, Germany). PMA was purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany).

HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 mixture; COS-7 and NIH-3T3 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 5% CO2 in a water-saturated atmosphere. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 mg/liter), and penicillin (60 mg/liter). NIH-3T3 cells were serum-deprived 18 h before stimulation. Cells grown in a 100-mm dish to 80% confluence were preincubated with anisomycin (10 ng/ml), actinomycin D (1 μg/ml), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), PD98059 (10 μm), or SB202190 (10 μm) for 45 min followed by PMA (10−7m) or bFGF (10 ng/ml) treatment for 45 min.

The expression vector pSVL-Eg encoding the chimeric Epo/gp130 receptor was modified by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis leading to a Phe for Tyr-683 substitution.

COS-7 cells were transfected with 20 μg of total DNA by using standard calcium-phosphate precipitates. Cells were incubated with precipitate for 18 h, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in fresh medium for at least 8 h. Cells were then split and incubated for another 24 h.

The protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5% glycerol in 0.25-fold TBE (20 mm Tris, 20 mmboric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 20 V/cm for 4 h. Gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 80% water for 1 h, dried, and autoradiographed. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 15% glycerol) for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the cell lysates were incubated with specific antibodies at 4 °C for a minimum of 2 h. The immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose (5 mg/ml in lysis buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C. When monoclonal antibodies were used, rabbit anti-mouse IgG was bound to the protein A-Sepharose beads. After centrifugation, the Sepharose beads were washed three times with wash buffer (0.05% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 15% glycerol). The samples were boiled in gel electrophoresis sample buffer and the precipitated proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide (7.5 or 10%) gels. The following antibodies were used: anti-gp130 mouse monoclonal antibody (B-T12) (25.Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Roche C. Gu Z.J. Clement C. Klein B. Eur. J.

The electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes by the semidry Western blotting method. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in TBS-N (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 15 min. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies in TBS-N for 1 h. After extensive rinsing with TBS-N, blots were incubated with secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG, or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

HepG2 cells were grown on 60-mm dishes to 30% confluence and transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum using standard calcium phosphate precipitates, with 3.5 μg of reporter construct plasmid DNA (a 246-base pair upstream promotor fragment of the human α1-antichymotrypsin gene) (26.Kordula T.

Cells were incubated with the precipitate for 18 h, cultured in fresh medium for at least 8 h, and stimulated with IL-6 (100 units/ml) for an additional 18 h. Cell lysates were prepared and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was measured according to manufacturers instructions (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities. Total RNA was isolated from cultured NIH-3T3 cells using the total RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gel electrophoresis and Northern blot analyses were performed with 15 μg of total RNA as described in Ref. 27.Gatsios P. Haubeck H.D. Van de Leur E. Frisch W. Apte S.S. Greiling H. Heinrich P.C.

Burchert-Graeve, Aachen, Germany). The inhibition by PMA of the IL-6-induced STAT activation was studied in human hepatoma cells (HepG2). After pretreatment with 0.1 μm PMA for 45 min IL-6 (100 units/ml) was added for 15 min. Activation of STAT1 and STAT3 requires phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, i.e. Tyr-701 in STAT1 and Tyr-705 in STAT3. Thus, we performed Western blot analyses of nuclear extracts using specific antibodies against the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT3 (Fig. 1 A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of both, STAT1 and STAT3, was induced by IL-6 and clearly decreased upon PMA pretreatment (Fig. 1 A). PMA incubation alone did not result in STAT activation. These results confirm recent findings with respect to STAT3 (17.Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and show that also STAT1 activation is affected by PMA. EMSA revealed that the reduced STAT phosphorylation results in a strongly diminished binding of STAT1 and STAT3 to the STAT1/3-specific SIE probe (Fig.1 B). Inhibition of STAT activation by PMA was partially reversed by the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of PMA requires the activation of MAP kinases as recently proposed (17.Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Inhibition was not reversed by the specific p38 kinase inhibitor SB202190 (data not shown). We have shown that after PMA treatment the IL-6 receptor is rapidly released from the cell surface of transfected COS-7 cells and primary human monocytes by shedding, i.e. limited proteolysis of the membrane-bound receptor form (28.Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Günther M. Graeve L. Buse G. Mackiewicz A. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This raises the question whether the observed inhibition of the IL-6-induced STAT activation by PMA is due to a loss of IL-6-binding sites at the cell surface. In order to exclude this possibility, COS-7 cells, which endogenously express only gp130 but not the IL-6 receptor, were pretreated with PMA for 45 min and then stimulated with a combination of IL-6 and a recombinant soluble IL-6 receptor. The soluble IL-6 receptor has been shown to act agonistically on cells that express only gp130 (29.Mackiewicz A. Schooltink H. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2021-2027PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 C, the inhibitory effect of PMA on the IL-6 response was also observed in COS-7 cells which suggests that shedding of the IL-6 receptor is not involved. Similar results were obtained in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, surface expression of gp130 was not affected by PMA. 2S. Thiel and L. Graeve, unpublished observation. In order to analyze which members of the MAP kinase family are activated by PMA treatment, HepG2 (Fig. 2 A) and COS-7 (Fig. 2 B) cells were treated with PMA for 0–180 min upon which total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analyses using antibodies specific for the activated forms of MAP kinases. These antibodies only recognize MAP kinases that are phosphorylated at threonine and tyrosine residues in a characteristic Thr-X-Tyr motif. In both cell types activated Erk2 and to a minor extent Erk1 were detected after 5 min. Maximal activation was observed at 30 min (Fig. 2, left panel). In contrast, a negligible activation of JNKs and p38 was observed. Anisomycin, a known activator of all three MAP kinases, led to the phosphorylation of all three MAP kinase family members (Fig. 2, right panel). These data demonstrate that the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 by PMA parallels the inhibitory effect on STAT activation. Interestingly, anisomycin did not inhibit STAT activation by IL-6 (data not shown). This could be explained by the fact that after anisomycin treatment activation of Erk1/2 was less pronounced (compare left and right panels in Fig. 2, A and B). Alternatively, co-activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinases might counteract the inhibitory effect of Erk1/2. Such a possibility is supported by our recent finding that p38 activation is necessary for STAT activation upon hyperosmotic shock (30.Bode J.G. Gatsios P. Ludwig S. Rapp U. Häussinger D. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30222-30227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Erk1 and Erk2 are activated by MAP kinase kinase-1/2 which in turn become phosphorylated by an activated Raf kinase (31.Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Therefore, we overexpressed a constitutively active form of Raf (Raf-BxB (21.Hoffmeyer A. Grosse-Wilde A. Flory E. Neufeld B. Kunz M. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4319-4327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) in COS-7 cells and studied its effect on STAT activation (Fig. 3 A). In this experiment, activation of STAT1 was achieved by co-expression of an erythropoietin receptor/gp130 chimera (Eg) and stimulation with Epo. This chimera consists of the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts of gp130 and allows us to study the activation of STAT factors in transfected cells independently of the endogenous gp130 (5.Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Raf-BxB (Fig. 3 B, left panel) resulted in a strong inhibition of the Epo-induced STAT1 signal (Fig. 3 A) and in the activation of Erk2 (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). In addition, expression of a reporter gene under the control of the IL-6 responsive promoter of the human α1-antichymotrypsin gene (26.Kordula T. Rydel R.E. Brigham E.F. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4112-4118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was strongly diminished in cells expressing Raf-BxB (Fig. 3 C). Expression of the Eg chimera with an expected molecular mass of ∼68 kDa was not affected by co-expression of Raf-BxB (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Thus, also activation of the Erk2 kinase by constitutively active Raf results in an inhibition of the Jak/STAT pathway. The level at which PMA inhibits the Jak/STAT pathway is not clear. Sengupta et al. (17.Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) demonstrated a small decrease in Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation upon PMA pretreatment. In order to assess whether the signal transducer gp130 is also affected in its tyrosine phosphorylation we pretreated HepG2 cells with PMA for 45 min and then stimulated them with IL-6 for 15 min. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against gp130 and Western blot analysis was performed with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. Upon IL-6 stimulation tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 was increased about 6-fold. PMA inhibited the IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 by about 60% (Fig.4 A). Similar experiments were performed to investigate the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the phosphatase SHP2 which is known to contribute to the IL-6-induced signaling although its specific function remains to be elucidated (7.Schaper F.

SHP2 was proposed to be a gp130-associated adaptor connecting the signal transducer to Grb2 thereby linking the Jak/STAT to the MAP kinase pathway (8.Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 is increased in response to IL-6 in a Jak1-dependent manner (7.Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). PMA treatment of HepG2 cells resulted in a time-dependent decrease (maximal inhibition after 60 min) of the IL-6-induced SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). Together with the data of Sengupta et al. (17.Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) these findings show that tyrosine phosphorylation of all components of the Jak/STAT cascade (gp130, Jaks, SHP2, and STATs) is affected by PMA. Activation of STATs and SHP2 requires prior phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 which then recruit these proteins via their intrinsic SH2 domains (4.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 5.Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U.

To analyze the importance of specific tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic part of gp130 for the PMA effect, we again made use of Eg chimeric receptor mutants (5.Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). Stimulation of COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type Eg-chimera led to the activation of STAT1 which is diminished upon preincubation with PMA (Fig.5 B, first panel). Activation of STAT3 is consistently not observed in these cells unless overexpressed (5.Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A chimeric construct Egγ440 containing only the Jak-binding sites (box 1 and box 2) of gp130 and the tyrosine module YDKPH of the interferon γ receptor crucial for the activation of STAT1 via interferon γ, however, resulted in a STAT1 activation that was resistant to pretreatment with PMA (Fig. 5 B, fourth panel). This suggests that the activity of Jak kinases is not directly affected by PMA treatment and that sequences downstream of box 1 and box 2 of the cytoplasmic tail of gp130 are necessary for the inhibitory effect of PMA. To further analyze the role of specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic part of gp130 we took advantage of the EgY759F chimera, in which phenylalanine is substituted for Tyr-759 of gp130 (7.Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Tyr-759 is required for the recruitment and activation of SHP2 (4.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Epo-induced STAT1 activation was not inhibited by PMA in cells expressing EgY759F (Fig. 5 B, second panel). In contrast, substitution of phenylalanine for Tyr-683 (EgY683F) did not affect the inhibitory effect induced by PMA (Fig. 5 B, right panel). This finding suggests that Tyr-759 within the cytoplasmic part of gp130 plays an essential role in the inhibition of STAT activation by PMA. The FGF receptor as a receptor tyrosine kinase is known to activate the MAP kinase cascade upon FGF binding (18.Geer v.d., P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). To examine also whether this physiological stimulus leads to an inhibitory effect on STAT signaling, we studied NIH-3T3 cells which endogenously express FGF receptors. Upon stimulation with bFGF we detected Erk2 activation after 15 min which was transient and diminished after 30 min (Fig.6 A). Activation of JNKs and p38 was not observed (data not shown). Incubation of NIH-3T3 cells with bFGF or PMA prior to stimulation with IL-6/sgp80 resulted in an inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT activation (Fig. 6 B). Also in the case of bFGF, the observed inhibition was sensitive to the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 6 C). In order to determine whether the inhibitory effect on STAT activation of PMA or bFGF necessitates de novomRNA and protein synthesis we preincubated HepG2 and NIH-3T3 cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, inhibitors of mRNA or protein synthesis, respectively. Cells pretreated with actinomycin D (Fig.7 A) or cycloheximide (Fig.7 B) showed a partial reversal of the inhibitory PMA/bFGF effect indicating that this inhibitory mechanism is, at least in part, mediated by the expression of newly induced genes. Recently, it was reported that IL-6 stimulation results in the induction of SOCS-3 gene expression, a feedback inhibitor of the Jak/STAT pathway (11.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). In order to study whether SOCS-3 might play a role in the inhibition of IL-6 signaling by PMA and bFGF, Northern blot analyses were performed with RNA from NIH-3T3 cells stimulated with IL-6/sgp80, PMA, or bFGF for 45 min. As shown in Fig. 8 A, not only IL-6/sgp80 but also PMA and bFGF induce the expression of SOCS-3 mRNA. No increase of SOCS-1 mRNA could be detected (data not shown). To analyze whether the SOCS-3 induction by PMA and bFGF is sensitive to inhibition of Erk activation we again made use of the MEK inhibitor PD98059. NIH-3T3 cells were pretreated with PD98059 for 45 min before stimulation with PMA or bFGF for an additional 45 min and Northern blot analyses were performed. The induction of SOCS-3 mRNA levels by PMA and bFGF was largely reversed upon pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 8 B). This study presents a number of novel findings with respect to the molecular mechanism of PMA-induced and Erk-dependent down-regulation of the Jak/STAT pathway. First, a physiological activator of MAP kinases, namely bFGF, also results in a down-modulation of STAT activity. Second, transcription and translation are at least in part essential for the inhibition of the IL-6-induced STAT activation by PMA/bFGF. Third, both PMA and bFGF rapidly induce SOCS-3 mRNA expression in a MEK-dependent manner. And finally, the PMA-induced inhibition is dependent on Tyr-759 of the cytoplasmic part of the IL-6 signal transducer gp130. Our findings strongly suggest that prestimulation of cells with activators of MAP kinases such as PMA or bFGF inhibits a subsequent STAT activation by IL-6 via the rapid induction of the negative feedback inhibitor SOCS-3. Such a model is consistent with the dependence of the inhibitory effect on de novo transcription and protein synthesis. It is, furthermore, supported by the fact that both, the inhibition of STAT activation and the induction of SOCS-3, are largely reversed by the action of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Recently, we could demonstrate in monocytic cells that activators of the MAP kinase p38, namely lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-α, inhibit a subsequent STAT activation by IL-6 (33.Bode J.G. Nimmesgern A. Schmitz J. Schaper F. Schmitt M. Frisch W. Häussinger D. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This inhibition was also paralleled by a rapid SOCS-3 induction which in this case was sensitive to inhibition of p38. Interestingly, in rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells tumor necrosis factor-α neither down-modulate STAT activation nor induce SOCS-3. Thus, in all experimental systems in which activation of MAP kinases resulted in an inhibition of the Jak/STAT pathway, SOCS-3 induction was observed. Although this is only a correlation, it strongly argues for a crucial role of SOCS-3 as a mediator of MAP kinase-dependent Jak/STAT inhibition. Final proof of our model would require the specific inhibition of SOCS-3 induction by antisense technology or gene knock-out. Unfortunately, SOCS-3 knock-out mice die at days 12–16 of embryonic development (34.Marine J.C. McKay C. Wang D. Topham D.J. Parnagas E. Nakajima H. Pendeville H. Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1999; 98: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The murine SOCS-3 promotor has recently been cloned and a STAT1/3-binding site was identified and shown to be necessary for the induction of SOCS-3 by leukemia inhibitory factor (35.Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6964-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our data (this study and Ref. 33.Bode J.G. Nimmesgern A. Schmitz J. Schaper F. Schmitt M. Frisch W. Häussinger D. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) as well as recent results from other groups (36.Stoiber D. Kovarik P. Cohney S. Johnston J.A. Steinlein A. Decker T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2640-2647PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Mao Y. Ling P.R. Fitzgibbons T.P. McCowen K.C. Frick G.P. Bistrian B.R. Smith R.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5505-5515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest also that binding sites for MAP kinase-activated transcription factors such as TCF and Elk-1 (38.Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) must exist within the SOCS-3 regulatory region. Overexpression of c-Jun and c-Fos had no effect, suggesting that transcription factors different from AP-1 are involved in this induction. 3P. Gatsios, unpublished observation. Since IL-6 does not only activate the Jak/STAT pathway but also the MAP kinase pathway our results further imply that induction of SOCS-3 mRNA expression by IL-6 is due to the synergistic effect of activated STATs and MAP kinase-dependent transcription factors. This could explain why IL-6 is a more potent inducer of SOCS-3 than PMA or bFGF which do not activate STATs (Fig. 8 A). It should be pointed out that induction of SOCS-3 by PMA/bFGF is only incompletely inhibited by the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 indicating also that Erk1/2-independent pathways are involved in this induction. Why does the inhibition of STAT activation by PMA depend on Tyr-759 of the cytoplasmic part of the IL-6 signal transducer gp130? Tyr-759 is one of the five tyrosine residues which have been demonstrated to act as recruitment sites for signaling molecules. Whereas STAT3 and STAT1 are recruited to phosphotyrosine residues with the consensus sequence YXXQ and YXPQ, respectively, the YSTV motif of Tyr-759 was described to bind the SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (4.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 5.Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U.

However, in our study the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2, which is believed to increase its catalytic activity (39.Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), is also inhibited by PMA making an involvement of SHP2 in our scenario unlikely. Schmitz et al. (40.Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12848-12856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that Tyr-759 of gp130 is necessary for the inhibitory effect of overexpressed SOCS-3 on the STAT-responsive α2-macroglobulin promoter in HepG2 cells. They could further show that SOCS-3 protein in vitro binds to a phosphorylated Tyr-759 containing peptide and that a recombinant SH2 domain of SOCS-3 interacts with this phosphopeptide (40.Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12848-12856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that SOCS-3, whether overexpressed or induced by PMA/bFGF, exerts its inhibitory effect by binding to phosphorylated Tyr-759 of gp130. How SOCS-3 blocks the activity of Jak kinases and the phosphorylation of STATs remains unclear. SOCS-1 was found to bind to phosphorylated Tyr-1007 in the activation loop of Jak2 (41.Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The N-terminal located kinase inhibitory region of SOCS-1 also contributed to this binding and was essential for Jak2 kinase inhibitory activity. A similar mechanism was proposed for SOCS-3. However, compared with SOCS-1, the affinity of its SH2 domain for Jak2 is weaker whereas that of its kinase inhibitory region is stronger (42.Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Suzuki A. Kamizono S. Syoda T. Kinjyo I. Sasaki M. Johnston J.A. Yoshimura A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Our model suggests that SOCS-3 can exert its inhibitory effect not only by binding directly to Jaks but also by binding to the receptor chain (Fig.9).

In the earlyCaenorhabditis elegans embryo, endodermal (intestinal) fates are specified by GATA family transcription factors (END-1, END-3, ELT-2) that are related to those that mediate endoderm development inDrosophila (Serpent) and vertebrates (GATA-4/5/6) (1.Zhu J.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1061-1075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The presence of consensus SKN-1-binding sites adjacent to the end-1 gene along with the timing of its expression suggests that SKN-1 may activateend-1 directly (2.Zhu J. Hill R.J. Heid P.J. Fukuyama M. Sugimoto A. Priess J.R. Rothman J.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2883-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).

A basic DNA-binding region at the SKN-1 COOH terminus is particularly similar to those of CNC proteins, but SKN-1 lacks a zipper dimerization domain (Fig. 1, A and C) and, uniquely, binds DNA as a monomer (4.Blackwell T.K.

These similarities and differences pose the question of whether SKN-1- and CNC-related proteins simply bind DNA through related but divergent mechanisms or might share a closer functional relationship.Like SKN-1, many CNC proteins are involved in the development or function of endodermal or mesodermal cells. DrosophilaCNC is required for specification of pharyngeal segments (10.Mohler J. Mahaffey J.W. Deutsch E. Vani K.

Supporting the idea that some CNC protein functions might parallel those of SKN-1, neither they nor their dimerization partners, the Maf basic leucine zipper proteins (18.Blank V. Andrews N.C.

(20.Shi Y. Mello C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). p300/CBP proteins are metazoan histone acetyltransferases that are involved in developmental and inducible gene expression and that are recruited by numerous activators (21.Shikama N.X. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), including the CNC protein p45NF-E2 (22.Cheng X. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). C. elegans CBP-1 is required for specification of all non-neuronal embryonic developmental lineages (20.Shi Y. Mello C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Endodermal differentiation can be restored in embryos that lack either CBP-1 or SKN-1, however, by inhibition of histone deacetylases (20.Shi Y. Mello C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This suggests that in the endoderm, SKN-1 might recruit the CBP-1 histone acetyltransferase activity directly. It remains possible, nevertheless, that lack of histone deacetylases simply restores expression of downstream genes independently of possible histone acetyltransferase recruitment by SKN-1.We have addressed these issues by investigating how SKN-1 regulates transcription. C. elegans cell lines have not been developed, but given the conservation of the eukaryotic mRNA transcription machinery (23.Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SKN-1 would be predicted to be active in mammalian cells. Using transfection assays, we show here that SKN-1 is a powerful activator of transcription that contains three transactivation domains. The functional core of one domain consists of a short sequence (the DIDLID element) (Fig. 1 B) that is specific to SKN-1-related proteins and to the NRF group of CNC proteins. The p300/CBP proteins appear to be direct cofactors of SKN-1, but not to be critical for the activity of the DIDLID element. The conservation and transcriptional function of the DIDLID element suggest that SKN-1 and the NRF CNC proteins share a common transcriptional protein target in addition to p300/CBP and, during evolution, may have maintained some parallel functions in endodermal cells.DISCUSSIONThe presence of a DNA-binding domain in SKN-1 (4.Blackwell T.K. Bowerman B. Priess J. Weintraub H. Science. 1994; 266: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and its localization to nuclei (36.Bowerman B. Draper B.W. Mello C. Priess J. Cell. 1993; 74: 443-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) suggested previously that SKN-1 is likely to regulate transcription. We have shown here that SKN-1 is a potent activator of transcription when it binds its cognate site (Fig. 2). SKN-1 interacts with two regions of human p300 in vitro(Fig. 5 A), and p300/CBP proteins contribute to its activity (Fig. 5, B and C). Given the extensive similarity between p300/CBP proteins and their C. elegans ortholog CBP-1, these data support the model that SKN-1 may recruit CBP-1 directly to promoters as a cofactor in vivo (20.Shi Y. Mello C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p300 potentiated SKN-1 activation of domains B and C (Fig. 5 D), suggesting that it can be recruited directly or indirectly by them. Domain B was not inhibited by E1A mutants in which binding to either p300/CBP (p300mut) or PCAF (E55) in particular was impaired (Fig. 5 E), implicating each of these histone acetyltransferases in its activity. Domain C was partially inhibited by these E1A mutants (Fig. 5 E), however, suggesting either that it may require both histone acetyltransferases simultaneously or might act on an independent E1A target. The activity of domain A, which contains the DIDLID element (Fig. 1 A), was not enhanced significantly by p300 expression (Fig. 5 D), and was inhibited by E1A p300mut (Fig. 5E), suggests that it has a target that is distinct from p300/CBP.The conservation of the DIDLID element across evolution (Fig. 1,B and C) supports the model that SKN-1 and the CNC proteins evolved from a common precursor (4.Blackwell T.K. Bowerman B. Priess J. Weintraub H. Science. 1994; 266: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This conservation is particularly striking because the DIDLID motif is separate from the DNA-binding domain and was maintained despite divergences in how these proteins bind DNA (Fig. 1 C). Point mutants in the DIDLID element dramatically decreased SKN-1-driven transcription in mammalian cells (Fig. 4 A), supporting the idea that it mediates a highly specific interaction that is common to these proteins. In apparent contrast to our findings, an NRF2 fragment that contained the DIDLID element appeared to lack transcriptional activity in Gal4 fusion assays (29.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). This particular NRF2 fragment also included the inhibitory domain that can retain NRF2 in the cytoplasm (29.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar), however, suggesting that in this context, the DIDLID element might have been masked or not present in the nucleus.Our findings suggest that SKN-1 and CNC proteins may have preserved some parallel functions in the endoderm and mesoderm. Also supporting this idea, in all of these proteins, hydrophobic residues on the CNC region surface are conserved that are not predicted to influence folding or DNA binding, but instead form a pocket, suggesting a common protein-protein interaction (8.Rupert P.B. Daughdrill G.W. Bowerman B. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The CNC protein most analogous to SKN-1 may be NRF1, which contains DIDLID (Fig. 1, B andC) and appears to be involved in endodermal and mesodermal differentiation and regulation of detoxification genes (13.Farmer S.C. Sun C.W. Winnier G.E. Hogan B.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 16.Kwong M. Kan Y.W. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37491-37498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest a particularly intriguing possibility, that the little understood requirement for SKN-1 to maintain the viability of differentiated intestinal cells (5.Bowerman B. Eaton B.A. Priess J.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1061-1075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) might involve functions that parallel the role of the NRF1 and NRF2 proteins in antioxidant responses. During development, establishment of cell fates frequently involves conserved regulatory pathways. In the earlyCaenorhabditis elegans embryo, endodermal (intestinal) fates are specified by GATA family transcription factors (END-1, END-3, ELT-2) that are related to those that mediate endoderm development inDrosophila (Serpent) and vertebrates (GATA-4/5/6) (1.Zhu J. Fukushige T. McGhee J.D. Rothman J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3809-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2.Zhu J. Hill R.J. Heid P.J. Fukuyama M. Sugimoto A. Priess J.R. Rothman J.H.

This program is triggered by maternally expressed SKN-1, a predicted transcription factor (4.Blackwell T.K. Bowerman B. Priess J. Weintraub H. Science. 1994; 266: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that also specifies mesodermal lineages (pharynx and some body wall muscle) (5.Bowerman B. Eaton B.A. Priess J.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1061-1075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The presence of consensus SKN-1-binding sites adjacent to the end-1 gene along with the timing of its expression suggests that SKN-1 may activateend-1 directly (2.Zhu J. Hill R.J. Heid P.J. Fukuyama M. Sugimoto A. Priess J.R. Rothman J.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2883-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). SKN-1 is also required in the endoderm post-embryonically, to prevent differentiated intestinal cells from undergoing severe atrophy (5.Bowerman B. Eaton B.A. Priess J.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1061-1075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Apparent SKN-1 orthologs have not been identified outside of nematodes, but in its DNA-binding region, SKN-1 is related to a subgroup of basic leucine zipper transcription factors (4.Blackwell T.K. Bowerman B. Priess J. Weintraub H. Science. 1994; 266: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5.Bowerman B. Eaton B.A. Priess J.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 1061-1075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the CNC1 proteins. A basic DNA-binding region at the SKN-1 COOH terminus is particularly similar to those of CNC proteins, but SKN-1 lacks a zipper dimerization domain (Fig. 1, A and C) and, uniquely, binds DNA as a monomer (4.Blackwell T.K. Bowerman B. Priess J. Weintraub H. Science. 1994; 266: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Its DNA binding requires the adjacent α-helical “CNC region” (Fig. 1, A andC) (4.Blackwell T.K. Bowerman B. Priess J. Weintraub H. Science. 1994; 266: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6.Carroll A.S. Gilbert D.E. Liu X. Cheung J.W. Michnowicz J.E. Wagner G. Ellenberger T.E. Blackwell T.K.

Biol. 1998; 5: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is otherwise found only in CNC proteins. An adjacent SKN-1 element that is lacking in CNC proteins, the NH2-terminal arm (Fig. 1, A and C), contributes additional binding affinity and specificity (6.Carroll A.S. Gilbert D.E. Liu X. Cheung J.W. Michnowicz J.E. Wagner G. Ellenberger T.E. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9.Kophengnavong T. Carroll A.S. Blackwell T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3039-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These similarities and differences pose the question of whether SKN-1- and CNC-related proteins simply bind DNA through related but divergent mechanisms or might share a closer functional relationship. Like SKN-1, many CNC proteins are involved in the development or function of endodermal or mesodermal cells. DrosophilaCNC is required for specification of pharyngeal segments (10.Mohler J. Mahaffey J.W. Deutsch E. Vani K. Development. 1995; 121: 237-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and vertebrate p45NF-E2 is involved in hematopoiesis (11.Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In mice, different knockouts of the Nrf1(NF-E2 relatedfactor-1; also LCRF-1/TC11) gene either cause a fetal liver microenvironment defect (12.Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Lu R. Chang J. Wang B. Yen T.S. Kan Y.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or appear to block cell-to-cell induction of the mesoderm, a function usually ascribed to endodermal cells (13.Farmer S.C. Sun C.W. Winnier G.E. Hogan B.L. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both NRF1 and NRF2 directly induce expression of detoxification enzymes (14.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar, 15.Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K.

Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). Supporting the idea that some CNC protein functions might parallel those of SKN-1, neither they nor their dimerization partners, the Maf basic leucine zipper proteins (18.Blank V. Andrews N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 19.Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), appear to be encoded in the complete C. elegans genome (data not shown). Genetic evidence suggests that SKN-1 may interact functionally with CBP-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the p300/CBP transcription coactivators. (20.Shi Y. Mello C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). p300/CBP proteins are metazoan histone acetyltransferases that are involved in developmental and inducible gene expression and that are recruited by numerous activators (21.Shikama N.X. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), including the CNC protein p45NF-E2 (22.Cheng X. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). C. elegans CBP-1 is required for specification of all non-neuronal embryonic developmental lineages (20.Shi Y. Mello C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Endodermal differentiation can be restored in embryos that lack either CBP-1 or SKN-1, however, by inhibition of histone deacetylases (20.Shi Y. Mello C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This suggests that in the endoderm, SKN-1 might recruit the CBP-1 histone acetyltransferase activity directly. It remains possible, nevertheless, that lack of histone deacetylases simply restores expression of downstream genes independently of possible histone acetyltransferase recruitment by SKN-1. We have addressed these issues by investigating how SKN-1 regulates transcription. C. elegans cell lines have not been developed, but given the conservation of the eukaryotic mRNA transcription machinery (23.Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SKN-1 would be predicted to be active in mammalian cells.

The p300/CBP proteins appear to be direct cofactors of SKN-1, but not to be critical for the activity of the DIDLID element. The conservation and transcriptional function of the DIDLID element suggest that SKN-1 and the NRF CNC proteins share a common transcriptional protein target in addition to p300/CBP and, during evolution, may have maintained some parallel functions in endodermal cells.

https://openalex.org/W1976382957,"Accumulating evidence demonstrates that cytokine receptor signaling is negatively regulated by a family of Src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor molecules termed SOCS (suppressor of cytokinesignaling). Previous studies have indicated that the expression of SOCS-related molecules is tightly controlled at the level of transcription. Furthermore, it has been reported that SOCS polypeptides are relatively unstable in cells, unless they are associated with elongins B and C. Herein, we document the existence of a third mechanism of regulation of SOCS function. Our data showed that expression of SOCS-1, a member of the SOCS family, is strongly repressed at the level of translation initiation. Structure-function analyses indicated that this effect is mediated by the 5′ untranslated region of socs-1 and that it relates to the presence of two upstream AUGs in this region. Further studies revealed thatsocs-1 translation is cap-dependent and that it is modulated by eIF4E-binding proteins. In combination, these results uncover a novel level of regulation of SOCS-related molecules. Moreover, coupled with previous findings, they suggest that SOCS expression is tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms, in order to avoid inappropriate interference with cytokine-mediated effects.

For example, they are required for normal hemopoietic cell development and immunity. Moreover, they participate in the pathophysiology of various autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Cytokines mediate their biological effects by binding to specific transmembrane receptors on target cells. As is the case for many other receptors, engagement of these receptors triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, including the cytokine receptors themselves, members of the Jak family of protein-tyrosine kinases, and the STAT transcription factors. Since cytokine receptors are devoid of intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity, these phosphorylation events necessitate the participation of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases. Accumulating data show that receptor-associated Jak kinases are activated upon ligand stimulation, thus allowing tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent recruitment and activation of Src homology 2 domain-containing effectors such as the STATs. Given the deleterious consequences of excessive cytokine stimulation, there has been significant interest in identifying mechanisms restricting their effects. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and possibly its relative SHP-2 have been shown to play important roles in this process, by dephosphorylating the cytokine receptors and the Jak kinases (4.Yi T. Mui A.L. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Symes A. Stahl N. Reeves S.A. Farruggella T. Servidei T. Gearan T. Yancopoulos G. Fink J.S. Curr.

Additionally, a new group of molecules termed PIAS (protein inhibitor of activatedSTAT) was found to inhibit STAT function by interfering with their ability to bind DNA (7.Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B.

S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Finally, members of the SOCS (suppressor of cytokinesignaling) family of adaptor molecules (also referred to as the CIS or SSI family) were reported to be potent negative regulators of cytokine receptor signaling, in part through their capacity to bind and inactivate Jak kinases (9.Yoshimura A.

Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The SOCS family is comprised of at least eight distinct members (13.Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These molecules share a common structure including a variable amino-terminal region, a central Src homology 2 domain, and a conserved carboxyl-terminal motif termed the SOCS box. Several observations support the idea that SOCS are negative regulators of cytokine receptor signaling. First, SOCS polypeptides can bind through their Src homology 2 domain to Jak kinases and can inhibit their activity in vivo and in vitro (11.Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H.

Second, enforced expression of several SOCS family members such as SOCS-1, CIS-1, and SOCS-3 can repress cytokine-induced effects, including cellular proliferation and differentiation (10.Starr R.

And finally, mice lacking the prototype of the family, SOCS-1, exhibit monocytic and polymorphonuclear infiltration of several organs, fatty degeneration of the liver, and early neonatal lethality (23.Starr R. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Brysha M. Willson T.A. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14395-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24.Naka T.

Moreover, their hemopoietic cell progenitors have an increased sensitivity to cytokines like granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IFN-γ (25.Metcalf D. Alexander W.S. Elefanty A.G. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Starr R. Mifsud S. Di Rago L. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These animals also possess markedly diminished cellularity in the thymus, seemingly as a consequence of enhanced apoptosis (38.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). In light of their potent inhibitory impact, it appears likely that the expression and function of SOCS molecules needs to be tightly controlled. In keeping with the idea, the accumulation of most, if not all, SOCS family members was shown to be dependent on prior exposure to cytokines (9.Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A.

Our results show that the expression of SOCS-1 is strongly modulated at the level of translation initiation. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl-terminal portion of SOCS-1 were raised against a bacterial (TrpE) fusion protein encompassing amino acids 168–212 of mouse SOCS-1. Antibodies against the amino-terminal segment of SOCS-1 were also produced in rabbits, using a TrpE fusion protein containing residues 2–78 of mouse SOCS-1. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was described previously (29.Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Whole thymus was extracted from 3-week-old C57BL/6 mice. CTLL-2 is an IL-2-dependent mouse T-cell line and was propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and recombinant IL-2. BI-141 is an antigen-specific mouse T-cell hybridoma (30.Reske-Kunz A.B. Rude E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1985; 15: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Derivatives expressing the neomycin phosphotransferase alone (Neo) were described elsewhere (31.Abraham N. Miceli M.C. Parnes J.R. Veillette A. Nature. 1991; 350: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). All BI-141 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and, if appropriate, G418 (0.6 mg/ml). COS-1 cells were propagated in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, while HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Recombinant murine IFN-γ was purchased from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. The full-length socs-1 cDNA depicted in Fig. 2 B was reconstituted from two mouse EST clones (GenBankTM accession numbers AA212316 and AA024269). cDNA variants lacking the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) were generated in two ways. For transfection in BI-141 cells, a partialsocs-1 cDNA already lacking most of the 3′-UTR was excised with XhoI (site located just upstream of the ATG; see Fig. 2 B) and SacI (in the polylinker at the 3′-end). For COS-1 cell transfections, a socs-1 cDNA bearing an EcoRI site immediately downstream of the stop codon was created by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction. This cDNA was subsequently digested with XhoI andEcoRI. cDNAs lacking the 5′-UTR or the 3′-UTR were generated by digesting the modified full-length cDNA carrying the artificial EcoRI site with either XhoI orEcoRI, respectively. All inserts were blunt-ended and cloned in the mammalian expression vector pNT-Neo, which contains the origin of replication of SV40, the SRα promoter, the SV40 polyadenylation sequence, and the neo gene. The upstream AUGs ofsocs-1 were mutated using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To isolate the 5′-UTR of socs-1, an additionalXhoI site was first created at the 5′-end of the full-length cDNA. The 5′-UTR was subsequently released with XhoI and used to generate the plasmids pSKII-5′UTR SOCS-1-luc (for in vitro transcription/translation and HeLa cell transfection) and pcDNA3-rluc-5′-UTR SOCS-1-fluc (for transfection in HeLa cells). All constructs were verified by sequencing to ensure that no unwanted mutation had been introduced during their creation (data not shown). pcDNA3-rluc-POLIRES-fluc, pACTAG-2, pACTAG-2–4E-BP1, pACTAG-2-BP1-Δ4E were reported previously (32.Marcotrigiano J.

Sonenberg, unpublished results., 3H. Imataka and N. Sonenberg, unpublished results. Total cellular RNA was prepared by the acid isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (34.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63046) Google Scholar). The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by electrophoresis in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. RNase protection assays were performed according to a previously published protocol (35.Chow L.M. Ratcliffe M.J. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), using serial dilutions of total cellular RNA. The construct used to produce socs-1 riboprobes was generated by cloning a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 651–773 of the sequence shown in Fig. 2 B in pBSKII. After linearization with NotI, ∼190-nucleotide antisense riboprobes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Full protection of this riboprobe by cellular socs-1 transcripts was expected to yield a 123-nucleotide fragment. Cellular transcripts generated by cDNAs with a truncated 3′-UTR resulted in a larger protected fragment, due to hybridization of the riboprobe with additional sequences at the 3′-end of the cDNA. The luciferase riboprobe was generated by cloning an EcoRV–EcoNI fragment from the luciferase cDNA into pBSKII. After linearization withHindIII, antisense riboprobes of ∼390 nucleotides were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase. Full protection of these riboprobes by cellular luciferase transcripts resulted in a 282-nucleotide fragment. Size markers were prepared by end-labelingMspI-digested pBR322 fragments with Klenow DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. BI-141 cells were stably transfected by electroporation (260 V, 960 microfarads) and selected in the presence of G418 (0.75 mg/ml), according to a protocol described elsewhere (36.Latour S. Fournel M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4434-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Monoclonal cell lines expressing the transfected cDNAs were identified by a combination of RNase protection assays and immunoprecipitations (data not shown). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method using 4 μg of plasmid DNA. After 12 h, cells were treated with chloroquine (60 mg/ml) for 5 h (37.Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Following an additional growth period of 48 h, cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells were first infected for 1 h with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7–3, which allows the production of T7 RNA polymerase (38.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar, 39.Belsham G.J. Brangwyn J.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were then transfected with the indicated DNAs using the Lipofectin reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested approximately 18 h later for luciferase assays, RNase protection assays, and/or immunoblots. T-cells, thymus cells, and COS-1 cells were lysed in 1× TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone,N-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). SOCS-1 polypeptides were recovered from various amounts of total cellular proteins using the antiserum raised against the carboxyl-terminal portion of SOCS-1. Immune complexes were subsequently collected with Staphylococcus aureusprotein A (Pansorbin; Calbiochem). After several washes with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted in sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblots were performed according to a previously described protocol (40.Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar) using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (for SOCS-1) or 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd.) (for HA tag). Luciferase RNAs were synthesized in vitro from linearized pSKII-luc, pSKII-5′UTR SOCS-1-luc, or pSKII-5′UTR ODC-luc using T7 RNA polymerase, in the presence of m7GpppG and GTP to allow capping of the RNAs, as described (41.Svitkin Y.V. Ovchinnikov L.P. Dreyfuss G. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7147-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Various quantities of transcripts were then translated in vitro for the indicated periods of times at 30 °C using rabbit reticulocyte lysates, as outlined by the manufacturer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using either the luciferase reporter assay system or the dual luciferase reporter assay system from Promega. Values were measured in a luminometer (EG & G Berthold). Previous studies have indicated thatsocs-1 is expressed highly in thymus (10.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to understand better the regulation of SOCS-1, we first wished to identify the SOCS-1 protein in T-cells. To this end, lysates from mouse thymus and IL-2-treated CTLL-2 T-cells were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal portion of SOCS-1, and the presence of SOCS-1 in these immunoprecipitates was revealed by immunoblotting with another antibody raised against the amino-terminal segment of SOCS-1 (Fig.1 A). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed in parallel to quantitate the levels ofsocs-1 transcripts, using serial dilutions of total cellular RNA (Fig. 1 B). Although socs-1 transcripts could be readily documented in these samples (Fig. 1 B), we found that the SOCS-1 protein was very difficult to detect under standard immunoprecipitation conditions. Nonetheless, when large amounts of cell lysates (9 mg of total cellular proteins) were utilized for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 A), we were capable of detecting a ∼24-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide consistent with SOCS-1 in anti-SOCS-1 immunoprecipitates (lanes 2 and4). This product was absent in immunoprecipitates generated with normal rabbit serum (lanes 1 and3). Our difficulty in detecting endogenous SOCS-1 polypeptides, but not socs-1 transcripts, raised at least two possibilities. First, it is plausible that the SOCS-1 protein was highly unstable in T-cells. However, this scenario seems unlikely, since we estimated that the half-life of SOCS-1 was ∼4 h in these cells, 4A. Gregorieff, S. Pyronnet, N. Sonenberg, and A. Veillette, unpublished results. in keeping with previous reports (28.Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Second, it suggested that the SOCS-1 protein may be translationally regulated. To address this possibility, we first wanted to identify the noncoding elements in mouse socs-1RNAs. Characterization of these untranslated sequences was performed through a combination of database searches, cDNA cloning, EST clone sequencing, and comparison with the reported genomic sequence of the mouse socs-1 gene. The socs-1 cDNA sequence defined by these analyses is depicted in Fig.2 A. It exhibits a length of 1177 nucleotides, in agreement with the reported size of mousesocs-1 transcripts (10.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 12.Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). This sequence includes 134 nucleotides of 5′-UTR, a coding portion of 639 bases and a 3′-UTR of 404 nucleotides. It has an additional 5 nucleotides at the 5′ end compared with the cDNA reported by DeSepulveda et al.(GenBankTM accession no. AF120490) and 16 nucleotides more than the cDNA submitted by Starr et al.(GenBankTM accession no. U88325). Based on the sequence of the socs-1 gene, it was determined that socs-1RNAs are encoded by two exons (Fig. 2 B). While exon 1 contributes only to the 5′-UTR, exon 2 participates in the formation of part of the 5′-UTR, all of the coding region, and the 3′-UTR. To examine the impact of the UTRs on the translation ofsocs-1, BI-141 mouse T-cells were stably transfected by electroporation with either a full-length socs-1 cDNA or a cDNA containing only the coding region of socs-1. Levels of SOCS-1 protein and RNA in representative derivatives were subsequently compared with those observed in control BI-141 cells that were either unstimulated or treated with IFN-γ (Fig.3).

It also induced the appearance of detectable amounts of SOCS-1 protein in these cells (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). The levels of endogenous SOCS-1 protein and RNA observed in IFN-γ-treated BI-141 cells were essentially similar to those found in the cell line transfected with the full-length socs-1cDNA (Fig. 3, A, lane 6, andB, lanes 12–14). However, the amount of SOCS-1 protein observed in these cells was significantly lower than that found in cells transfected with the cDNA devoid of UTRs (Fig.3 A, lanes 3–5), even if comparable quantities of RNA existed (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 6–8 with lanes 9–11). Taking into account the differences in the quantities of cell lysates used for these immunoprecipitations, it was estimated that socs-1transcripts possessing intact UTRs produced at least 30 times lower levels of SOCS-1 protein in comparison with full-length RNAs. Similar results were obtained with other SOCS-1-expressing BI-141 clones (data not shown). Next, we wanted to determine which noncoding sequence(s) was responsible for inhibiting the translational efficiency of socs-1 RNAs. To this end,socs-1 cDNAs lacking either the 5′-UTR or the 3′-UTR or both were constructed as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” All cDNAs were cloned in the expression vector pNT-Neo, flanked by an SRα promoter and the polyadenylation sequence from SV40. After transient expression in COS-1 cells, the abundance of SOCS-1 protein was measured by anti-SOCS-1 immunoblotting of SOCS-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 A), whereas the accumulation of socs-1 transcripts was monitored by RNase protection assay (Fig. 4 B). First, this experiment showed that the levels of SOCS-1 protein generated from the full-length cDNA in COS-1 cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 10–12) were lower (∼7-fold) than those synthesized from the cDNA lacking both UTRs (Δ5′/Δ3′; lanes 1–3), in keeping with the observation made above in BI-141 T-cells. This difference was not due to variations in RNA expression, as documented by the parallel RNase protection assay (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 13–15 with lanes 4–6). It should be mentioned, however, that the protected riboprobe fragment observed with the Δ5′/Δ3′ and Δ3′ cDNAs was 5–10 nucleotides larger than that seen with the full-length cDNA. This alteration was due to the fact that polylinker sequences present in the riboprobe were identical to sequences found at the 3′-end of the Δ5′/Δ3′ and Δ3′ cDNAs. Second, this s"

Previously, our laboratory defined a region of the β′ subunit that interacts with ς70 in vitro. This region of β′ contained heptad repeat motifs indicative of coiled coils. In this work, we used 10 single point mutations of the predicted coiled coils, located within residues 260–309 of β′, to look at disruption of the ς70-core interaction. Several of the mutants were defective for binding ς70 in vitro. Of these mutants, three (R275Q, E295K, and A302D) caused cells to be inviable in an in vivoassay in which the mutant β′ is the sole source of β′ subunit for the cell. All of the mutants were able to assemble into the core enzyme; however, R275Q, E295K, A302D were defective for Eς70 holoenzyme formation.

RNA polymerase nickel nitrilotriacetic acid wild type The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 is a multisubunit enzyme that plays a central role in eubacterial gene regulation and expression. This enzyme has two functional forms: core and holoenzyme. Transcription elongation and termination are performed by the core enzyme with α:2,β:1,β′:1 stoichiometry (1Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Core RNAP binds one of a variety of ς subunit species at a given time to form a specific holoenzyme (2Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K.F. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme performs the tasks of promoter recognition and transcription initiation. Each ς subunit directs its cognate holoenzyme to start transcription from only those promoters containing DNA sequences specifically recognized by that ς factor (2Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K.F. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 3Gross C.A. Chan C.L. Lonetto M.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol.

Understanding the molecular basis of ς binding to core RNAP will aid in the analysis of several questions involving how multiple ς species come to sequester core and turn on subsequent genes. It has been hypothesized that all of the ς species bind to the same site/sites on the core enzyme (1Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 6Sharp M.M. Chan C.L. Lu C.Z. Marr M.T. Nechaev S. Merritt E.W. Severinov K. Roberts J.W. Gross C.A.

Studies to identify the core binding site on ς have resulted in the positive identification of a single binding site located on ς70 overlapping conserved region 2.1 (5Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar,8Lesley S.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7728-7734Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A single point mutation in the homologous region of Bacillus subtilis ςE prevented binding to core (9Shuler M.F. Tatti K.M. Wade K.H. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3687-3694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent genetic and biochemical studies suggest that region 2.1 may be only one of multiple contact sites that ς uses in binding to the core enzyme (6Sharp M.M. Chan C.L. Lu C.Z. Marr M.T.

Information about sites on core that bind ς has come in most part from biochemical assays. Protein footprinting studies of the core enzymes susceptibility to hydroxy radical cleavage upon binding a modified ς factor containing the cleavage catalyst have revealed that there are three regions on the core, one located on β′ and two on β, that are in close proximity to ς (12Owens J.T. Miyake R. Murakami K. Chmura A.J. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6021-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One of the β regions was identified earlier as being near the ς70 binding region. It was noticed that this site, in the core enzyme complex, was cleaved by trypsin, whereas formation of Eς70 prevented trypsin cleavage at this site (13Fisher R. Blumenthal T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11056-11062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous in vitro work from our laboratory identified a strong binding site for ς70 on the β′ subunit (14Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This site was mapped to within residues 260–309 of β′. The predicted secondary structure (15Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. CABIO S. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar) of β′260–309 has two α helices joined by a random coil. Another structural analysis program indicates that these two helices are amphipathic and have the potential for coiled coil formation (16Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar). The coiled coil motif is based on a heptad repeat of residues designated a–g (17Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 18Chao H. Bautista D.L. Litowski J. Irvin R.T. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 715: 307-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). The a and d positions are hydrophobic, whereas the other positions are usually charged or polar. Burial of the a and d hydrophobic residues during coiled coil formation provides a large amount of the binding energy. Specificity in binding comes from the e and g positions, which can form ionic interactions or salt bridges. We have undertaken a mutational analysis of this region to confirm that our in vitro binding results were relevant to in vivo binding and function. This work presents the analysis of 10 point mutations, most of which are change-of-charge mutations at the e and g residues, in the β′260–309 predicted coiled coil. Three of the mutations (R275Q, E295K, and A302D) were nonfunctional in binding ς70 in all of the assays in which they were tested but still able to assemble into the core enzyme. We also report on mutations that were nonfunctional in some of our assays but functional in others, indicating that binding of other sites may compensate for loss of binding at the β′260–309 site. We use this analysis to demonstrate that the binding site identified previously by in vitro methods is important in vivo and that mutations in this region can greatly diminish core binding of ς70 and other minor ςs. In the recently solved crystal structure for the core RNAP of Thermus aquaticus, the region homologous to Escherichia coliβ′260–309 was determined to form a “coiled coil-like” structure (19Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) consistent with our predictions. Modeling of our mutations onto the T. aquaticus structure places all of the nonfunctional mutations on the same face of the β′ coiled coil. Plasmid characteristics are described in Table I. Plasmids pTA577 and 600–620 were made from the base plasmid pRL663 (20Wang D. Meier T.I. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R.L. Cell. 1995; 81 (350): 341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). SingleHinDIII and BamHI restriction sites, at bases 674 and 952 of rpoC, respectively, were inserted into the rpoC gene of pRL663 via silent mutagenesis to create pTA577. pTA561 was created in the same manner as pTA577 except that pRL308 (22Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was the starting plasmid. The HinDIII and BamHI restriction sites were used to insert polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragments containing the various mutations to generate pTA600–609. For pTA620, which contains a truncatedrpoC fragment coding for β′ residues 1–319, pRL663 was cut with Xba-HinDIII for insertion of a polymerase chain reaction-generated rpoC truncation. The ς70binding site was previously mapped to residues 260–309 of β′; however, we engineered some of the constructs for this work to extend to residue 319. This was done to incorporate the BamHI site mentioned previously. Therefore, the various mutations could be moved into the new plasmid to create pTA610–619. We have not seen any difference in behavior of the fragments ending at residue 309 as opposed to those ending at residue 319. All sequences generated via polymerase chain reaction were sequenced to ensure that spurious mutations had not been incorporated.Table IPlasmid list and characteristicsPlasmidβ′ residuesMutationsModificationsRef.pRL3081–1407NoneNone22Weilbaecher R.

Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a concentration of 1 mm. Three hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × gfor 15 min and frozen at –20 °C. The cell pellet from a 1-liter culture was thawed and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.3 mKCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysozyme was added to 0.1 mg/ml. The cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and then sonicated in three 60-s bursts. The recombinant protein in the form of inclusion bodies was separated from the soluble lysate by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min. The inclusion body pellet was resuspended by sonication in 10 ml of lysis buffer + 2% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. The mixture was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The deoxycholate-washed inclusion bodies were resuspended in 10 ml of deionized water and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min. The water wash was repeated, and the inclusion bodies were aliquoted into 1-mg pellets and frozen at −20 °C until use. ς70 inclusion bodies (10 mg) were solubilized, refolded, and purified according to a variation of the procedure of Gribskov and Burgess (21Gribskov M. Burgess R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6745-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were solubilized by resuspension in 10 ml of 6 m guanidine-HCl. The proteins were allowed to refold by diluting the denaturant 64-fold with Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) in 2-fold steps over 2 h. One gram of resin (DEAE-cellulose, Whatman) was added and mixed with slow stirring for 24 h at 4 °C. The resin was then collected in a 10-ml column and washed, and the protein was eluted with a gradient from 0.1 to 1.0m NaCl in Buffer A. The ς70 fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mNaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol), and stored at −20 °C. Protein samples to be quantitated were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred out of the gel onto 0.05-μm nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked in Blotto (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and probed with monoclonal antibodies. The signal was generated using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected on a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The signal was quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Cells containing truncated β′ expression plasmids pTA610–620 were grown to A 600 = 0.6–0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were grown for an additional 30 min. A 200-μl sample was removed and sonicated three times for 30 s each. 20 μl of glycerol and 20 μl of SDS sample buffer were added and heated for 2 min at 95 °C, and the sample was then stored at –20 °C until use. The lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto 0.05-μm nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was blocked by incubating in HYB buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μmZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) for 16 h at 4 °C. A chimeric ς70 was created by fusing a heart muscle kinase recognition sequence to the N terminus of ς70 to facilitate radiolabeling of ς70. Labeling of ς70 was done in a 100-μl reaction volume. 50 μl of 2× kinase buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mmNaCl, 24 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol) was added to 50 μg of heart muscle kinase ς70 protein. 240 units of cAMP-dependent kinase catalytic subunit (Promega) was added and the total volume was brought to 99 μl with deionized water. One microliter of [γ-32P]ATP (0.15 mCi/μl) was added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a Biospin-P6 column (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with 1× kinase buffer and centrifuged at 1100 × g for 4 min. The flow-through was collected and stored at −20 °C. The blocked nitrocellulose was incubated in 10 ml of HYB buffer with 4 × 105 cpm/ml 32P-labeled ς70 for 3 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times with 10 ml of HYB buffer for 3 min each. The blot was dried, and the signal was visualized with a PhosphorImager and quantitated with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Plasmids pTA577 and 600–609 (0.1 μg) were transformed into strain RL602 (22Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Ridley S.P. Oeshger M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 736-746PubMed Google Scholar). After heat shock and incubation on ice, 300 μl of LB was added to the 50-μl cell mixture. 10 μl of the transformation reaction was spotted onto LB plates plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 30 °C. Another 10 μl was spotted onto identical plates and incubated at 42 °C. The plates were incubated for 24–48 h and assessed for growth. 1-liter flasks containing 200 ml of LB with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.15 mm) were inoculated with 200 μl from overnight cultures of cells containing plasmids pTA561, 577, and 600–609. The cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking until the A 600 reached 0.4 for log phase assays and 2 h longer (A 600 ∼ 2.0) for the early stationary phase assays. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min and stored at –20 °C until use. The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, and 0.1 mm EDTA) plus 0.15 m NaCl and lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) and then incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were sonicated three times for 30 s each and centrifuged for 25 min at 27,000 × g to remove the insoluble material. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1.5-ml immunoaffinity column containing the polyol-responsive, anti-β′ monoclonal antibody NT73 (24Thompson N.E. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 15 ml of TE plus 0.15 m NaCl followed by a second wash with 10 ml of TE plus 0.5 m NaCl. The protein was eluted from the column with 4 ml of TE plus 0.7m NaCl and 30% propylene glycol. The eluted sample (4 ml) was diluted with 6 ml of buffer 66 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and loaded (2×) onto 500 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin. The resin was washed twice with 5 ml of buffer 66 and eluted with 0.5 ml of buffer 66 plus 0.25 mimidazole. Samples from the elution fractions were assayed by Western blot as described above, using monoclonal antibodies to each subunit or ς factor. The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies and the signal was generated using the ECL Plus substrate system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected using the STORM PhosphorImager and quantitated with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Structural prediction, using the Coils program (16Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar), scored both of the predicted α-helices of β′260–309 as having a high probability of forming coiled coils (Fig. 1 A). To test this prediction, we constructed two β′ mutants with proline residues inserted into either helix. These β′ mutants were no longer predicted to form helices or coiled coils. When assayed for function in both the far Western and in vivo growth assays, both mutants were found to be nonfunctional (data not shown). We took this to indicate that the helical/coiled coil structure in this region was important for function. The solubility of these mutant proteins was not 100%, so we ceased using them because their loss of function could simply be due to gross folding defects. We decided to concentrate in most part on the e and g positions of the α-helices for the next phase of our analysis. The e and g residues of coiled coils often engage in interhelical interactions, such as the formation of ionic interactions or salt bridges (17Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 18Chao H. Bautista D.L. Litowski J. Irvin R.T. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 715: 307-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Such interactions in this case could be intramolecular (between the two helices of β′260–309), forming a coiled coil structure necessary for binding by the ς subunit (Fig. 1 B). Alternatively, the e and g residues of β′260–309 could be making intermolecular contacts with ς upon binding. Our efforts were directed toward making change-of-charge mutations at these residues of β′ (Fig.1 B) and assaying their effects on binding. Two of the mutations described in this work do not involve e or g residues and were chosen for other reasons. Based on the findings that tyrosine and arginine residues are often located in “hot spots” of protein-protein interactions (26Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), we changed the tyrosine residue at position 269 to an alanine and arginine 297 to a serine. Previous studies in our laboratory found that insertion of a leucine at position 297 generated a β′ subunit that was nonfunctional for binding ς70 (unpublished results). Therefore, we were interested to determine whether a less drastic mutation at this position would also affect ς binding. Previously, we had used far Western blotting to map a ς70 binding site to the N-terminal region of the β′ subunit (14Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We again applied this procedure as an initial assay for functionality of our β′ mutants. The mutations were cloned into a gene fragment coding for amino acids 1–319 of the β′ subunit. Cells containing these genes were induced for a short period to give moderate levels of the β′ fragment, comparable to other proteins in the extract. Samples were analyzed for binding ς70 by far Western analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of ς70 probe bound by each β′1–319mutant fragment was compared with the amount bound by wt β′1–319 fragment. Each signal was normalized to the amount of β′1–319 contained in the supernatant as determined by Western blotting. Five of the mutations (R275Q, R293Q, E295K, R297S, and A302D) were greatly reduced in their ability to bind ς70 (Fig.2). The Q300E and N309D mutations had the opposite effect, binding more ς70 than wild type β′1–319. Q300E exhibited an increase in relative binding of greater than 7-fold. There were no effects on binding seen with the N266D, Y269A, or K280E mutations. To assess the importance of the ς70 binding site in vivo, we assayed the ability of mutant β′ subunits to function as the sole source of β′ for the cell. Plasmids containing mutant or wild type, full-length β′ were transformed into strain RL602 (22Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Ridley S.P. Oeshger M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 736-746PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosomal rpoC gene of RL602 has an amber mutation that prevents functional β′ from being produced in the absence of a suppressor tRNA. RL602 also has a chromosomal, temperature-sensitive amber suppressor. At the permissive temperature (30 °C), the amber suppressor is active and allows chromosomal β′ to be produced and the cell can grow. The amber suppressor is not active at the nonpermissive temperature (42 °C). Therefore, at 42 °C, chromosomal β′ is not made, and the cell cannot grow without another source of β′. If the plasmid-derived β′ can complement the loss of β′, then the cells will grow and form colonies on plates at the nonpermissive temperature. If the mutant β′ cannot complement, there will be no growth on the plates at this temperature. Three of the β′ mutants that were defective for ς binding in the far Western assay (R275Q, E295K, and A302D) could not support growth at the nonpermissive temperature, indicating that these mutations were also caused defects in binding ς in vivo (Fig.3). N266D, a mutation that had no detectable effect in the far Western assay, allowed some growth at the nonpermissive temperature but not enough to be considered wild type. In contrast, the R293Q and R297S mutations that did not bind ς70 in the far Western assay could support growthin vivo. Mutations Y269A, K280E, Q300E, and N309D had no detectable effects on growth. Expression levels for nonfunctional β′ mutants were determined to be equivalent to that of plasmid-derived, wild type β′ when grown at 37 °C (data not shown). An alternate explanation for the inviability caused by some of the β′ mutations would be that they are no longer able to be assembled into the core enzyme. To evaluate the potential assembly defects caused by the various mutations, we expressed His6-tagged, mutant β′ subunits in cells that were also expressing wild type, chromosomal β′ proteins. We used a Ni2+-NTA mediated pull-out assay to purify the mutant β subunits together with associated cell proteins. An immunoaffinity column was used to clean up the samples in order to reduce any nonspecific binding to the Ni2+-NTA column. All of the mutant β′ subunits tested retained the ability to assemble into the core enzyme demonstrated by the association of the α and β subunits throughout the purification (Fig.4, A and B). Again, mutations R275Q, E295K, and A302D caused defects in binding ς70 in both log and stationary phase samples (Fig.4 C). Also reduced in Eς70 formation were N266D in both log and stationary phase samples and R297S in log phase samples. Q300E again showed properties of binding ς70better than wild type. Y269A, K280E, R293Q, and N309D had no detectable effect on Eς70 assembly. When a non-His6-tagged β′ was expressed from the plasmid, there was no detectable nonspecific binding to the Ni2+-NTA column. All of the sample eluates were also assayed for the presence of any minor ς species. The only minor ςs of which the concentrations were sufficient for detection were ς32 in log phase and ς32 and ςF in stationary phase samples. The results for these ςs were essentially the same as for ς70 with the exception of mutants R297S and Q300E. In stationary phase samples from the Q300E mutant, the ς32and ςF levels are greatly reduced, whereas the ς70 levels are above those in the wt. The log phase samples for this mutant also contained a decreased amount of ς32 indicating a defect in Eς32 formation but not as severe as in stationary phase. Recently, Zhang et al. (19Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) published the crystal structure of T. aquaticus core RNAP. The β′260–309 region of E. coli RNAP has a high degree of sequence conservation with its T. aquaticus homolog (Fig.5 A). 2L. Minakhin and K. Severinov, personal communication. This region of the T. aquaticus β′ subunit forms a coiled coil-like structure. When the mutations studied here are modeled onto the T. aquaticus structure using the Rasmol program (25Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar), those that are most defective in ς binding are grouped on one face of the coiled coil. Those that had defective phenotypes in some assays but not others are on the outer edges of this face. Mutations that had no detectable effects are clustered on the opposite face of the coiled coil, with the exception of N309D, which is located at the very C terminus of the coiled coil immediately next to the “rudder” (19Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, B and C). Binding of various ς factors to the core polymerase is a major step in the process of global gene expression and regulation. It is not known whether this step is part of the regulation, via a competition for binding to a limited core population, or merely a straight-forward binding of free ςs to an excess of core (27Jishage M. Iwata A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ju J. Mitchell T. Peters III, H. Haldenwang W.G. J.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). If there is competition among populations of ς species for core binding, that competition may be influenced by binding specificity of the ςs. In light of the high sequence conservation of most ς species, it has been thought that all ς factors bind to the same location(s) on the core enzyme (1Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). We had previously identified a binding site for ς70 in vitro (14Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol.

Confocal microscopic imaging of platelet-poor plasma clots reveals that essentially all fibrin-associated PAI-1 colocalizes with fibrin-bound vitronectin.

This effect is dependent on direct binding interactions of vitronectin with fibrin. There is no significant effect of fibrin-associated vitronectin on fibrinolysis in the absence of PAI-1. The binding of PAI-1 to fibrin clots formed in the absence of vitronectin was characterized by a low affinity (K d∼ 3.5 μm) and rapid loss of PAI-1 inhibitory activity over time. In contrast, a high affinity and stabilization of PAI-1 activity characterized the cooperative binding of PAI-1 to fibrin formed in the presence of vitronectin. These findings indicate that plasma PAI-1·vitronectin complexes can be localized to the surface of fibrin clots; by this localization, they may modulate fibrinolysis and clot reorganization.

Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments indicate that PAI-1 and native vitronectin form a 320-kDa complex composed of two vitronectin and four PAI-1 molecules, suggesting a 2:1 stoichiometry. 2Podor, T. J., Shaughnessy, S. G., Blackburn, M., and Peterson, C. (May 19, 2000) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M000362200. 2Podor, T. J., Shaughnessy, S. G., Blackburn, M., and Peterson, C. (May 19, 2000) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M000362200. Binding studies using domain-specific monoclonal antibodies support the concept that there are two PAI-1-binding sites on vitronectin. The reportedM r of circulating PAI-1·vitronectin complexes (19.Wiman B. Almquist A. Sigurdardottir O. Lindahl T.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with our results and raises the possibility that the complex, rather than the individual proteins, interacts with other macromolecules. Supporting this concept are studies demonstrating that vitronectin can bind PAI-1 and heparin simultaneously, indicating that PAI-1·vitronectin complexes can interact with other molecules (37.Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies demonstrating both PAI-1 and vitronectin on fibrils of fibrin clots formed in vitro or in vivo (38.Robbie L.A. Bennett B. Croll A.M. Brown P.A.J. Booth N.A. Thromb.

Haematol. 1999; 104: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are compatible with the notion that the individual proteins interact with fibrin. Although PAI-1 has been reported to bind directly to fibrin, it has yet to be shown that vitronectin or PAI-1·vitronectin complexes interact directly with fibrin. Recently, we demonstrated that vitronectin associates with fibrin in both purified and plasma systems. 3T. J. Podor, J. Weitz, and C. Peterson, submitted for publication. 3T. J. Podor, J. Weitz, and C. Peterson, submitted for publication.Based on these observations, we hypothesized that fibrin-bound vitronectin supports PAI-1 binding. To explore this possibility, direct binding studies were performed to quantify the interaction between PAI-1 and fibrin-bound vitronectin. In addition, functional PAI-1 assays were used to demonstrate that vitronectin enhances the inhibitory effects of PAI-1 on t-PA-mediated clot lysis. Human glu-plasminogen, α-thrombin, fibronectin, and plasminogen-free fibrinogen was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN).

Monoclonal antibody to PAI-1 (MAI-12) was purchased from Biopool AB (Umeä, Sweden). Plastic inoculation loops were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Tween-20, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, urea (electrophoresis grade), acrylamide:bis 37.5:1 (2.6%C), molecular weight markers, glycine, TRIS, SDS, G-25M Sepharose, and gelatin were purchased from Bio-Rad. Specta/Por® CE (cellulose ester) MWCO 15,000 dialysis membrane tubing was purchased from VWR-Canlab (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Blood was collected from the antecubital vein of healthy volunteers into plastic syringes prefilled with 110 vol of 3.8% trisodium citrate. After mixing, the red blood cells and platelets were sedimented by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and PPP was harvested and stored at −70 °C until needed. Native vitronectin was purified and characterized as described previously (23.Hill S.A. Shaughnessy S.G. Joshua P. Ribau J. Austin R.C. Podor T.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 5061-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, vitronectin was isolated from PPP using immunoaffinity purification with the SAHVn IgG coupled to Affi-Gel affinity resin (Bio-Rad) and subjected to PAGE analysis in the presence or absence of SDS. Fibrinogen was rendered vitronectin-free using immunoaffinity chromatography with immobilized SAHVn IgG, which reduced the vitronectin levels from approximately 10 nmdown to <10 pm vitronectin per μmfibrinogen. Fibrinogen was trace radiolabeled with Na125I using Iodobeads (Pierce) to a specific activity of ∼100 μCi/mg, and its clotting activity was assessed by measuring its incorporation into fibrin clots (95–98%) (42.Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Hudoba M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Recombinant human PAI-1 containing the 6 residual peptide consensus sequence for heart muscle kinase (HMK) at the amino terminus was constructed using the polymerase chain reaction, and the resulting fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coliand isolated as described (43.Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When HMK-rPAI-1 was compared with fully active wild-type rPAI-1, both proteins inhibited t-PA and urokinase-type PA to the same extent, and both bound to vitronectin comparably. HMK-PAI-1 was radiolabeled by incubation with [32P]ATP (ICN Radiochemicals, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) in the presence of purified protein kinase from bovine heart muscle (Sigma), and the labeled protein was isolated by gel filtration on G-25M Sepharose. The specific activity of the 32P-PAI-1 was approximately 5800 cpm/ng. To examine the spatial distribution of PAI-1 and vitronectin in clots, 150 μl of PPP was placed on APTEX-coated coverslips and clotted by the addition of CaCl2 (final concentration, 10 mm). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the clots were fixed with cold 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min, washed alternately with PBS alone and PBS containing 0.1 mol/liter glycine, and then incubated for 30 min with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml normal goat immunoglobulin). Primary antibodies, including a monoclonal anti-PAI-1 IgG (monoclonal antibody MAI-12), SAHVn IgG, and a sheep anti-human fibrinogen IgG were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with the clots for 1 h at 37 °C. Control clots were stained with each primary antibody separately, stained without primary antibodies, or stained with nonspecific mouse and sheep IgG. After washing, clots were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with Texas Red rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-sheep or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:20 in blocking buffer. The coverslips were washed, mounted on glass slides using Permafluor mounting medium, and then subjected to Z-plane optical sectioning (200 nm/section) using a Zeiss LSM 10 equipped with a 63× planapo oil immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4). Dual-wave-length images were acquired using an argon ion laser (488 nm excitation), a helium/neon ion laser (543 nm excitation), and two matched long pass barrier filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate (515–525 nm emission) and Texas Red rhodamine (575–640 nm emission) images. Image processing and three-dimensional volume rendering were performed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Inc., Chester, PA). Clots stained with nonspecific primary antibodies were used to threshold for background staining. 125I-Labeled clots were formed around plastic inoculation loops (44.Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Ginsberg J. J. Clin.

Prior to clotting, these solutions were spiked with 125I-fibrinogen (500,000 cpm/ml). The purified clots were also formed in the presence of various concentrations of PAI-1 and/or vitronectin. All clots were allowed to age for 2 h at 37 °C. After repeated washing with TBS, clots were then incubated with 0.1 nm t-PA or TBS at 37 °C. The extent of t-PA-induced clot lysis was quantified by counting the radioactivity of the residual clots. In addition, aliquots of the bathing buffer were removed at intervals to monitor the time course of the release of 125I-labeled fibrin degradation product. For some experiments, plasma clots were formed in the presence or absence of antibodies directed against PAI-1 (MAI-12) or vitronectin (SAHVn). Treatment of the clots with MAI-12 or SAHVn attenuated PAI-1-mediated inhibition of clot lysis in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal inhibition at 10 and 250 μg/ml, respectively. Previous reports have demonstrated that the monoclonal MAI-12 attenuates PAI-1-mediated inhibition of t-PA-dependent clot lysis (11.Levi M. Beimond B.J. van Zonneveld A.-J. ten Cate J.W. Pannekoek H. Circulation. 1992; 84: 305-312Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar,16.Keijer J. Linders M. Van Zonneveld A.J. Ehrlich J.H. de Boer J.-P. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1991; 78: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SAHVn IgG attenuates the binding of PAI-1 to vitronectin immobilized on the surface of microtiter wells in a dose-dependent fashion. The percentage of clot lysis was calculated by subtracting the residual radioactivity of the clots from their initial radioactivity, and expressed this value as a percentage of the initial radioactivity. The vitronectin-dependent inhibition of t-PA-mediated lysis of purified clots was confirmed by solubilizing the residual clots formed in the presence or absence of PAI-1 and/or vitronectin with 1× Laemmli sample buffer in the presence or absence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 1 h (45.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The undissolved portion of the clot was pelleted by centrifugation, 50% of each of the dissolved clots and preclot supernatant samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gel), and the gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue. The dried gels then exposed to autoradiography film to visualize the distribution of fibrin and fibrin fragments (46.Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5201-5212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of vitronectin on PAI-1 inhibition of t-PA-dependent plasmin generation on fibrin matrices, microtiter wells were first coated with fibrin formed by clotting 50-μl aliquots of a fibrinogen (375 nm) solution containing 0.5 nm vitronectin (or buffer alone) with 30 nm thrombin, 20 nmCaCl2. After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, the plates were stored at 4 °C until used. Previous studies have determined that the addition of 0.5 nm vitronectin to 375 nm fibrinogen prior to clotting resulted in the highest ratio of fibrin-bound versus free vitronectin.3To block nonspecific binding, 100-μl aliquots of PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween-20 (blocking buffer) were added to wells for 2 h at 37 °C. The fibrin-coated wells were then preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of PAI-1 (0.01–100 nm) diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween-80, 5 mm EDTA, 20 units/ml aprotinin, and 0.05% sodium azide (dilution buffer). For some experiments, fibrin matrices were incubated with PAI-1 in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml of SAHVn IgG or preimmune sheep IgG. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween-20 (wash buffer), the wells were then incubated at 37 °C for intervals of up to 24 h. At each time point, 0.48 nm t-PA, 0.54 μm glu-plasminogen, and 1 mm S-2251 were added, and the rate of plasmin generation was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm (A 405 nm) every min for 1 h. Rates of plasmin generation were expressed as a percentage of the maximum rate of plasmin generation in which no PAI-1 was added. Using the residual plasmin activity at each concentration of PAI-1, we calculated the amount of PAI-1 that bound to fibrin in the presence and absence of vitronectin, and the apparent K d(K d(app)) was calculated for each condition using regression analysis. The binding of radiolabeled PAI-1 to fibrin-coated (375 nm) microtiter plate wells was quantified in the presence or absence of 0.5 nm vitronectin. Various concentrations of32P-HMK-PAI-1 (0.01–22 nm) in dilution buffer were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the fibrin matrices that were formed in the presence or absence of vitronectin. After the wells were rinsed three times with wash buffer, the bound and free PAI-1 were quantified by scintillation counting. Data for vitronectin-dependent binding of PAI-1 to fibrin (B in Equation 1) were analyzed by nonlinear least squares analysis according to the Hill equation, B=(Bmax·[S] n)/((K0.5) n+[S] n)Equation 1 in which S is the total PAI-1 concentration,B max is the amount of PAI-1 bound at saturation,K 0.5 corresponds to the PAI-1 concentration at half-maximal saturation, and n is the Hill coefficient. Although previous immunohistochemistry studies have demonstrated that PAI-1 and vitronectin are each localized on fibrin (38.Robbie L.A. Bennett B. Croll A.M. Brown P.A.J. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39.Wohn K.-D. Schmidt T. Kanse S.M. Yutzy B. Germer M. Morgenstern E. Preissner K.T. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the extent to which these proteins colocalize has yet to be determined. Recently, we described the ultrastructural distribution of vitronectin aggregates associated with the surface of fibrin fibrils formed by clotting plasma or purified fibrinogen.3 To determine whether fibrin-associated vitronectin regulates PAI-1 distribution in clots, plasma clots were processed for dual-labeling immunofluorescence and confocal scanning laser microscopic image analysis to examine the distribution of plasma vitronectin and PAI-1 on fibrin fibrils (Fig. 1). Digitalized thresholding of optical sections from clots stained in the absence of a primary antibody or with preimmune IgG was used to establish the background levels of fluorescence. Fibrin-associated vitronectin staining is intense, and is distributed in a punctate, aggregate-like pattern along the fibrin fibrils (Fig. 1 A). Specific PAI-1 staining is distributed intermittently along the length of the fibrin fibrils, with intense staining noted at junctions of overlapping fibrin fibrils (Fig. 1 B, arrows). Quantitative analysis of the percentage of staining for PAI-1 that overlaps with that for vitronectin reveals that the majority (>87%) of fibrin-bound PAI-1 (Fig. 1 C, green) colocalizes with the vitronectin aggregates (red) on the surface of fibrin fibrils (Fig.1 C, yellow). To define the distribution of fibrin fibrils, plasma clots also were stained for fibrin (Fig. 1 D). To examine the influence of fibrin-associated vitronectin on PAI-1 activity, we monitored the t-PA-mediated lysis of125I-fibrinogen-labeled plasma clots (Fig.2). First, we quantified the t-PA dose- and time-dependent lysis profiles of125I-fibrinogen-labeled plasma clots in order to determine an optimal t-PA concentration that results in approximately 40–50% lysis after 18–24 h of incubation (Fig. 2 A). Based on these results, we used 0.08 nm t-PA to examine the lysis of plasma clots formed in the presence or absence of exogenous 1.0 μg/ml PAI-1. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, approximately 37% of the125I-fibrin-labeled plasma clots was digested in the absence of exogenous PAI-1, whereas the addition of PAI-1 to the clot significantly (p = 0.001) reduced lysis to only 7%. Formation of clots in the presence of antibodies against PAI-1 (MAI-12) attenuated PAI-1-mediated inhibition of clot lysis, a finding consistent with previous in vitro (11.Levi M. Beimond B.J. van Zonneveld A.-J. ten Cate J.W. Pannekoek H. Circulation. 1992; 84: 305-312Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and in vivo (16.Keijer J. Linders M. Van Zonneveld A.J. Ehrlich J.H. de Boer J.-P. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1991; 78: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studies with this antibody. In contrast, the anti-vitronectin IgG (SAHVn) completely blocked the inhibitory effects of PAI-1 on clot lysis. Control experiments confirmed that the SAHVn IgG did not contain any plasminogen activator activity, and this antibody had no effect when added after clotting (data not shown). Neither preimmune mouse nor sheep IgG had any effect on clot lysis. To confirm the results with SAHVn IgG in plasma,125I-fibrinogen-labeled clots were formed from 3.0 μm purified fibrinogen, 22 nm PAI-1, 0.54 μm plasminogen, and various doses of vitronectin. These clots were then exposed to t-PA (Fig. 3). In control experiments, clots formed in the presence of increasing concentrations of vitronectin, but in the absence of PAI-1, no significant difference in t-PA-induced clot lysis was demonstrated. Indeed, >95% of the fibrin was solubilized (Fig. 3, open triangles). In the absence of vitronectin, PAI-1 had only a modest inhibitory effect on clot lysis, with 85% of the fibrin clot degraded (Fig. 3, open circle on left axis). When PAI-1 was added in conjunction with increasing concentrations of vitronectin there was a dose-dependent potentiation of PAI-1-mediated inhibition of clot lysis (Fig. 3, closed circles), and <10% of the clot was degraded with vitronectin doses >14 nm. These results suggest that preformed PAI-1·vitronectin complexes are incorporated into fibrin clots during coagulation. To determine whether the potentiation of PAI-1-mediated inhibition of clot lysis is due to direct interactions of vitronectin with fibrin, and to determine whether fibrin-bound vitronectin can bind PAI-1, clots were first formed in the presence of increasing doses of native vitronectin. After extensive washing, the clots were then incubated with PAI-1 for 1 h prior to t-PA exposure (Fig. 3,open circles). These studies indicate that PAI-1 inhibition of clot lysis is less efficient when vitronectin is first prebound to the fibrin clot during coagulation. Although these findings may simply reflect impaired diffusion of PAI-1 into a preformed clot, the results nonetheless demonstrate that fibrin-bound vitronectin can still potentiate PAI-1-mediated inhibition of t-PA. Furthermore, the results confirm that the incorporation of vitronectin into the clot is not PAI-1-dependent. In order to confirm that purified vitronectin potentiates the PAI-1-mediated inhibition of fibrinolysis, purified125I-fibrinogen-labeled clots that had been subjected to t-PA-mediated fibrinolysis were solubilized. The soluble extracts were fractionated using SDS-PAGE under reduced and nonreduced conditions in order to evaluate changes in fibrin degradation (Fig.4). As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the presence of PAI-1 or vitronectin alone had no significant effects on the degradation of fibrin (Fig. 4). However, in the presence of PAI-1 and vitronectin doses >4.0 μg/ml, the fibrin degradation pattern on nonreduced gels illustrates that vitronectin markedly inhibits the degradation of fibrin polymers with a molecular mass of >250 kDa (Fig.4, arrows a), and lower molecular mass forms of covalently li"

Two additional PLD-inhibitory proteins have now been purified and identified as the amphiphysins I and II, which forms a heterodimer that also associates with the clathrin coat. Bacterially expressed recombinant amphiphysins inhibited both PLD1 and PLD2 isozymes in vitro with a potency similar to that of brain amphiphysin (median inhibitory concentration of ∼15 nm). Expressions of either amphiphysin in COS-7 cells reduced activity of endogenous PLD as well as exogenously expressed PLD1 and PLD2. Coprecipitation experiments suggested that the inhibitory effect of amphiphysins results from their direct interaction with PLDs. The NH2 terminus of amphiphysin I was critical for both inhibition of and binding to PLD. Phosphatidic acid formed by signal-induced PLD is thought to be required for the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles during endocytosis.

PA can be further hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol by a specific phosphatase or to lysophosphatidic acid by phospholipase A2. Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C, and lysophosphatidic acid is a potent mitogen (7.Moolenaar W.H. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the basal activity of PLD in mammalian cells is low, the enzyme is activated in a variety of cells by a wide range of stimuli, including hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and cytokines (1.Exton J.

Activation of PLD is thought to occur through its interaction with small GTP-binding proteins such as ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and Rho as well as through protein kinase C (9.Exton J. J. Biol.

Purified PLD1 exhibits a low basal activity but is markedly stimulated in a synergistic manner by protein kinase C-α, ARF, or Rho in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a cofactor that is required for PLD1 activation (1.Exton J.

Fractions corresponding to the second peak (peak II) of inhibitory activity (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 20.Han J.-S. Chung J.-K. Kang H.-S. Donaldson J. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11163-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were pooled, dialyzed against purification buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and aprotinin (1 μg/ml)), and centrifuged to remove insoluble particles. The resulting supernatant (220 mg of protein) was applied to a TSK-gel DEAE-5PW column (21.5 × 150 mm) that had been equilibrated with purification buffer. After washing the column with purification buffer, proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with a 400-ml linear gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl in purification buffer. Fractions (5 ml) were collected and assayed for PLD1 inhibitory activity. Fractions corresponding to the peak of inhibitory activity were pooled, adjusted to 0.8 m ammonium sulfate by addition of a saturated solution, and centrifuged to remove insoluble particles. The resulting supernatant (84 mg of protein) was applied to a TSK-gel phenyl-5PW column (21.5 × 150 mm) that had been equilibrated with purification buffer containing 0.8 m ammonium sulfate. After washing the column with purification buffer containing 0.8 m ammonium sulfate, proteins were eluted over 60 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with a decreasing linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 0.8–0m in purification buffer. Fractions (5 ml) were collected, and those corresponding to the peak of PLD1 inhibitory activity were pooled, dialyzed against purification buffer, and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant (10 mg of protein) was applied to a TSK-gel heparin-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm) that had been equilibrated with purification buffer. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.2 m for 10 min, from 0.2 to 0.4 m for 30 min, and from 0.4 to 1.0m for 10 min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and assayed for PLD1-inhibitory activity, two peaks of which, centered on fractions 23 and 28, were obtained (Fig. 1 A). A pool of of fractions 22–25 from the heparin-5PW column was concentrated, and 25 μg in 50 μl was further applied to Superose 12 gel column (3.2 × 300 mm). This sizing chromatography was performed on a Smart Chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equipped with microseparation unit. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 40 μl/min with the buffer for an hour. Collected fractions were assayed for the inhibitory assay, analyzed on 8% gel, and visualized with the silver staining method (Fig. 1 D). Proteins in fraction 28 of the heparin 5-PW column (Fig. 1 A) were reductively denatured by treatment with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 2 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), after which sulfhydryl groups were labeled with 10 mmiodoacetamide. The labeled proteins were digested with V8 protease, and the resulting peptides were applied to a C18 hydrophobic column (4.6 × 250 mm; Vydac) that had been equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 60-ml linear gradient of 0–60% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were detected by measuring absorbance at 215 nm. Fractions corresponding to the highest four peaks were separately collected, dried, and subjected to digestion with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were purified on the Vydac C18column by applying the same gradient as before. The 83-kDa protein from fraction 23 of the heparin 5-PW column (Fig. 1 B) was electroeluted from gel bands and digested with Lys-C protease. The resulting peptides were purified on the Vydac C18 column as described above. Purified peptides were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. A cDNA (hAmphy-Z1A) encoding full-length (695-residue) human AmphI has been described (26.Yamamoto R. Li X. Winter S. Francke U. Kilimann M.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and a plasmid [pEXlox(+)] that encodes a 434-residue variant of mouse AmphII was kindly provided by Dr. B. Kay (University of Wisconsin). The AmphI and AmphII cDNAs were separately ligated into the 5′ BamHI and 3′ EcoRI sites of the pGEX4T1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by standard techniques of subcloning and the polymerase chain reaction to produce expression vectors (pGEX-AmphI and pGEX-AmphII) encoding the respective GST fusion proteins. Similarly, truncated cDNAs encoding the NH2-terminal 373 residues or COOH-terminal 404 residues of AmphI were cloned into the 5′ BamHI and 3′ EcoRI sites of pGEX4T1 to produce pGEX-N-AmphI and pGEX-C-AmphI. Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transfected with the various expression vectors encoding the GST fusion proteins and grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm of the culture reached 0.5–0.6. Expression of GST-Amph proteins was then induced by incubation of the cells for 3 h in the presence of 100 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sonicated in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (1 μg/ml), and N-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (1 μg/ml), and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. GST fusion proteins were purified from the resulting supernatant with the use of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The concentration of purified proteins was determined spectroscopically with extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 39,970 for GST, 97,870 for GST-AmphI, 81,700 for GST-AmphII, 70,140 for GST-N-AmphI, and 69,370 for GST-C-AmphI. Rabbit monospecific antibodies to AmphI were described previously (26.Yamamoto R. Li X. Winter S. Francke U. Kilimann M.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera to N-AmphI or to C-AmphI were prepared by injection of recombinant proteins obtained by removal of the GST moiety from the corresponding GST fusion proteins with the use of thrombin. pCGN expression vectors containing cDNAs for full-length PLD1 and PLD2 have been described previously (10.Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). pCGN also encodes an influenza virus HA tag that becomes expressed in-frame at the NH2 terminus of the PLD proteins. TheXbaI-SmaI fragments of the pCGN vectors were subcloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), yielding pCDNA-PLD1 and pCDNA-PLD2. For preparation of amphiphysin expression vectors, theBamHI-EcoRI fragments from pGEX-AmphI and pGEX-AmphII were inserted into pCDNA3.1, yielding pCDNA-AmphI and pCDNA-AmphII, respectively. Subconfluent COS-7 cells were harvested by exposure to trypsin, centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min, and washed once with ice-cold transfection buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mmsucrose) (27.Kattunen J. Shastri N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3972-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells (4 × 106 in 400 μl) were placed in a 0.4-mm gap cuvette and subjected to electroporation (two 99-μs pulses at 850 V) in the presence of the indicated plasmids with a T820 electroporater (BTX, San Diego, CA). The cells were maintained on ice for 10 min and then mixed with 9 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A retroviral vector for the expression of AmphI (pSinRep5-AmphI) was constructed by inserting the NheI-EcoRV fragment of pCDNA-AmphI into a pSinRep5 virus vector (Invitrogen) that had been digested with XbaI and StuI. By using the empty pSinRep5 vector (Invitrogen) and the AmphI-expressing vectors, control and AmphI-expressing virus were generated with the Sindbis Expression System according to manufacturer's guide, and their titers were determined by measuring relative luminescent unit in BHKn-LUC cells (ATCC). The volumes of virus stocks were adjusted to equalize titers. PLD activity in cells was assayed by measuring the accumulation of3H-labeled phosphatidylethanol. Transfected COS-7 cells (7 × 105 per well) were labeled by incubation for 18 h in 2 ml of DMEM containing 10 μCi of [3H]myristic acid (ICN) and 1% FBS. The labeled cells were washed with DMEM, kept in 2 ml of DMEM containing 0.5% ethanol for 5 min, and then incubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of 100 nm PMA. The medium was then removed and replaced with ice-cold PBS to terminate cell stimulation. The cells were scraped into an ice-cold vial and then extracted with a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1). The organic phase was dried, redissolved with an equal mixture of chloroform and methanol, and spotted onto Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates (Merck). The labeled compounds were separated with the use of the organic phase of a mixture of ethyl acetate:n-octylbutane:acetic acid:methanol:water (13:2:3:10:10) (28.Poulin B. Rich N. Mas J.-L. Kordon C. Enjalbert A. Drouva S.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 142: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylethanol spots were detected by staining with iodine vapor, scraped into a vial, and sonicated in scintillation mixture. The amount of radioactivity associated with these spots was normalized on the basis of the radioactivity incorporated into total lipids of the cells and was then used as the measure of PLD activity. We previously showed that chromatography of rat brain cytosol on a DEAE-Sephacel column yielded three partially resolved peaks of PLD inhibitory activity (20.Han J.-S. Chung J.-K. Kang H.-S. Donaldson J. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11163-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to the first peak were further separated into two peaks, IA and IB, that yielded synaptojanin and AP180, respectively. Further purification of the second peak (peak II) from the DEAE-Sephacel column was performed by sequential high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on DEAE-5PW, phenyl-5PW, and heparin-5PW columns. Fractions were assayed for their ability to inhibit PLD1 activity measured in the presence of ARF and PI(4,5)P2. The heparin-5PW column yielded two peaks of PLD inhibitory activity centered on fractions 23 and 28 (Fig.1 A). Analysis of fraction 23 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on an 8% gel revealed two major broad bands corresponding to proteins with apparent molecular masses of 125 and 83 kDa, as well as a minor band that migrated slightly ahead of the 83-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B). Fraction 28 yielded a single broad band corresponding to a protein of 125 kDa. This latter protein was digested with V8 protease, and the resulting fragments were fractionated by HPLC on a C18 column. The fractions corresponding to each of the four major peaks obtained each appeared to contain more than one peptide; these fractions were therefore incubated with trypsin and again subjected to chromatography on the same C18 column. Edman degradation of the resulting four peptides yielded sequences that matched exactly stretches of amino acids present in human AmphI as follows: AFTIQ (positions 242–246), TPSPPE (positions 261–266), KGPP (positions 299–302), and ISVTT (positions 332–336). The human AmphI cDNA encodes a protein of 695 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 76,256 (26.Yamamoto R. Li X. Winter S. Francke U. Kilimann M.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mobility of human AmphI on SDS-PAGE was previously shown to be less than that expected from its predicted size, which is likely a result of the acidic nature of the protein (isoelectric point, 4.50) (26.Yamamoto R. Li X. Winter S. Francke U. Kilimann M.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Identification of the 125-kDa protein in fractions 20–28 from the heparin-5PW column as AmphI was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis with monospecific antibodies to AmphI (Fig. 1 B). The broadness of the AmphI bands in Fig.1 B is likely attributable to the fact that AmphI is constitutively phosphorylated at multiple sites (29.Bauerfeind R. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30984-30992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The potencies of fractions 23 and 28 from the heparin-5PW column with regard to inhibition of PLD1 were similar (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that both the 83- and 125-kDa proteins in fraction 23 were able to inhibit PLD1 activity. However, neither antibodies to the NH2-terminal 373 residues of AmphI nor those to the COOH-terminal 404 residues of AmphI recognized the 83-kDa protein (data not shown), suggesting that the latter was not derived from AmphI. To separate further these two bands, a pool of fraction 22–25 from the heparin-5PW column was subjected to micropurification by Superose gel column, and each fraction was visualized by silver staining 8% on gel (Fig. 1 D). Because the staining intensities of the 125- and 83-kDa proteins in the fractions from the gel column showed equal ratio (Fig. 1 D, inset), we investigated whether the two polypeptides exist as a complex. PAGE analysis of fraction 25 on a nondenaturing gel yielded one major band corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa (Fig. 1 E). When the 240-kDa protein was electroeluted from the native gel and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, two bands of 125 and 83 kDa were apparent (Fig.1 E), suggesting that the 125- and 83-kDa proteins indeed form a complex. The 83-kDa protein was then electroeluted from an SDS-PAGE gel and digested with Lys-C, and the resulting fragments were separated by HPLC on a C18 column. The sequence of one purified peptide (SPSPPPDGSPAATPEIRV) matched perfectly that of residues 296–313 of rat AmphII (30.Wigge P. Kohler K. Vallis Y. Doyle C.D. Owen D. Hunt S.P. McMahon H.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2003-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). At least 10 splice variants of rat AmphII have been identified, with the largest such variant consisting of 588 amino acids. Unlike AmphI, AmphII proteins are not acidic and do not migrate abnormally on SDS-PAGE. We prepared glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing full-length (695 residues) human AmphI (GST-AmphI), the NH2-terminal 373 amino acids (GST-N-AmphI), or the COOH-terminal 404 amino acids (GST-C-AmphI) of AmphI, or a full-length 434-residue variant of mouse AmphII (GST-AmphII) and then tested their abilities to inhibit PLD1 and PLD2. The bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were isolated with the use of glutathione-Sepharose beads, and their purity was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). Both GST-AmphI and GST-AmphII inhibited PLD1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner which was measured in the presence of ARF and PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2 B); the two fusion proteins showed similar potencies, with half-maximal inhibition apparent at 10–15 nm, similar to the value of 5 nm calculated from the data in Fig. 1 C for Amph proteins purified from rat brain. GST alone had no effect on PLD1 activity. The inhibitory potency and efficacy of GST-N-AmphI were similar to those of GST-AmphI, whereas GST-C-AmphI had virtually no effect on PLD1 activity (Fig. 2 B). The NH2-terminal 373 residues, but not the COOH-terminal 404 residues, of AmphI thus appear critical for inhibition of PLD1. PLD2 activity measured in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 was also inhibited by GST-AmphI and by GST-AmphII with similar potencies (Fig.2 B). We also investigated the possibility that the Amph-depe"

Based on the NMR structure of Tat, we have designed and synthesized a backbone cyclic ARM mimetic peptide library. The peptides were screened for their ability to mediate nuclear import of the corresponding BSA conjugates in permeabilized cells. One peptide, designated “Tat11,” displayed active NLS properties. Nuclear import of Tat11-BSA was found to proceed by the same distinct pathway used by the Tat-NLS and not by the common importin α pathway, which is used by the SV40-NLS. Most of the Tat-derived backbone cyclic peptides display selective inhibitory activity as demonstrated by the inhibition of the nuclear import mediated by the Tat-NLS and not by the SV40-NLS. The Tat-ARM-derived peptides, including Tat-11, also inhibited binding of the HIV-1 Rev-ARM to its corresponding RNA element (Rev response element) with inhibition constants of 5 nm. Here we have shown for the first time (a) a functional mimetic of a protein sequence, which activates a nuclear import receptor and (b) a mimetic of a protein sequence with a dual functionality.

Oren D. Barda Y. Gilon C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They are useful for detailed study of protein folding, structure, and function. The major potential application of proteinomimetics is, however, therapeutic; such molecules can be used to block protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acid interactions, thus interfering with undesired biological processes (2Braisted A.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5688-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 3Wrighton N.C. et al.Science. 1996; 273: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 4Yanofsky S.D. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7381-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Being relatively small, proteinomimetics often solve acute problems associated with the use of proteins as drugs, such as antigenicity, low bioavailability, high cost, and rapid enzymatic degradation. Two properties of the parent protein must be retained when designing proteinomimetics: (i) the bioactive conformation of the desired active site and (ii) a certain degree of conformational flexibility to allow induced fit. Linear peptides are not optimal candidates to mimic proteins, because they equilibrate between multiple conformations and thus adaptation of the bioactive conformation is at an entropic cost. Introduction of conformational constraints into the peptide is thus needed to generate a proteinomimetic. Being relatively small and conformationally constrained, cyclic peptides are excellent candidates to serve as proteinomimetics. Backbone cyclization of peptides is the method of cyclization developed and used in our lab. It results in peptides with improved selectivity, enhanced metabolic stability, and high bioavailability (5Altstein M. Ben-Aziz O. Daniel S. Schefler I. Zeltser I. Gilon C. J. Biol.

To select the most active backbone cyclic (BC)1 peptide based on a given sequence, we have developed the “cycloscan” technology (10Gilon C. Muller D. Bitan G. Salitra Y. Goldwasser I. Hornik V.

All peptides in a BC library are based on the same primary sequence and differ only in parameters that influence their conformation. These parameters include ring size, position, and chemistry. The feasibility of these methodologies has been demonstrated with several naturally occurring peptides, including substance P (6Byk G. Halle D. Zeltser I. Bitan G. Selinger Z. Gilon C. J. Med.

We have recently extended the use of backbone cyclization from peptides to proteins and coined this novel methodology “the backbone cyclic proteinomimetics approach.” We have demonstrated its utility with the parent proteins bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (1Kasher R.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of proteins is normally mediated by a specific signal, termed the nuclear localization signal (NLS). The prototypic NLS is a short sequence of mostly basic amino acids, as in the SV40 large T-antigen. Nuclear import in the common pathway is initiated by binding of the NLS to the cellular receptor importin α. The complex formed is then attached to the receptor importin β, which anchors it to the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and is transported into the nucleus via the NPC by an energy-dependent process (15Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that several other nuclear import pathways also exist. For example, nuclear import of the HIV-1 Tat protein is mediated by the binding of the Tat-NLS directly to importin β at the same site through which it binds importin α (16Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 Tat protein is a viral transcriptional activator that is actively imported into the nucleus. It binds the viral RNA in a specific region within the LTR promoter called TAR, thereby increasing the processivity of RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Refs. 17Emerman M. Malim M.H.

The Tat-NLS is a semiconsensus arginine-rich motif (ARM) (reviewed in Refs. 19Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 20Mattaj I.W.

The three-dimensional structure of the HIV-1 Tat protein and the TAR RNA have been separately determined by NMR (22Abdoul-ela F. Karn J. Varani G. J. Mol.

As mentioned above, previous research in our group resulted in the development of matrix protein-NLS mimetics. The most potent mimetic, termed BCvir by us, inhibited nuclear import via the importin α pathway in vitro with an IC50 value of 35 nm (13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, BCvir was not able to mediate nuclear import of the appropriate conjugate. It inhibited the function of the corresponding receptor but was not able to activate it, showing an antagonistic activity (13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Friedler D. Gilon C. Loyter A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). BCvir is not an optimal NLS mimetic because it does not display the properties of an active NLS (agonistic activity). In the present study we describe the development of the functional mimetics of the HIV-1 Tat NLS. A BC library based on the Tat-NLS sequence was designed and synthesized. Several peptides from the library specifically inhibited in vitro nuclear import via the importin β pathway. One of the peptides, Tat11, is an active NLS, as demonstrated by its ability to mediate nuclear import of a BSA conjugate in an in vitro assay system. Our results show, for the first time, the use of the BC-P approach to develop a functional proteinomimetic capable of undergoing receptor-based nuclear import. Protected amino acids, methyl benzhydril amine resin, and coupling reagents were purchased from Novabiochem. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Merck. Solvents for peptide synthesis were purchased from Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ. BC peptides were prepared as described previously (13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: peptides were synthesized on methyl benzhydril amine resin (loading 0.56 meq/gr). Peptide libraries were synthesized by the simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis “tea bags” methodology (25Houghten R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar), with 300-mg resin portions in each bag. The protected amino acid derivatives used were: Fmoc-Arg(Mts)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Z)-OH and Fmoc-Cys(pMeOBzl)-OH. The coupling reactions were performed for 2 h following a 10-min preactivation in NMP with PyBroP (3 eq) as a coupling agent. 3 eq of protected amino acid and 7 eq of diisopropylethylamine were used in each coupling. The coupling of Fmoc-Arg(Mts) after the building unit was repeated three times. The coupling of all the amino acids following this arginine were repeated twice. Succinic and glutaric acids were coupled as their anhydrides (10 eq) with 10 eq diisopropylethylamine and 1 eq dimethylaminopyridine in NMP for 3 h. Couplings of adipic and pimelic acid were performed with 10 eq acid and 10 eq DIC, which were preactivated in DMF for 30 min and then added to the resin with 1 eq dimethylaminopyridine and shaken for 3 h. HF cleavage and work up were performed as described (13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The crude peptides were analyzed by time of flight-mass spectroscopy and had the expected molecular weights. The peptides were analyzed by AAA and HPLC (Merck Hitachi, wavelength 215 nm, RP-4 column (Vydac)). The flow was fixed at 1 ml/min, and the gradient was 5–60% acetonitrile: triple distilled water (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 35 min. The peptides were purified on semipreparative HPLC (RP-4 column, Vydac) with a constant flow of 4.5 ml/min. The gradient was 5–60% acetonitrile:triple distilled water (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in 45 min. The purified peptides were also characterized by analytical HPLC, AAA, and time of flight-mass spectroscopy. All molecular masses found were exactly as the calculated values. The purified peptides were all >95% clean, as determined by analytical HPLC. Linear Tat-ARM and SV40-NLS peptides were synthesized on Rink amide resin (loading 0.5 mmol/gr) using the Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer model 431A as described in Ref. 13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. Ac-GRKKRRQRRRAHQN-NH2 was used for the linear Tat-ARM; this sequence has been shown by Siomi et al. (26Siomi H. Shida H. Maki M. Hatanaka M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1803-1807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to act as an NLS. The peptides were cleaved from the resin using a mixture of 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% anisole, and 2.5% diisopropylsilane and were further treated, purified by HPLC, and characterized as described for the BC peptides. Modified Rev34–50 peptides of the sequence succ-TRQARRNRRRRWRERQRAAAAC-NH2have been utilized for all Rev-RRE experiments. Synthesis of Rev peptides was carried out using standard Fmoc/HBTU chemistry on a ABI Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer. The crude peptide was purified on a C-18 semiprep HPLC column with an isocratic mixture of 14% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) in water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), lyophilized, and reacted with 100 equivalents of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 30% (v/v) Me2SO at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. The resulting fluorescently labeled peptide and the unlabeled Rev-ARM peptide were purified on a C-18 semiprep HPLC column with a mixture of acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid); isocratic conditions were 19% acetonitrile for Rev-Fl and 14% acetonitrile for the unlabeled Rev ARM peptide. Colo-205 (human colon adenocarcinoma cells (ATcc CCL 222)) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.3 gr/lit l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Beit hemeek, Israel). Nuclear import was quantitatively determined by the ELISA-based assay system using biotinylated BSA peptide conjugates as transport substrates, essentially as described before (13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Melchior F. Paschal B. Evance J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Briefly, a suspension of Colo-205 cells was used, and biotinylated BSA-SV40 T-antigen NLS, biotinylated BSA-Tat NLS, and biotinylated BSA-ARM mimetic BC peptides conjugates were used as transport substrates. The cells were permeabilized with digitonin, and then the reticulocyte extract was added at 4 °C (when needed); the transport was initiated by the addition of the substrate (biotinylated-BSA-NLS), and then the reaction mixture was transferred to 30 °C for 30 min. All other experimental conditions were as described before (13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Melchior F. Paschal B. Evance J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The results given are an average of triplicate ELISA determinations whose standard deviation never exceeded ±20%. A Rev-RRE complex was formed by mixing 10 nm Rev-Fl with 8.5 nm of the prefolded 67-nucleotide RRE (heated to 90 °C then cooled slowly to room temperature). All displacement experiments were done at 20 °C in a buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), KCl (100 mm), sodium phosphate (10 mm), NH4OAc (10 mm), guanidinium hydrochloride (10 mm), MgCl2 (2 mm), NaCl (20 mm), EDTA (0.5 mm), and Nonidet P-40 (0.001%). Upon binding the RRE, only minor changes in the emission spectrum of fluorescein were seen (about 10% quenching of Rev-Fl). We have taken the change in anisotropy as being directly proportional to the fraction of Rev-Fl bound by the RRE. At the starting point of each titration there is 5 nm of unbound Rev-Fl, 5 nmRev-Fl-RRE complex, and 3.5 nm free RRE. Following complex formation, an inhibitor [I] is titrated into the thermocontrolled cuvette, and a decrease in anisotropy is observed. At high concentrations of inhibitor, anisotropy saturates at 0.081 (the same value observed for the unbound Rev-Fl peptide). Sufficient mixing time was always provided to allow for equilibrium to be reached. At the concentration of inhibitor, which disrupts half of the formed Rev-RRE complex, there must be 2.5 nm of the Rev-Fl-RRE complex, 7.5 nm of free Rev-Fl, 5.23 nm of the RRE-inhibitor complex, and 0.77 nm of free RRE (calculated from the Kd of Rev-Fl-RRE). From a simple, three component, competitive binding equilibrium, the following equation (Equation 1) can be derived. The Kd of the Rev-RRE interaction is calculated by titration of the prefolded 67-nucleotide RRE fragment into a solution of 10 nm Rev-Fl. The following equation was used to calculate the Kd for RRE-Rev-Fl binding.A = A 0 + ΔA{([RNA]total + [Rev-Fl]total +Kd) − [([RNA]total + [Rev-Fl]total + Kd)2 − 4[RNA]total[Rev-Fl]total]1/2}/2[Rev-Fl]total, where A, observed anisotropy; A 0, anisotropy in the absence of RNA; and ΔA, total change in anisotropy upon saturation of Rev-Fl. The Kdobtained for Rev-Fl binding to the RRE was used to calculate the Ki values for all inhibitors with known binding stoichiometry (28Sevenich F.W. Langowski J. Weiss V. Rippe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the case of the cyclic ARM peptides, a 1:1 binding stoichiometry to RRE has been observed using gel electrophoresis (not shown). The Tat ARM sequence, RKKRRQRRR, was used as a template for the design of the ARM mimetic library according to the BC-P approach (1Kasher R. Oren D. Barda Y. Gilon C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on the NMR structure of HIV-1 Tat (23Bayer P. Kraft M. Ejchart A. Westendorp M. Frank R. Rosch P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we have determined the best side chain to be derivatized into the backbone cyclization ring. The HIV-1 Tat lacks any defined secondary structure, and its ARM, which is located between residues 48–57, is exposed on the protein surface and bears a flexible disordered conformation (see Fig.1). The six arginine residues (Arg49, Arg52, Arg53, Arg55, Arg56, and Arg57) face the solvent and are likely to interact with importin β, the nuclear import receptor, as well as with the RNA. Gln54, on the other hand, faces the interior of the protein and is unlikely to interact with other molecules. This residue forms several potential hydrogen bonds with other residues in the Tat protein, which can stabilize the ARM in its bioactive conformation(s). Whereas the arginine residues are all essential for TAR RNA binding, Gln54 is unnecessary and can be mutated to other residues without loss of the TAR binding ability (30Calnan B.J. Biancalana S. Hudson D. Frankel A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This allowed us to replace Gln54 by the backbone cyclization ring (see Fig.1). To maintain the original peptide sequence, we have covalently connected the backbone amide nitrogen in the Gln position to the N terminus of the ARM peptide. We have included a cysteine residue at the C terminus of all peptides, as an attachment point to BSA for the nuclear transport studies. To maximize the number of possible conformations that can potentially support NLS activity and/or RNA binding activity, two variable methylene linker chains have been incorporated into the backbone cyclization ring (see Fig. 1). The final ARM mimetic library contained 16 peptides (see Fig. 2) that were synthesized using the simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis methodology (25Houghten R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ability of the peptides to mediate nuclear import was tested in permeabilized cells using the ELISA-based assay system (14Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar,27Melchior F. Paschal B. Evance J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The peptides were conjugated to biotinylated BSA either as mixtures or separately. The amount of the conjugates in the nuclei of permeabilized colo cells was determined quantitatively (13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Melchior F. Paschal B. Evance J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Out of the library, only peptide Tat11 (n = 4, m = 4 in Fig.2) mediated nuclear import of its BSA conjugate. The nuclear import of the Tat11-BSA conjugate was characterized according to several parameters that demonstrate a specific receptor-mediated nuclear uptake (Fig.3). Nuclear import of Tat11-BSA did not require the addition of cytosolic factors, indicating an importin α-independent pathway. Furthermore, the addition of cytosolic extract caused inhibition of its nuclear import. Nuclear uptake of Tat11-BSA was found to be ATP dependent and was inhibited by free Tat11 peptide (1 mg/ml). Such competitive inhibition indicates a receptor-mediated transport. We have repeated the experiments in the absence of external cytosolic extract. We assumed that in these experiments the added importin α does not compete with the NLS-BSA conjugate for the importin β binding site, relieving importin β for NLS binding. Nuclear import without cytosolic extract was not observed, again, under ATP depletion. It was also inhibited by the free Tat11 peptide and free Tat-NLS peptide, both of which interact with importin β (see Fig.4). As can be seen, the inhibition of nuclear import by the addition of cytosolic extract was even more impressive. Another characteristic of nuclear import is its partial inhibition by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). WGA is known to interact with the NPC and block importin α-mediated nuclear import, which is carried out via the pores. In our experiments, WGA did not inhibit importin β-mediated nuclear import (Fig. 3) and in some cases even increased it (Fig. 4). This may suggest that importin α-independent nuclear import is carried out via a different site in the NPC than the WGA binding site. We have compared the nuclear import characteristics of Tat11-BSA to the Tat-NLS-BSA, whose nuclear import is mediated by importin β (16Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to the SV40-NLS-BSA, whose nuclear import is mediated by importin α (15Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). As expected, nuclear import of SV40-NLS-BSA was dependent on the addition of cytosolic extract and was inhibited by the addition of WGA but was almost not inhibited by the free Tat11 and Tat-NLS peptides (Fig. 3). In contrast, nuclear import of Tat11-BSA was facilitated by the absence of cytosolic extract or by the addition of WGA and was inhibited by free Tat11 peptide, showing similar characteristics to those of Tat-NLS-BSA. This suggests that they both utilize the same nuclear import pathway, probably importin β. The nuclear import characteristics of the Tat-NLS-BSA and Tat11-BSA conjugates were similar also when the experiment was carried out without the addition of cytosolic extract (Fig. 4). The ability of the BC ARM-derived peptides to inhibit nuclear uptake of various transport substrates was determined using the ELISA-based assay system. The transport substrates used were Tat-NLS-BSA (which uses the importin β pathway) and SV40-NLS-BSA (which uses the classic importin α pathway). The inhibition of Tat-NLS-BSA import was determined with and without the addition of cytosolic extract, because its nuclear uptake does not involve importin α (see above). Most of the peptides inhibited nuclear import of Tat-NLS-BSA but did not inhibit nuclear import of SV40-NLS-BSA (Fig.5). In almost all cases, inhibition of Tat-NLS-BSA nuclear uptake was more significant in the absence of cytosolic factors (compare the green and blue bars in Fig. 5). As mentioned above, the ARM, in addition to its NLS properties, functions as the RNA binding domain of the Tat and Rev proteins. We have determined whether the BC ARM mimetic peptides also exhibit RNA binding. Similar to the Tat-ARM, the Rev-ARM is responsible for nuclear uptake and for the specific binding of the protein to its corresponding RNA element, the RRE. The HIV-1 Rev protein facilitates the nuclear export of unspliced and singly spliced viral RNA by binding to the RRE. (31Pollard V.W. Malim M.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 491-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We have used the Rev-RRE experimental system to determine the RNA binding activity of the ARM mimetic peptides (32Kirk S.R. Luedtke N.W. Tor Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 980-981Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The ability of each peptide to displace a fluorescein-labeled Rev-ARM peptide (Rev-Fl) from the RRE is measured by monitoring changes in fluorescence anisotropy. All peptides tested are potent inhibitors of Rev-RRE binding (Table I) and are about two orders of magnitude more active than neomycin B (a well studiedin vivo and in vitro inhibitor of Rev-RRE complex formation) (33Zapp M.L. Stern S. Green M.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar).Table IBC ARM-mimetic peptides inhibit Rev ARM peptide-RRE interactionPeptideKi(nm)Tat-120 ± 10Tat-45 ± 4Tat-75 ± 4TAT115 ± 4Tat-155 ± 4Tat-165 ± 4Rev ARM1.4 ± 1Tat ARM20 ± 10Neomycin1100 ± 250Kanamycin B15000 ± 200Ki values were determined using fluorescence anisotropy techniques as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the binding stoichiometry for neomycin and kanamycin is unknown, only their IC50 values can be reported. Open table in a new tab Ki values were determined using fluorescence anisotropy techniques as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the binding stoichiometry for neomycin and kanamycin is unknown, only their IC50 values can be reported. We describe the application of the BC-P approach for the development of a BC peptide that functionally mimics the Tat-NLS. This peptide, “Tat11,” is able to mediate nuclear import of its BSA conjugate, probably by activating the importin β receptor. In the past, the BC-P approach yielded peptides that were inhibitory, displaying only antagonistic properties (1Kasher R. Oren D. Barda Y. Gilon C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,13Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 2E. Hariton-Gazal, D. Friedler, A. Friedler, N. Zakai, A. Loyter, and C. Gilon, unpublished results. Also, in the present work most of the BC Tat peptides displayed antagonistic properties, as demonstrated by their ability to inhibit receptor-mediated nuclear transport. However, only peptide Tat11 displayed agonistic properties as shown by its ability to mediate nuclear import. This is the first time that the BC-P approach has produced an agonistic peptide, which can activate a receptor. Because all BC Tat peptides have the same primary sequence, we assume that Tat11 is the only peptide that adopts a conformation capable of activating the importin β receptor, whereas the other antagonistic peptides might bind the receptor in conformations sufficient to inhibit but not to activate it. Peptide Tat11 is the first example of an NLS-proteinomimetic. Its BSA conjugate shows all the features of specific nuclear import; it is ATP-dependent and is inhibited by the corresponding free peptide. Tat11-mediated nuclear import is different from that of SV40-NLS-BSA import (which takes place in the common importin α pathway). It shows, however, similar characteristics to nuclear import mediated by the Tat-NLS, which proceeds via the importin β pathway (16Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both are energy-dependent processes and are competitively inhibited by the free Tat-NLS and Tat11 peptides, and both do not require the addition of cytosolic factors. The effect of adding cytosolic extract can yield information regarding the nuclear uptake machinery utilized by the NLS tested. During cell permeabilization, the cytosol, which contains soluble proteins (including importin α), leaks out of the cell. To reconstitute the transport system for the determination of importin α-mediated nuclear import (the “common” pathway), cytosolic extract should be added, otherwise nuclear uptake cannot take place because of lack of importin α. In contrast, when nuclear import is mediated by a direct binding to importin β (as is the case with the ARM), the addition of cytosolic extract inhibits nuclear import, because the added importin α competes for binding to importin β. Our results are consistent with those of Jans and co-workers (34Efthymiadis A. Briggs L.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1623-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and also with the observations that the nuclear import of Tat proceeds by a direct interaction with importin β (16Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), assuming that a significant portion of importin β remained attached to the NPC following cell permeabilization. The observation that the addition of cytosolic factors (containing importin α) strongly inhibited nuclear import of Tat11-NLS-BSA is explained by assuming that most of the importin β was saturated by importin α and was not available for binding the Tat11-BSA conjugate and mediate its nuclear uptake. The inhibition by cytosolic factors was much greater and could be observed more easily in the case of Tat11-BSA compared with the linear Tat-NLS-BSA. The rapid emergence of HIV variants that are resistant to protease and reverse-transcriptase inhibitors requires new strategies for antiretroviral therapy (35De-clercq E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 36Erickson J.W. Burt S.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 545-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The Tat protein is a key regulatory protein of HIV-1, and thus inhibition of its function is of therapeutic potential. Inhibition of Tat activity has been extensively researched and several families of small molecules that inhibit Tat activity via inhibition of the Tat-TAR binding have been reported (37Hsu M.C. Schutt A.D. Holly M. Slice L.W. Sherman M.I. Richman D.D. Potash M.J. Volsky D.J. Science. 1991; 254: 1799-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 38Michne W.F. et al.J. Med.

Retrovirol. 1998; 17: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our results indeed show (Fig. 5) that most of the BC peptides are inhibitors of nuclear uptake of Tat-NLS-BSA (the importin β pathway) but not of SV40-NLS-BSA (the importin α pathway). Thus, we have achieved selectivity and found inhibitors that are optimized only for the distinct pathway used by the Tat protein. Such inhibitors may serve as lead compounds for the development of molecules, which will selectively block nuclear import of the Tat protein, and thus might serve as anti-HIV lead compounds. In addition to NLS activity, Tat11 also has a high affinity for the RRE RNA (Ki = 5 nm). This presents the intriguing possibility that small molecules that bind RNA can be actively concentrated within the nucleus. Many small proteins (including Tat and Rev) are well under the molecular weight cut-off for passive diffusion but still enter the nucleus using active transport. The pharmacological use of small molecules that take advantage of active transport machinery could become an effective method to “target” nuclear RNA. Thus, Tat11 is a promising anti-HIV lead compound that can inhibit two critical protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions crucial to the viral life cycle 1) inhibition of Tat nuclear uptake and 2) inhibition of Rev-RRE binding. It is interesting to note that all cyclic peptides tested inhibited the Rev ARM-RRE interaction with Ki values in the low nanomolar range (Table I) and are more potent than the linear Tat-ARM and the known inhibitors neomycin and kanamycin. Although the peptides are derived from the Tat-ARM, they inhibited the interaction between the Rev-ARM and its corresponding RNA element. This is not surprising, because the Tat and Rev ARMs are homologous sequences. The observation that most of the peptides displayed a similar affinity to the RRE RNA might be explained by nonspecific electrostatic effects. However, the diminished activity of Tat1 (relative to the other Tat peptides) indicates that some conformational factors are important for RRE binding of the BC peptides. The selectivity of these peptides (relative to other RNA sequences) is currently being tested. The ARM is a protein sequence with a dual functionality. It functions both as an NLS and as an RNA binding domain. We assume that the different functions within the same segment protein, similar to small linear peptides, arise from conformational flexibility. The BC-P approach, which is based on the discovery of conformationally constrained bioactive peptides, is an appropriate solution to achieve selectivity between different functions. This was demonstrated here for the HIV-1 Tat ARM. Only peptide Tat-11 is an active NLS, whereas all of the peptides bound to RNA. Moreover, the bioactive conformation of the Tat NLS is not known, and solving the NMR structure of the mimetic Tat11 can shed light on it. Summary—In summary we have expanded the scope of the BC-P approach in the following ways: (a) We have developed a functional mimetic of a protein sequence using this method. (b) We have succeeded to develop a selective mimetic of a protein sequence with a dual function. 2) Tat11 is a lead compound, which could potentially inhibit HIV-1 life cycle by a dual mechanism: inhibition of nuclear import and of RNA binding. It has been demonstrated that the Tat-ARM is able to penetrate through the cell plasma membrane (42Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar), and thus it is expected that the bioavailability of the ARM mimetic compounds will be high. The optimization of the ARM mimetic Tat11 as a lead compound for the development of anti-HIV compounds is underway.

https://openalex.org/W2031953507,"Calcium agonists induce membrane depolarization in endothelial cells through an unknown mechanism. Present studies tested the hypothesis that pulmonary artery endothelial cells express a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channel activated by store-operated calcium entry to produce membrane depolarization. In the whole-cell configuration, voltage-clamped cells revealed a large non-inactivating, outwardly rectifying cationic current in the absence of extra- or intracellular Ca2+ that was reduced upon replenishment of Ca2+. The inward current was non-selective for K+, Na+, Cs+, and Rb+ and was not inhibited by high tetraethylammonium concentrations. cAMP and cGMP stimulated the current and changed the cation permeability to favor Na+. Moreover, 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated the current in voltage-clamped cells in the perforated patch mode. The cationic current was inhibited by the CNG channel blocker LY83,583, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction cloning identified expression of a CNG channel resembling that seen in olfactory neurons. Activation of store-operated calcium entry using thapsigargin increased a current through the CNG channel. Stimulation of the current paralleled pulmonary artery endothelial cell membrane depolarization, and both the current and membrane depolarization were abolished using LY83,583. Taken together, these data demonstrate activation of store-operated calcium entry stimulates a CNG channel producing membrane depolarization. Such membrane depolarization may contribute to slow feedback inhibition of store-operated calcium entry. Calcium agonists induce membrane depolarization in endothelial cells through an unknown mechanism. Present studies tested the hypothesis that pulmonary artery endothelial cells express a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channel activated by store-operated calcium entry to produce membrane depolarization. In the whole-cell configuration, voltage-clamped cells revealed a large non-inactivating, outwardly rectifying cationic current in the absence of extra- or intracellular Ca2+ that was reduced upon replenishment of Ca2+. The inward current was non-selective for K+, Na+, Cs+, and Rb+ and was not inhibited by high tetraethylammonium concentrations. cAMP and cGMP stimulated the current and changed the cation permeability to favor Na+.

Gq-coupled agonists accomplish these diverse functions partly through generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate which, upon binding its internal receptor, depletes intracellular calcium stores and activates a membrane calcium entry channel (2.Berridge M.J.

Although endothelial cells are non-excitable, membrane potential is a critical determinant of the magnitude of both store-operated calcium entry (7.Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and permeability (14.He P. Curry F.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1246-H1254PubMed Google Scholar, 15.He P. Curry F.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 2288-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) responses. Whereas hyperpolarization promotes calcium entry and permeability, depolarization reduces calcium entry and permeability. Activation of store-operated calcium entry by Gq-coupled agonists including bradykinin or Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors like thapsigargin cause an initial hyperpolarization attributed to activation of maxi- or intermediate KCa channels (16.Vaca L. Licea A. Possani L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C819-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hyperpolarization is transient but further promotes Ca2+entry by increasing the electrochemical driving force. A large, sustained depolarization occurs subsequently that reduces calcium entry. Mechanism(s) underlying this sustained depolarization are unknown with the exception that it is caused by neither KIRnor KCa channel activity and is La3+-sensitive, suggesting a Ca2+ dependence. Either Ca2+ or Na+ entry could produce membrane depolarization, and although several cationic conductances have been described in endothelial cells, putative channels mediating Ca2+ or Na+ entry are poorly understood (1.Moore T.M. Chetham P.M. Kelly J.J. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L203-L222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17.Nilius B. Verh. K Acad. Geneeskd Belg. 1998; 60: 215-250PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG)1 cation channels are permeable to both Ca2+ and Na+ and mediate membrane depolarization in neurons (18.Zufall F. Firestein S. Shepherd G.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 577-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19.Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 20.Finn J.T.

The membrane-depolarizing effect of CNG channels is well described in retina where physiologically high concentrations of cGMP constitutively activate the “dark” current (21.Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T.D.

More recently, CNG channels have been cloned from diverse tissues, including several brain regions, heart, kidney, testis, liver, and skeletal muscle (30.Weyand I. Godde M. Frings S. Weiner J.

However, in most of these cases a clear link between the CNG channel and a physiological function is unknown. Non-excitable endothelial cells have been shown to express CNG1 channels, and whereas their activation by calcium-elevating agents would be predicted to cause membrane depolarization, a functional role for CNG channels in endothelium has not been established (37.Yao X. Leung P.S. Kwan H.Y. Wong T.P. Fong M.W. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, studies were undertaken to determine whether endothelial cells express an endogenous CNG channel that mediates membrane depolarization following activation of store-operated calcium entry. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (CD strain, 350–400 g; Charles River) were euthanized by an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg of pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal, Abbott). After sternotomy, the heart and lungs were removed en bloc, and the pulmonary arterial segment between the heart and lung hili was dissected, split, and fixed onto a 35-mm plastic dish. Pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) were obtained from the intima by gentle scraping with a plastic cell lifter and were seeded onto a 100-mm Petri dish containing 10 ml of seeding medium (∼1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 + 10% fetal bovine serum). Cells were verified as endothelial by positive factor VIII staining and uptake of 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein. When the primary culture reached confluence, cells were passaged by trypsin digestion into 75-cm2 culture flasks (Corning), and standard tissue culture techniques were followed until the cells were used for experiments. Cells were studied between passages 6 and 20. Confluent rat PAECs were enzyme-dispersed, seeded onto 35-mm plastic culture dishes, and then allowed to re-attach for at least 24 h before patch clamp experiments were performed. Whole-cell and perforated patch clamp recordings were obtained from single (electrically isolated) rat PAECs, exhibiting a flat, polyhedral morphology. These cells were chosen for study because their morphology was consistent with rat PAECs from a confluent monolayer (38.Moore T.M. Brough G.H. Babal P. Kelly J.J. Li M. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L574-L582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conventional whole-cell and nystatin-perforated voltage-clamp configurations were performed to measure transmembrane currents in single rat PAEC by the standard giga-seal patch clamp technique. Perforated patch technique (39.Mistry D.K. Hablitz J.J. Brain Res. 1990; 535: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was applied to avoid disturbing the intracellular milieu of the cell, in particular resting cytosolic Ca2+. Conventional whole-cell recordings were used to dialyze the cell with our artificial “intracellular” solutions. For nystatin-perforated patch recording, the pipette was filled with nystatin containing intracellular solution and gentle suction applied to achieve giga-ohm resistance. The access resistance gradually decreased within 5 min after the giga-ohm seal was formed, and then the transmembrane current was recorded in the voltage-clamp mode when a steady value was achieved. Recording pipettes were manufactured from glass capillary tubes (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT), pulled by a two-stage puller (PC-10, Narishige Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and heat-polished before use. Pipette resistance was in the range of 2–5 megohms when filled with our intracellular solution. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). An EPC-9 patch clamps amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) was used to acquire data with Pulse/PulseFit software (HEKA) and filtered at 2.9 kHz. Patch clamp electrophysiological experiments were performed using two solutions, asymmetrical and symmetrical extra- and intracellular (pipette) solutions. Asymmetrical solutions contained (in mm) the following: for extracellular, 120 glutamic acid, 20 HEPES, and 1N-phenylanthranilic acid and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with tetraethylammonium (TEA) hydroxide; for intracellular, 145 potassium glutamate, 10 HEPES, 6 MgCl2 (pH 7.2, titrated with KOH). Symmetrical solutions contained (in mm) the following: for extracellular, 100 potassium methanesulfonate (KCH3SO3), 20 HEPES, 1N-phenylanthranilic acid, (pH 7.4 titrated with methane sulfonic acid); for intracellular, 100 potassium glutamate, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA (pH 7.2 titrated with KOH). The osmolality in all solutions was adjusted with sucrose to 290–300 mosm. The above asymmetrical extra- and intracellular solutions were used for both whole-cell and perforated patch recordings; however, in perforated patch recordings the intracellular solution was also supplemented with nystatin (100 μg ml−1). LY83,583 [6-(phenylamino)-5.8-quinolinedione] (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA) was prepared in ethanol. Working solutions were made fresh each use with final ethanol concentrations of less than 1% (v/v). Thapsigargin (Sigma) was prepared in Me2SO. Dilutions were made with final Me2SO concentrations of less than 0.1% (v/v). These concentrations of ethanol and Me2SO did not alter the electrophysiological characteristics of endothelial cells. Stock solutions of cAMP and 8-Br-cAMP were dissolved fresh in the extracellular solution. N-Phenylanthranilic acid was purchased from Fluka (Switzerland). Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Total RNA was isolated from a confluent, early passage 75-cm2 flask of rat PAECs by the RNeasy Total RNA (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) method. Approximately 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with or without 200 units of Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 42 °C. The first strand cDNA synthesis reactions were primed with an adapter primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the following sequence: 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT T-3′. PCR was performed with consequent reverse transcriptase products for 30 cycles (Profile: 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 1 min and 45 s; final extension 72 °C, 10 min) with the following primer set: (sense) 5′-TGA GTT CTT TGA CCG CAC TG-3′; (antisense) 5′-TTG ACA GCA TCA ATC TTG GC-3′. Following gel purification of PCR products, a second “nested” primer set was used: (sense) 5′-GGT CCT TTA CAT CTT GGT CAT C-3′ and (antisense) 5′-GAG GAC ACC AAT CAA GAA G-3′. The PCR profile was exactly as described above. PCR products were ligated directly into pCR2.1®-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli. Plasmids were isolated from positive clones (verified by PCR analysis) using the Qiaprep spin miniprep method (Qiagen, Inc.) and submitted to the Biopolymer Laboratory at the University of South Alabama for automated fluorescence sequence analysis (AB373XL DNA stretch sequencer). Sequence accuracy was confirmed by sequencing in both directions using double-stranded plasmids as templates with universal primers. Nucleotide and amino acid alignments were performed with the assistance of BLAST (NCBI) and DNASIS version 2.0 (Hitachi Software) programs. Confluent rat PAECs were loaded with 1 μm of the anionic potentially sensitive fluorescent dye, bis(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol, according to methods previously described (40.Stevens T. Cornfield D.N. McMurtry I.F. Rodman D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1416-H1421PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were studied with an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope at × 400 using a xenon arc lamp photomultiplier system (Photon Technologies Inc., Monmouth Junction, NJ), and data were acquired and analyzed with PTI Felix software. Cells (3.Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R157-R159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 4.Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) were excited by the xenon arc lamp (490 nm wavelength), and emission of epifluorescence at 520 nm (signal averaged) was measured. Total fluorescence intensity was adjusted by reducing the arc lamp illumination intensity to minimize photobleaching of the dye, although some degree of photobleaching still occurred during the experiment. Data were corrected for the calculated rates of photobleaching for each individual experiment. An estimation of the relationship between fluorescence intensity and change inE m was performed by exchanging the experimental physiologic salt solution (in mm, 11 d-glucose, 0.6 MgSO4, 1 KH2PO4, 4.7 KCl, 118 NaCl, 25 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, titrated to pH 7.35–7.45 using 11 NaOH) for a high [K+]-low [Na+] solution (in mm, 11 d-glucose, 0.6 MgSO4, 1 KH2PO4, 50 KCl, 68 NaCl, 25 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, titrated to pH 7.35–7.45 using 11 NaOH) and recording the resulting increase in fluorescence (depolarization). Confluent PAECs in 12-well plates were treated as indicated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES. Cyclic GMP in cell extracts was then determined by radioimmunoassay as described previously (41.Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial experiments were performed using voltage-clamped cells to test for the presence of cationic currents in PAECs. Fig.1 A shows membrane current traces and current-voltage (I-V) relationships recorded using symmetrical K+ methylsulfonate solutions, since CNG channels poorly discriminate between K+ and Na+(25.Frings S.

Current was measured for 200 ms at voltages ranging from −100 to +100 mV. PAECs exhibited a sustained (non-inactivating) current that was outwardly rectifying at positive voltages. As expected in symmetrical solutions, the reversal potential was 0 mV. Inclusion of tetraethylammonium in the patch pipette did not alter the K+ current (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, 4-aminopyridine did not inhibit the current (data not shown), indicating the K+ conductance was not due to KIR or KCa channel activity. We next examined the permeability ratio to monovalent cations. Ion replacement studies were performed using Rb+ and Cs+. In these experiments, intracellular K+methylsulfonate (100 mm) was replaced with either 100 mm Rb+ nitrate or 100 mmCs+ methylsulfonate. These replacements resulted in a 22 and 60% decrease in conductance, respectively, indicating the permeability ratio was K+ (1.Moore T.M. Chetham P.M. Kelly J.J. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L203-L222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) > Rb+(0.8) > Cs+ (0.4). Because the anionic carrier for Rb+ was different from Cs+, we performed studies to examine the anionic contribution to the current. Studies were conducted using both 100 mm K+ glutamate and methylsulfonate. The magnitude of the K+ current was slightly associated with its predominant anion. For example, the outward K+ conductance at +100 mV was 12.3 ± 1.04 pA/picofarads when glutamate was the anion and 15.0 ± 2.47 when methylsulfonate was the anion, suggesting the presence of an anionic conductance that contributed to the current. We performed ion replacement studies using symmetrical K+, Cs+, and Na+ in a glutamate solution (Fig.2). Under these conditions the inward permeability ratio was K+ (1.Moore T.M. Chetham P.M. Kelly J.J. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L203-L222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) > Na+(0.6) > Cs+ (0.5), and the outward permeability ratio was K+ (1.Moore T.M. Chetham P.M. Kelly J.J. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L203-L222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) > Cs+ (0.4) > Na+ (0.1). Taken together, these findings suggest the presence of a current conducted through a non-selective cation channel. Conductance of monovalent cations through some non-selective cation channels is inhibited by Ca2+ and Mg2+. We tested whether Ca2+ and Mg2+ regulate the K+ current observed presently. Fig.3 shows the K+ current magnitude was similarly inhibited by either of the divalent cations tested, irrespective of whether Ca2+ or Mg2+were placed in the intra- or extracellular pipette solutions. Thus, the K+-conducting channel exhibits features of divalent cation block. To address putative non-selective channel(s) that may mediate the observed cationic current, we investigated the effect of cAMP on the I-Vprofile, within a physiologically relevant range of voltages. Inclusion of cAMP in the internal solution increased the cation current (Fig.4 A) and altered the ion permeability where Na+ conductance was favored over K+ and Cs+ (Fig. 4 B; TableI). This change in ion permeability induced by cAMP resembles the slip-mode conductance observed in tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels (47.Santana L.F. Gomez A.M. Lederer W.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The outwardly rectifying nature of the I-V plot illustrated in Figs. 1 and2 and the permeability ratio favoring Na+ in the presence of cAMP generally resemble the electrophysiological profile previously described in both endogenous CNG channels and overexpressed CNG2 channels (18.Zufall F. Firestein S. Shepherd G.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 577-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Importantly, cyclic nucleotide increased the current within a physiologically relevant range of voltages.Table IK = 1 inward current ± cAMP at −100 mV testing potentialcAMPK+Cs+Na++10.511.69−10.450.63 Open table in a new tab CNG channels are non-selective cation channels recently shown to be expressed in diverse cell types (30.Weyand I.

Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since cAMP stimulated the cationic current similar to CNG channels of the olfactory neuron, RT-PCR cloning was performed to address whether PAECs express CNG2 channels. Primers were designed to isolate the pore region of CNG channels based upon the rat olfactory neuron sequence (48.Dhallan R.S. Yau K.W. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). RT-PCR revealed a single product of predicted size (253-base pair fragment) from both rat PAEC and rat kidney total RNA. The cloned PAEC product was 100% identical to the rat olfactory (CNG2) channel. Deduced amino acid sequence from PAECs was compared with rat olfactory (CNG2), gustatory (CNG1), and rod (CNG3) α subunits (Fig. 5 B). By using physiological salt solutions, we examined the function of endogenously expressed CNG channels in PAECs. Voltage-clamped cells exhibited a limited degree of run-down over 10 min (data not shown). Inclusion of thapsigargin in the patch pipette increased the current 300% above control values and right-shifted the reversal potential, consistent with stimulation of either a Na+ or Ca2+ current (Fig. 6). The thapsigargin-stimulated current progressively increased over time until its peak was reached 3 min after establishing a seal; this peak increase in current was stable until completion of the experiment (data not shown). We next examined whether the cationic current was inhibited by LY83,583, a potent CNG channel blocker (49.Leinders-Zufall T. Rand M.N. Shepherd G.M. Greer C.A. Zufall F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4136-4148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Leinders-Zufall T. Zufall F. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 2759-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), by using physiological salt solutions. PAECs were incubated for 15 min in the presence of 40 μm extracellular LY83,583 prior to establishing a seal. Cells incubated with LY83,583 exhibited a 54% lower K+conductance at +100 mV than did the untreated cells (Fig.7). Moreover, LY83,583 inhibited the current induced by both cAMP and thapsigargin, to the level obtained in control experiments, suggesting that cAMP and thapsigargin activate a similar CNG channel (Fig. 8). To confirm this idea further, maximal concentrations of cAMP and thapsigargin were applied together in the patch pipette. The combined application of cAMP and thapsigargin did not produce an additive increase in current (Fig.8 C). Taken together, these results support the idea that PAECs possess a CNG channel that regulates cationic conductance.Figure 8Inhibition of CNG channels prevents cAMP and thapsigargin from activating an inward cationic current.Current-voltage relationships recorded 10 min after the whole-cell configuration was established in the absence (closed circles) and presence (open circles) of 40 μm LY83,583. PAECs were pretreated with LY83,583 for 15 min before establishing the whole-cell configuration. A,inclusion of 400 μm cAMP in the patch pipette stimulated an inward cationic current. The current stimulated by cAMP was abolished by LY83,583 (p < 0.05). B,thapsigargin (1 μm) stimulated an inward cationic current that was also abolished by LY83,583 (p < 0.05).C, inclusion of both cAMP (400 μm) and thapsigargin (1 μm) to the patch pipette did not produce an additive increase in current density.

We investigated RAFTK and FAK signaling upon nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation of PC12 cells. NGF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in a time- and dose-dependent manner, whereas no change in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was observed. Chemical inhibition showed that RAFTK phosphorylation was inhibited by blocking phospholipase Cγ activity or intracellular Ca2+. Blocking of extracellular Ca2+ or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity partially reduced the phosphorylation of RAFTK. In addition, disruption of actin polymerization abolished RAFTK phosphorylation, indicating that an intact actin-based cytoskeletal organization is required for RAFTK phosphorylation. The focal adhesion molecule paxillin was co-immunoprecipitated with RAFTK, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was increased in a Ca2+-dependent manner upon NGF stimulation. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that RAFTK translocated from the cytoplasm to potential neurite initiation sites at the cell periphery, where RAFTK co-localized with paxillin and bundled actin in the early phase (within 5 min) of NGF stimulation, whereas FAK co-localized with paxillin at “point contacts,” which are the primary cell adhesion sites in neuronal cells. Significant distribution of RAFTK was observed in the neurites and growth cones of differentiated PC12 cells. Furthermore, potassium depolarization induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of both RAFTK and paxillin in an intracellular Ca2+-dependent manner in the differentiated PC12 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RAFTK is involved in NGF-induced cytoskeletal organization and may play a role in neurite and growth cone function(s).

RAFTK is highly expressed in the central nervous system and in neuronal cell lines, including PC12 cells (1.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B.

Studies have shown activation of RAFTK upon treatment with various neuronal stimuli, such as membrane depolarization and the neuropeptide bradykinin (1.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role of RAFTK in neuronal cell signaling. NGF is a neurotropic factor inducing neuronal cell growth, survival, and the differentiation of distinct populations of neurons through activation of the NGF receptor, TrkA (12.Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 13.Klein R. Jing S.Q. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M.

Neuron. 1992; 9: 1053-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NGF-induced neuronal responses and neuronal differentiation have been extensively studied in a pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12), which can generate action potentials when grown in the continual presence of NGF (15.Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar, 16.Toledo-Aral J.J. Brehm P. Halegoua S. Mandel G. Neuron. 1995; 14: 607-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Among the rapid cellular changes observed is actin-cytoskeletal reorganization upon NGF stimulation (17.Paves H. Neuman T. Metsis M. Saarma M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). NGF stimulation induces the formation of ruffles with actin redistribution within a few minutes, followed by condensation of actin bundles to several dot-like aggregates that subsequently become the growth cones (18.Sano M. Iwanaga M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This implies that a variety of molecular machinery is required to accomplish the actin reorganization, such as actin polymerization, bundle formation, and actin targeting to the plasma membrane. One of the intracellular signals that might be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization during NGF stimulation is Ca2+ mobilization. NGF induces both extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (19.Pandiella-Alonso A. Malgaroli A. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20.Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Calcium has also been implicated in cell growth, survival, cell death, and neural functions including excitability, neurotransmitter release, associativity, plasticity, and gene transcription (21.Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in PC12 cells upon NGF stimulation. Paxillin, a cytoskeletal protein and focal adhesion molecule, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon integrin engagement to the extracellular matrix and associates with focal adhesions (22.Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin has also been observed upon treatment with a variety of stimuli, and paxillin is capable of binding to another cytoskeletal protein, vinculin, as well as the signaling proteins Csk, Crk, Src, p125FAK, and RAFTK (23.Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 24.Turner C.E. Int J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of paxillin reveals the presence of (i) three tyrosine residues within the binding motif for the Crk SH2 domain (YXXP), (ii) a proline-rich motif that could serve as an SH3 binding domain, and (iii) four motifs identified or very closely related to LIM domains (25.Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that paxillin associates with cell adhesion molecules and with the cytoskeleton and recruits these molecules into a signal transduction complex, near the plasma membrane, that acts as a scaffold molecule (24.Turner C.E. Int J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Induction of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and its enhanced expression during neuronal differentiation indicate a possible role of paxillin in neuronal differentiation (26.Leventhal P.S. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5957-5960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since RAFTK activation is induced by Ca2+ mobilization and is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (22.Avraham H. Park S. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), the signaling of RAFTK and its homologous tyrosine kinase FAK and their role as mediators of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization during NGF signaling were investigated. Here, we report that RAFTK, but not FAK, is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon NGF stimulation of PC12 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. NGF-induced RAFTK phosphorylation is dependent on PLCγ activity, Ca2+mobilization, an intact actin-based cytoskeleton, and partially on PI3-K activity. RAFTK associates with paxillin inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in a Ca2+-dependent manner and translocates from the cytoplasm to the cell periphery upon NGF stimulation, whereas FAK associates with paxillin at the plasma membrane and is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion. Furthermore, RAFTK and paxillin localize at the neurites and growth cones in differentiated PC12 cells and are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon the induction of increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels by potassium depolarization. This suggests that RAFTK may play an important role in NGF-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and in neurite and growth cone function(s). Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium).

Specific antibodies (R4250) against RAFTK were generated by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with a bacterially expressed fusion protein consisting of GST and the COOH terminus (amino acids 681–1009) of the human RAFTK cDNA subcloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector as described (6.Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RAFTK cDNA in the pcDNA3-neo vector was constructed as described in our previous studies (4.Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L.M. White R.A. Groopman J.E.

A kinase-negative mutant of RAFTK (km) was constructed by replacing Lys-475 with an Ala residue using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The GFP-tagged wild-type (wt) or kinase mutant (km) RAFTK was subsequently prepared by subcloning the RAFTK constructs in a pEGFP-C2 vector according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). PC12 cells were transiently transfected with either the GFP-tagged wild-type or kinase mutant RAFTK construct as described (6.Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 72 h of transfection, the cells were stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml, for 5 min at 37 °C). Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-RAFTK antibodies or control antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were washed and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation as described below. Wild-type and mutant TrkA cDNA constructs were prepared using a Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (27.Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. Dikic I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15059-15065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). TrkA double mutants contain tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at the PLCγ association site Tyr-785 and the p85/PI3-K interaction site Tyr-751 (Y785F/Y751F), at the Tyr-785 and the Shc interaction site Tyr-490 (Y785F/Y490F), or at the Tyr-751 and Tyr-490 (Y751F/Y490F). The paxillin cDNA tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) in the pRcCMV vector was kindly provided by R. Salgia and J. D. Griffin (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). Transient transfection of cDNA constructs into 293 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 2 μg of TrkA cDNA and 0.5 μg of RAFTK cDNA were used for each 100-mm dish of 293 cells. Empty vector cDNA was used as a transfection control. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were starved for 6 h in serum-free medium followed by NGF (50 ng/ml, 5 min) stimulation. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, followed by immunoblotting as described below. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4and 1 mm NaF). Immunoprecipitations were performed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies of anti-RAFTK (R4250) and anti-FAK (R4714) (4.Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L.M. White R.A. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27742-27751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), followed by protein G incubation. Immunoprecipitates were separated by either gradient (4–12%) or 8% SDS-PAGE (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) under reducing conditions, electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and processed for immunoblotting using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitated complexes, obtained by immunoprecipitating cell lysates with RAFTK antiserum and protein G, were washed twice with modified RIPA buffer and once in kinase buffer. The immune complex was then incubated in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 30 min as described (28.Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling the sample for 5 min. Proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiographs. The activities were determined by densitometry of autoradiographys. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. ERK kinase activity was determined by incubating 300 μg of cellular extracts with 1 μg of anti-ERK1 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of protein G-agarose and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein G beads were then washed thoroughly before the addition of 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μm ATP) containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μg of myelin basic protein as a substrate protein. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reactions were stopped with Laemmli buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 2 days in the presence or absence of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM (50 μm). Changes in cell morphology were observed, and images of PC12 cells were taken under an inverted light microscope (Olympus CK2) with an attached camera (Olympus SC35). Tissue-cultured cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. After being blocked with 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, cells were incubated with specific primary antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-, rhodamine-, or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies after washing in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h each. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was used for actin staining. The samples were analyzed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope. To test the effect of NGF on RAFTK and FAK, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK and FAK upon NGF stimulation of PC12 cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK was induced by NGF in a time-dependent manner, peaking at 5 min (Fig. 1 A), whereas that of FAK was constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated at a high level and showed no change in phosphorylation upon NGF stimulation. This suggests that RAFTK, but not FAK, is specifically involved in NGF-mediated signaling cascades (Fig. 1 B). Next, we analyzed the dose response of RAFTK phosphorylation upon stimulation with various concentrations of NGF. RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation was dose-dependent, reaching a peak at 10 ng/ml NGF (Fig.1 C). However, FAK showed no change in phosphorylation when cells were treated with various concentrations of NGF (data not shown). RAFTK kinase activity was examined to see whether phosphorylation of RAFTK leads to its activation upon NGF stimulation (Fig.1 D). In vitro autophosphorylation of RAFTK showed a significant increase in RAFTK kinase activity (30% increase), suggesting that NGF induces RAFTK kinase activation as well as its tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these data indicate that NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation are specific to RAFTK, but not FAK, in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. To delineate the signaling cascades leading to RAFTK activation by NGF, the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK was examined in the presence of specific inhibitors of the downstream signaling molecules of the TrkA receptors. When NGF binds to its receptor TrkA, the autophosphorylated receptors associate with PLCγ, Shc, and the p85 subunit of PI3-K through a specific interaction between the SH2 domains and their specific phosphotyrosine residues (29.Obermeier A.

In our study, the NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK was partially inhibited by a PI3-K-specific inhibitor, LY294002, or wortmannin (Fig.2, A and E). The effectiveness of LY294002 and wortmannin, specific inhibitors of PI3-K, was shown by the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (active form) which is downstream of PI3-K activation upon NGF stimulation (Fig.2 E). U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, blocked the phosphorylation of RAFTK upon NGF stimulation (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that NGF-induced RAFTK phosphorylation is mediated through PLCγ which is known to induce intracellular Ca2+increase and protein kinase C activation by producing inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, respectively. Next, we examined whether RAFTK phosphorylation is induced through IP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ increase from the endoplasmic reticulum and/or through diacylglycerol-mediated protein kinase C activation. Fig. 2 A demonstrates that BAPTA/AM, a cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator, abolishes RAFTK phosphorylation. However, chelerylthrine chloride (CC), a protein kinase C-specific inhibitor, had no effect on RAFTK phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A), indicating that RAFTK phosphorylation is mediated through PLCγ, IP3, and intracellular [Ca2+]i increase. Fig. 2 D shows that CC is effective in inhibiting the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. Since Shc is known to associate with Grb2 and transmits signals to Ras, we examined whether Shc is associated with RAFTK. However, we were not able to detect any direct association between Shc and RAFTK in PC12 cells (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that NGF induces extracellular calcium influx in several cell lines including PC12 cells (20.Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and that RAFTK is highly phosphorylated upon treatment of cells with various Ca2+-inducing agents (1.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R.

Therefore, we examined the effect of extracellular Ca2+ influx on RAFTK phosphorylation using the Ca2+ chelator, EGTA. EGTA significantly reduced the NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that NGF-induced extracellular Ca2+ influx contributes to the phosphorylation of RAFTK. In comparison, FAK remains at a high level of tyrosine phosphorylation and fails to respond to NGF regardless of treatment with various inhibitors (Fig. 2 B). These data demonstrate that RAFTK activation is mediated through intracellular signaling cascades of the TrkA receptor, PLCγ, IP3, through intracellular Ca2+increase, and partially through PI3-K and extracellular Ca2+ influx upon NGF stimulation of PC12 cells. To investigate a possible connection between RAFTK and the actin-based cytoskeleton, cells were treated with the specific actin microfilament inhibitor cytochalasin D (1 μm) for 2 h prior to NGF stimulation. Fig.2 C shows that cytochalasin D inhibits the NGF-induced phosphorylation of RAFTK, indicating that intact actin-based cytoskeletal organization is required for this NGF-induced phosphorylation of RAFTK. To confirm the signaling cascades observed in our study using the specific pharmacological inhibitors, 293 cells which express neither TrkA nor RAFTK were transiently transfected with the following: RAFTK cDNA and wild-type or mutant TrkA cDNA having double tyrosine-phenylalanine mutations at the PLCγ and the p85/PI3-K interaction sites (Y785F/Y751F), at the PLCγ and the Shc interaction sites (Y785F/Y490F), or at the p85/PI3-K and the Shc interaction sites (Y751F/Y490F). Our results demonstrated that wild-type TrkA induced RAFTK phosphorylation upon NGF stimulation, whereas no effects were observed with the pcDNA3 vector alone (Fig.3). Cells transfected with TrkA double mutated at the p85- and the Shc-binding sites (Y751F/Y490F) or double mutated at the PLCγ- and the Shc-binding sites (Y785F/Y490F) retained RAFTK phosphorylation upon NGF stimulation. However, cells transfected with TrkA double mutated at the PLCγ- and the p85-binding sites (Y785F/Y751F) showed abolishment of most of the RAFTK phosphorylation, demonstrating that both PLCγ and PI3-K are involved in the RAFTK phosphorylation.

In order to obtain further evidence for this mechanism, we have solved the structure of this iPGM complexed with 2-phosphoglycerate and two Mn2+ ions at 1.7-Å resolution. The structure consists of two different domains connected by two loops and interacting through a network of hydrogen bonds. This structure is consistent with the proposed mechanism for iPGM catalysis, with the two main steps in catalysis being a phosphatase reaction removing the phosphate from 2- or 3-phosphoglycerate, generating an enzyme-bound phosphoserine intermediate, followed by a phosphotransferase reaction as the phosphate is transferred from the enzyme back to the glycerate moiety. The structure also allowed the assignment of the function of the two domains of the enzyme, one of which participates in the phosphatase reaction and formation of the phosphoserine enzyme intermediate, with the other involved in the phosphotransferase reaction regenerating phosphoglycerate. Significant structural similarity has also been found between the active site of the iPGM domain catalyzing the phosphatase reaction and Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase.

Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar). There are two distinct types of PGMs, bisphosphoglycerate mutase and monophosphoglycerate mutase, and only the first type has the ability to perform all of the reactions listed above, while monophosphoglycerate mutases catalyze primarily the interconversion of 3PGA and 2PGA in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. There are also two classes of monophosphoglycerate mutases that are distinguished by their requirement for 23PGA for catalysis (1Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fraser H.I. Kratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The PGMs requiring 23PGA for catalysis are termed 23PGA-dependent and are the predominant PGM in mammals, yeast, and some bacteria. They also have the ability to perform all reactions noted above but at significantly different rates. The monophosphoglycerate mutases that do not require DPG for catalysis are termed 23PGA-independent (iPGMs) and are the predominant PGM in plants and some other bacteria, including endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria and their close relatives; iPGMs, unlike cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases and bisphosphoglycerate mutases, can only carry out the interconversion of 2PGA and 3PGA (1Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar, 3Carreras J. Mezquita J. Bosch J. Bartrons R. Pons G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

The two classes of monophosphoglycerate mutases are extremely different in amino acid sequence, catalytic mechanism, and structure, both tertiary and quaternary. Despite the differences between these two types of PGMs, the iPGMs all have very conserved amino acid sequences, as do the cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases; the cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases are also very similar in sequence to bisphosphoglycerate mutases, reflecting their likely similarity in structure and in function (1Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar, 5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another difference between the cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases and iPGMs is that there is no metal ion requirement for catalysis by cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases (or bisphosphoglycerate mutases), while at least some iPGMs, including the enzymes of endospore-forming bacteria, have an absolute and specific requirement for Mn2+ ions for catalysis, which makes the activity of these enzymes exquisitely sensitive to pH (1Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chander M. Setlow B. Setlow P. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 759-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6Kuhn NJ.

This pH sensitivity is physiologically relevant, since it allows for the regulation of iPGM activity during different parts of the developmental cycle of these organisms. During sporulation, the pH in the developing spore falls to ∼6.5, which decreases the activity of this cell's iPGM, allowing for accumulation of 3PGA, which is stored in the dormant spore; this 3PGA is then utilized for ATP synthesis during spore germination, when the pH in the germinating spore rapidly rises to 7.5–8 (9Magill N.G. Cowan A.E. Koppel D.E. Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2252-2258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Magill N.G. Cowan A.E. Leyva-Vazquez M.A. Brown M. Koppel D.E. Setlow P. J.

Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 20-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The iPGMs of non-spore-forming organisms that are closely related to spore formers also require Mn2+ for catalysis, suggesting that all iPGMs are related evolutionarily to an ancestral metal ion-requiring iPGM (4Chander M. Setlow B. Setlow P. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 759-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the iPGMs of some organisms (e.g. Escherichia coli, whose iPGM contains Mn2+ (2Fraser H.I. Kratskhelia M. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and plants for which the Mn2+ requirement is not yet clear) may have lost the extreme pH sensitivity of their enzyme activity during evolution (13Botha F.C. Dennis D.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), since this pH dependence may have no physiological importance. The structure and general mechanism of catalysis of cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutases were established a number of years ago (1Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rigden D.J. Alexeev D. Phillips S.E.V. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but until recently there was no corresponding information on iPGMs, although over 20 years ago crystals were obtained of at least one iPGM that might have allowed structural studies using x-ray crystallography (see appendix of Ref.15Gatehouse J.A. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). However, the structure of Bacillus stearothermophilus iPGM complexed with its 3PGA substrate as well as with two Mn2+ ions was recently solved by x-ray crystallography at 1.9-Å resolution (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analysis of this structure located the two Mn2+ ions and the 3PGA in the enzyme's active site and allowed formulation of a likely catalytic mechanism that utilizes a phosphoserine-enzyme intermediate. In addition to information obtained by analysis of the structure of the 3PGA-iPGM complex, the proposed mechanism was also consistent with the effects on enzyme activity of a number of site-directed mutations altering residues in or near the active site. However, another important source of information on which the proposed catalytic mechanism was based were studies in which the 2PGA substrate/product was modeled in the active site of the enzyme. Since the latter information was obtained only from modeling studies, we decided to obtain further information relevant to our understanding of the mechanism for this iPGM by determining the crystal structure of B. stearothermophilus iPGM complexed with 2PGA. With this latter information, there will be two structures available, which have both substrates/products bound in the active site of this iPGM, thus closing the catalytic cycle originating with 3PGA and finishing with 2PGA or vice versa. The availability of the structural details of 2PGA binding in the active site of the enzyme, in contrast to the modeled information previously available, further allowed definitive assignment of specific mechanistic functions to different parts of the enzyme. Since previous work had indicated that there is some limited sequence similarity between the metal binding regions of E. colialkaline phosphatase (AP) and iPGMs (16Galperin M.Y. Bairoch A. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), 2M. J. Jedrzejas and P. Setlow, submitted for publication. 2M. J. Jedrzejas and P. Setlow, submitted for publication. we also manually compared the structure of the active site of B. stearothermophilus iPGM with that of the active site of E. coli AP and have found striking structural similarity, but limited only to these regions of the two proteins. Since the catalytic mechanism for E. coli AP has been studied in great detail (18Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 19Stec B. Hehir M.J. Brennan C. Nolte M. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the similarity in the part of the active site structure between AP and iPGM is discussed in view of the mechanism proposed for iPGMs. B. stearothermophilus iPGM was obtained as described previously (20Chander M. Setlow P. Lamani E. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm EDTA and concentrated to 25 mg/ml. The 2PGA complex with iPGM was crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (21McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Molecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar) and 24-well Linbro culture plates. The crystallization drops contained equal volumes (1–2 μl) of the enzyme, 150 mm 2PGA in water, and the reservoir solution. The drops were equilibrated against 0.3 ml of reservoir solution, which contained 2.1 mammonium sulfate and 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.7, 25 mm zinc acetate, 20 mm CsCl2, 3% polyethylene glycol 200, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Diffraction quality crystals were obtained in less than a week, and they diffracted x-rays to 1.7-Å resolution; the presence of 2PGA was essential for crystallization. For the diffraction experiments, the crystals were cryoprotected using 23% ethylene glycol (v/v), 2.5m ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.7, and flash frozen at −170 °C in a nitrogen stream using a Cryostream Cooler (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). The x-ray diffraction data were collected at the Argonne National Laboratory, Advanced Photon Source, beamline 19-ID of the Structural Biology Center at an x-ray wavelength of 1.1 Å, and a 1.7-Å resolution diffraction data set was obtained. The data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 package (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The unit cell of the crystals was determined to be as follows: a = 58.41 Å, b = 205.69 Å, c = 123.71 Å with the orthorhombic space group C2221. The crystal volume per unit of molecular weight was consistent with one molecule of the enzyme in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 63% (23Mathews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7911) Google Scholar). The space group as well as the cell parameters for the crystals of the iPGM·2PGA·Mn2+ complex were isomorphous to those of the iPGM·3PGA·Mn2+ complex (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Chander M. Setlow P. Lamani E. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and thus molecular replacement was not needed for the initial phase determination. The rigid body refinements (24Brunger A.T. X-plor Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) of the protein component of the iPGM·3PGA·Mn2+ complex structure against the diffraction data set from the iPGM·2PGA·Mn2+ crystals was sufficient. The R free procedure, using a data set containing 5% of the total unique reflections, was used to judge the refinement progress (25Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar). The R crystafter such refinements decreased to 0.35, whereas the R free was 0.39. After manual inspection and evaluation of the model using the graphics program QUANTA (26Molecular SimulationsQUANTA. Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA1997Google Scholar), adjustments to the protein model were made followed by refinements using the X-plor least-squares procedures (24Brunger A.T. X-plor Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar), after which the R cryst decreased to 0.30. Using the 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps, the geometry of the structure was reexamined using a Ramachandran plot (27Laskowski R. Macarthur M. Moss D. Thomton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar), and the model was corrected manually as above. The bulk solvent correction and the overall B-factor corrections were then applied to the data during the subsequent structure refinement using the molecular dynamics procedures of the X-plor protocol (24Brunger A.T. X-plor Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). Two Mn2+ ions were located between the two domains of the structure using [vert]Fo −Fc[vert] electron density maps with a 6ς cut-off. The simulated annealing omit maps (25Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar) calculated in the region where the 2PGA was expected to bind (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were used to examine as well as to locate and place the 2PGA in the enzyme's active site. The topology and parameter files for 2PGA were generated using standard files based on the energetically expected values for the distances and angles between atoms of 2PGA provided in the Quanta program (26Molecular SimulationsQUANTA. Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA1997Google Scholar). Subsequently, another round of least-squares and molecular dynamics refinements was performed followed by individual B-factor refinements (25Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3855) Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were added to the model based on the inspection of the 3ς level [vert]Fo −Fc[vert] map and the analysis of the contacts with either the protein or with the 2PGA. The stereochemistry of the model examined using the Ramachandran plot (27Laskowski R. Macarthur M. Moss D. Thomton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar) does not contain any residues outside of the energetically allowed areas. Figures were drawn using Ribbons software (28Carson M.J. J. Mol. Graph. 1987; 5: 103-106Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The conserved regions of the B. stearothermophilus iPGM and E. coli AP sequences were aligned based on the structural alignment of the active site residues of both enzymes. All manipulations as well as a least-squares refinement of the structure-based alignment were performed using the graphics program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.-T Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). All 14 segments encompassing 149 amino acid residues were superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 1.67 Å. However, all sequence-based alignment methods that were tried failed to recognize most of these similarities between these two enzymes. The crystal structure of the B. stearothermophilus iPGM·2PGA complex was solved at 1.7-Å resolution using the structure of the iPGM·3PGA complex as a model (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Chander M. Setlow P. Lamani E. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The iPGM·2PGA structure consists of residues from Lys3 to Val510, two Mn2+ ions, 2PGA, and 172 water molecules (Fig. 1). Ser2 and the last residue, Lys511, were not included in the final model due to the lack of their corresponding electron density. The Ramachandran plot analysis (27Laskowski R. Macarthur M. Moss D. Thomton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-290Crossref Google Scholar) showed no residues, even in loop areas, in the energetically disallowed regions.

Open table in a new tab As found previously for the iPGM·3PGA·Mn2+ complex, the B. stearothermophilus iPGM·2PGA·Mn2+ complex assumes a compact, globular shape with two domains, A (Lys3–Ala71 and Thr316–Val510) and B (Leu79–Tyr305). Both domains have similar folds consisting of a central eight-stranded β-sheet structure flanked by α-helices, eight in domain A and nine in domain B. Overall, this iPGM assumes an α/β type structure (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Sternberg M.J.E. Cohen F.E. Taylor W.R. Feldmann R.J. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1981; 293: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both domains have complementary surfaces, and they interact through a network of hydrogen bond interactions and are connected by two loops, Gly72–Ser78 and Val306–Asn315. There is a well defined solvent-, metal ion-, and substrate accessible cleft between the two domains. The sides of this cleft are lined by residues primarily from the loops connecting α-helices and β-strands of both domains. Both Mn2+ ions, Mn1 and Mn2, and 2PGA are located in this cleft (Fig. 1). The phosphate of 2PGA and both Mn1 and Mn2 interact with residues of domain A, and the phosphate interacts only with Arg261 from domain A, while the glycerate end of the substrate interacts with residues only from domain B. Both Mn2+ binding sites are located in a crevice between strands of domain A. The ordered water molecules are located either on the enzyme's surface or inside the interdomain cleft. The active site is well defined and is composed of 15 amino acid residues interacting with 2PGA, Mn1, or Mn2 (Fig. 2 A). The amino acid residues originate from both domains: Asp12, Ser62, Lys336, Asp403, His407, Asp444, His445, His462 in domain A and His123, Arg153, Asp154, Arg185, Arg191, Arg261, and Arg264 in domain B (Fig. 2 A and TableII). The residues interacting directly with Mn1 are Asp403, His407, and His462 (average Mn1 to ligand distance of 2.17 Å), and residues interacting directly with Mn2 are Asp12 (both NE1 and NE2 atoms), Ser62, His444, and His445 (average Mn2 to ligand distance of 2.37 Å). Mn1 also interacts with two phosphate oxygen atoms, O1P and O3P, of 2PGA (average distance of 2.46 Å) (Fig. 2 A and TableIII). The common coordinating hard ligands of Mn2+ ions are carboxylates of aspartate residues and nitrogens of histidines, although other ligands are sometimes encountered; these include oxygens of serine residues and phosphate groups on substrates (31Pearson R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 3533-3539Crossref Scopus (8063) Google Scholar, 32Christianson D.W. Cox J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 35-57Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The geometry of ligand coordination to both Mn2+ ions is distorted square pyramidal, which is typical for Mn2+ ions (Fig. 2 A and Table III) (32Christianson D.W. Cox J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 35-57Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 33Christianson D.W. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 217-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The apex coordination is occupied by the NE2 nitrogen atom of His462 for Mn1 and by the OG oxygen atom of Ser62 for Mn2. Additional interactions that are important for catalysis (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) are the bidentate interaction of Arg261with the phosphate group oxygens O2P and O4P (average distance of 2.81 Å) as well as the bidentate interaction of Arg264 with the substrate carboxyl group (average distance of 2.87 Å) (Table II). The O3P phosphate group's oxygen atom semibridges the two Mn2+ions with a Mn2 to O3P distance of 3.33 Å and an O3P to Mn1 distance of 2.32 Å; the Mn1-O3P-Mn2 angle is 134.0° (Fig.2 A, Table III).Table IIInteractions in the active site of B. stearothermophilus iPGMAtom (residue)Atom (residue)DomainDistance2PGA with proteinÅO1ANE2 (His123)B2.69NH1 (Arg191)B3.25NE (Arg264)B2.68O1BWat63 (water)2.64NH2 (Arg264)B3.06O3NE2 (His123)B3.37OD1 (Asp154)B2.62OD2 (Asp154)B2.87NH2 (Arg185)B3.37NH1 (Arg185)B3.04O1P (ester)Wat632PGA3.31NE2 (His462)A3.37O2PN (Ser62)A2.75NH1 (Arg261)A2.82CE1 (His462)A3.18O3POG (Ser62)A2.63Nz (Lys336)A2.86OD2 (Asp403)A3.22O4POG (Ser62)A3.07NH2 (Arg261)B2.80Nz (Lys336)A2.95POG (Ser62)A3.18Wat63 (water) with protein/substrateO1P2PGA3.37O1B2PGA2.64NH2 (Arg191)A3.19NH2 (Arg153)A2.74OD2 (Asp403)A3.02SD (Met404)A2.98CD2 (His407)A3.37Selected protein with proteinN2 (Lys336) AOG (Ser62)A2.49 Open table in a new tab Table IIICoordination of Mn2+ ions in the iPGM · 2PGA complexMetalLigand (residue)DistanceLigand-metal-ligand AngleHis407His462O1PO3PÅdegreesMn1OD1 (Asp403)2.08106.5104.3158.8100.4NE2 (His407)2.17100.487.6144.8NE2 (His462)2.2288.394.4O1P (2PGA)2.6161.0O3P (2PGA)2.31OD2 Asp12Ser62Asp444His445Mn2OD1 (Asp12)2.0348.9107.9112.3109.9OD2 (Asp12)2.9096.377.9155.3OG (Ser62)2.28106.9115.2OD1 (Asp444)2.21104.8NE2 (His445)2.31Mn1Mn24.92 Open table in a new tab There are no global differences between the structures of the iPGM·2PGA complex and the iPGM·3PGA complex; the fold as well as the arrangement of the domains is, as expected, the same (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The active site geometry is similar, although there are differences around the carboxyl end of the 2PGA including the precise positions of residues Arg153, Arg154, and Arg185, all from domain B. Mn1 and Mn2 and their ligands as well as the residues interacting with the phosphate of 2PGA are also in similar positions and possess similar side chain orientation as in the 3PGA complex. As proposed earlier (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), 2PGA is located in the same area of the enzyme's active site as is 3PGA in the 3PGA·iPGM complex; the differences are in the positioning and orientation of the glycerate moiety (Fig. 2 B). In general, the position of the phosphate and carboxyl moieties of 2PGA and 3PGA are the same. The O3 oxygen of 2PGA is placed in proximal position to the O2 atom of 3PGA, and both atoms point in the direction of Asp154. In the iPGM·2PGA complex the O3 to OD1 Asp154 distance is 2.62 Å, while in the 3PGA complex the distance between the corresponding oxygen atom, O2, and OD1 of Asp154 is 2.75 Å. The largest differences between the 3PGA and 2PGA are in the positions for the C2 (from 3PGA) and C3 (from 2PGA) carbon atoms, which differ by 1.21 Å and 1.31 Å, respectively. Carbon atoms C2 for 2PGA and C3 for 3PGA are bridging atoms with the phosphate group, and their positions are displaced only by 0.63 Å, suggesting that the placement of the phosphate group is very important and is a stringent requirement for catalysis (Fig. 2 B). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of iPGMs from different sources, including bacteria (both spore formers and non-spore formers) and plants, has shown that all active site residues are conserved in these enzymes (5Jedrzejas M.J. Chander M. Setlow P. Krishnasamy G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Comparison of iPGM sequences with the sequences of several members of the alkaline phosphatase family has also shown that the residues directly involved in metal binding are also conserved between these two types of enzymes (16Galperin M.Y. Bairoch A. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).2Alkaline phosphatases contain two Zn2+ ions, while those iPGMs in which metal ions have been identified contain Mn2+ions, with two Mn2+ ions identified in the iPGM of B. stearothermophilus (2Fraser H.I.

To elucidate whether these two tRNAsSer can be recognized by the single animal mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (mt SerRS), we purified mt SerRS from bovine liver 2400-fold and showed that it can aminoacylate both of them. Specific interaction between mt SerRS and either of the tRNAsSer was also observed in a gel retardation assay. cDNA cloning of bovine mt SerRS revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme contains 518 amino acid residues. The cDNAs of human and mouse mt SerRS were obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and expressed sequence tag data base searches. Elaborate inspection of primary sequences of mammalian mt SerRSs revealed diversity in the N-terminal domain responsible for tRNA recognition, indicating that the recognition mechanism of mammalian mt SerRS differs considerably from that of its prokaryotic counterpart.

This process is catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS),1 which discriminates with high selectivity among many structurally similar tRNAs and amino acids (1.Normanly J. Abelson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 1029-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2.Schulman L.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 41: 23-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To avoid misacylation of tRNAs from any of the 19 noncognate groups within each tRNA sequence, tRNAs possess identity elements that are unambiguously recognized only by the cognate synthetase. These recognition elements are most commonly located in the tRNA anticodon, the acceptor stem and the “discriminator” base at position 73 (2–5). However, in the Escherichia coli system, several biochemical approaches have revealed that identity elements of the tRNAAla and tRNASer isoacceptors are not located in the anticodon and discriminator (4.Shimizu M. Asahara H. Tamura K. Hasegawa T. Himeno H. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 436-443PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M.

Science. 1988; 240: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the case of tRNAAla, the G3-U70 base pair in the acceptor stem is a major determinant of tRNAAla identity (8.Hou Y.M. Schimmel P. Nature. 1988; 333: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 9.McClain W.H. Foss K. Science. 1988; 240: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). tRNAs can be divided into two groups according to the length of the extra arm: those with a short extra arm of 4–5 nucleotides (type 1) and those with a long extra arm of at least 11 nucleotides (type 2) (10.Lenhard B. Orellana O. Ibba M. Weygand-Durasevic I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). tRNAs that belong to the latter type are restricted to only three species in prokaryotes: tRNAsTyr, tRNAsLeu, and tRNAsSer, and two species in eukaryotes: tRNAsLeu and tRNAsSer (Fig.1). Biological experiments have shown that the long extra arm of E. coli tRNASercontributes the most to the specificity of serylation (6.Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6815-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7.Sampson J.R. Saks M.M.

Biol. 1994; 236: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, Himeno et al. (6.Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6815-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) reported that the different orientations of the long extra arms in these three species are a key element for discrimination by E. coli seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), which is a plausible reason why neither the length nor the sequence of the extra arm is conserved among tRNASerisoacceptors (14.Sprinzl M. Hartmann T. Weber J. Blank J. Zeidler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the crystallographic structures of SerRS-tRNASer complexes from E. coli andThermus thermophilus (15.Price S. Cusack S. Borel F. Berthet-Colominas C. Leberman R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16.Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 17.Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). tRNASer binds across both subunits of the dimer. The terminal part of the acceptor end contacts the active site of one subunit, whereas the rest of the tRNASer is bound to the other subunit, in which is located the N-terminal long helical arm-like domain that is important for recognition of the long extra arm and TΨC loop of tRNASer. In eukaryotic systems, cytoplasmic tRNASer also has a long extra arm (Fig. 1), and several biochemical studies on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human tRNAsSer have indicated that the major identity element of tRNASer is located in this arm (18.Achsel T. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3333-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19.Dock-Bregeon A.C. Garcia A. Giege R. Moras D. Eur. J.

Soma A. Nishikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be concluded that the major identity element of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasmic tRNAsSer for specific recognition by SerRS is located in the characteristic long extra arm. The recognition mechanism using the long extra arm appears evolutionarily conserved in the tRNASer-SerRS system. On the other hand, because all animal mitochondrial (mt) tRNAsSer possess a short extra arm (10.Lenhard B. Orellana O. Ibba M. Weygand-Durasevic I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the recognition mechanism described above would not be applicable in the mt system. Also, animal mt tRNASer isoacceptors differ structurally from those of other mt tRNAs; the tRNASer specific for codons AGY (Y = C or U; tRNAGCUSer) lacks the entire D arm (22.Steinberg S. Gautheret D. Cedergren R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas the isoacceptor for codons UCN (N = A, G, C, or U; tRNAUGASer) lacks the invariant U8 between the acceptor and D stems and has a small D loop and an extended anticodon stem consisting of 6 base pairs (23.Yokogawa T. Watanabe Y. Kumazawa Y. Ueda T. Hirao I. Miura K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6101-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The primary and secondary structures of these two tRNAsSer are too different for a common region in these tRNAs to be identified. To date, it remains unclear whether the single ARS recognizes two cognate tRNAs with apparently different structures, like animal mt tRNAsSer. It thus is of interest to ascertain whether the single mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (mt SerRS) recognizes the two distinct tRNASer isoacceptors and, if so, what kind of tRNA recognition mechanism is needed for the system. To obtain information on the recognition mechanism of animal mt SerRS, we previously studied the recognition sites of bovine mt tRNAGCUSer (24.Ueda T. Yotsumoto Y. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have recently undertaken further biochemical investigations to elucidate the recognition mechanism of animal mt SerRS by purifying bovine mt SerRS from bovine liver, cloning its gene, and characterizing the native bovine mt SerRS. The results are presented here. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and DEAE-Sepharose were purchased from Sigma; hydroxyapatite and a protein assay kit were from Bio-Rad; Centriprep-10, Centricon-10, and Microcon-10 were from Amicon; [14C]l-serine (4.4 GBq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products; and Superdex 200 prep grade, HiTrap heparin (1 ml), Mono S (HR5/5), and Mono Q (HR5/5) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other chemicals were from Wako Pure Chemicals. E. coli total tRNAs were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Native mt tRNAsSer and mt tRNAGAAPhe were purified from bovine mitochondria by the selective hybridization method using a solid phase DNA probe as described by Wakita et al. (25.Wakita K. Watanabe Y. Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Nakamura S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nishikawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Procedures were generally performed at 4 °C; only the FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was operated at room temperature. For For step 1, digitonin-treated bovine liver mitochondria, isolated mt pellets, and the mt S-30 fraction were prepared as described previously (26.Schwartzbach C.J. Farwel M. Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For step 2, fresh S-30 (2800 mg) was applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.7 × 17.5 cm) equilibrated and washed with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 100 μm PMSF), and developed with a linear gradient (1000 ml) from 40 to 500 mm KCl in Buffer A. Fractions (10 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Active fractions were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation). For step 3, the above precipitate was dissolved and dialyzed extensively against Buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 100 μm PMSF). The dialyzed sample (360 mg of proteins) was applied onto a hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 11 cm) equilibrated with Buffer B and developed with a linear gradient (200 ml) from 10 to 200 mm potassium phosphate in Buffer B. Fractions (5 ml) were collected. Aliquots (200 μl) were taken from every second fraction and dialyzed against Buffer C (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0), 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 100 μm PMSF) with Microcon 10 to remove phosphate. These were used for the aminoacylation assays. The concentrated sample (5 ml, 55 mg of proteins) collected by Centriprep 10 from active fractions was immediately applied onto a Superdex 200 column (2.5 × 60 cm) equilibrated with Buffer C. For step 4, the column was developed with Buffer C. Fractions (5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Active fractions were concentrated with Centriprep 10. This procedure was used in the subsequent steps. For step 5, the concentrated sample (5.6 mg of proteins) was diluted with Buffer D (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0), 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) 4-fold and immediately applied onto a HiTrap heparin column (1 ml), which was developed with a 25-ml linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm KCl in Buffer D at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a FPLC system. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. For step 6, the sample (0.36 mg) dialyzed against Buffer D with Centricon 10 was immediately applied onto a Mono S column (0.5 × 5 cm) and developed with a 20-ml linear gradient from 0 to 400 mm KCl in Buffer D at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by FPLC. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. For step 7, the sample (0.14 mg) dialyzed against Buffer D with Centricon 10 was immediately applied onto a Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) and developed with a 25-ml linear gradient from 0 to 300 mm KCl in Buffer D at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min by FPLC. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. To check their purity, active fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using the method of Laemmli (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The mt SerRS fraction was frozen quickly and stored at −70 °C. The tRNASer-SerRS complex was formed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min in a 10-μl aliquot containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmspermine, about 0.02 A 260 unit of mt tRNA, and about 0.5 μg of mt SerRS fraction. Native PAGE was done as described by Hornung et al. (29.Hornung V. Hofmann H. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the gels were stained with both Coomassie Brilliant Blue and toluidine blue to analyze the components of the tRNASer-SerRS complex. The band of the complex was cut out and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was silver-stained. About 15 μg of the purified mt SerRS was digested with 1 μg of lysyl endopeptidase at 37 °C overnight in a 50-μl aliquot containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9) and 20 mm EDTA. The resultant product was loaded onto a C8 column (2.1 × 30 mm) in a high performance liquid chromatography system and separated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a 6-ml linear gradient from 0 to 35% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetate and then with a 3-ml linear gradient from 35 to 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetate. The amino acid sequence of each separated peptide was determined with an Applied Biosystems 477A/120A protein sequencer. In parallel, the sequences of peptides digested with endoproteinase V8 were obtained according to the method of Cleveland et al.(30.Cleveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications indicated in Ref. 31.Omori A. Yoshida S. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 471Google Scholar. The assays were carried out at 37 °C for 5 min with reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 42 μm[14C]l-serine, 0.5A 260 unit of E. coli total tRNAs, and an appropriate amount of the enzyme fraction (32.Nishimura S. Novelli G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 80: 574-586PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 pmol of seryl-tRNASer for 1 min. The protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aminoacylation reactions to determine the kinetic parameters of bovine mt SerRS were carried out at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm spermine, 2 mm ATP, 60 mm KCl, 33 μm[14C]l-serine (5.59 GBq/mmol) purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and 5.7 nm purified bovine mt SerRS. Although l-serine was used at the subsaturating concentration, it was slightly above K m (23 μm) of bovine mt SerRS according to Kumazawa et al. (33.Kumazawa Y. Studies on the Mitochondrial Protein Synthesis. Ph.D. Thesis. The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan1988Google Scholar), and we made compromise between unreliable results because of the concentration around K m and low counting efficiency because of low specific activity of the labeledl-serine caused by dilution with nonlabeledl-serine (18.Achsel T. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3333-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The initial rates of aminoacylation were determined by using six different concentrations of native tRNAsSer ranging from 0.04 to 1.5 μm (0.04, 0.10, 0.30, 0.70, 1.0, and 1.5 μm) for tRNAGCUSer or from 0.03 to 1.3 μm (0.03, 0.10, 0.25, 0.60, 0.90, and 1.3 μm) for tRNAUGASer at a fixed concentration of mt SerRS, which gave reasonable kinetics plots for determining the apparent K m andk cat values. Partial peptide sequences of bovine mt SerRS were subjected to a BLAST search of the DDBJ/EBI/GenBankTM nucleotide sequence data bases and a human EST clone (accession number T78174) was obtained. A sense primer (np 1207–1227; see Fig. 4) and an antisense primer (np 1453–1472) were designed from the partial region in the clone that was highly identical to the partial peptide sequences of bovine mt SerRS. To obtain the bovine cDNA clone, RT-PCR was performed using these two primers, 2 μg of laboratory stock bovine poly(A)-tailed mRNA, and a TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (AMV) version 2.1. cDNA screening, cloning, and sequencing of the plasmid DNA obtained were done according to Takeuchi et al. (34.Takeuchi N. Kawakami M. Omori A. Ueda T. Spremulli L.L. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15085-15090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The 5′-region of the cDNA corresponding to the N-terminal region of the mature mt SerRS was obtained by RT-PCR. First strand cDNA synthesis and first and nested PCR were carried out according to Nakayama (35.Nakayama H. Baio Jikken Irasutoreiteddo. 1996; 3: 85-100Google Scholar) with some modifications. A degenerate sense primer (np 103–122) was designed from the N-terminal peptide sequence. Antisense primers (np 1099–1118 and 1123–1143) were designed from the cDNA sequence obtained by cDNA screening and respectively used for first and nested PCR. The predominant PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into a pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) was used to further determine the 5′-region of the bovine mt SerRS cDNA. Antisense primers (np 151–168 and 126–144) were designed from the 5′-region sequence of the mature mt SerRS and used, respectively, for first and nested PCR. Sequencing was done using a Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) and an ABI PRISMTM310 genetic analyzer. The major part of the putative human mt SerRS cDNA sequence and the whole putative cDNA sequence of mouse mt SerRS were obtained by connecting several EST clones whose peptide sequences are very homologous to that of bovine mt SerRS. The few unknown regions in the human mt SerRS cDNA were determined by RT-PCR using RT-PCR high (Toyobo). Primers were designed from the determined sequences on both sides. To elucidate whether the single animal mt SerRS recognizes the two tRNASer isoacceptors, which differ considerably in their secondary structures, we purified mt SerRS to homogeneity from bovine liver mitochondria by successive column chromatographies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only one peak fraction exhibiting serylation activity was observed in each step. The purification scheme resulted in 2400-fold purification of mt SerRS with 2.8% recovery (Table I). In the final step, the serylation activity completely coincided with the Mono Q column absorbance profile (Fig.2 A). The molecular mass of mt SerRS was estimated to be about 53,000 Da by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 B). On the other hand, mt SerRS was eluted in the region of a molecular mass exceeding 100,000 Da on Superdex 200 column chromatography (data not shown). Because all the SerRSs known so far have an α2 subunit structure, bovine mt SerRS is thought to be a dimer.Table IPurification of mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase from bovine liverPurification stepProteinTotal unitsSpecific activityTotal recoveryPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%foldMitochondrial extract (S-30)280080002.81001DEAE-Sepharose460680015855.360% Ammonium sulfate precipitation360560016705.6Hydroxyapatite553200644023Superdex 2005.6320058040210Heparin0.3678022009.8790Mono S0.1442030005.31100Mono Q0.03222068002.82400 Open table in a new tab To ascertain whether the single bovine mt SerRS recognizes the two mt tRNAsSer, we carried out gel retardation assays and aminoacylation reaction experiments. Fig.3 A shows that the main protein band was shifted as a consequence of adding mt tRNAGCUSer and mt tRNAUGASer to mt SerRS, whereas no such shift was observed when mt tRNAGAAPhewas used. Furthermore, the shifted band was found to contain both a 53,000-Da protein and the mt tRNASer on the SDS-containing gel (Fig. 3 B). It was thus demonstrated that the single mt SerRS recognizes and binds to the two tRNASer isoacceptors with different structures. The kinetic parameters of aminoacylation by the purified bovine mt SerRS are shown in Table II. The bovine mt SerRS is seen to aminoacylate the two tRNAsSer almost equally. The K m values determined in the present study are rather different from those reported previously using partially purified bovine mt SerRS (36.Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Miura K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2623-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The present data appear more reasonable because the K m values for each cognate tRNASer in the previous data differ considerably.Table IIKinetic parameters in aminoacylation of bovine mitochondrial serine tRNAsSubstrateK mk catk cat/K mμm1/s1/(μm × s)tRNAGCUSer0.37 ± 0.100.35 ± 0.100.95tRNAUGASer0.22 ± 0.030.63 ± 0.062.86Experimental conditions for aminoacylation are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Experimental conditions for aminoacylation are described under “Experimental Procedures.” To obtain cDNA clones of mt SerRS, partial peptide sequences were determined. N-terminal sequencing revealed that mt SerRS has two heterologous termini: NH2-ATERQDRNLLYEHAR and NH2-ERQDRNLLYEHAR (Fig. 4). Subsequently, five internal peptides were sequenced (Fig. 4) that were subjected to a BLAST search through the human EST data base. The search revealed one EST clone (accession number T78174) containing portions of the two peptide sequences at the C-terminal region of bovine mt SerRS (Fig. 4). For cDNA screening, a cDNA clone was obtained by RT-PCR using bovine mRNA with primers designed from the sequences of this clone (Fig. 4). The cDNA screening gave one cDNA clone 998 base pairs (bp) in length that corresponded to the C-terminal region (np 892–1889) of mt SerRS (Fig. 4). Subsequently, the N-terminal region was amplified by RT-PCR using a degenerate primer based on the N-terminal peptide sequence, and one cDNA clone 1118 bp in length (np 103–1220) was obtained. Through 5′-rapid amplifiation of cDNA ends, four clones with identical sequences but different lengths were obtained. The longest cDNA fragment, 210 bp in length, contained one ATG codon. Assuming this to be the initiation codon, the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) consists of only 12 bases. It is possible that another ATG codon further upstream in the 5′-region functions as the initiation codon. However, human mt SerRS has a TAA codon at position −48 in frame that strongly suggests that the relevant ATG codon functions as the initiation codon. Additionally, the initiation context found in both sequences, possessing A at position −3 and G at position 4, conforms to the consensus feature for eukaryotic genes (37.Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). These facts strongly suggest that the sole ATG codon found in the cDNA sequence of bovine mt SerRS is the actual initiation codon. It is now clear that the bovine mt SerRS cDNA is composed of at least 12 bp of 5′-UTR, a 1557-bp coding sequence, and 331 bp of 3′-UTR. All the sequences of the five peptide fragments derived from bovine mt SerRS were identified within its complete amino acid sequence (Fig. 4). Based on the amino acid sequence of the 1557-bp coding sequence, analysis of the mature bovine mt SerRS revealed that the N-terminal 34-amino acid sequence of the precursor protein functions as the targeting peptide (Fig. 4). However, as noted above, two different N-terminal peptide fragments (i.e. two different precursor cleavage sites) were observed. This leaves the possibility of alternative cleavage of the mt SerRS precursor by the matrix processing protease (38.Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We next confirmed the C-terminal peptide of bovine mt SerRS. After digesting the mt SerRS with trypsin, peptide fragments were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization/iontrap mass spectrometry. The C-terminal peptide, LPGQPASS, was identified as a slightly charged ion with anm/z of 756.4 Da (data not shown). Peptide fragments generated from digestion by trypsin in H218O were similarly analyzed. No change in the molecular mass of the relevant fragment was observed, showing that the actual termination is executed at the putative termination codon expected from the bovine mt SerRS cDNA sequence. Thus, it was concluded that the cDNA sequence determined in this work is actually derived from the mature mt SerRS. The putative human mt SerRS cDNA was obtained by connecting human EST clones and RT-PCR (Fig.5 A); it is composed of at least 160 bp of 5′-UTR, a 1557-bp coding sequence, and 337 bp of 3′-UTR. The putative mouse mt SerRS cDNA was acquired only by connecting mouse EST clones (Fig. 5 A); it consists of at least 20 bp of 5′-UTR, a 1557-bp coding sequence, and 281 bp of 3′-UTR. Information on the position of the human mt SerRS gene on the genome was obtained by subjecting its cDNA sequence to a BLAST search. One of the acquired clones contained the complete human mt ribosomal protein S12 (MRPS12) gene (accession number AF058761). Only the first exon of the human mt SerRS gene was found in the sequence of the above-mentioned EST clone (Fig. 5 B). It is of interest that one of the putative binding sites of nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), one of the transcription factors, is located in the coding sequence of human mt SerRS in the opposite direction (39.Johnson D.F. Hamon M. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Genomics. 1998; 52: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). According to the coding sequence of bovine mt SerRS, the predicted translation product has 518 amino acids. Mammalian mt SerRS has a long C-terminal sequence, but it is different from a basic C-terminal lysine-rich extension found in all eukaryotic cytoplasmic SerRSs that may be important for both stability and optimal substrate recognition (40.Weygand-Durasevic I. Lenhard B. Filipic S. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2455-2461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Though it displays only 28–34% homology with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasmic counterparts and even with yeast mt SerRS, relatively high homology is observed in the C-terminal region among all the sequences (Fig.6). Analyses of the crystal structures of E. coli and T. thermophilus SerRSs revealed that prokaryotic SerRS discriminates tRNASer from other noncognate tRNAs by means of the long helical arm located in the N-terminal region and interacts with serine and ATP by the residues mainly located in the C-terminal region, in particular in motifs 2 and 3, which are highly conserved active sites among class II ARSs (Fig. 6). The high homology in the C-terminal region between prokaryotic SerRS and mammalian mt SerRS indicates that the C-terminal region also functions as the catalytic core in the latter, whereas the low homology in the N-terminal region accords well with the lack of the long extra arm in most animal mt tRNAsSer from the perspective of the co-evolution of ARS and its cognate tRNA. Our work has shown that the two distinct mitochondrial tRNASer isoforms are recognized by a single bovine mt SerRS, a 54,635-Da polypeptide. The low homology in the N-terminal region between mammalian mt SerRS and other SerRSs is consistent with the recognition mechanism of mammalian mt SerRS differing from that of prokaryotic SerRSs so far elucidated. On the other hand, the high homology in the C-terminal region is indicative of the conservation of the catalytic core in mammalian mt SerRSs, except for some residues involved in the interaction with the acceptor stem of tRNA. This local difference seems to be in agreement with the unique recognition mechanism of mammalian mt SerRS. Relevant details of our inspection of the C-terminal region of bovine mt SerRS are as follows. In the crystal structure of T. thermophilus SerRS, ATP is bound to the active site through interactions with Arg256, Glu258, Arg271, Phe275, Glu345, Glu348, and Arg386 (16.Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 17.Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,41.Härtlein M. Cusack S. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). (Fig. 6) Furthermore, serine specificity is ensured by the interaction of the hydroxyl group in the side chain of serine with Tyr380 in motif 3 (41.Härtlein M. Cusack S. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In particular, Glu281in yeast cytoplasmic SerRS, equivalent to Glu258 inT. thermophilus SerRS, is reported to be important for the binding of ATP and to contribute to the stabilization of the motif 2 loop (42.Lenhard B. Filipic S. Landeka I. Skrtic I. Söll D. Weygand-Durasevic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1136-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of these residues are also conserved in mammalian mt SerRS (Fig. 6). As reported by Cusack et al. (17.Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the motif 2 loop of T. thermophilus SerRS can take either of two quite different conformations: one in the presence of tRNA (the T-conformation) and the other in the absence of tRNA but in the presence of ATP (the A-conformation). These two ordered conformations are each stabilized by different sets of interactions, often involving the same residues. The side chains of Glu258 and Arg271, key residues in the conformation switch, alter the conformation and bind to either ATP or tRNA in each conformation. These two residues are conserved in the mammalian mt SerRSs. On the other hand, Ser261, Phe262, and Arg267, which are involved in interactions with several bases in the acceptor stem in the T-conformation (17.Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), are scarcely conserved in mammalian mt SerRS. Cusack et al. (17.Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) speculate that the occurrence of two glycines in the motif 2 loop (Gly260 and Gly263) surrounded by small residues (Ala, Thr, or Val) in positions 259 and 266 may provide the flexibility necessary to facilitate the conformational switch. However, Gly260 and Val266 in T. thermophilus SerRS are not conserved in mammalian mt SerRSs. The conservation of Glu258 and Arg271(according to the T. thermophilus numbering) in the motif 2 loop of mammalian mt SerRSs also suggests the existence of the conformational switch from the serine activation step to the aminoacylation step in these enzymes. However, the lack of two out of the several residues necessary for providing flexibility to the motif 2 loop may reduce the flexibility of mammalian mt SerRS. Because the motif 2 loop of SerRS is the longest among other class II synthetases (17.Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), residues of the long motif 2 loop are able to extend down to the fifth base pair of the acceptor stem of T. thermophilustRNASer. The apparently lower flexibility of the motif 2 loop and the low level of conservation of Ser261 and Arg267 (T. thermophilus SerRS numbering) in mammalian mt SerRS (Fig. 6), raise the possibility that mammalian mt SerRS does not interact with the bases of the acceptor stem. This is fully consistent with our previous finding that substitution of A-U base pairs in the acceptor stem of bovine mt tRNAGCUSer with C-G pairs did not severely impair the charging activity of tRNAGCUSer by bovine mt SerRS (24.Ueda T. Yotsumoto Y. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated the significance of U54 and A58 of the T-loop in the recognition of bovine mt tRNAGCUSer by bovine mt SerRS (24.Ueda T. Yotsumoto Y. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The corresponding residues are also found in another isoacceptor, tRNAUGASer, as U54 and m1A, respectively. Because the present work has shown that the single mt SerRS can aminoacylate the two structurally distinct tRNAsSer, it is reasonable to assume that both tRNAGCUSer and tRNAUGASer have the same recognition elements. Because tertiary U54-A58 pairing is widely conserved among nonmitochondrial tRNAs and is considered to play a general role in maintaining the L-shape of the tRNA molecule (43.Rich A. Kim S.H. Sci. Am. 1978; 238: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that this pairing is critical for enzyme recognition. Further study is necessary to determine the recognition elements common to both bovine mt tRNAsSer. Kumazawa et al. (44.Kumazawa Y. Himeno H. Miura K. Watanabe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that bovine mt SerRS not only charges cognate E. colitRNASer species but also extensively misacylates several noncognate E. coli tRNA species, whereas E. coliSerRS is unable to aminoacylate bovine mt tRNAsSer. This unilateral aminoacylation mechanism between bovine mitochondria andE. coli will be also elucidated through further research. A human EST data base search revealed that the human mt SerRS gene is located at a position 5′ adjacent to the RPMS12 gene on chromosome 19q13.1 (Fig. 5 B) (39.Johnson D.F. Hamon M. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Genomics. 1998; 52: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 45.Shah Z.H. Migliosi V. Miller S.C.M. Wang A. Friedman T.B. Jacobs H.T. Genomics. 1998; 48: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, the autosomal dominant deafness locus DFNA4 was also mapped to 19q13.1 (46.Chen A.H. Ni L. Fukushima K. Marietta J. O'Neill M. Coucke P. Wiliems P. Smith R.J.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1073-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because the ribosomal protein S12 is known to act as a core component of the highly conserved accuracy center in the ribosome, it is supposed that mutations in the S12 gene result in inaccurate mt translation (47.Alskne L.E. Anthony R.A. Liebman S.W. Warner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9538-9541Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A genetic study of the fruit fly indicates that a single point mutation in the mt ribosomal protein S12 causes a bang-senseless mutant called tko (48.Shah Z.H. O'Dell K.M.C. Miller S.C.M. An X. Jacobs H.T. Gene (Amst .). 1997; 204: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the phenotype of which resembles a sensorineural hearing loss related to mt dysfunction (49.Prezant T.R. Agapian J.V. Bohlman M.C. Bu X. Ötzas S. Qiu W.-Q. Arnos K.S. Cortopassi G.A. Jaber L. Rotter J.I. Shohat M. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Although human RPMS12 has been suggested to be responsible for DFNA4 hearing loss (39.Johnson D.F. Hamon M. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Genomics. 1998; 52: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 45.Shah Z.H. Migliosi V. Miller S.C.M. Wang A. Friedman T.B. Jacobs H.T. Genomics. 1998; 48: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the human mt SerRS gene may also be a possible candidate, because mt SerRS contributes to the maintenance of translational fidelity in the mt protein synthesis reaction. Although many biochemical experiments on recognition elements in tRNAs, especially those of prokaryotes, have been reported, there has been no study in which the recognition mechanism of structurally different tRNAs by a single synthetase was elucidated. We have discussed the recognition mechanism of bovine mt SerRS in the light of the information revealed in the present study. Further experimental investigation will certainly reveal the essential recognition mechanism between SerRS and tRNAsSer and thereby deepen our understanding of the animal mitochondrial translation system. We thank Dr. Yoichi Watanabe (Tokyo University) for helpful discussions, Dr. Chie Takemoto (Gakushuin University) for kind advice concerning mt SerRS purification, and Takeo Suzuki (Tokyo University) for excellent technical assistance with mitochondrial tRNAs purification."

The skeletal muscle α-actin gene is activated by signaling through an MCAT element, the binding site of the transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) family of transcription factors. Previously, we showed that overexpression of the TEF-1-related factor (RTEF-1) increased the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic response of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter, whereas TEF-1 overexpression did not. Here, we identified the functional domains and specific sequences in RTEF-1 that mediate the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic response. Chimeric TEF-1 and RTEF-1 expression constructs localized the region responsible for the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic response to the carboxyl-terminal domain of RTEF-1. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to inactivate eight serine residues of RTEF-1, not present in TEF-1, that are putative targets of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic-dependent kinases. Mutation of a single serine residue, Ser-322, reduced the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic activation of RTEF-1 by 70% without affecting protein stability, suggesting that phosphorylation at this serine residue accounts for most of the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic response. Thus, these results demonstrate that RTEF-1 is a direct target of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic signaling in hypertrophied cardiac myocytes."

The regulation of the growth and survival of the cells of the early embryo is, however, poorly understood. Mammalian preimplantation embryos develop in vitro with simple medium requirements and have no absolute requirement for exogenous vitamins, hormones, or growth factors. This contrasts with the absolute requirement of normal somatic cells for exogenous mitogens and survival factors. The continued mitoses of preimplantation embryo cells in the absence of exogenous growth factors implicates a role for endogenous, autocrine trophic factors, or the constitutive activation of signaling pathways in the early embryo. Several lines of evidence support a role for the former: (i) the rate of embryo development in vitro is density-dependent, with embryos growing in relatively small volumes (or in large groups) developing more successfully than those grown in large volumes (or individually) (1.O'Neill C.

A. 1990; 87: 4756-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar); (ii) the synthesis by the preimplantation embryo of a number of growth factor ligands and their receptors (3.Pantaleon M. Kaye P.L.

Reprod. 1999; 60: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); and (iii) the capacity of some exogenous growth factors to enhance embryo metabolism in vitro and to compensate for the adverse effects of culture in large medium volumes (1.O'Neill C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 2.Paria B.C. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Experimental partial deprivation of released autocrine trophic factors did not arrest the cell-cycle at given checkpoints (9.O'Neill C. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rather, there was progressive loss of viability with increased cell death as embryos progressed past the 8-cell stage. This finding suggests that the autocrine factors may act as survival factors rather than classical growth factors (triggering progression through specific cell-cycle checkpoints). While several autocrine factors have been implicated, platelet-activating factor (PAF)1 seems to be one of the first produced, being synthesized de novo by the embryo soon after fertilization (10.Wells X.E. O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1994; 101: 385-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Wells X.E. O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1992; 96: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Its actions are required by the mid-2-cell stage for normal rates of embryo survival (9.O'Neill C. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Despite this range of supportive data, there is limited direct evidence for the action of autocrine trophic factors in early embryo development. Transgenic and recombinant knock-out models have not generally been informative of the growth requirements of the early embryo prior to implantation. This may be due to extensive redundancy of regulatory pathways. Growth/survival factors exert their effects by generating secondary messengers that then exert downstream actions. The generation of transient increases in intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) is a universally important secondary messenger (12.Whitaker M. Patel R. Development. 1990; 108: 525-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i transients are known to be important regulators of the early embryo's developmental program. The fertilizing sperm induces a series of calcium transients in oocytes that cause oocyte activation and have longer term consequences for normal embryo development (13.Cheek T.R. McGuinness O.M. Vincent C. Moreton R.B. Berridge M.J. Johnson M.H. Development. 1993; 119: 179-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Parrington J. Swann K. Shevchenko V.I. Sesay A.K. Lai F.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 15.Swann K. Development. 1990; 110: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Swann K. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A [Ca2+]itransient also occurs at the time of nuclear envelope breakdown in the mouse zygote (17.Kono T. Jones K.T. Bos-Mikich A. Whittingham D.G. Carroll J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The post-fertilization calcium oscillations and the transients associated with nuclear envelope breakdown require factor(s) derived from the sperm that become associated with the nuclear membrane. There is no direct evidence of a developmental requirement for calcium transients in the mammalian early embryo outside these defined periods, although evidence that induction of artificial transients in morulae enhanced the rate of blastocyst formation (18.Stachecki J.J. Yelian F.D. Schultz J.F. Leach R.E. Armant D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,19.Stachecki J.J. Armant D.R. Development. 1996; 122: 2485-2496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the inhibition of embryo development by a calmodulin antagonist (W-7) suggests a role (20.Poueymitou W.T. Schultz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Develop. 1990; 26: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It was recently shown (21.Roudebush W.E. LaMarche M.D. Levine A.S. Jiang H. Butler W.J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that exogenous PAF may induce calcium transients in the 2-cell mouse embryo although a mechanism for this action was not defined, nor was it established whether embryo-derived PAF also induced such responses. The aims of the study were, therefore, to screen preimplantation stage mouse embryos for evidence of [Ca2+]i transients; to define the causative agent of any transient observed; to provide characterization of the [Ca2+]i transients; and to assess whether their induction had developmental consequences for the early embryo. We found that embryo-derived PAF caused transients in late zygotes and 2-cell embryos during interphase and that they were necessary for normal rates of embryo development in vitro. Female Swiss albino mice (Laboratory Animal Services, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia), 6–9 weeks old, were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 10 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, Folligon, Intervet International, Boxmeer, The Netherlands) followed 48 h later by 10 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Chorulon, Intervet). Females were then left unmated or paired with males of proven fertility. Fertilization occurred by 13 h after human chorionic gonadotropin. Day 1 of pregnancy was confirmed by the presence of a copulation plug. The use of animals was in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes, and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Ethics Committee. All components of medium were tissue culture grade from Sigma. Unless otherwise stated all media were supplemented with 3 mg of BSA/ml (Fraction V, CSL Ltd., Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Embryos or cumulus masses were flushed from the reproductive tract using Hepes-buffered modified human tubal fluid medium (Hepes-modHTF (1.O'Neill C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)) with 3 mg of BSA/ml. Zygotes and oocytes were freed from their cumulus cells by brief exposure to 300 IU of hyaluronidase (Sigma). Embryos fertilized in the reproductive tract were collected by dissection from the ampulla region of the oviduct. Zygotes and embryos that were not immediately prepared for calcium imaging were cultured in bicarbonate-buffered modified HTF medium (modHTF) (1.O'Neill C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) containing 3 mg of BSA/ml at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in air. Calcium imaging was performed with embryos mounted in a chamber on a microscope coverslip. The chamber contained ∼0.5 ml of medium and was perfused with medium at 37 °C at a rate of 1 ml/min. Perfusion medium was the same composition as Hepes-modHTF with 3 mg of BSA/ml, but without phenol red. Embryos were washed 3 times in Hepes-modHTF and incubated with Fura-2 AM (2 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in BSA-free perfusion medium for 30 min and then washed 3 times in BSA-free perfusion medium. In some experiments embryos were then incubated in recombinant plasma-type PAF acetylhydrolase (rPAF acetylhydrolase, 174 μg/ml; ICOS Inc., Bothell, WA) (22.Tjoelker L.W. Wilder C. Eberhardt C. Stafforini D.M. Dietsch G. Schimpf B. Hooper S. Trong H.L. Cousens L.S. Zimmerman G.A. Yamada Y. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) in BSA-free perfusion medium for 15 min and washed in BSA-free perfusion medium before calcium imaging. The perfusion chamber was constructed from perspex (40 × 70 × 5 mm, width × length × depth) into which an elliptical slot was created. The slot was sealed at the base with a glass coverslip (with high vacuum silicon grease, Ajax Labs., Auburn, NSW, Australia). The slot held approximately 0.5 ml of medium. The top of the slot was open and medium was added at the rate of 1 ml/min, at one end of the slot and removed at the far end. Fluid was pumped through the chamber by a variable speed peristaltic pump. Embryos in BSA-free perfusion medium were placed onto a Cell-TakTM (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA)-treated glass coverslip that was attached to the perfusion chamber. After establishing baseline readings and subtracting background readings, perfusion was initiated. Relative changes in intracellular calcium concentration were measured using fluorescence ratiometric imaging of Fura-2 at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. One frame (0.04 s) was captured at each wavelength every 15 s. The [Ca2+]i is the average over an entire cell (zygote-8-cell stage) or an entire embryo (morulae) and thus may not reflect the peak calcium concentrations achieved within regions of a cell. Results were recorded with a Panasonic video camera (model WV-BP 310/A) linked to a Macintosh computer via a Pixelpipeline frame grabber. Images were captured and analyzed with IonvisionTMsoftware (Improvision, Coventry, UK). All imaging was performed on a Nikon Diaphot microscope using 100 W Xenon illumination, and a ×20 Olympus DPlan Apo UV lens. Up to 10 embryos were within the field of view of this objective and were imaged simultaneously. Intracellular calcium concentrations were calculated using the equations of Grynkiewicz et al. (23.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).R max (340/380 nm ratio value at high calcium concentrations) was determined in the presence of 2 mmcalcium and ionomycin (1 μm, Calbiochem, Alexandria, NSW, Australia). R min (340/380 nm ratio value in calcium-free conditions) was determined by perfusing with Ca2+-free perfusion medium until a stable baseline was achieved. The effect of the following exogenous growth factors was tested: EGF (human recombinant EGF, Sigma, lot 63HD04135), insulin-like growth factor 1 (human recombinant insulin-like growth factor 1, Sigma, lot 83H09655), transforming growth factor-β (porcine platelet transforming growth factor-β, R&D Systems Inc., MN, lot 1085); platelet-derived growth factor (human platelet-derived growth factor, R&D Systems Inc., lot D711); and PAF (Sigma, equal mixture of 1-O-octadecyl/hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphocholine). EGF, insulin-like growth factor-1, transforming growth factor-β, and platelet-derived growth factor were first dissolved in 0.01m acetic acid, freeze dried, and then brought to working concentrations in perfusion medium. PAF was prepared as a 10 mg/ml stock solution in chloroform. Aliquots were removed to a siliconized glass test tube, reduced to dryness under a stream of N2, and dissolved in perfusion medium to the desired concentration. Some inhibitors and antagonists were also used. WEB 2086 (a competitive PAF-receptor antagonist, a gift of Boeringher Ingelheim AG, Ingelheim, Germany) was dissolved in perfusion medium. A stock solution of BN 50730 (PAF antagonist, a gift of Institute Henri Beaufour, Paris, France) was prepared in Me2SO. Working solutions were prepared by dilution in perfusion medium to give a final Me2SO concentration less than 0.2% (v/v). BAPTA-AM (0.1 and 0.5 μm; Sigma) was prepared in Hepes-modHTF. Embryos were exposed to BAPTA-AM for 20 min washed and then added to the perfusion chamber. In some cases, BAPTA-AM-treated embryos (0.5 or 1 μm; for 20 min at 27 h post-fertilization; early 2-cell stage) were set up in culture in modHTF, either untreated or supplemented with 20 ng of PAF/ml, and development monitored each 24 h for 96 h. To determine the dependence of transients on extracellular calcium, responses to embryo-derived PAF or exogenous PAF were examined in perfusion medium free of calcium (with osmolality adjusted with NaCl). The role of calcium channels was assessed by the inhibitory action of nifedipine (Calbiochem, L-type channel blocker) or pimozide (Sigma, T-type channel blocker). The presence of a functional L-type calcium channel was confirmed by challenging 2-cell embryos with mixed enantiomer (±)BAY K8644 (Sigma) which has a net agonistic action on calcium channels. Internal stores of calcium were depleted by use of the calcium-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin (1 μm, Sigma). It was prepared in BSA-free medium and embryos were treated with thapsigargin for 15 min prior to PAF challenge. The action of phospholipase C (PLC) in generating the intracellular [Ca2+]i transient was measured by treating 2-cell embryos with U73122 (5 μm, Calbiochem) for 5 min prior to challenge with exogenous PAF (37.2 nm). Challenge of untreated embryos and embryos treated with U73343 (Calbiochem; an inactive analogue of U73122) acted as controls. A cell-permeable inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-receptor antagonist, xestospongin C (24.Gafni J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) (Calbiochem), was prepared as a stock solution in ethanol and then diluted in perfusion medium to working concentration of 10 μm. Embryos were incubated with xestospongin (for 30 min immediately prior to challenge with PAF). Some zygotes were cultured in α-amanitin (11 μg/ml, Sigma) from 5 h post-fertilization to assess the role of transcription of new mRNA in the onset of the embryo responsiveness to PAF. Cell counts were performed by visualization of cell nuclei following staining with 4 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33342 (bisbenzimide, Sigma). Embryos were left in this solution for 45–60 min and then prepared as wet mounts on a glass microscope slide under a coverslip. An embryo was considered to have responded with a [Ca2+]i transient if the [Ca2+]i increased to be greater than twice the standard deviation of the average baseline ratio within 5 min of perfusion commencing and then subsequently decreased. A minimum of 5 readings was obtained for baseline assessment. Data is expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the [Ca2+]i at each observation time for all embryos, or as traces of individual embryos. Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS statistical package (version 8, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed by Chi-squared analysis. Responses over time were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Comparisons of peak amplitude of calcium responses or time taken to achieve peak amplitudes were by ttest. A surprising initial observation was that 2-cell embryos often displayed a spontaneous [Ca2+]i transient soon after imaging commenced without other treatment. This only occurred if embryos were collected and prepared in protein-free conditions and then exposed to medium containing albumin during imaging; in the absence of albumin from perfusion medium, [Ca2+]i transients were not seen (Fig.1 a). This calcium response was consistently observed as a single global calcium transient throughout the entire cell (zygote), or in both cells of the 2-cell embryo. Repetitive oscillations over the time frame of observation (30 min) were not detected. The transients were not artifactual responses to changes in temperature or osmolality since these potential variables were carefully controlled. The loading of embryos with Fura-2 AM, their subsequent washing and set-up on the imaging slide were all performed in protein-free medium. The response to medium containing albumin may indicate that albumin itself acted as a signaling molecule, or that it acted as an acceptor for a released embryo-derived trophic molecule. Albumin is required for the release of PAF from cells (25.Ludwig J.C. Hoppens C.L. McManus L.M. Mott G.E. Pinckard R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), including the 2-cell embryo (26.Ammit A.J. O'Neill C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,27.Ammit A.J. O'Neill C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18772-18778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), so we tested the hypothesis that PAF accumulates on the embryo's outer plasma membrane during processing in protein-free medium and is released upon exposure to albumin. This was done by determining whether the embryos response to albumin was inhibited by treating the embryos with exogenous rPAF acetylhydrolase (degrading PAF to an inactive form) prior to exposure to albumin. After Fura-2 AM loading, embryos were incubated with 174 μg of rPAF acetylhydrolase or vehicle for 15 min. They were then washed and challenged with perfusion medium containing BSA (Fig. 1 b). The rPAF acetylhydrolase treatment inhibited (p < 0.001) calcium transients in response to perfusion. The inhibition of spontaneous transients after rPAF acetylhydrolase treatment suggests that PAF was the only agent responsible for inducing these transients. To determine whether other embryonic growth factors might also cause calcium transients, a range of peptide growth factors was added as exogenous components of medium: EGF (1–1000 ng/ml), insulin-like growth factor-1 (1–1000 ng/ml), platelet-derived growth factor (0.1–2.5 ng/ml), and transforming growth factor-β (0.1–10 ng/ml). None of these induced any observable change in [Ca2+]i (results not shown). Following embryo-derived PAF-induced [Ca2+]itransients in 2-cell embryos, the same embryos failed to show any response to an immediate further challenge with exogenous PAF (results not shown) suggesting desensitization/down-regulation of the response. Down-regulation of an initial response to exogenous PAF (372 nm) also occurred; rPAF acetylhydrolase-treated embryos were exposed to exogenous PAF for 5 min and then at various intervals a second PAF challenge was applied. No embryos showed a [Ca2+]i response to the second PAF challenge at 15 or 25 min after the first challenge. By 35 min a small number (17%) responded and the proportion responding further increased at 40 min (75%) and 75 min (79%) (75 min results are shown in Fig.2). To enable the characterization of the action of PAF-antagonists on PAF-induced [Ca2+]i transients in 2-cell embryos, it was necessary to standardize the concentration of the PAF challenge. This was achieved by degrading externalized embryo-derived PAF with rPAF acetylhydrolase followed by exposure of embryos to exogenous PAF. Embryos (collected 29–31 h post-fertilization) responded to PAF (0.037–372 nm) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). At the lowest concentrations (0.037 nm) responses were not common and were of low amplitude when they did occur. At a concentration of 0.37 nm, low amplitude (p < 0.01) transients were consistently observed. At a concentration of 3.7, 37.2 (results not shown), and 372 nm responses were of a consistently high amplitude. At 0.37 nm, the time taken for the peak amplitude of the response to be achieved was longer (p< 0.01) compared with higher doses. Transients in response to exogenous PAF were typically single peaks; repetitive oscillations of short duration were rarely observed. The new baseline established after the [Ca2+]i peak was generally higher than the original baseline, perhaps indicating residual capacitative calcium entry (CCE). WEB 2086 (0.44–44 μm), a competitive PAF-receptor antagonist (28.Korth R. Hirafuji M. Keraly C.L. Delautier D. Bidault J. Benveniste J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), reduced the mean amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients in response to exogenous PAF (37 nm) compared with control responses. Responses were reduced (p < 0.0001) at 0.4–4.4 μm(Table I) and essentially abolished at 44 μm. BN 50730 also caused partial inhibition (p < 0.001) of [Ca2+]itransients induced by PAF but was not as effective as WEB 2086 (TableI).Table IThe effect of PAF-receptor antagonists on PAF-induced calcium transients in 2-cell embryosAntagonist concentrationMaximum rise in calcium concentration above baseline (nm) Mean ± S.E.WEB 2086BN 50730μm0415 ± 100.2270 ± 42.00.04159.0 ± 22.9ND aND, not determined.0.44203.0 ± 29.3ND4.40131.4 ± 30.1104.0 ± 14.044.019.8 ± 3.6136.0 ± 19.0The results are the mean ± S.E. of three replicates with at least 8 embryos per replicate.

Statistical analysis is in the text. The specificity of PAF's action was further confirmed by testing the response of embryos to the enantiomeric isomer of PAF (3-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphocholine). Over a concentration range of 40–400 nm, enantiomeric PAF was without effect on the [Ca2+]i of 2-cell embryos (35–37 h) that had been pretreated with rPAF acetylhydrolase (results not shown). Unfertilized oocytes and young zygotes (7–9 h after fertilization) failed to show any [Ca2+]i transients in response to medium containing albumin. By 10–13 h after fertilization, 8 of 32 zygotes showed detectable [Ca2+]i transients, and these were of modest amplitude (87.8 ± 24.5 nm above baseline values). For 2-cell embryos collected fresh from the reproductive tract, transients in response to embryo-derived PAF varied with the age of the embryo (Fig. 4 a). At 27–29 h after fertilization there were modest responses to embryo-derived PAF. By 31–33 h after fertilization the average [Ca2+]i transient was significantly (p < 0.01) greater in peak amplitude above baseline and reached its peak earlier (p < 0.01) than observed at 27–29 h. At 35–37 h embryo responses to embryo-derived PAF had declined in average amplitude (p < 0.01) and took longer (p < 0.05) to achieve peak amplitude above baseline than observed at 31–33 h. By 41–43 h the responses were significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated compared with each other time point tested for 2-cell embryos. No [Ca2+]i transients were observed in 4-cell, 8-cell, and morulae stage embryos (not shown). To determine whether these changes in responsiveness during development were due to changes in the availability of embryo-derived PAF or to changes in the capability of embryos to respond to PAF, we compared the embryo-derived PAF induced [Ca2+]i responses to those induced by exogenous PAF (372 nm) (in rPAF acetylhydrolase treated embryos). Oocytes and early embryos (7–9 h after fertilization) did not respond to exogenous PAF, but by 10–13 h after fertilization embryos showed a [Ca2+]iresponse. The peak amplitude of the response to exogenous PAF was significantly (p < 0.0001) larger (157.1 ± 16.4 nm above baseline) than the embryo-derived PAF-induced responses. In 2-cell embryos the [Ca2+]i response to exogenous PAF was greater than the spontaneous responses at each of the times studied (Fig. 4 b). In contrast to spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients, the amplitude of the response to exogenous PAF was similar (p > 0.05) at 27–29 h and 31–33 h after fertilization. Transients were significantly attenuated at 35–37 and 41–43 h after fertilization (p < 0.01) compared with younger 2-cell embryos. At each of these times, the average amplitude of response to exogenous PAF was greater than the"

E1A interferes with DNA-protein interactions at certain IFN-responsive promoters (10.Kalvakolanu D.V. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Harter M.L. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7459-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and also abrogates the binding of Stat1 to CBP/p300, because E1A and Stat1 utilize the same binding sites on CBP/p300 (11.Zhang J.J. Vinkemeier U. Gu W. Chakravarti D. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15092-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Therefore, one way for E1A to affect Stat1-mediated gene expression would be through competition for CBP/p300. A recent study shows that E1A also binds to Stat1 directly and thus can affect Stat1-mediated gene expression (12.Look D.C. Roswit W.T. Frick A.G. Gris-Alevy Y. Dickhaus D.M. Walter M.J. Holtzman M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The involvement of CBP/p300 in DNA-protein interactions at the LMP2 promoter has not been studied. However, we do know that Stat1 must bind to the LMP2 ICS-2/GAS to support constitutive transcription of the LMP2 gene (5.Chatterjee-Kishore M. Kishore R. Hicklin D.J. Marincola F.M. Ferrone S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16177-16183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted to analyze the involvement of CBP/p300 in LMP2 transcription and to evaluate whether down-regulation of constitutive LMP2 transcription by E1A is mediated by its direct binding to Stat1 or by interference with the Stat1-CBP/p300 interaction. We find that the LMP2 gene is expressed at normal constitutive levels in cells that express a mutant of Stat1 (Y701F) that is incapable of forming homodimers in response to ligand stimulation. Stat1 and IRF1 bind to each other directly, and the resulting complex binds to the LMP2 ICS-2/GAS element. E1A down-regulates LMP2 transcription by interfering with the Stat1-IRF1 interaction, which is essential for the constitutive expression of LMP2. The following cDNA reagents were kind gifts: E1A 12S from M. L. Harter and E1A 12S mutants RG2 and Δ2–36 from G. C. Sen (Cleveland Clinic Foundation); IRF1 C-terminal mutants from J. Hiscott (McGill University); Stat1 ΔN135 from R. Schreiber (Washington University, St. Louis, MO); Stat1 ΔN200 from R. Ransohoff (Cleveland Clinic Foundation); and Stat5/1 chimera from C. Schindler (Columbia University). U3A, U3A-IRF1(H), U3A-701, and 2fTGH cells (13.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 μg/ml from penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C under 10% CO2. Total RNA was prepared with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and mRNA was purified by using the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed by converting 1 μg of mRNA to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT) primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The LMP2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs were amplified from total cDNA by using specific primers (5.Chatterjee-Kishore M. Kishore R. Hicklin D.J. Marincola F.M. Ferrone S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16177-16183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For S1 nuclease analysis, mRNAs were hybridized with end-labeled, PCR-derived LMP2 and GAPDH probes, using the Ambion S1 nuclease kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA-DNA hybrids were purified and then analyzed in a 6% PAGE gel containing 8 m urea. The sizes of the protected fragments were 677 base pairs for LMP2 and 450 base pairs for GAPDH. Signals were recorded using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. A vector for the expression of His-Stat1 was constructed by amplifying Stat1 cDNA by PCR and cloning the product downstream of a His6tag. The forward PCR primer (GGATCATATGGGTGGTTCTCAGTGGTACGAACTTCAG) has an NdeI site and introduces two extra glycine residues in the linker for better thrombin cleavage, and the reverse primer (CGGGATCCTATCATACTGTGTTCATCATACTGTC) has a BamHI site. PCR was performed usingPfu TURBO (Stratagene), using conditions suggested by the manufacturer. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR-blunt (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer. The BamHI/NdeI fragment obtained from the construct in pCR-blunt was then subcloned into pET-15b (Novagen), creating Stat1 with a His-tag at the N terminus. To express and purify recombinant His-Stat1, the Stat1-pET-15b vector was transfected into Bl21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells (Novagen), which were grown in LB medium with 200 μg/ml carbenicillin at 28 °C until the A 600reached 1.0. 200 ml of this culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB with carbenicillin and allowed to grow at 28 °C until theA 600 reached 0.6. Isopropylthiogalactoside was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mm to induce the expression of His-Stat1. Cells were grown at 25 °C overnight, harvested by centrifugation, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 200 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). Cells were lysed and the suspensions were spun at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant solution was filtered, 10 ml of washed nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) were added, and the mixture was stirred slowly at 4 °C overnight. The beads were collected in a column and rinsed with 6 column volumes of lysis buffer. Protein eluted from the column with a buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol was dialyzed against 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C. 2fTGH cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 1 × 107 cells were treated with IFNγ (1000 IU/ml) for 15 min. U3A, U3A-701, 2fTGH, and IFNγ-treated 2fTGH cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 70 μl of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.135 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin at 0.1 mg/ml each). Following lysis on ice for 15 min, the cell suspensions were spun at >12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant solutions were used in EMSAs with the end-labeled LMP2 GAS probe (ATTCGCTTTCCCCTAAATG). In supershift assays, extracts of U3A-701 cells were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Stat1, raised against the C terminus (a gift of B. R. G. Williams, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) for 20 min before adding the radioactively labeled LMP2 GAS oligonucleotide. Cell extracts were prepared in HEM buffer as described for EMSAs. In vitro translation products for Stat1, Stat1 Y701F, Stat1 ΔN135, Stat1 ΔN200. Stat5/1, IRF1, and the C-terminal mutants of IRF1 were produced by using a T7-based coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal expression was confirmed by incorporating the Transcend biotin-tRNA label (Promega) into the translated products and analyzing them in Western transfers with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Extracts and in vitro translation products were precleared with normal rabbit serum and Gamma-bind G (Pharmacia) for 4 h at 4 °C. Precleared extracts and in vitro translation products were immunoprecipitated with anti-E1A (M73, Oncogene Sciences), anti-Stat1 (raised against the N and C termini; Transduction Laboratories), anti-IRF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or nonspecific antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in HEM buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membranes and detected with either anti-Stat1 or anti-IRF1. The IRF1 C-terminal mutants have been described (14.Lin R. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 169-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Streptavidin-agarose beads (Neutravidin-agarose, Pierce) were saturated with biotin-labeled oligonucleotides at 4 °C for 2 h, washed in HEM buffer, and incubated with either His-Stat1 (2–5 μg), IRF1 (in vitro translation products), U3A extracts, or U3A-IRF1(H) extracts at 4 °C for 1 h. The His-Stat1-saturated beads were then washed once with HEM buffer and incubated with either IRF1 (in vitro translation product), U3A extracts, or U3A-IRF1(H) extracts for 2 h at 4 °C. All samples were washed five times in HEM buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and separated in 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes and analyzed by using anti-IRF1. To analyze the effect of E1A on LMP2 transcription and to evaluate the role of CBP/p300, U3A (lacking Stat1 expression), U3A-701 (expressing Stat1 Y701F), and 2fTGH (expressing wild-type Stat1) cells were transfected transiently with constructs expressing the 12S splice variant of E1A, a mutant of E1A 12S lacking amino acids 2–36 (Δ2–36), which binds to neither CBP/p300 nor Stat1, and the RG2 mutant of E1A 12S, which does not bind to CBP/p300 but does bind to Stat1. LMP2 transcription was assessed in cells transfected with empty vector or the E1A variants after 48 h. LMP2 RNA is barely detectable in U3A cells. However, parental 2fTGH and U3A-701 cells express this RNA well, at similar levels. LMP2 transcription is almost abolished in U3A-701 and 2fTGH cells transfected with E1A (Fig.1). This down-regulation is not seen in cells transfected with Δ2–36, but the effect of RG2 is similar to that of E1A. Therefore, E1A down-regulates constitutive LMP2 transcription mediated by unphosphorylated Stat1, and CBP/p300 is not involved in constitutive LMP2 transcription, because transfection with RG2, which binds to Stat1 and not to CBP/p300, also down-regulates LMP2 expression. To understand how unphosphorylated Stat1 regulates LMP2 transcription, we analyzed the binding of factors to the LMP2 promoter, which contains overlapping ICS-2 and GAS sites that bind to IRF1 and Stat1, respectively. EMSAs with an LMP2 GAS probe (ATTCGCTTTCCCCTAAATG; GAS shown in bold) reveal a novel complex with extracts of both 2fTGH and U3A-701 cells (Fig. 2 A). This oligonucleotide includes most of the ICS-2 site (ATTCGCTTTCCCCTAAATG; shown in bold). The novel complex migrates more slowly than the complex involving tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 homodimer, formed in extracts of IFNγ-treated 2fTGH cells. Supershift analysis shows that the novel complex in both U3A-701 and 2fTGH cells does contain Stat1. Fig. 2 B shows the supershift assay, using extracts from U3A-701 cells. U3A, U3A-701, and 2fTGH cells were transfected transiently with E1A, Δ2–36, or RG2, and cell extracts were prepared 48 h later. The novel complex was almost totally absent in extracts of U3A-701 or 2fTGH cells transfected with either E1A or RG2. However, Δ2–36 had no effect in either U3A-701 or 2fTGH cells (Fig. 2 C). The most likely secondary component of the novel binding activity observed in U3A-701 and 2fTGH cells is IRF1, because the GAS oligonucleotide used in gel shift assays contains part of the overlapping ICS-2 site from the LMP2 promoter. To confirm that a Stat1-IRF1 complex can bind to the LMP2 GAS element, we saturated biotinylated LMP2 GAS oligonucleotides bound to streptavidin agarose beads with either unphosphorylated His-Stat1 or in vitrotranslated IRF1. IRF1 does not bind to the LMP2 GAS alone, but bound His-Stat1 captured in vitro translated IRF1 (Fig.3). To analyze whether His-Stat1 bound to the LMP2 GAS could also capture IRF1 from cell extracts, we used U3A cells expressing IRF1 from a transgene, because U3A cells express very low levels of endogenous IRF1 (13.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The bound His-Stat1 did indeed capture IRF1 from U3A-IRF1(H) cell extracts (Fig. 3). Stat1 and Stat1 Y701F both bind to IRF1 in vivo (Fig.4 A). Stat1 was co-immunoprecipitated from extracts of U3A-701 or 2fTGH cells but not from extracts of U3A cells, using an antibody against IRF1. Although the levels of IRF1 are low in 2fTGH, U3A, and U3A-701 cells, IRF1 could still be detected in immunoprecipitates of U3A-701 and 2fTGH cells with an antibody against Stat1 (Fig. 4 A). To investigate whether additional proteins are required for the Stat1-IRF1 interaction, IRF1, Stat1, and Stat1 Y701F were translatedin vitro, using a T7-based coupled transcription/translation system in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and the proteins alone or in pairwise combinations were immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat1 or anti-IRF1 (Fig. 4 B). The results clearly show that Stat1 and Stat1 Y701F interact directly with IRF1. The Stat1 binding capacity of E1A is required to down-regulate LMP2 transcription, and a complex of unphosphorylated Stat1 and IRF1 binds to the LMP2 GAS. To analyze the effect of E1A on the binding of Stat1 to IRF1, extracts were prepared from U3A, U3A-701, and 2fTGH cells transfected transiently with either E1A, Δ2–36, or RG2. Equal parts of each extract were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against E1A or IRF1, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed with antibodies against Stat1. As observed before (12.Look D.C. Roswit W.T. Frick A.G. Gris-Alevy Y. Dickhaus D.M. Walter M.J. Holtzman M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), Stat1 binds to E1A and RG2 but not to Δ2–36. Both Stat1 Y701F and Stat1 bound to E1A (Fig.5, top panel). Stat1-IRF1 binding was markedly reduced in U3A-701 and 2fTGH cells transfected with either E1A or RG2 but not in cells expressing Δ2–36 (Fig. 5,bottom panel). Thus, E1A binds to unphosphorylated Stat1, interfering with Stat1-IRF1 binding directly. To analyze the domains of Stat1 required for binding to E1A, E1A, Stat1, Stat1 Y701F, Stat1 ΔN135 (lacking the first 135 residues), Stat1 ΔN200, and Stat1-p84 (lacking the C-terminal transactivation domain, residues 712–750) were translated in vitro, alone or pairwise. Immunoprecipitations were performed with an antibody to E1A, and Stat1 was detected with antibodies directed against either the N or C terminus. Both Stat1 and Stat1 Y701F bind well to E1A (Fig. 6). The binding is barely detectable with Stat1 ΔN135, Stat1 ΔN200, and Stat1-p84. Thus, E1A binds to both ends of Stat1. We employed a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of IRF1, translatedin vitro, in co-immunoprecipitation assays with recombinant Stat1. IRF1, IRF1 1–300, IRF1 1–250, and IRF1 1–200 were all able to bind to recombinant Stat1 (Fig.7 A). The binding of IRF1 1–170 was very weak, and IRF1 1–150 and IRF1 1–120 did not bind detectably (Fig. 7 A). Thus, the minimal region of IRF1 required for binding to Stat1 probably lies between residues 170 and 200. Stat1 binds to another member of the IRF family, IRF9, through the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Stat1 (15.Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the same region is important for Stat1-IRF1 binding, two deletion mutants of Stat1, Stat1 ΔN135 (lacking the first 135 residues) and Stat1 ΔN200 (lacking the first 200 residues, which include most of the coiled-coil domain), were translated in vitro with IRF1 and used in co-immunoprecipitation assays using an antibody to IRF1. Both deletion mutants of Stat1 failed to bind to IRF1 (Fig. 7 B). We have also observed that IRF1 does not interact with Stat5 in vivo (data not shown). Extracts from U3A cells expressing Stat1 (U3A-Stat1) or from U3A cells expressing a Stat5B/Stat1 chimera (the first 129 residues of Stat5B and residues 130–750 of Stat1) were used in co-immunoprecipitations with anti-IRF1. Stat1 was detected in the co-imunoprecipitates, but Stat5/1 was not (Fig. 7 C). Thus the first 135 residues of Stat1 are required for Stat1-IRF1 binding, and both IRF1 and E1A bind to the same region of Stat1. The LMP2 gene requires unphosphorylated Stat1 for basal transcription. Transcription was detected in U3A-701 cells (expressing Stat1 Y701F, which is incapable of participating in dimer formation through the interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated Y701 with the SH2 domain of a Stat1 partner) but not in U3A cells (which lack Stat1). Previous work from our laboratory has identified other genes that can be activated in U3A-701 cells (13.Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Transfection of U3A-701 or 2fTGH cells with E1A abrogates LMP2 transcription. A mutant of E1A that binds to Stat1 but not to CBP/p300 also down-regulates LMP2 transcription, whereas Δ2–36, which binds to neither CBP/p300 nor Stat1, has no effect on the levels of LMP2 RNA in either U3A-701 or 2fTGH cells. A novel DNA-binding complex containing Stat1 can be detected in extracts of untreated U3A-701 or 2fTGH cells. The other protein component of this complex appears to be IRF1. Stat1 and IRF1 bind to each other directly through the N-terminal region of Stat1 and residues 170–200 of IRF1. The N-terminal region of Stat1, especially R161 within the coiled coil domain, is required for the binding of Stat1 to another member of the IRF1 family, IRF9 (previously called p48; Ref. 15.Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Stat1 might also be important for it to interact with accessory proteins that aid in its nuclear translocation and also with certain phosphatases (16.Strehlow I. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28049-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have observed that E1A binds to both the N- and C-terminal regions of Stat1 and probably interferes with Stat1-IRF1 interactions directly by occupying the N terminus of Stat1. E1A, essential for adenovirus replication, also activates the host cell cycle by sequestering proteins important for cell cycle checkpoint control (17.Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E1A may also help to suppress host defenses against virus infection by binding to the cellular co-activator CBP and the highly homologous p300 protein. The activation of many genes requires the histone acetyl transferase activity associated with CBP/p300. E1A competes with transcription factors for CBP/p300 and thus alters the transcription of many genes (7.Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M.

A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). E1A competes with Stat1 (19.Bhattacharya S. Eckner R. Grossman S. Oldread E. Arany Z. D'Andrea A. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Stat1 bind to CBP/p300 (18.Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The LMP2/TAP1 bi-directional promoter is down-regulated by adenovirus 12 (6). We show that the down-regulation of constitutive LMP2 transcription depends on the direct interaction of E1A with Stat1 and does not involve CBP/p300. A previous study identified the region of Stat1 required for binding to E1A to be the C-terminal transactivation domain (12.Look D.C. Roswit W.T. Frick A.G. Gris-Alevy Y. Dickhaus D.M. Walter M.J. Holtzman M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We find that the N-terminal region is also important, because the binding of E1A to N-terminal deletion mutants of Stat1 is very low. The N-terminal region of Stat1 is also required for binding to IRF1; the C-terminal region of Stat1 is not important for this interaction since Stat1-p84 does bind to IRF1 (data not shown). Therefore inhibition of Stat1-IRF1 binding and thus of constitutive LMP2 transcription is probably mediated by a competition between E1A and IRF1 for the N-terminal region of Stat1. The N-terminal region of IRF1 is involved in DNA binding (20.Schaper F. Kirchhoff S. Posern G. Koster M. Oumard A. Sharf R. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and perhaps homodimerization (21.Kirchhoff S. Schaper F. Oumard A. Hauser H. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal region is involved in interactions with other proteins (20.Schaper F. Kirchhoff S. Posern G. Koster M. Oumard A. Sharf R. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This demarcation is not absolute, because casein kinase II interacts with IRF1 through the N-terminal residues 1–120 (14.Lin R. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 169-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IRF1 mutants 1–170 and 1–200 can still bind to DNA but do not heterodimerize with IRF8 (also called ICSBP; Ref. 20.Schaper F. Kirchhoff S. Posern G. Koster M. Oumard A. Sharf R. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The interaction of Stat1, Stat2, and IRF9 to form ISGF3 already is well known, and the elucidation here of Stat1-IRF1 interactions reveals yet another way that members of the two interferon-inducible protein families can communicate. The region of IRF1 required for binding to Stat1 appears to be residues 170–200. Thus, IRF1 may interact with several proteins through different domains, allowing it to play a broad role in cellular signaling and transcription. In this regard, it is interesting that the IRF1-null mice used to analyze LMP2 gene transcription (22.White L.C. Wright K.L. Felix N.J. Ruffner H. Reis L.F. Pine R. Ting J.P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) actually express a truncated protein, generated by exon skipping (23.Reis L.F. Ruffner H. Stark G. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4798-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The deleted exons encode residues 63–182, and although the lack of this region abrogates the DNA binding activity of IRF1, the truncated protein may still bind to Stat1, and the complex may still bind to the ICS-2/GAS element through the DNA-binding domain of Stat1 and thus support the low level of LMP2 transcription observed in these mice. IRF1 alone does not bind to the LMP2 GAS; however, the ICS-2 and GAS elements overlap in this promoter. Thus, Stat1, IRF1, or both could provide DNA binding. Complexes of Stat1 with IRF1 or with another transcription factor would bind very specifically to DNA sequences that recognize both factors, and GAS sequences are close to other transcription factor binding sites in several genes (24.Harroch S. Gothelf Y. Revel M. Chebath J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3539-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25.Muhlethaler-Mottet A. Di Berardino W. Otten L.A. Mach B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). E1A represses the transcription of major histocompatibility complex class I genes by interfering with the binding of NF-kB, AP-1, and COUP-TF to regulatory elements in the promoters (26.Brockmann D.

We show here that E1A also interferes with the formation of the Stat1-IRF1 complex and with its binding to the ICS-2/GAS element of the LMP2/TAP1 promoter. Thus, in cells infected with adenovirus 12, the host antigen presentation machinery is virtually shut down, allowing them to escape killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1993008481,"The conformation and interactions with membrane mimics of the NH2-terminal fragment 1–25 of HA2, HA2-(1–25), of influenza virus were studied by spectroscopic methods. Secondary structure analysis of circular dichroism data revealed 45% helix for the peptide at pH 5.0. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching by acrylamide and NMR experiments established that the Trp14is inside the vesicular interior and residues 16–18 are at the micellar aqueous boundary. NBD fluorescence enhancement of the NH2-terminal labeled fluorophore on the vesicle-bound peptide indicated that the NH2 terminus of the fusion peptide was located in the hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer. No significant change in insertion depth was observed between pH 5.0 and 7.4. Collectively, these spectroscopic measurements pointed to an equilibrium between helix and non-helix conformations, with helix being the dominant form, for the segment in the micellar interior. The conformational transition may be facilitated by the high content of glycine, a conformationally flexible amino acid, within the fusion peptide sequence. Self-association of the 25-mer peptide was observed in the N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine SDS-gel electrophoresis experiments.

Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of the proprotein HA (4.Klenk H.-D. Rott R. Orlich M. Blodorn J. Virology. 1975; 68: 426-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) generates two polypeptide chains, HA1 and HA2, linked by a disulfide bond. HA1 acts as the receptor-binding subunit while HA2 anchors the HA molecule onto the viral membrane and mediates fusion with the target cell membrane. The fusion activity of proteolyzed HA is triggered by lowering the pH to about 5.0. HA has been shown to associate with and disrupt the membrane bilayer in order to exert its fusogenic function (5.Schoch C. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9267-9274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Gething M.J. Doms R.W. York D. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Structures of the ectodomain of enzymatically cleaved HA2 have been determined by x-ray crystallography at both neutral and acidic pH (3.Wilson I.A.

Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). In essence, the conformational change from neutral to low pH states consists in the transition of B-loop (55–76) to helix (8.Carr C.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) and transition of helix (105–113) to a loose turn. The resultant trimeric helical rod spans more than 100 Å and is packed on its external face by three shorter COOH-terminal helices in an antiparallel orientation. However, the NH2-terminal fusion peptide, which has been shown to be exposed at the fusion pH (9.Skehel J.J. Bayley P.M. Browns E.B. Martin S.R. Waterfield M.D. White J.M. Wilson I.A. Wiley D.C.

Steinhauser D.A. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), particularly in the membranous environment. Recently, the HA2-mediated fusion mechanism has been studied in considerable detail by several laboratories. Thus, Kembleet al. (14.Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), Melikyan et al. (15.Melikyan G.B. Brener S.A. Ok D.C. Cohen F.S. J.

Acta. 1991; 1065: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported intermediate steps which include hemifusion or stunted fusion in the mechanism leading to full membrane fusion. These intermediate structures involve reorientation of lipid molecules in the outer and inner leaflets of membranes in contact. It has also been deduced from Fourier transform infrared and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic experiments that the fusion peptide of influenza virus inserted into the membrane at a tilted angle (17.Ishiguro R. Kimura N. Takahashi S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9792-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18.Gray C. Tatulian S.A. Wharton S.A. Tamm L.K. Biophys.

These results necessitate examination of the structure of HA2 fusion domain and its interactions with the membrane at high resolution.The NH2-terminal region of HA2 encompassing the first 15 amino acids is highly conserved among various strains of influenza viruses. It is characterized by high content of glycine and alanine residues, followed by a more polar region encompassing residues 21–37 and leucine zipper-like domain starting at residue 38. Like other enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), this region is termed fusion peptide because of its importance in fusing with the target membrane, as highlighted by the observation that a single amino acid attachment to, or deletion of, the NH2-terminal glycine renders HA fusion incompetent (6.Gething M.J. Doms R.W. York D. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The orientation and the depth of insertion of HA2 into the membrane bilayer may provide some insight into the HA2-mediated fusion mechanism.Synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence of HA2 have been shown to cause liposome fusion and red blood cell lysis (20.Wharton S.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27606-27614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). From EPR and infrared spectroscopic experiments (22.Lüneberg J. Martin I. Nubler F. Ruyschaert J.-M. Herrmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27606-27614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it was deduced that the HA2 fusion peptide inserted into the vesicle at an oblique angle and the NH2 terminus of the fusion segment is located near the hydrocarbon-polar head group interface of the bilayer. The hydrophobic photolabeling technique can be used to probe the protein insertion into the membrane, but is unable to directly determine the insertion depth (23.Harter C. Bächi T. Semenza G. Brunner J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1856-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).It was also found that substitution of glutamic acids at positions 11 and 15 affected little the capacity of hemolysis and the fusion pH (21.Steinhauser D.A. Wharton S.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, deletion of the NH2-terminal glycine or its substitution by glutamic acid abolished the liposome fusion activity of the fusion peptide, and substitution of this amino acid residue changed the activating pH and α-helical content (20.Wharton S.A. Martin S.R. Ruigrok R.W. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 1847-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,24.Long M.L. Waring A.J. Hammer D.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1430-1439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Fluorescence measurements have been employed in the previous investigations on the insertion depth of HA2 fusion peptide into the model membrane (25.Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6500-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Clague M.J. Knutson J.R. Blumenthal R. Hermann A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5491-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The data by Clague et al. (26.Clague M.J. Knutson J.R. Blumenthal R. Hermann A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5491-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) placed Trp14 approximately 8 Å from the center of vesicular bilayer and suggested no appreciable positional change between neutral and acidic pH. For these experiments, only the location of the tryptophan probe can be deduced.In order to understand the structural basis of the fusion peptide of HA2, we carried out investigation on the peptides corresponding to HA2-(1–25) and HA2-(1–20) from strain X31 of the influenza virus, using NMR spectroscopy which affords information on the dynamics and structure at the atomic resolution as well as insertion depth on the amino acid level. Data from circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence, and NMR experiments enabled us to locate residues 16–18 of the fusion peptide at the interface of aqueous phase and hydrocarbon interior of micelle or vesicle. The result strikingly indicated the localization of Glu11 in the hydrophobic core of SDS micelle and pointed to the oligomerization of the peptide. Propensity for the latter property was substantiated by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Identification of the region residing in the membranous core and CD data analysis implied a conformational equilibrium for the segment, thus providing a rationalization of high content of highly conserved glycine residues in the fusion peptide sequence.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsTwo peptides corresponding to residues 1–25, HA2-(1–25) (NH2-GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDGWYGFR), and residues 1–20, HA2-(1–20), of HA2 (strain X31) of influenza virus were synthesized in an automated mode by a solid phase synthesizer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 431A using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. The peptides were cleaved from the resins by trifluoroacetic acids and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 reverse-phase column. The primary sequence of the peptide was ascertained by electrospray mass spectrometry.SDS was acquired from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) and d 25-SDS from Cambridge Isotope (Andover, MA). Lipids, 1,2-ditetradecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), and 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DPPS) were acquired from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Acrylamide, 5-doxyl-stearic acid (5-DXSA), proteinase K, and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) were purchased from Sigma. Otadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) was acquired from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Reagents for electrophoresis and molecular weight markers were products of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All reagents were used in the experiments without further purification. Solutions containing vesicles were prepared by solubilizing the lipids in a chloroform:methanol (4:1, v/v) mixture and drying the sample under nitrogen stream before dissolving in buffer solution. Mixtures of peptides and SDS or phospholipids were sonicated for 30–60 min before measurements.The amino-terminal labeling of the peptide with NBD was prepared by the standard procedure (27.Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of pure peptide was reacted with 2 equivalents of the NBD probe in dry dimethyl formamide at room temperature for 20 h. The conjugated peptide was further purified by high performance liquid chromatography as described above for the unlabeled peptide.MethodsNMR ExperimentsMicellar solutions containing HA2-(1–25):d 25-SDS 1.2:120 mm were used for NMR measurements. One-dimensional and two-dimensional1H NOESY and TOCSY NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer as described previously (28.Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In deuteron-hydrogen (D-H) exchange experiments, the peptide-incorporated SDS sample in the NMR tube was lyopholized three times with pure H2O. D2O:H2O (9:1) (v/v) was added immediately before acquiring NMR data (28.Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Chien W.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6593-6602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1H signal attenuation with varying pH is due to an increase in amide proton exchange rate at pH 8.0 compared with pH 5.0 (29.Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Trivedi V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5299-5309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), resulting in higher relaxation rate and weaker signal (30.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 31.Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) at higher pH. Relaxation enhancement by 5-DXSA is due to dipolar interaction between its unpaired electron on the doxyl moiety and the proton, and hence is highly sensitive to the distance between them.Structure CalculationsA total of 365, including 118 non-sequential, NOE interactions and 24 intra-residue dihedral angles were utilized in the structural computations using distance geometry/simulated annealing protocols of Biosym programs InsightII, Discover, and NMRchitect (version 97.0) from Molecular Simulations, Inc. (San Diego, CA). NOE data were converted into interproton distance using H2/H3 cross-peak of the aromatic ring of phenylalanine as reference. A range of 0.6 to 1.0 Å was allowed to vary in the distance constraints. In the simulated annealing protocol, the temperature was raised to 1000 K in four steps followed by a molecular dynamics run for 34 ps to allow more conformational space to be explored. The system was subsequently annealed to 300 K in 10 steps for a total of 66 ps and minimized by the steepest-descent and conjugated-gradients methods before final refined structures were obtained.Circular Dichroism ExperimentsCD experiments were carried on a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter at ambient temperature. Cells with path lengths of 0.1 and 1.0 mm were employed for sample solutions containing final concentrations of 75 μm, 15 mm HA2-(1–25):SDS and 12 μm, 1.2 mm HA2-(1–25):DMPC, respectively. Peptide concentration was determined by UV absorbance denatured in 6m guanidinium chloride, using ε = 12,660 liter mol−1·cm−1 at 280 nm for HA2-(1–25) containing one tyrosine and two tryptophan residues (32.Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded from 184 or 190–260 nm at scanning rate of 20 nm·min−1 with a time constant of 4 s, step resolution of 0.1 nm, and band width of 1 nm. For each of the peptide preparations, final CD profile was obtained by averaging four scans.CD data were represented in units of extinction coefficient, Δε (liter mol−1·cm−1), which is converted by Δε = [θ]/3300, where [θ] is the mean residue ellipticity (degree cm2 dmol−1). In turn, [θ] is obtained from the observed ellipticity (θ) according to [θ] = θ·l −1·c −1·n −1, where l is the cell length in mm, c is the molar concentration, and n is the number of amino acid residues in the peptide. Quantitative prediction of the secondary structure (helix, in particular) was accomplished by fitting CD data with Hennessey-Johnson (H.-J.) algorithm (33.Hennessey Jr., J.P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), by the programVarselec, using 33 proteins of known secondary structure as the basis set.Fluorescence ExperimentsSteady State Fluorescence StudiesFluorescence measurements of HA2-(1–25) in aqueous buffer, SDS micellar solution, and DMPC or DPPS vesicular solution were performed on a JASCO spectrofluorometer, model FP-777, using a cell of 1 cm in length at 25 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra in 300–450 nm range were recorded by using 280 nm excitation wavelength with a scan rate of 100 nm min−1, response time of 1 s and data interval of 0.1 or 0.2 nm. The band widths for excitation and emission were 5 and 1.5 nm, respectively. The average from two independent scans was taken for all spectral measurements. Appropriate blanks were subtracted to obtain the corrected spectra. The solutions used in this experiment contained 10 μm of the peptide, 50 mm sodium chloride as well as 2.5–4.0 mm SDS or 1.2 mmphospholipid.Acrylamide Quenching StudiesThe fluorescence quenching study monitors accessibility of the fluorophore to the acrylamide quencher. An incremental amount of acrylamide stock solution (1m) was added to the peptide (10 μm) solutions to make final concentrations of acrylamide up to 50 μm. Corrections due to dilution were made to the observed fluorescence intensities. The data were analyzed by the Stern-Volmer equation (34.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar), F0/F=1+KSV·[Q]Equation 1 where F 0 is the fluorescence intensity at the zero quencher concentration, F is the fluorescence intensity at any given quencher concentration [Q], whereasK SV represents the apparent Stern-Volmer quenching constant, obtained from the slope ofF 0/F versus[Q] plot. The reported K SV values were the average of two independent measurements.Binding of Peptide to Membrane and Accessibility of Peptide to Proteolytic CleavageThe ability of the peptide to bind to lipid membrane was studied by using fluorescent-labeled peptide. The peptide and the lipid concentrations were 1 and 500 μm, respectively. NBD fluorescence is sensitive to its environment (27.Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35.Rajarathnam K. Hochman J. Schindler M. Ferguson M.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3168-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A blue shift (from 550 to 528 nm) concomitant with an increase in fluorescence intensity arises from association of the labeled peptide with the membrane. Spectra were collected by employing 467 nm excitation wavelength. The protease cleavage experiment was performed under similar experimental conditions at neutral or acidic pH. The protease (∼30 μg/ml) was added to the NBD-conjugated peptide bound to the lipid bilayer and loss in fluorescence was measured with time (35.Rajarathnam K. Hochman J. Schindler M. Ferguson M.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3168-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the control experiment, the peptide was preincubated with the same amount of protease followed by the addition of phospholipid. The net retention of fluorescence is attributed to the protection of peptide from protease cleavage. The percent protection was defined as fluorescence intensity after addition of the protease relative to that before the protease treatment.Octadecylrhodamine Chloride B (R18) Human Erythrocyte Content Mixing AssaySelf-quenching of R18 was used to study the fusion efficiency of the 25-mer peptide. Dequenching is observed as a result of R18 being encapsulated in larger merged cells.Human red blood cells (RBC) were labeled according to the earlier procedures (5.Schoch C. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9267-9274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Morris S.J. Sarkar D.P. White J.M. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3972-3978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and used for counting. About 109cells suspended in 2 ml of PBS were labeled by using 40 μl of R18 solution (1 mg/ml in ethanol) in small aliquots with mild shaking. The suspension was made to 10 ml with PBS and kept at room temperature in dark. The cells were further washed twice and finally suspended in 10 ml of PBS. 200–250 μl of labeled RBC was suspended in 500 μl of PBS followed by addition of peptide at final concentration of 50 μm. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 556 and 590 nm, respectively, for fluorescence measurements. The suspension was acidified to pH 5.0 by sodium citrate prior to the addition of peptide for acidic condition. The measured dequenching was normalized by the dequenching obtained with adding 5 μl of 10% (v/v) Triton X-100 according to, %Dequenching=(Ft−Fo)(F−Fo)Equation 2 where F t and F o are fluorescence intensities at a given time t and at time 0 (before addition of the peptide), respectively, while F is the fluorescence after introduction of Triton X-100 and is taken as fluorescence at infinite dilution of probe. The time course was followed for 10 min with excitation and emission band widths of 5 and 1.5 nm, respectively.The percentage of fluorescence dequenching was measured relative to the increased value obtained with the control solution by adding 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 to the R18-encapsulated RBC dispersion.Tricine SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)Tricine SDS-PAGE was performed according to the procedures used by Pristkar et al. (38.Pritsker M. Rucker J. Hoffman T.L. Doms R.W. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11359-11371Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The stacking, spacer, and running gels with 4, 10, and 16.5% of acrylamide, respectively, were used as described by Schägger and Jagow (39.Schägger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). Peptide samples were incubated with buffer solutions containing 1% of SDS, 0.06m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 20% of sucrose or glycerol. Fixing, staining, and destaining times were adjusted to 1 min, 1 h, and overnight, respectively, to reduce the extent of diffusion (38.Pritsker M. Rucker J. Hoffman T.L. Doms R.W. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11359-11371Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe acrylamide fluorescence quenching (Table I) and CD (Fig. 2) experiments in vesicular and micellar solutions suggest the suitability of using the SDS micelle to probe the insertion of HA2-(1–25) into lipid bilayers. NMR attenuation technique detects the 1H signal change by pH variation, D-H exchange and spin label on the contiguous amino acids along a fusion peptide sequence (31.Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Supported by fluorescence experiments using acrylamide quenching and NBD-labeled peptide, the NMR results shown in Fig. 8 allow a precise determination of the penetration position of the fusion peptide in the membrane environment. Compared with another method of probing the burial depth, fluorescence quenching of fluorophore attached to fusion peptide by spin-labeled lipids (40.Breukink E. van Kraaij C. van Dalen A. Demel R.A. Siezen R.J. de Kruijff B. Kuipers O.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8153-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the present approach offers two advantages. First, the attenuation profile is along the entire peptide chain, allowing a clear identification of boundary of the two regions between which there is a large distinction in water accessibility. In contrast, the fluorescence method is based on the distance dependent quenching between the fluorophore and the quencher moieties on the two different molecules and therefore subject to uncertainties such as the orientation of the interacting groups and flip-flop of the labeled phospholipid. Second, there is no additional perturbation of membrane structure since no spin-label and fluorophore are necessary. Using the EPR technique, Macosko et al. (19.Macosko J.C. Kim C.-H. Shin Y.-K. J. Mol.

Still another method, hydrophobic photolabeling, is not capable of directly pinpointing the depth of penetration (44.Harter C. James P. Bächi T. Semenza G. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6459-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Among the three NMR methods adopted in the present work, D-H exchange affords a more sensitive 1H signal attenuation for residues near the apolar-polar boundary. Thus resonance intensity of Gly13-Gly16 is largely reduced in D-H exchange experiments whereas these signals are gradually affected by pH variation (Fig. 8 A). This is in part due to the fact that D-H exchange measurements were made at minutes or longer after the onset of introducing deuterium oxide into SDS solution.For HA2-(1–25) in SDS dispersion, the helix content is found to be 45% (Fig. 2), which amounts to 11 helical residues. However, data from NMR, and fluorescence measurements on the Trp quenching by acrylamide (Table I) as well as NBD-labeled peptide (Fig. 3 A) at pH 5.0 enable us to locate the residues (Gly13-Ile18) near the micelle-water or vesicle-water interface but inside the apolar interior of micelle and the NH2 terminus of the peptide in the hydrophobic region. Hence it is impossible for the micelle-inserted portion of the peptide to adopt a purely helical structure. On the other hand, NMR data (Fig. 7) indicate that segment 2–14 is located inside the micelle primarily as helix. Taken together, our data lead to the proposition that there is an equilibrium between helix and non-helix conformations for the region, with helix being the predominant form. This may be rationalized by the presence of a high content of glycine, known for its conformational plasticity, within the segment. A mutational study by Steinhauser et al. (21.Steinhauser D.A. Wharton S.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the effect of substituting glycine within HA2 by bulky non-polar amino acids indicated that the fusogenicity was greatly impaired by changes at positions 1 and 8, and only the alanine substitution was tolerated.Identification of residues near the membrane-water interface and the proposition of transition between helix and non-helix forms for the portion of HA2 immersed in the membrane bilayer may be germane to the HA2-mediated fusion. First, it is impossible to span both leaflets of the membrane bilayer for a helical peptide sequence of about 16 amino acid residues, especially if an oblique insertion mode is adopted by the fusion peptide as deduced from IR and EPR measurements (17.Ishiguro R.

We examined if stabilization of mRNA decay could account for the >20-fold increase in the expression of CYP7A1 mRNA without a detectable change in transcription following dexamethasone treatment of rat hepatoma cells (L35 cells). Following RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription block or protein synthesis block, the decay of CYP7A1 mRNA displayed a short half-life (∼30 min). Control experiments showed that in cells pre-treated with a RNA polymerase II inhibitor, dexamethasone had no detectable effect on CYP7A1 mRNA decay. Stable expression of luciferase reporter mRNAs in L35 cells showed that the CYP7A1 3′-UTR was required to observe a dexamethasone induction. To examine the hypothesis that a labile protein is required for dexamethasone-induced mRNA stabilization, cells were stably transfected with a tetracycline-repressible promoter that drives the expression of a green fluorescent protein analogue (ECFP) with or without the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1. Cells expressing ECFP with the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 displayed a 3-fold dexamethasone induction of ECFP mRNA, whereas cells expressing ECFP without the 3′-UTR did not. Moreover, specific block of the transcription of ECFP containing the 3′-UTR by adding the tetracycline analogue doxycycline clearly displayed dexamethasone-induced stabilization of mRNA decay.

Transcriptional variation results in an almost concomitant change in CYP7A1 mRNA levels, suggesting that CYP7A1 mRNA displays rapid turnover (6.Noshiro M. Nishimoto M. Okuda K. J. Biol.

Additional studies have led to the conclusion that these rapid diurnal variations are due to regulated degradation of its mRNA and protein (20.Sundseth S.S. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15090-15095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that a post-transcriptional mechanism (e.g. stabilization of mRNA) might have been responsible for a >20-fold increase in the steady-state levels of CYP7A1 mRNA in L35 rat hepatoma cells treated with dexamethasone (14.Trawick J.D. Wang S.-L. Bell D. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3099-3102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based solely on the observation that no detectable change in CYP7A1 transcription was observed in nuclei prepared from control and dexamethasone-treated cells (14.Trawick J.D. Wang S.-L. Bell D. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3099-3102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this report we examine the effect of dexamethasone on the stability and expression of rat CYP7A1 and chimeric mRNAs encoding luciferase or an analogue of green fluorescent protein (ECFP). Our results show that the 3′-UTR of rat CYP7A1 and a labile protein, which is rapidly depleted from cells whose transcription or translation is blocked, are sufficient to allow dexamethasone-induced stabilization of mRNA decay.

Cells were treated with dexamethasone (0.1 mm), 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB), cycloheximide, or doxycycline-HCl at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Control cells received ethanol (vehicle) only. Cells were harvested at the times indicated in the figure legends by removing the culture medium and adding guanidinium isothiocyanate (24.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

RNA (2 to 5 μg of poly(A) RNA) was loaded onto 0.8% agarose, 3% formaldehyde gels and subjected to electrophoresis. The gels were blotted onto Zetaprobe GT (Bio-Rad) nylon membranes and hybridized with nick-translated cDNA probes using the conditions described for Zetaprobe by Bio-Rad. After hybridization and washing, Northern blots were exposed to phosphor screens of a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, Kodak Biomax MS film, or to DuPont Reflection Autoradiography film, as described (14.Trawick J.D.

The pcDNA3-Luc plasmid was constructed by ligating the firefly luciferase reporter gene into theBamHI-XhoI site of pcDNA3. This construct was used as the backbone for the subsequent addition of the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 mRNA. The entire 3′-UTR of rat CYP7A1 was obtained from two individual pBSSK:7α 3′-UTR plasmids (kindly supplied by Dr. John Chiang, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine). The CYP7A1 3′-UTR was excised from the pBSSK:7α 3′-UTR plasmids with NotI and Bsp120I and ligated into pcDNA3-Luc that had been linearized with Bsp120I to form the pcDNA3–7α 3′-5′ construct. This plasmid (designated pcDNA3-luc-7α 3′-5′) was sequenced and shown to contain sequences identical to the 3′-UTR in the reverse orientation. To construct the luciferase plasmid with the 3′-UTR in the correct 5′ to 3′ orientation, (pcDNA3-luc-7α 5′-3′ construct), PCR was utilized. Using pcDNA3-Luc-7α 3′-5′ as a template, PCR primers (DM1–5′CCGCGTCGACTACGTGGTTGGAAGAAGCGAACACT3′ and DM2–5′CGCCGGCCGTTGCTAGTCTGTGTGTCACATGTCA3′) were used to amplify the CYP7A1 3′-UTR in the following reaction: 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1.5 min for 30 cycles. ASalI site was engineered into the DM1 primer, and anEagI site was engineered into the DM2 primer for cloning of the PCR product into pcDNA3-Luc. The vector pcDNA3-Luc was digested with XhoI and Bsp120I and ligated with the CYP7A1 5′-3′ PCR SalI-EagI fragment to produce pcDNA3-Luc 3′-UTR. Each construct containing the CYP7A1 3′-UTR in either orientation was sequenced using the dideoxy method (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) and an automated DNA sequence analyzer (DuPont). The sequence was in total agreement with published data (26.Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A modified version of the TetOff expression system (21.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) was purchased from CLONTECH. pECFP (CLONTECH) was ligated into the bidirectional tetracycline response plasmid, pBI-L, to form pBIL-ECFP, whose sequence was confirmed to be correct. The plasmid encoding ECFP containing the rat CYP7A1 3′-UTR was made by inserting the rat CYP7A1 3′-UTR into pBIL-ECFP as follows. PCR was utilized to produce an amplified segment of DNA template containing EagI restriction sites at the ends for cloning into pBIL-ECFP. The entire rat CYP7A1 3′-UTR was PCR-amplified using Luc 3′-UTR as a template and appropriate primers containing EagI on each end. The resulting amplified segment was digested with EagI and ligated into pBIL-ECFP. Clones containing the entire 3′-UTR in the correct orientation were identified by restriction digestions. The sequence of the plasmid, pBIL-ECFP 3′-UTR, was confirmed to be correct. L35 rat hepatoma cells were cultured until 70% confluency. Each expression plasmid pcDNA3-Luc 3′-UTR and the control plasmid pcDNA3-Luc was transfected into L35 cells using Ca3PO4, as described (27.Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were selected for stable expression of the plasmid expressing neomycin resistance by culturing in G418 (400 μg/ml). Once selected, at least three single cell clones/transfection were isolated. L35 cells were transfected with the TetOff regulatory plasmid and selected for resistance to the neomycin analogue, G418 (400 μg/ml). Single cell clones were isolated using the limiting dilution method. Clones were then screened for the presence of a doxycycline-repressible expression of luciferase (produced by a transiently transfected pBIL expression plasmid). A single cell clone (L35ctTA-X) exhibiting high expression of luciferase in the absence of doxycycline and low expression of luciferase in the presence of doxycycline was used to obtain stable clones of cells expressing the ECFP expression plasmids, as described below. L35ctTA-X cells were transfected with either pBIL-ECFP or pBIL-ECFP 3′-UTR along with pTK-Hyg, and stable cells were selected for resistance to hygromycin (400 μg/ml). Cells were single cell-cloned by limiting dilution. Single cell clones resistant to G418 (400 μg/ml) and hygromycin (400 μg/ml) displaying ECFP fluorescence in the absence of doxycycline and no fluorescence in the presence of doxycycline were used for the studies described below. Genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAamp blood kit (Qiagen). The relative copy numbers of the transfected plasmids in the isolated genomic DNA were digested with BamHI and StuI to excise the luciferase-encoding region. The digests were loaded onto 0.8% agarose gels and subjected to electrophoresis, transferred, and hybridized using 32P-labeled probes for the coding region of luciferase and CYP7A1 (22.Leighton J.K. Dueland S. Straka M.S. Trawick J. Davis R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2049-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Relative copies of luciferase/genomic CYP7A1 were determined using PhosphorImager densitometry of the Southern blots. Results are given as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was determined by Student's ttest. Values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered to be significant. It has been generally noted that the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 contains multiple AUUUA elements (6.Noshiro M. Nishimoto M. Okuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10036-10041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

In an appropriate context, AUUUA sequences in the 3′-UTR of several mRNAs influence mRNA stability (29.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar, 30.Shyu A.-B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G.

We examined the cDNAs from rat, hamster, mouse, rabbit, and human CYP7A1 for conserved AUUUA elements (Fig. 1). All five of the different species mRNAs contain AU elements in their coding region and 3′-UTRs (Fig. 1). The rat CYP7A1 mRNA contains eight AUUUA elements and many near-consensus AUUUA elements. Seven of the AUUUA elements are located in the 3′-UTR, and five are clustered between bases 2585 and 2782. Interspersed among the seven AUUUA motifs in the 3′-UTR are 10 mid-sized (5–7 nucleotides long) U stretches. These mid-sized U stretches combined with one to three AUUUA motifs have been shown to regulate the stability of other mRNAs (e.g. c-fos (34.Chen C.-Y.A. You Y. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 35.Chen C.-Y., A. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)). Rat CYP7A1 mRNA also contains four heptameric UAUUUA(U/A) sequences, which may regulate mRNA stability when present in the 3′-UTR as three copies (31.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, the rat CYP7A1 mRNA contains a perfect nonomeric UUAUUU(U/A)(U/A) sequence, which by itself has been shown to cause rapid degradation (31.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 33.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic conservation of several of these AUUUA elements in the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 mRNA raises the possibility that they may play an important physiologic role. We examined the rate of CYP7A1 mRNA decay following inhibition of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription by DRB (36.Sehgal P.B. Darnell J., J.E. Tamm I.

At 0 h before the addition of DRB, the expression of CYP7A1 mRNA by L35 cells treated with dexamethasone was >20-fold compared with untreated cells (Fig.2 A). Within 1 h of adding DRB, approximately 75% of the CYP7A1 mRNA was lost from both groups of L35 cells. After this time up until 4 h, there was no detectable loss of the remaining CYP7A1 mRNA. The rate of decay of CYP7A1 mRNA (half-life ∼30 min) was similar to that of c-myc mRNA (half-life ∼36 min), a cell cycle-specific gene product whose mRNA displays rapid turnover. Furthermore, using this experimental protocol, dexamethasone treatment did not significantly affect the rate of decay of either CYP7A1 or c-myc mRNA. In HepG2 cells, dexamethasone did not alter the rate of decay of human CYP7A1 following polymerase II inhibition (37.Andreou E.R. Prokipcak R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These data suggest that either dexamethasone did not affect the rate of turnover of CYP7A1 mRNA or that a factor that is required for dexamethasone-mediated stabilization of CYP7A1 mRNA was lost upon RNA polymerase II block by DRB. To determine if translation is required for the rapid degradation of CYP7A1 mRNA, dexamethasone-induced L35 cells were treated with cycloheximide (0.05 mg/ml). Under the conditions and time course of these experiments, there was no evidence of cell toxicity as determined by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Within 1 h of adding cycloheximide CYP7A1 mRNA decreased (Fig. 3) in a manner that was similar to the decrease observed following RNA polymerase II block with DRB (Fig. 2). The decay of CYP7A1 mRNA was specific, since even after 4 h there was no detectable loss of mRNAs encoding β-actin (Fig. 3) or c-myc (data not shown). These data suggest that translation is not required for the rapid degradation of CYP7A1 mRNA and that a labile protein required for dexamethasone-mediated stabilization of CYP7A1 mRNA was lost upon cycloheximide treatment. Cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression plasmids encoding both a neomycin-resistant gene product and the enzyme luciferase were constructed so that the entire rat CYP7A1 3′-UTR was either absent or present 3′ to the luciferase mRNA. Single cell clones resistant to G418 were obtained and assayed for luciferase mRNA expression by Northern blotting (Fig.4). Cells expressing the plasmid without the CYP7A1 3′-UTR contained a single luciferase mRNA (∼2 kilobases) (Fig. 4). In the cells expressing luciferase containing the CYP7A1 3′-UTR, three different-sized mRNAs encoding luciferase were present (Fig. 4). These three luciferase mRNAs had sizes similar to the sizes of rat CYP7A1 mRNA plus an additional 0.16 kilobases, which is equal to the larger coding region of luciferase compared with CYP7A1. These data suggest that the different molecular weight forms of the rat CYP7A1 mRNA are produced by different usages of polyadenylation sites contained within the 3′-UTR, as predicted (28.Jelinek D.F. Russell D.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7781-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the absence of dexamethasone, cells stably transfected with the luciferase plasmid without the 3′-UTR contained ∼10-fold greater luciferase mRNA compared with cells stably transfected with the luciferase plasmid containing the 3′-UTR (Fig. 4). Moreover, dexamethasone caused a 3-fold increase in luciferase mRNA levels in 24 h but had no effect on the expression of luciferase without the 3′-UTR (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained in a total of three separate single cell clones (i.e. dexamethasone treatment caused a 2–3-fold increase in the expression of mRNA encoding luciferase with the 3′-UTR, whereas there was no significant change in the level of luciferase mRNA without the 3′-UTR. Additional experiments showed that dexamethasone did not affect the rate of degradation of the luciferase mRNA containing the 3′-UTR (i.e. following DRB-blocked transcription, the rate of decay was the similar in cells treated with and without dexamethasone; data not shown). These findings are similar to those observed for the endogenous CYP7A1 mRNA (i.e. dexamethasone increased steady-state mRNA levels without altering mRNA decay; Fig. 2). The inability to experimentally observe an effect of dexamethasone on the rate of turnover of mRNAs containing the CYP7A1 3′-UTR might be explained if dexamethasone mRNA stabilization required a labile protein that may have been depleted following transcription arrest. To examine the hypothesis that a labile protein is necessary for dexamethasone-induced stabilization of mRNAs containing the CYP7A1 3′-UTR, we developed an experimental approach that would specifically block the transcription of a reporter mRNA with and without the CYP7A1 3′-UTR. A modified version of the TetOff expression system (21.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) (CLONTECH) was chosen for these experiments. This regulated mammalian expression plasmid system utilizes two plasmids, the TetOff regulator plasmid and the TRE response plasmid. The TetOff plasmid constitutively expresses a doxycycline-controlled transactivator (tTA), a fusion of the wild-type Tet repressor fromEscherichia coli to the activation domain of VP16 from herpes simplex virus. A single cell clone of L35 cells stably expressing tTA was obtained and subsequently transfected with a response plasmid (pBI-L) that expressed either ECFP with or ECFP without the CYP7A1 3′-UTR. In addition, luciferase was also expressed from the bidirectional tTA response element. The following characteristics were consistently observed in three separate single cell clones of L35 cells stably expressing mRNAs encoding ECFP with and without the CYP7A1 3′-UTR. In the absence of dexamethasone, cells expressing ECFP without the 3′-UTR displayed an easily visualized cyan fluorescence (Fig.5). In marked contrast, cells expressing ECFP containing the 3′-UTR displayed a cyan fluorescence that was barely visible in the absence of dexamethasone (Fig. 5). The level of fluorescence displayed by the cells agreed with the relative level of expression of ECFP mRNA, as shown below. Similar to the results obtained with the luciferase constructs (Fig. 4), in the absence of dexamethasone, the expression of ECFP without the 3′-UTR was >10-fold that of ECFP containing the 3′-UTR. These data further support the conclusion that the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 confers instability to chimeric mRNAs. Moreover, following treatment of cells with dexamethasone, the intensity of the fluorescence of the cells expressing ECFP without the 3′-UTR did not change, whereas the fluorescence of the cells expressing ECFP containing the 3′-UTR was significantly increased. Treating cells with the tetracycline analogue, doxycycline, decreased the fluorescence of both groups of cells whether or not they were also treated with dexamethasone. These data show that the fluorescence of both groups of cells was blocked by doxycycline and that only the ECFP containing the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 was increased in cells treated with dexamethasone. Multiple mRNAs encoding ECFP containing the 3′-UTR (Fig.6) corresponded in size to the multiple luciferase mRNAs containing the 3′-UTR (Fig. 4). Moreover, the level of fluorescence displayed by cells expressing ECFP mRNAs agreed closely with the levels of ECFP mRNA expression (Fig. 6). The level of ECFP mRNA containing the 3′-UTR was <10% of the level of mRNA encoding ECFP without the 3′-UTR. Moreover, dexamethasone caused a 3-fold increase in the relative content of mRNA encoding ECFP containing the 3′-UTR (Fig. 6). These data confirm the findings observed with the luciferase chimeras (i.e. the presence of the CYP7A1 3′-UTR is sufficient to confer dexamethasone induction). To examine if dexamethasone affected the stability of the ECFP mRNA containing the 3′-UTR, plasmid-dependent transcription was specifically blocked by adding doxycycline. A rapid decrease in ECFP mRNA displayed a double-exponential decay (Fig. 6). The decrease in ECFP mRNA was specific as demonstrated by the observation that the relative abundance of other mRNAs (e.g. β-actin) was unchanged throughout the time course of the experiment (Fig. 6). Moreover, it is clear that dexamethasone treatment significantly decreased the rate of degradation of ECFP mRNA containing the 3′-UTR (Fig. 6). In cells treated with dexamethasone, the rate of decay of mRNA encoding ECFP containing the 3′-UTR was ∼4-fold slower than the rate of decay without dexamethasone treatment. In contrast, dexamethasone had no effect on the decay of luciferase mRNA (data not shown). These data provide compelling evidence that dexamethasone induces the expression of mRNAs containing the 3′-UTR of rat CYP7A1 by decreasing the rate of mRNA degradation. Our results support the following conclusions. 1) In the absence of dexamethasone, the rate of degradation of rat CYP7A1 mRNA is relatively rapid (i.e. similar to that of c-myc) (Fig. 2); 2) in its natural context and when added to mRNAs encoding luciferase or ECFP, the rat CYP7A1 3′-UTR acts to decrease expression; 3) the steady-state levels of mRNAs encoding luciferase or ECFP that contain the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 is increased in L35 cells treated with dexamethasone (Figs. 2, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6); 4) dexamethasone increases the levels of mRNA encoding ECFP containing the 3′-UTR of rat CYP7A1 by decreasing its rate of degradation; and 4) a labile protein, which is likely to be an RNA-binding protein, is required for dexamethasone stabilization of mRNAs containing the 3′-UTR of rat CYP7A1. In L35 cells, the rate of decay of CYP7A1 mRNA was similar to that of c-myc (Fig.2), whose degradation is considered to be rapid (38.Herrick D.J. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We estimated the half-life of CYP7A1 mRNA in L35 cells to be ∼30 min. This rate of endogenous CYP7A1 decay is similar to the rapid rate of decay in cells expressing ECFP containing the 3′-UTR and cultured without dexamethasone (half-life = 45.6 min, Fig. 6). In other experimental systems and treatments the half-life of CYP7A1 mRNA varied from 30 min (39.Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Lucas V. Heuman D.M. Chiang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G401-G410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to ∼4 h (6.Noshiro M. Nishimoto M. Okuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10036-10041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Andreou E.R. Prokipcak R.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40.Twisk J. Lehmann E.M. Princen H.M.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The combined data support the proposal that CYP7A1 mRNA displays a relatively rapid rate of degradation. Our additional finding that irrespective of dexamethasone presence, adding the CYP7A1 3′-UTR to mRNAs encoding both luciferase (Fig. 4) and ECFP (Fig. 6) resulted in markedly lower steady-state expression of these mRNAs. However, without the 3′-UTR there was >10-fold higher expression as compared with mRNAs containing the 3′-UTR. Assuming that the presence of 3′-UTR in the expression vector would not affect transcription, the increased steady-state levels of mRNAs without the CYP7A1 3′-UTR indicates that the 3′-UTR enhances mRNA degradation. These conclusions are consistent with the predictions suggesting that the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 mRNAs acts to destabilize mRNA (6.Noshiro M. Nishimoto M. Okuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10036-10041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

It has been reported that the enzymatic activity produced by a chimeric mRNA containing the mouse CYP7A1 3′-UTR was significantly less than that produced by an mRNA without the 3′-UTR (41.Agellon L.B. Cheema S.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The findings that mRNAs encoding either luciferase (Fig. 4) or ECFP (Fig. 6) displayed dexamethasone induction when they contained the 3′-UTR of rat CYP7A1, but no induction without the 3′-UTR, strongly indicate that non-coding sequences play a regulatory role in CYP7A1 expression. However, the 3-fold increase in luciferase (Fig. 4) and ECFP (Fig. 6) mRNA levels by dexamethasone is clearly less than the >20-fold induction of the endogenous CYP7A1 mRNA (Fig. 2). There are several possible explanations for this difference. First, dexamethasone might increase transcription of the endogenous CYP7A1 gene. Using nuclear extracts from L35 cells run-off transcription assays detected no significant increase with dexamethasone (14.Trawick J.D. Wang S.-L. Bell D. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3099-3102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that the coding region of CYP7A1, which also contains AUUUA elements (Fig. 1), may affect the dexamethasone-mediated stabilization. Finally, it is also possible that differences in the stoichiometric relationships between the mRNA and the factors that may decrease its degradation may account for this decreased induction. Our findings strongly support the conclusion that a labile protein(s) may be necessary for dexamethasone to decrease the degradation of an ECFP mRNA containing the 3′-UTR (Fig. 6). These data imply that the cellular content of this(these) protein(s) relative to the amount of mRNA containing the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 plays a critical role in dexamethasone-induction of mRNA expression. We were unable to directly measure a dexamethasone-induced stabilization of mRNA decay of either the endogenous CYP7A1 mRNA or the luciferase mRNA containing the 3′-UTR. However, using the tetracycline-regulatable expression vector, we were able to clearly detect a slower rate of degradation of the mRNA encoding ECFP with the CYP7A1 3′-UTR in dexamethasone-treated cells (Fig. 6). These data strongly support the conclusion that the 3′-UTR of CYP7A1 confers dexamethasone induction of mRNA expression by increasing mRNA stability. The requirement for a labile protein for dexamethasone stabilization of CYP7A1 mRNA can explain the unexpected finding that inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment decreased the cellular content of CYP7A1 mRNA (Fig. 3) at a rate that was similar to the decay rate caused by blocking transcription with DRB (Fig. 2). Clearly, rapid and regulated changes in mRNA degradation coupled to changes in transcription afford a more immediate change in mRNA expression and, presumably, enzyme activity. Although, to our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate a regulated change in CYP7A1 mRNA degradation, there have been several reports providing data that indirectly predicted this possibility. Diurnal changes in CYP7A1 transcription are mediated by DBP, a diurnally regulated transcription factor that binds to 5′ sequences in the CYP7A1 promoter and activates transcription (7.Lavery D.J. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1871-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 8.Lee Y.H. Alberta J.A. Gonzalez F.J. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14681-14689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transcriptional variation results in an almost concomitant change in CYP7A1 mRNA levels, leading to the conclusion that due to the presence of instability elements in the 3′-UTR, CYP7A1 mRNA displays rapid turnover (6.Noshiro M. Nishimoto M. Okuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10036-10041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lavery D.J. Schibler U.

Changes in CYP7A1 mRNA stability have been proposed to play a role in mediating bile acid repression of CYP7A1 transcription. (7.Lavery D.J. Schibler U.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There are two secondary effects of CYP7A1 enzymatic action that may require rapid changes. 1) Bile acids are cytotoxic, and their synthesis may require rapid regulation to prevent excessive accumulation and 2) in the hepatocyte, control of the cellular pool of cholesterol is intimately linked to expression of CYP7A1. The relatively rapid and variable turnover rate of CYP7A1 mRNA may ensure that changes in transcription rapidly invoke changes in the functional expression of this physiologically important enzyme. Additional studies show that the 3′-UTR of rat CYP7A1 mRNA prevents the expression of CYP7A1 in several non-hepatic tissue culture cell lines (RAW 264.1 macrophages and McArdle rat hepatoma cells). 2G. L. Moore and R. A. Davis, unpublished data. Removing the 3′-UTR of rat CYP7A1 results in a robust expression. These findings suggest that the factors necessary to stabilize rat CYP7A1 may contribute to its unique tissue (liver) and cell type (parenchymal cells located near efferent venules) (44.Twisk J. Hoekman M.F. Mager W.H. Moorman A.F. de, B. P. Scheja L. Princen H.M. Gebhardt R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45.Massimi M. Lear S.R. Huling S.L.

Our combined data suggest that regulated degradation of CYP7A1 mRNA compliments the changes in CYP7A1 gene transcription to provide a rapid and complex adaptation of enzyme expression to the metabolic demands of the cell, liver and animal.

This cytokine is produced by several cell types including T lymphocytes expressing the αβ as well as the γδ T cell receptor (TcR). In human, the circulating γδ T cells, which mostly express Vγ9Vδ2 TcR, have been strongly suggested to play an important protective role against infectious agents.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the signaling pathways regulating expression of this cytokine in T cells. Recent results obtained with a T lymphoma cell line have shown that ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways cooperate to mediate synthesis of TNF-α (11.Hoffmeyer A. Grosse-Wilde A. Flory E.

Early and high level TNF-α production can have beneficial effects against development of intracellular pathogens; however, these TNF-α-induced beneficial effects are actually dependent on the strength and duration of its expression. An overactivation of the cells, leading to sustained high TNF-α serum levels, could result in immunopathology (35.Kabelitz D. Wesch D. Hinz T. Spring. Semin. Immunopathol. 1999; 21: 55-75PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed TNF-α has been implicated in several diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, septic shock, and osteoporosis (see, for review, Refs. 36.Kollias G. Douni E.

In this perspective, therapeutic potentialities for inflammatory diseases have been given to p38 kinase inhibitors, which blocked TNF-α production in animal models (40.Badger A.M. Bradbeer J.N.

Intracellular signals regulating TNF-α production in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are totally unknown. In the present paper, we questioned whether TNF-α production by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells requires, like in αβ T cells, CD28-induced costimulatory signals, and whether the intermediary transducing molecules in γδ T cells are different from those involved in αβ T lymphocytes; particularly, we studied the possibility that p38 kinase which is poorly involved in the cytokine production by primary αβ lymphocytes, could be considered as a major pharmacological target in Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes. We show herein that, in contrast to what was demonstrated in αβ T cells, TNF-α production in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells is triggered through the T cell receptor complex independently of CD28 signaling; we also demonstrate that TcR·CD3-induced p38 and ERK-2 MAP kinase pathways are both essential for TNF-α production. Moreover, we bring elements showing that signals triggered through the T cell receptor complex are more intense in Vγ9Vδ2 than in αβ T cells supporting the idea already suggested by others (35.Kabelitz D. Wesch D. Hinz T. Spring. Semin. Immunopathol. 1999; 21: 55-75PubMed Google Scholar) that the “activation threshold” of γδ T cells leading to cytokine production is lower than that of αβ T cells. Recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) was purchased from Chiron (Emeryville, CA). Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) was from Sigma, SB 203580 from Calbiochem Corp. (Nottingham, United Kingdom). PD 98059, anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibody (Ab), anti-p38 MAP kinase Ab, anti-phospho-CREB-1 Ab, anti-CREB-1 Ab, anti-phospho-ATF-2 Ab, anti-ATF-2 Ab, and anti-phospho-p42/44 MAP kinase Ab were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-ERK-2 Ab was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ab and anti-rabbit Ab were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Paris, France). UCHT1 (anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb)), anti-TcR Vδ2, anti-TcR Vγ9, anti-TcR pan-αβ, anti-CD28 mAb conjugated or not conjugated were purchased from Immunotech (Marseille, France). Unlabeled anti-CD28 was kindly provided by Dr. Olive (INSERM, Marseille, France). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy donors. Human peripheral blood-derived αβ T cells were generated as described previously (42.Cantrell D.A. Smith K.A. Science. 1984; 224: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, and rIL-2 (20 ng/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. αβ T lymphoblasts were allowed to return to quiescent state by washing three times and reculturing in RPMI 1640 with 10% serum in the absence of IL-2 for 48 h. γδ T lymphocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by positive immunoselection, using anti-TcR Vδ2 mAb and magnetic beads coated with anti-mouse IgG. After spontaneous detachment, γδ T cells were specifically activated in presence of syngeneic monocytes, IPP (50 μm) and rIL-2 (20 ng/ml). Human peripheral blood-derived γδ T lymphoblasts were generated as described above and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% human AB serum, 2 mm glutamine, and rIL-2 (20 ng/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for 4 or 5 weeks. αβ and γδ T cells (2 × 106cells/ml) were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS (for αβ T cells) or 5% FCS + 5% human AB serum (for γδ T cells) in a total volume of 0.5 ml/well. When mentioned cells were pretreated with inhibitors (SB 203580 or PD 98059) for 30 min at 37 °C at indicated concentrations, then stimulated with IPP, UCHT1 mAb, and/or anti-CD28 mAb at indicated concentrations. At different times, supernatants were harvested and assayed for TNF-α using a human TNF-α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (OptEIA set: human TNF-α, PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 0.5 million cells were incubated with 10% human AB serum for 30 min. γδ T cells were then stained with 1 μg of phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-TcR Vγ9 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD28; αβ T cells were stained with 1 μg of PC5-conjugated anti-TcR pan-αβ and PE-anti-CD28 in PBS supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.02% NaN3, on ice in a total volume of 50 μl. After 30 min, the cells were washed once, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed on a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson) with Cell Quest software. After stimulation, 5 × 106 cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Na2VO3, and 1 μg/ml each protease inhibitor (leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin). Proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 1.5 volumes of acetone. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (or 15% for visualization of ERK-2 shift) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and detected with the indicated antibodies: anti-phospho- and pan-p38 MAP kinase Abs (1:1000), anti-ERK-2 Ab (1:5000), anti-phospho-p42/44 MAP kinase Ab (1:1000), anti-phospho- and pan-CREB-1 Abs (1:1000), anti-phospho- and pan-ATF-2 Abs (1:1000). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the chemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). αβ and γδ T cells were suspended (5 × 106 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 without phenol red and loaded with 5 μl/ml of fura-2AM (1 mg/ml in Me2SO) at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing, the cells were resuspended (2.5 × 106 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 without phenol red. Calcium measurement was done in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorimeter set at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 560 nm emission wavelengths. The stimulating agent UCHT1 (1 μg/ml) was added directly in the cuvette. The maximum and the minimum fluorescence were measured after addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm EGTA, respectively. Purified human peripheral blood-derived Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were stimulated through the TcR·CD3 complex either with UCHT1 (anti-CD3 mAb) or with IPP a specific Vγ9Vδ2-stimulating nonpeptidic phospholigand, and assayed for TNF-α production. Fig.1 A shows that, at a concentration commonly used in previous studies, both stimulating agents induce cytokine synthesis; however, TNF-α production is maximum after 3–6 h of CD3-stimulation, whereas with IPP, the maximum occurs after 16 h of activation. At the respective optimal incubation time, maximum production is reached at 1 μg/ml UCHT1 (Fig.1 B) and 20 μm IPP (Fig. 1 C). It must be noticed that, even at low concentrations of anti-CD3 mAb (0.2 μg/ml) (Fig. 1 B) or IPP (5 μm) (Fig.1 C), Vγ9Vδ2 T cell do not need any external costimulatory signal to produce TNF-α. In contrast to the preceding results, we confirmed that αβ T cells need a CD28 costimulatory signal in addition to TcR·CD3 activation to produce TNF-α (Fig. 2 A), even when high doses of anti-CD3 mAb (10 μg/ml) are used (Fig.2 B). However, because B7 molecules, which normally interact with CD28, have been demonstrated to be expressed also on T cells (43.Cross A.H. Lyons J.A. San M. Keeling R.M. Ku G. Racke M.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3140-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a possibility existed that TNF-α produced in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells occurred upon a costimulatory signal via CD28 interacting with its counterreceptors present on neighboring γδ T cells. To approach this particular point, we analyzed expression of CD28 on Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cell population we used in this study was 90% CD28-negative (Fig.3), supporting the conclusion that TNF-α production by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells is independent of CD28 stimulation (the same result was obtained with CD28-positive depleted cells; data not shown). We cannot, however, totally rule out the possibility that other self-costimulatory interactions in these cells may have contributed to TNF-α production.Figure 3Comparison of CD28 antigen expression by human peripheral blood-derived αβ and γδ T cells. Human peripheral blood-derived αβ T cells were stained with both PC5-conjugated anti-pan-TcR αβ mAb and PE-labeled anti-CD28 mAb; the cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (right panel). Human peripheral blood-derived γδ T cells were stained with both fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Vγ9 TcR mAb and PE-anti-CD28 mAb, and analyzed by flow cytometry (left panel). Each analysis has been repeated at least three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was shown that the blockade of p38 MAP kinase by its specific inhibitor SB 203580 only slightly impaired TNF-α synthesis in αβ T lymphocytes (10.Schafer P.H. Wang L. Wadsworth S.A. Davis J.E. Siekierka J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it totally blocked it in monocytes. We therefore questioned whether p38 kinase might play a role in TNF-α production in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. We first demonstrated that p38 MAP kinase can be activated through TcR·CD3 ligation using anti-CD3 mAb. As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, UCHT1 stimulation induces p38 phosphorylation/activation; after 5 min of stimulation, this activation reaches a plateau that lasts at least for 30 min. In parallel, we showed (Fig. 4 B) that TNF-α production induced upon anti-CD3 stimulation (left panel) is almost totally inhibited by 10 μm SB 203580 and totally blocked at 20 μm; at this latter concentration, TNF-α release induced by IPP is also completely inhibited (right panel). In order to correlate inhibition of TNF-α production with the blockade of p38 activity, we studied inhibition of phosphorylation of CREB-1 and ATF-2, two substrates of P38 kinase (44.Swart J.M. Bergeron D.M. Chiles T.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2311-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 45.Brinkman B.M. Telliez J.B. Schievella A.R. Lin L.L. Goldfeld A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2103-2114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), by several concentrations of SB 203580. Fig. 4 Cshows that SB 203580-induced inhibition of TNF-α production closely parallels that of p38 activity (IC50 ∼ 5 μm). A possibility existed that TNF-α production in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells was regulated by the JNK pathway and that this pathway could have been inhibited by 20 μm SB 203580. We actually demonstrated that c-Jun, one of the JNK substrates that must be phosphorylated both at Ser-63 and Ser-73 for optimal transcription activity (47.Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), was not phosphorylated on Ser-63 upon TcR·CD3 stimulation (data not shown). This result makes unlikely the involvement of JNK pathway in TcR·CD3-induced TNF-α production by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Altogether, these data clearly indicate that p38 activation is a key event for TNF-α production in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. In αβ T cells, TNF-α production is thoroughly dependent on the MEK/ERK pathway (10.Schafer P.H. Wang L. Wadsworth S.A. Davis J.E. Siekierka J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore studied whether activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells also led to activation of this pathway and whether this kinase cascade could be involved in TNF-α production. As can be seen in Fig.5 A, stimulation of γδ T cells through TcR·CD3 complex led to phosphorylation of ERK-2, as assessed by the appearance of a slowly migrating electrophoretic band. It had to be noticed that, when the cells are pretreated with PD 98059, the specific inhibitor of MEK1, the upstream kinase that phosphorylates and activates ERK-2, phosphorylation of ERK-2 is totally blocked, whereas it is not impaired by SB 203580, the inhibitor of p38 kinase (Fig. 5 A). To correlate activation of ERK-2 with TNF-α production, we inhibited ERK-2 activation by pretreating the cells with PD 98059. As shown in Fig. 5 B, 20 μm PD 98059 totally blocked production of TNF-α induced either with UCHT1 (left panel) or IPP (right panel). We demonstrated that in γδ T cells CD3 stimulation alone is sufficient for TNF-α production, whereas in αβ T cells the cytokine release needs, in addition to CD3 stimulation, a costimulatory signal delivered via CD28. As already suggested by others, these data favor the hypothesis that the “activation threshold” of γδ T cells might be lower than that of αβ T cells. To approach this point, we compared activation of ERK-2 as well as calcium mobilization, two intracellular signals triggered via the T cell receptor complex in either αβ or γδ T cells. Fig. 6 A shows ERK-1/ERK-2 activation (5 min) as a function of anti-CD3 concentration in both populations. To detect MAP kinase activation, we used a specific antibody that recognizes the active form of the kinase. As can be seen in the figure, for the same amount of detected ERK-2 protein, phosphorylation/activation of this kinase is detectable at 0.1 μg/ml UCHT1 stimulation and maximum at 0.2 μg/ml in γδ T cells whereas, in αβ T cells, activation is detectable only at 0.5 μg/ml and is maximum at 1 μg/ml. In parallel we tested calcium mobilization induced by optimal concentration of UCHT1. Fig. 6 B shows that calcium response is 6 times higher in γδ T cells than in αβ T cells. These results are elements showing that at least some intracellular cell signals triggered via the T cell receptor complex are more intense in γδ than in αβ T cells. It is noteworthy that tyrosine phosphorylation electrophoretic profiles of total lysates from unstimulated αβ and γδ T cells are identical, ruling out the hypothesis that higher signal intensities triggered in γδ T cells could be due to a preactivated state of some transducing molecules as is the case in transformed cells (data not shown). In the present paper we show that, in contrast to αβ T cells, TNF-α production in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells does not need CD28-triggered signals. This result first supports the idea that human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells behave differently than other γδ T cells from other species; indeed, it was demonstrated that mouse γδ T cells necessitated a CD28-mediated costimulation for their activation (48.Sperling A.I. Linsley P.S. Barrett T.A. Bluestone J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6043-6050PubMed Google Scholar). One of the elements we brought to assess that TNF-α production is a CD28-independent process in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, was to show that the cells we used were CD28-negative cells. Previous analysis of CD28 expression on human γδ T lymphocytes led to contradictory results; indeed, on the one hand, it was shown that long term culture of human peripheral blood γδ T cells do not express CD28 (49.Poggi A. Bottino C. Zocchi M.R. Pantaleo G. Ciccone E. Mingari C. Moretta L. Moretta A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas, on the other hand, other results have demonstrated that 40–60% of freshly isolated γδ T cells do express CD28 (50.Testi R. Lanier L.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 51.Groh V. Porcelli S. Fabri M. Lanier L.L. Picker L.J. Anderson T. Warnke R.A. Bhan A.K. Stominger J.L. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1277-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy was explained by the fact that CD28 was progressively lost during culture (50.Testi R. Lanier L.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We actually confirmed this conclusion since we noticed that 40–50% of the freshly isolated Vγ9Vδ2 T cells did express CD28, whereas the expanded long term cultured cells we used in our study have become CD28 negative cells. In peripheral blood αβ T cells, it was demonstrated that ligation of CD28, which is a prerequisite for TNF-α production, induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase; however, blockade of this kinase only slightly impairs TNF-α production. From such a result, it can be concluded that in primary αβ T cells, ligation of CD28 induces signals in addition to p38 activation that are involved in TNF-α release. A possibility exists that these putative co-signals may act with p38 to regulate TNF-α production in cooperation with the TcR-induced signals, and that specific blockade of p38 has only a limited effect on TNF-α release. A recent paper has demonstrated that in T lymphoma cell lines, ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways cooperatively contribute to transcription and synthesis of TNF-α, and it has been shown that specific blockade of p38 has no effect on TNF-α promoter activity and a mild effect on TNF-α biosynthesis; in contrast, the blockade of the three pathways abolished TNF-α promoter induction (11.Hoffmeyer A. Grosse-Wilde A. Flory E. Neufeld B. Kunz M. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4319-4327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, we established that TNF-α production is dependent on ERK-2 and p38 pathways triggered upon TcR/CD3 engagement, whereas JNK pathway is not involved. In parallel, we showed that the activation threshold appears to be lower in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells than in αβ T cells, as already suggested by others (35.Kabelitz D. Wesch D. Hinz T. Spring. Semin. Immunopathol. 1999; 21: 55-75PubMed Google Scholar). From these results, it can be hypothesized that the high intensity signals triggered in γδ T cells can lead to cytokine production without the need of costimulatory signaling pathways, and therefore the TcR/CD3-induced activation of p38 kinase pathway, which is a prerequisite for TNF-α production in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, could be more sensitive to inhibition than it is in αβ T cells. However, one can question why ligation of the TcR/CD3 complex by the same anti-CD3 antibody (UCHT1) used at the same concentration triggers different signals in αβ or γδ T cells. Indeed, we showed that the calcium response is about 6 times higher in γδ than αβ T cells, and a strong activation of ERK-2 occurs at lower concentrations in γδ than αβ T cells. Actually, the stronger intracellular signaling we observed in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells can be related to the observation that human γδ peripheral blood lymphocytes express about twice more TcR·CD3 complexes than αβ lymphocytes (52.Thibault G. Bardos P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3814-3820PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, among the earliest biochemical events detected after TcR stimulation is the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs on cytoplasmic tails of CD3 and TcRζ subunits, which promotes the recruitment of ZAP-70 for its phosphorylation and activation. Evidence has been brought that these events are crucial in TcR signaling, and the strength of TcR signal transduction depends on the number of the transducing molecules involved (53.Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 54.Quian D. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These data are in line with a recent report, which demonstrated using enterotoxin superantigens, i.e. low affinity TcR ligands, that there is a cooperative activation of the TcRs, which increases the number of signal transduction molecules and therefore the magnitude of the intracellular signals (55.Niedergang F. Dautry-Versat A. Alcover A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6054-6058PubMed Google Scholar). This could be an element explaining how non-major histocompatibility complex-presented small nonpeptidic molecules like IPP could trigger strong activation of γδ T cells leading to production of high amounts of TNF-α. In conclusion, our data indicate that early and high production of TNF-α by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells is independent on the CD28-induced costimulatory signals but highly dependent on TcR·CD3-induced activation of both MEK/ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways. Evidence of the involvement of these two pathways in the regulation of TNF-α production brings arguments supporting the development of therapeutic strategies involving MAP kinase inhibitors aiming at modulating release of the cytokine in a beneficial way.

Surprisingly, however, these increases were not accompanied by a change in basal or insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal in the doubly transgenic mice compared with Glut1 transgenic mice, probably due to an inhibition of de novo glycogen synthesis as a result of the high levels of steady-state glycogen in the muscles of doubly transgenic mice (430 μmol/g versus 10 μmol/g in wild-type mice).

Johnson D.W. Gibbs E.M. Lillquist J.S. Soeller W.C. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18442-18445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Marshall B.A. Hansen P.A. Ensor N.J. Ogden M.A. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E390-E400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that transport is rate-limiting for muscle glucose metabolism and for whole-body glucose disposal in normal mice, a finding that is consistent with a large body of additional experimental data that has accumulated over the past several decades (for a review, see Ref. 4.Mueckler M. News Physiol. Sci. 1995; 10: 22-29Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, muscles from the Glut1-overexpressing mice do not exhibit further increases in glucose transport after treatments that augment transport in normal muscles (insulin, hypoxia, electrically induced contractions) (5.Gulve E.A. Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Hansen P.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18366-18370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), despite the fact that Glut4 translocates to the sarcolemma and transverse tubules normally in the transgenic muscles (6.Hansen P.A. Wang W. Marshall B.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18173-18179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the intrinsic activity of Glut4 can be subject to regulation in the plasma membrane domains of muscle fibers. The dramatic elevation in basal glucose uptake in the muscles of Glut1-overexpressing mice results in the near equilibration of free glucose across the muscle fiber membranes, indicating that the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase has become the rate-limiting step in glucose uptake in these muscles (2.Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation demonstrates that hexokinase catalyzes a secondary rate-limiting step in skeletal muscle glucose disposal that can become predominant if the transport step is artificially elevated. It therefore seemed reasonable that a further increase in muscle glucose uptake and whole-body glucose disposal might be induced in Glut1-overexpressing mice by increasing the expression of hexokinase in the muscles of these mice. This hypothesis has an important practical implication for therapies designed to counteract the insulin resistance and glucose intolerance associated with type 2 diabetes (4.Mueckler M. News Physiol. Sci. 1995; 10: 22-29Google Scholar). In order to test this hypothesis, Glut1-overexpressing mice were mated with mice that overexpress hexokinase II in skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, the overexpression of hexokinase II in the muscles of Glut1-overexpressing mice dramatically increased steady-state levels of glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen, but did not augment whole-body glucose disposal. Additionally, mice overexpressing hexokinase II alone exhibited no increase in muscle glucose uptake or whole-body glucose disposal compared with wild-type control mice. We conclude that increasing hexokinase activity in muscle is not likely to be an effective means of counteracting insulin resistance or glucose intolerance. Purified porcine insulin (Iletin II) and human insulin (Humulin R U-100) were purchased from Eli Lilly and Co. Radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin (BSA),1 and the nonradioactive forms of d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), and d-mannitol were obtained from Sigma. 2-Deoxy-d- [1,2-3H]glucose, [5-3H]glucose, and3H2O were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. [U-14C]Mannitol and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified 3-[3H]glucose were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Transgenic mice overexpressing human hexokinase II in striated muscle (a kind gift from Drs. D. H. Wasserman and D. K. Granner) were constructed as described previously, using a transgene containing the rat muscle creatinine kinase promoter-enhancer coupled to the human hexokinase II cDNA and an 850-base pair cassette (SVPA) containing the polyadenylation and splice site sequences of SV40 (7.Chang P.Y.

The construction of transgenic mice overexpressing the human Glut1 glucose transporter was also described previously (1.Marshall B.A. Ren J.M. Johnson D.W. Gibbs E.M. Lillquist J.S. Soeller W.C. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18442-18445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The minigene in this construct contains a 2.47-kilobase cDNA fragment encoding the human Glut1 glucose transporter under the regulation of the 1.2-kilobase rat myosin light chain-2 promoter. Expression of the transgene is restricted to skeletal muscle and does not affect expression of the Glut4 isoform. Male mice heterozygous for the Glut1 transgene were bred with female mice heterozygous for the hexokinase II transgene to produce mice of four separate genotypes: those carrying both transgenes, those carrying one of the two, and those carrying none of the transgenes. The presence of the transgenes was determined by PCR analysis of genomic DNA obtained from tail biopsy and prepared using the QiAmp tissue isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sex-matched littermate mice between the ages of 2 and 4 months were used for all experiments. Animals were housed in a room maintained at 23 °C with a fixed 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and given free access to Purina chow and water. On the morning of the experiment, animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (5 mg/100 g body weight by intraperitoneal injection). Extensor digitorum longus muscles were excised and incubated for determination of 2-DG uptake or glucose utilization. Extensor digitorum longus muscles were incubated for 30 min at 35 °C in 2 ml of oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) supplemented with 8 mm glucose, 32 mm mannitol, and 0.1% BSA in the absence or presence of 2 milliunits/ml porcine insulin. Next, muscles were transferred to KHB containing 40 mm mannitol, 0.1% BSA, and 2 milliunits/ml insulin for 10 min to remove glucose from the extracellular space prior to measurement of 2-DG uptake as described previously (8.Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Pessin J.E. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, muscles were incubated for 20 min in 1.5 ml of KHB containing 1 mm2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (1.5 μCi/mmol), 39 mm [U-14C]mannitol (8.5 μCi/mmol), and 0.1% BSA. Insulin was added if it was present in previous incubations. The gas phase was 95% O2, 5% CO2, and the temperature was maintained at 29 °C. Muscle extracellular space and intracellular 2-DG concentration (μmol·ml intracellular water−1·20 min−1) were determined as described previously (8.Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Marshall B.A. Gao J. Pessin J.E. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro rates of glucose utilization via glycolysis and glucose incorporation into glycogen were determined in skeletal muscle isolated from control and hexokinase-overexpressing mice according to a modification (8.Hansen P.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of previously described methods (9.Stauffacher W. Renold A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1969; 216: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10.Zawalich W.S. Matchinsky F.M. Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Extensor digitorum longus muscles were incubated for 3 h at 35 °C in 1 ml of oxygenated KHB containing 2.25 μCi of [5-3H]glucose under one of two conditions: either 8 mm glucose and 20 microunits/ml porcine insulin or 24 mm glucose and 2 milliunits/ml insulin. Mannitol was added to the medium at a concentration sufficient to bring the total osmolality of glucose plus mannitol to 40 milliosmolal. Using this technique, it has been demonstrated previously that in isolated skeletal muscle, the sum of glucose utilization via glycolysis (measured as [3H]water formation from [5-3H]glucose) plus the amount of tritium retained in glycogen accounts for nearly all of the [5-3H]glucose transported into the cell (11.Nesher R. Karl I.E. Kipnis D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C226-C232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clamp experiments were carried out as described previously (3.Marshall B.A. Hansen P.A. Ensor N.J. Ogden M.A. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E390-E400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Marshall, B. A., and Mueckler, M. M. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. E738–E744Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After placement of the infusion catheter, an infusion of 3-[3H]glucose at 0.04 μCi/min was begun for measurement of the rate of appearance of glucose, hepatic glucose production, and total body glucose utilization. The infusion was continued during a 75-min control period, and 20 μl of blood was taken from the tail for determination of glucose specific activity at 60, 67.5 and 75 min. After 75 min, an infusion of insulin (regular human) was begun at a rate of 80 milliunits/kg/min and continued for at least 90 min. An infusion of dextrose (25%) was begun, and the infusion rate varied during the clamp period to maintain the blood glucose at approximately 160 mg/dl. In all the clamps, the continuous infusion of 3-[3H]glucose tracer was continued during the insulin infusion periods and, in addition, the tracer was added to the 25% dextrose infusion to approximate the glucose specific activity in the blood at the end of the control period. This approximation was based upon measurement of specific activity during identical conditions in the same type of mice in previous experiments. Blood samples for determination of specific activity were taken 20 and 10 min prior to and at the end of the experimental period. The glucose infusion rate was not changed for at least 20 min prior to the first determination of specific activity. Both the blood glucose and the glucose specific activity were in steady state during the control period and the clamp sampling periods. Blood for insulin measurement was obtained by cardiac puncture at the conclusion of the experiment. Blood glucose was measured using 5 μl of whole blood in the Hemocue blood glucose meter (Hemocue, Mission Viejo, CA). Plasma insulin was measured by double-antibody radioimmunoassay using rat insulin standards (Eli Lilly). Specific activity of glucose in whole blood was determined by aqueous scintillation counting of 20 μl of blood deproteinized with barium hydroxide (0.3 n) and zinc sulfate (0.3 n). Aliquots of the resulting supernatant were dried at 70 °C to remove tritiated water prior to resuspension and liquid scintillation counting. The rate of appearance of glucose (R a), which equals the rate of total body glucose utilization (R d) when the blood glucose is in steady state, was calculated by dividing the infusion rate of 3-[3H]glucose by the specific activity at the same time. Hepatic glucose production was calculated by subtracting the cold glucose infusion rate from R a. Total hexokinase activity and heat-stable hexokinase I activity in quadriceps muscle homogenates (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14834-14839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were measured enzymatically (13.Crane R.K. Sols A. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 597-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hexokinase II activity was subsequently calculated by subtracting hexokinase I from total hexokinase activity. Glucose transporter protein levels were determined in muscle homogenates by immunoblotting, using rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the C terminus of either Glut4 (Phe349) or Glut1 (Phe350) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Antibody-bound proteins were detected using ECL. Measurements of glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate were performed using gastrocnemius muscles clamp frozen in situ. Frozen muscles were homogenized in ice-cold 0.3 m perchloric acid; one aliquot of this homogenate was analyzed for glycogen (14.Passoneau J.V. Lauderdale V.R. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), while the remaining homogenate was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant neutralized with buffer containing 0.4 m KCl, 2 n KOH, and 0.4 m imidazole. Glucose and glucose 6-phosphate in this fraction were measured fluorometrically (15.Lowry O.H. Passoneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar). Mice fed ad libitum were bled (∼0.3 ml) from the tail. Plasma insulin concentrations were measured by double-antibody radioimmunoassays using human standards (Linco Research, Inc.). Blood glucose levels were measured using a Hemocue glucose analyzer. Muscles were resected from littermate mice expressing the Glut1 transgene, the hexokinase II transgene, both transgenes, or control non-transgenic littermates and analyzed for the expression of hexokinase I, hexokinase II, and total hexokinase activities. Fig. 1 shows that the two groups of mice expressing the hexokinase II transgene exhibited similar (7.1- and 8.2-fold, respectively) increases in total hexokinase activity, due mostly to a specific increase in hexokinase II activity. The small increase in hexokinase I activity observed in these two groups is probably due to the fact that the assays do not quantitatively distinguish between the two isoforms. Glut1 transgenic mice exhibited a small increase in total hexokinase activity in muscle compared with their wild-type siblings. These data are consistent with previously published data concerning Glut1 (2.Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hexokinase II (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14834-14839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)-overexpressing transgenic mice. In order to determine whether overexpression of hexokinase II induced an alteration in glucose transport activity, 2-deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed on isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles. Fig. 2 shows that neither basal nor insulin-stimulated glucose transport was significantly altered in hexokinase II-overexpressing muscles. Similar results were observed in isolated soleus muscles (data not shown). These results suggest that overexpression of hexokinase II in muscle did not directly or indirectly impact on glucose transporter expression, regulation, or activity. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that neither Glut1 nor Glut4 protein levels were altered in the skeletal muscle of hexokinase overexpressing mice relative to wild-type littermates, nor were Glut1 or Glut4 protein levels altered in Glut1 × Hex mice relative to Glut1 mice (data not shown). In order to determine whether hexokinase overexpression by itself can augment muscle glucose metabolite levels, steady-state glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen levels were measured in muscles clamp frozenin situ from the four groups of mice. Fig.3 shows that neither metabolite was altered in the muscles of mice overexpressing hexokinase II compared with wild-type littermates. This is consistent with the observation that transport, not phosphorylation, is rate-limiting for glucose metabolism in normal mouse muscle. A previous study with hexokinase-overexpressing mice suggested that hexokinase may become rate-limiting or partially rate-limiting for glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle under conditions of hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperglycemia (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14834-14839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but direct evidence in the form of glucose tracer analysis in isolated muscles was not provided. In order to address this issue, the metabolism of [5-3H]glucose was examined in muscles isolated from control and hexokinase II-overexpressing mice. Fig.4 shows that under both basal (8 mm glucose, 20 microunits/ml insulin) and hyperglycemic/hyperinsulinemic (24 mm glucose, 2 milliunits/ml insulin) conditions, neither glycolytic nor glycogenic utilization of glucose was increased in muscles from hexokinase II transgenic mice compared with wild-type littermates. These data are in complete agreement with the data presented above on steady-state levels of glucose metabolites and further confirm the rate-limiting nature of the transport step in normal muscle. In order to determine the effect of the hexokinase transgene on whole-body glucose homeostasis, blood glucose and whole-body glucose disposal measurements were conducted. Fig.5 shows that expression of the hexokinase II transgene alone had no significant effect on fed blood glucose levels compared with wild-type controls. Fig.6 shows that the hexokinase transgene alone had no significant effect on whole-body glucose disposal (R d) in either the basal state or during a hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp.Figure 6Rates of whole-body glucose disposal in control and transgenic mice. Wild-type mice or mice carrying the hexokinase transgene (Hex), the Glut1 transgene (Glut1), or both transgenes (Glut1 ×Hex) were subjected to a euglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure along with the infusion of [3H]glucose to ascertain the rate of whole-body glucose disposal under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Values given represent the mean ± S.E. for 4 animals per group. *,p < 0.01 for Glut1 or Glut1 × Hexversus wild-type or Hex; **, p < 0.05 for Glut1 versus wild-type or Hex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Steady-state Glucose-6-phosphate levels were increased 2.4-fold and glycogen was increased 5.4-fold in muscles from Glut1 transgenic mice (Fig. 3). Increasing hexokinase activity in muscles that also overexpress Glut1 caused a further dramatic elevation in glucose 6-phosphate (7.6-fold compared with wild-type and 3.2-fold compared with Glut1-overexpressing muscles) and glycogen (40.5-fold compared with wild-type and 7.5-fold compared with Glut1-overexpressing muscles). These observations are completely consistent with the observation that phosphorylation is rate-limiting for glucose uptake in the muscles of the Glut1 transgenic mice (2.Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The massive overexpression of glycogen in muscles of the doubly transgenic animals resulted in a dramatic disruption in the normal ultrastructure of striated muscle (see Fig.7). Myofibrils in the doubly transgenic mice exhibited greater electron density compared with mice overexpressing hexokinase alone, which exhibited a normal muscle architecture, and the myofibril bundles were disrupted by numerous glycogen deposits, some of them very large in size. Despite their grossly abnormal muscle architecture, the doubly transgenic mice did not display any obvious change in mobility or behavior compared with their non-transgenic siblings. Consistent with previously published results (3.Marshall B.A. Hansen P.A. Ensor N.J. Ogden M.A. Mueckler M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E390-E400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Marshall, B. A., and Mueckler, M. M. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. E738–E744Google Scholar), Glut1-overexpressing mice exhibited increases in basal whole-body glucose disposal and insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal under euglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamp conditions compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 6). Because overexpression of hexokinase in the context of Glut1 overexpression dramatically increased steady-state levels of muscle metabolites compared with overexpression of Glut1 alone (see Fig. 3), it was expected that whole-body glucose disposal would be markedly elevated in the Glut1 × Hex mice relative to the Glut1 mice. Surprisingly, however, no significant difference was observed in basal or insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose disposal in Glut1 × Hex mice compared with Glut1 mice. The data presented in this study are consistent with a large body of previous experimental data indicating that, under most conditions and in most skeletal muscle types, transport of glucose is rate-limiting for glucose uptake and metabolism (4.Mueckler M. News Physiol. Sci. 1995; 10: 22-29Google Scholar). However, it is possible that in some skeletal muscle types, i.e. those expressing a relatively high Glut4/hexokinase II ratio, the phosphorylation step may become partially rate-limiting for overall glucose metabolism under certain conditions (16.Furler S.M. Jenkins A.B. Storlien L.H. Kraegen E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: E337-E347PubMed Google Scholar). One unanticipated finding of this study is that the hexokinase transgene did not further augment whole-body glucose disposal in mice that also overexpress Glut1 in muscle. The observation that intracellular free glucose is dramatically elevated in the muscle of Glut1 transgenic mice (2.Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the hexokinase step is rate-limiting for glucose metabolism in Glut1-overexpressing muscles. Consistent with this interpretation is the finding that the muscles of doubly transgenic mice exhibited elevated steady-state glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen levels relative to muscles overexpressing Glut1 alone (Fig. 3), implying an increased flux through the glycogenic pathway mediated by the hexokinase transgene. Why then are the elevated steady-state metabolite levels in doubly transgenic muscles not associated with a further increase in whole-body glucose disposal relative to mice that only carry the Glut1 transgene? There are several possible explanations, one being that the grossly elevated steady-state glycogen level caused an inhibition of de novo glycogen synthesis in muscles of the doubly transgenic mice (17.Laurent D. Hundal R.S. Dresner A. Price T.B. Vogel S.M. Petersen K.F. I. S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E663-E668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Support for this interpretation is provided by the observation that muscles of Glut1 transgenic mice with a 5-fold elevation in steady-state glycogen levels relative to control muscles exhibit a 50% reduction in the proportion of glycogen synthase in the active form (2.Ren J.M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of flux through the glycogenic pathway due to the very high glycogen levels probably contributed to the grossly elevated glucose 6-phosphate levels in the muscles of mice carrying both transgenes. Because glycogen synthesis is the major pathway for the disposal of glucose in muscle under hyperinsulinemic conditions (18.Shulman G.I. Rothman D.L. Jue T. Stein P. DeFronzo R.A. Shulman R.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), this could explain why the doubly transgenic mice do not exhibit a further increase in whole-body glucose disposal during the euglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure. Our data are in apparent disagreement with data published previously on hexokinase II transgenic mice. Chang and colleagues (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14834-14839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported that hexokinase II-overexpressing extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles exhibited increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake relative to control muscles, especially in the presence of pharmacologic concentrations of insulin. We observed no increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake in either muscle type in the presence or absence of insulin (Fig. 2). The data of Chang and colleagues (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14834-14839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) imply that hexokinase overexpression augmented the activity and/or expression of endogenous glucose transporters in skeletal muscle, because 2-deoxyglucose uptake reflects transport activity and not hexokinase activity under the conditions employed in these experiments (19.Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This is also definitively demonstrated by our uptake data where severalfold increases in hexokinase activity had no effect on the rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake (see Fig. 2). However, since hexokinase activity appears to be rate-limiting for glucose uptake in the muscles of Glut1-overexpressing mice, one might expect to observe an increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake after transgenic augmentation of hexokinase activity in these muscles. The explanation for the inability of hexokinase to increase 2-deoxyglucose uptake in Glut1-overexpressing mice lies in the lack of feedback inhibition of hexokinase activity by 2-deoxyglucose-6-P. Even at a concentration of 30 mm, 2-deoxyglucose-6-P fails to inhibit hexokinase activity in muscle homogenates, whereas glucose-6-P inhibits hexokinase activity by 80% at a concentration of 500 μm (19.Hansen P.A. Gulve E.A. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus,in situ, with an ambient blood glucose concentration of ∼8 mm and an intracellular glucose-6-P concentration of ∼0.8 mm (see Fig. 3), hexokinase activity was severely inhibited and was rate-limiting for glucose uptake in the muscles of Glut1-overexpressing mice. However, when muscles were removed and then incubated under conditions used to measure 2-deoxyglucose uptake (no glucose and 1 mm 2-deoxyglucose), the lack of feedback inhibition restored hexokinase activity to the point where transport once again became rate-limiting for uptake. Thus, 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated tissues continues to reflect only the rate of glucose transport in the muscles of Glut1-overexpressing mice, even though hexokinase is rate-limiting for glucose uptake in muscle in situ. If indeed the hexokinase-overexpressing mice studied by Chang and colleagues (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14834-14839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) also exhibited an increase in the activity of an endogenous glucose transporter, then that would explain other differences between their data and ours. For example, Chang and colleagues (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14834-14839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported a small but significant increase in glucose 6-phosphate levels in gastrocnemius muscles isolated from hexokinase transgenic mice after a bolus injection of glucose and insulin, but we observed no such increase under steady-state conditions. The increase they observed may in fact have been due to an increase in glucose transport activity in their mice. In a different collaborative study (20.Lombardi A.M. Moller D. Loizeau M. Girard J. Leturque A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), some of the same investigators reported that hexokinase-overexpressing mice exhibited increases in the glucose utilization index of gluteal and gastrocnemius muscles under hyperglycemic/hyperinsulinemic clamp conditions. It is possible that this was also due to an increase in the activity of an endogenous glucose transporter isoform expressed in the skeletal muscles of the hexokinase transgenic mice. In support of this suggestion, mice that overexpressed both Glut4 and hexokinase II had lower rates of muscle glucose utilization than mice overexpressing the Glut4 transgene alone (20.Lombardi A.M. Moller D. Loizeau M. Girard J. Leturque A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and these differences in the in situ glucose utilization rates paralleled the differences in muscle 2-deoxglucose uptake data, i.e. muscles overexpressing both hexokinase and Glut4 exhibited lower rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the presence of insulin than muscles overexpressing Glut4 alone. Why mice that overexpress both Glut4 and hexokinase might have lower glucose uptake rates than mice that overexpress hexokinase alone remains unclear, but this observation is consistent with a dominant role for transport as compared with phosphorylation in determining the rate of muscle glucose disposal, and supports the hypothesis that increases in metabolism observed in the hexokinase-overexpressing muscles may in fact have been due to an increase in endogenous glucose transport activity rather than the increase in hexokinase activity. The hexokinase transgenic mice used in our study were derived from the line originally constructed by Chang and colleagues (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J.

One difference is that we cross-bred the original hexokinase line (in a FVB/NJ background) with a different hybrid strain of mice that overexpress Glut1 (C57BL/6 × SJL), so that all four mouse genotypes studied were in a FVB/NJ × (C57BL/6 × SJL) background. This may account for some of the differences observed by Chang and colleagues (7.Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol.

Regardless, our data on hexokinase-overexpressing mice as well as the data described previously by others, when analyzed in the present context, are consistent with a dominant if not exclusive role for glucose transport in determining the rate of muscle glucose metabolism and whole-body glucose disposal in mice. This conclusion is in agreement with a recent elegant study employing NMR that directly measured the concentration of free glucose and glucose 6-phosphate in human skeletal muscle (21.Cline G.W. Petersen K.F. Krssak M. Shen J. Hundal R.S. Trajanoski Z. Inzucchi S. Dresner A. Rothman D.L. Shulman G.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that glucose transport, as opposed to phosphorylation, is rate-limiting for muscle glucose disposal under hyperglycemic/hyperinsulinemic conditions in normal subjects and in type 2 diabetics."

RNA recognition motif ribonucleoprotein open reading frame polymerase chain reaction phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride phosphate-buffered saline hemagglutinin From the time of their synthesis until their degradation, RNA polymerase II transcripts are associated with proteins. More than just participating in the packaging of mature or immature mRNAs, RNA-binding proteins are often actively involved in a series of post-transcriptional events, such as pre-mRNA 3′-end processing, pre-mRNA splicing, nucleocytoplasmic mRNA export, mRNA translation, and turnover (for a review, see Ref. 1.Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Therefore, RNA-binding proteins are thought to play central roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.The functions of RNA-binding proteins depend on domains that bind to RNA and on auxiliary domains involved in protein-protein interactions. One of the most common RNA-binding domains is the RNA recognition motif (RRM).1 This motif, conserved from yeast to human, consists of 80–100 amino acids encompassing a highly conserved octapeptide known as the ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence (RNP1) and a hexapeptide termed RNP2 (2.Sachs A.B.

Crystal structures and NMR studies have revealed that RRMs from different proteins adopt a similar globular tertiary structure in which RNA binding is primarily supported by β-sheet surfaces (5.Allain F.H.

Some of the RRM-containing proteins have a basal level of nonspecific binding affinity for RNA, while others, like the poly(A)-binding protein, show high affinity for specific RNA sequences.One important cellular pathway that relies upon RNA-binding proteins is translation initiation. Translation initiation in eucaryotic cells is directed by a set of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions that promote the recruitment of the 43 S preinitiation complex to the mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 10.Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Two key structural elements of most cellular mRNA, the 5′ cap and the 3′ poly(A) tail, are important determinants of these interactions. The translation initiation factor eIF4E binds to the cap structure, whereas the poly(A) tail-binding protein (Pab1p) is bound to the poly(A) tail. These two proteins interact with the translation initiation factor eIF4G. This complex, along with other factors, is thought to promote the binding of the 43 S preinitiation complex to mRNAs via the physical interaction between eIF4G and the ribosome-associated complex eIF3 (reviewed in Ref.11.Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar).We identified in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome data base a gene (SGN1, YIR001C) encoding an RRM-containing protein that was highly homologous to poly(A)-binding protein 2 (PABP2), a protein that stimulates the polyadenylation reactionin vitro by binding to the poly(A) tail and stabilizing the interaction of poly(A) polymerase with the poly(A) tail (12.Wahle E. Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because of our interests in poly(A) tail-binding proteins, we chose to investigate the function of this uncharacterized ORF more closely. Here we report that RBP29 (SGN1, YIR001C)(RNA-binding protein of29 kDa) is a cytoplasmic protein that binds to poly(A) with high affinity. Although it is a nonessential gene, we have discovered that RBP29 displays genetic interactions with the translation initiation apparatus. These results suggest that Rbp29p functions to stimulate the expression of mRNA, possibly through enhancing the efficiency of translation initiation.DISCUSSIONThis study presents the characterization of S. cerevisiae Rbp29p, previously known to be a nonessential 29-kDa protein containing one RRM domain (56.Entian K.-D. Schuster T. Hegemann J.H. Becher D. Feldmann H. Güldener U. Götz R. Hansen M. Hollenberg C.P. Jansen G., W., K. Klein S. Kötter P. Kricke J. Launhardt H. Mannhaupt G. Maierl A. Meyer P. Mewes W.

Genet. 1999; 262: 683-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Rbp29p was found to be a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that is associated with poly(A)+ RNAs in vivo. It is also associated with Pab1p in crude yeast extracts in a dosage- and RNA-dependent manner. In vitro, recombinant Rbp29p shows high binding affinity for poly(A). Although cells lacking Rbp29p have no discernible phenotype, we discovered that deletion of the RBP29 gene worsens the slow growth phenotype oftif4631 and tif4632 mutants. Moreover, excess Rbp29p suppresses the temperature-sensitive phenotype associated withtif4631, tif4632, and pab1 alleles. These data suggest that Rbp29p plays a stimulatory role in mRNA expression, possibly by affecting the efficiency of translation of a subset of transcripts.RBP29 is a member of a family of about 45 genes in S. cerevisiae that encode proteins encompassing at least one RRM domain. Its localization to the cytoplasm, its interaction with cytoplasmic Pab1p, and its genetic interaction with the translation machinery make it a bona fide member of a small group of yeast cytoplasmic RRM-containing proteins. These include translation initiation factors eIF4B (Tif3p), the β-subunit of eIF3 (Prt1p), and eIF4G as well as the mRNA-binding proteins Pab1p and Pub1p.Despite having exhibited a function in mRNA expression, Rbp29p in crude yeast extracts did not co-sediment with polyribosomes in sucrose gradients (data not shown). This might be explained if Rbp29p binds to the coding region of mRNA and has to dissociate from the transcript to allow for the passage of the ribosomes. It is important to note that although Rbp29p has high affinity for poly(A) in vitro (Fig.4), there is no direct evidence that Rbp29p is bound to the poly(A) tail of mRNAs in vivo. In fact, our results showing that rRNA can efficiently compete with poly(A) for Rbp29p binding (Fig.4 B) could indicate that Rbp29p functions as a more general RNA-binding protein. However, it should also be noted that the poly(A) binding of mammalian PABP2, which is homologous to Rbp29p, is also competed by rRNA (12.Wahle E. Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).The present study extends the characterization of thetif4631–459 mutant by showing that even at the permissive temperature, this strain has a highly reduced rate of protein synthesis. Shifting the cell to the restrictive temperature (37 °C) does not result in a further significant reduction of these rates. Based on these results, it seems likely that the growth arrest of thetif4631–459 mutant at 37 °C is a consequence of a reduction in the rate of translation of subset of mRNAs whose products are required for progression through the cell cycle. This pool of mRNAs could include transcripts that are normally poorly translated or whose steady state levels are reduced at higher temperature. One possibility is that Rbp29p functions to ensure the optimal level of expression of such a subpopulation of mRNAs. Consistent with this idea are our results showing that Rbp29p is required for optimal growth at higher temperature when only one of the two yeast eIF4G homologues is available (Fig. 7, A andB). This requirement for Rbp29p is also evident at 30 °C when eIF4G cannot interact properly with the cap-binding protein (Fig.7 C) or with Pab1p (data not shown).Rbp29p could work in dosage suppression of the tif4631–459temperature sensitivity either by inducing a general increase in mRNA translatability or by increasing the expression of a specific subset of transcripts. Our observation that the amount of Rbp29p co-immunoprecipitating with Pab1p is dependent on the amount of Rbp29p present in the cell is consistent with the hypothesis that it functions as a dosage suppressor as a result of its increased binding to mRNA. Whether this increased binding leads to more efficient mRNA export, mRNA translation, mRNA stabilization, or some other process will only be known when the mRNAs whose expression is stimulated by Rbp29p are identified.In conclusion, we have characterized a nonessential RNA-binding protein and provided clues about its possible function in cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism. Our identification of genetic interactions between mutations in RBP29 and TIF4631 andTIF4632 now provide useful tools for further investigations of the role of Rbp29p in yeast. Together with the anticipated progress in understanding the cellular roles of other poorly characterized yeast RNA-binding proteins, our work should provide a basis for the development of a more complete model of how mRNA packaging functions to regulate gene expression in eucaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W1990914688,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) interferes with insulin signaling in adipose tissue and may promote insulin resistance. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor (IR) triggers its autophosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of Shc and the downstream activation of p42/p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2), which mediates insulin-induced proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Since insulin resistance is a risk factor for vascular disease, we examined the effects of TNFα on mitogenic signaling by insulin. In rat aortic VSMC, insulin induced rapid phosphorylation of the IR and Shc and caused a 5.3-fold increase in activated, phosphorylated ERK1/2 at 10 min. Insulin induced a biphasic ERK1/2 activation with a transient peak at 10 min and a sustained late phase after 2 h. Preincubation (30–120 min) with TNFα had no effect on insulin-induced IR phosphorylation. In contrast, TNFα transiently suppressed insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of Shc was inhibited by TNFα in a similar pattern. Since mitogenic signaling by insulin in VSMC requires ERK1/2 activation, we examined the effect of TNFα on insulin-induced proliferation. Insulin alone induced a 3.4-fold increase in DNA synthesis, which TNFα inhibited by 48%. TNFα alone was not mitogenic. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation with PD98059 also inhibited insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis by 57%. TNFα did not inhibit platelet-derived growth factor-induced ERK1/2 activation or DNA synthesis in VSMC. Thus, TNFα selectively interferes with insulin-induced mitogenic signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Shc and the downstream activation of ERK1/2. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) interferes with insulin signaling in adipose tissue and may promote insulin resistance. Insulin binding to the insulin receptor (IR) triggers its autophosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of Shc and the downstream activation of p42/p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2), which mediates insulin-induced proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Since insulin resistance is a risk factor for vascular disease, we examined the effects of TNFα on mitogenic signaling by insulin. In rat aortic VSMC, insulin induced rapid phosphorylation of the IR and Shc and caused a 5.3-fold increase in activated, phosphorylated ERK1/2 at 10 min. Insulin induced a biphasic ERK1/2 activation with a transient peak at 10 min and a sustained late phase after 2 h. Preincubation (30–120 min) with TNFα had no effect on insulin-induced IR phosphorylation. In contrast, TNFα transiently suppressed insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of Shc was inhibited by TNFα in a similar pattern. Since mitogenic signaling by insulin in VSMC requires ERK1/2 activation, we examined the effect of TNFα on insulin-induced proliferation. Insulin alone induced a 3.4-fold increase in DNA synthesis, which TNFα inhibited by 48%. TNFα alone was not mitogenic. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation with PD98059 also inhibited insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis by 57%. TNFα did not inhibit platelet-derived growth factor-induced ERK1/2 activation or DNA synthesis in VSMC. Thus, TNFα selectively interferes with insulin-induced mitogenic signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Shc and the downstream activation of ERK1/2. insulin receptor IR β-subunit tumor necrosis factor α mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphatidylinositol platelet-derived growth factor insulin-like growth factor-1 bromodeoxyuridine vascular smooth muscle cell(s) insulin control Insulin has pleiotropic actions to regulate cell growth, differentiation, and metabolism (1.Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These varied biological effects of insulin result from the activation of a wide array of intracellular signaling proteins involved in multiple postreceptor pathways (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar and 2.Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of insulin to its cognate receptor (IR)1 triggers autophosphorylation of the IR, which activates a tyrosine kinase domain in the cytoplasmic tail of the β-subunit. The activated IR tyrosine kinase associates with and phosphorylates a variety of intracellular substrates including Shc and IRS-1, which function as docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins that propagate insulin's signal downstream. In most cell types, insulin signaling branches off into two pathways that lead to either the activation of ERK1/2 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), respectively. Activation of either pathway has been implicated for the mitogenic effect of insulin in different cell types, whereas metabolic responses elicited by insulin are more closely linked to the PI 3-kinase pathway (3.Moule S.K. Denton R.M. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 41A-49AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 pathway appears to be critical for insulin's actions in the vasculature, where insulin enhances the mitogenic activity of other growth factors and is itself a mitogen for VSMC (4.Cruzado M.

Insulin induces ERK1/2 activation in VSMC through the activation of the Raf-1 → MAPK/ERK kinase → ERK1/2 cytosolic protein kinase cascade, which we have recently shown to be required for insulin-stimulated VSMC growth (7.Xi X.P. Graf K. Goetze S. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These findings are supported by studies in other cell types showing that insulin-induced mitogenic signaling is linked to the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway (8.Krook A. Whitehead J.P. Dobson S.P.

TNFα has been shown to inhibit insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation in L6 skeletal muscle cells, C2C12 muscle cells, and 3T3L1 adipocytes (10.Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J.

In addition to its effects on insulin signaling through the ERK1/2 pathway, TNFα has been demonstrated to induce serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and a concomitant inhibition of insulin-stimulated IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation in adipocytes (11.Kletzien R.F.

The inhibitory effects of TNFα on insulin signaling in adipocytes appear to be more relevant for metabolic events than mitogenesis in these terminally differentiated cells. In other cell types with greater proliferative capacity than adipocytes, TNFα might interfere with mitogenic signaling by insulin. VSMC proliferation is a critical event in the development and progression of vascular lesion formation. Since insulin stimulates VSMC proliferation, we examined the effect of TNFα on insulin signaling in VSMC. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, glutamine, antibiotics, HEPES, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and monoclonal antibody against smooth muscle α-actin were obtained from Sigma; rat recombinant tumor necrosis factor α was from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN); and Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody, and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). Culture plastic ware was obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were from Charles River Laboratories (Charles River, MA). The MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 and phosphospecific ERK1/ERK2 MAPK rabbit antibodies were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against insulin receptor β, IRS-1, Shc, and tyrosine-phosphorylated protein were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) detection kit was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were prepared from thoracic aortas of 2–3-month-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats using the explant technique (17.Chamley-Campbell J. Campbell G.R. Ross R. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) and were cultured as described previously (18.Goetze S. Xi X.-P. Kawano Y. Kawano H. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When used, PD98059 or wortmannin were added 30 min prior to the following treatment protocol. For all data shown, each individual experiment represented in the n value was performed using an independent preparation of VSMC. For protein analysis, early passaged (5 or less) VSMC were grown to 60–70% confluency and then starved for 24 h in 0.4% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After various incubation periods with insulin (1 μmol/liter), TNFα (100 units/ml), or PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml), cells were lysed, and protein concentrations were determined as described previously (18.Goetze S. Xi X.-P. Kawano Y. Kawano H. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, 200 μg of protein in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:100) against insulin receptor β, IRS-1, or Shc at 4 °C. Then 40 μl of protein-Sepharose G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to each sample, followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. After that, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s, and pellets were washed several times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of 1× SDS buffer. Equal amounts of protein were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting against tyrosine-phosphorylated protein or phosphorylated ERK1/2 was performed as previously reported (18.Goetze S. Xi X.-P. Kawano Y. Kawano H. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All Western blot experiments were repeated at least three times with a different cell preparation. To examine DNA synthesis, incorporation of the thymidine analogue BrdUrd was measured using the BrdUrd labeling and detection kit II from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (18.Goetze S. Xi X.-P. Kawano Y. Kawano H. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quiescent VSMC were incubated with insulin (1 μmol/liter), PDGF (20 ng/ml), or TNFα (100 units/ml) in serum-free medium. When used as inhibitors, TNFα (100 units/ml), PD98059 (30 μmol/liter), or wortmannin (50 nmol/liter) was added 30 min prior to stimulation with insulin or PDGF. Controls were kept in serum-free medium. Cell nuclei incorporating BrdUrd appeared brown and were counted in 4–6 different high power fields/well. Analysis of variance was performed for statistical analysis, and p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. In adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and other cell types, TNFα has been shown to interfere with insulin signaling, leading to inhibition of ERK1/2 and PI 3-kinase activation. In those studies, suppression of insulin signaling was observed after cells were pretreated with TNFα for periods ranging from 10 min to 4 days (10.Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar,11.Kletzien R.F. Foellmi-Adams L.A. Diabetes. 1994; 43 (abstr.): 82Google Scholar, 13.Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N.

To investigate the effects of TNFα on insulin signaling in VSMC, quiescent cells were stimulated either directly with TNFα (100 units/ml) and/or insulin (1 μmol/liter) or with insulin after preincubation with TNFα for various times. Activation and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was assessed by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody. Quiescent cells in the control group exhibited low ERK1/2 activity as evidenced by the faint bands detected at 44 and 42 kDa, corresponding to the ERK2 and ERK1 MAPKs (Fig.1). Stimulation for 10 min with either TNFα or insulin alone led to a 2.1- or 5.3-fold induction of ERK1/2 activity (ERK1 + ERK2), respectively. When added simultaneously, TNFα plus insulin activated ERK1/2 by 7.1-fold compared with control, demonstrating their additive effect on this pathway. Pretreatment with TNFα, however, led to a transient suppression of insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation by 94% at 30 min and 89% at 60 min. After longer exposure to TNFα, ERK1/2 activation in response to insulin was restored (4.8-fold after 90 min, 5.1-fold after 120 min). Since insulin at 1 μmol/liter may bind to both IR and IGF-1 receptors and induce downstream signaling events, we also tested the effect of TNFα pretreatment on ERK1/2 activity after stimulation with IGF-1. After pretreatment with TNFα, we observed a comparable inhibition of IGF-1-induced ERK1/2 activation as in insulin-stimulated cells (data not shown), demonstrating that TNFα suppresses ERK1/2 activation resulting through both the IR and the IGF-1 receptor. Insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation is a signaling event that occurs downstream of the IR tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation. In adipocytes, hepatoma cells, and fibroblasts, TNFα blocks insulin signaling by inhibiting IR tyrosine kinase activity, which leads to impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby blocking downstream signaling events (11.Kletzien R.F. Foellmi-Adams L.A. Diabetes. 1994; 43 (abstr.): 82Google Scholar, 13.Hotamisligil G.S. Murray D.L. Choy L.N. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1996; 97: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The IR tyrosine kinase also directly phosphorylates Shc, which in turn associates with the adaptor proteins Grb2 and SOS that activate p21 ras and thereby initiates the sequential activation of the Ser/Thr kinases Raf-1, MAPK/ERK kinase, and ERK1/2 (2.Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of TNFα on insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR, IRS-1, and Shc. VSMC were stimulated with insulin and/or TNFα for 5 min with or without pretreatment with TNFα (30–120 min). The insulin receptor β-subunit (IRβ), IRS-1, or Shc was immunoprecipitated, and phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies were used for immunoblotting to detect phosphorylated tyrosines on IRβ, IRS-1, or Shc. Levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ or IRS-1 were below detection in quiescent cells or in VSMC stimulated with TNFα alone (Fig.2). Treatment with insulin induced an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated IRβ and IRS-1 by 1.9- and 2.3-fold, respectively, that was not affected by costimulation or preincubation with TNFα. The suppression of insulin signaling by TNFα in VSMC, therefore, occurs downstream of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR. This is in contrast to the reported effects in adipocytes and skeletal muscle, suggesting that TNFα suppresses insulin signaling in VSMC by a distinct and novel mechanism. In contrast to the lack of an effect on IRβ- and IRS-1-phosphorylation, we observed a dramatic inhibition of insulin-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation after pretreatment with TNFα (Fig. 3). While quiescent cells in the control group did not show detectable levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc, stimulation with either TNFα or insulin alone for 5 min resulted in a 2.3- or 2.5-fold induction of Shc phosphorylation, respectively. Interestingly, an additive stimulation of Shc phosphorylation was observed when TNFα and insulin were added simultaneously (3.8-fold as compared with control), similar to their effect on ERK1/2 activation. Pretreatment with TNFα led to a transient suppression of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc with a pattern similar to that observed for insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 activity, causing an inhibition by 71% at 30 min and 47% at 60 min. After exposure to TNFα for 90 min, insulin-stimulated Shc phosphorylation was restored. The suppression of insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by TNFα in VSMC, therefore, occurs at the level of Shc phosphorylation, which represents a new target for TNFα in interfering with insulin signaling. Shc protein levels did not change in response to insulin or TNFα, alone or in combination, for incubation periods of 5–90 min (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, there was no apparent shift in the mobility of Shc, which suggests that TNFα did not induce substantial phosphorylation at sites other than tyrosine (Fig. 3 B). To determine the effect of TNFα on mitogenic signaling by insulin, quiescent cells were stimulated for 24 h with insulin (1 μmol/liter) and TNFα (100 units/ml) either alone or in combination, and VSMC proliferation was measured by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig.4). Insulin alone induced a 3.37- ± 0.22-fold increase in VSMC DNA synthesis, which was inhibited by 47.8 ± 7.2% when TNFα was added 30 min before insulin and maintained throughout the experiment (p < 0.05). TNFα alone had no significant effect on mitogenesis. Blocking the ERK1/2 pathway with PD98059 (30 μmol/liter) also inhibited insulin-stimulated BrdUrd incorporation (57.2 ± 9.3% inhibition;p < 0.05), whereas wortmannin had only a modest effect that did not reach statistical significance. These results are in accord with our previous observations that insulin-induced mitogenic signaling in VSMC occurs predominantly through the ERK1/2 pathway (7.Xi X.P. Graf K. Goetze S. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In combination, these data indicate that TNFα suppression of insulin-induced DNA synthesis probably occurs through its blockade of ERK1/2 activation. Insulin-induced ERK1/2 activity in VSMC is biphasic. The first peak of ERK1/2 activity occurs as a rapid, transient activation of ERK1/2 within 10 min, which declines at 20 min and reaches a plateau activity above control at 30 min (Fig.5 A). Two hours after insulin stimulation, there is a late phase with a second, sustained peak of ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 5 A), which remains elevated above quiescent cell levels for up to 6 h (data not shown). A variety of growth factors induce a biphasic activation of ERK1/2 in VSMC (21.Desbois-Mouthon C. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Auclair M. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Caron M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22.Hoshiya M. Awazu M. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23.Rao G.N. Delafontaine P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20805-20810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a recent study has linked PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation to the late phase of ERK1/2 activity (25.Nelson P.R. Yamamura S. Mureebe L. Itoh H. Kent K.C. J. Vasc. Surg. 1998; 27: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The effect of TNFα on the biphasic induction of ERK1/2 by insulin is shown in Fig. 5 B. Cells were pretreated with TNFα for 30 min, and insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation followed from 0 to 180 min. Pretreatment with TNFα for 30 min suppresses not only the early phase but rather the full biphasic ERK1/2 response induced by insulin. Suppression of the late phase of ERK1/2 activation is consistent with our data showing that TNFα inhibits mitogenic signaling by insulin. To examine whether TNFα suppresses signaling from another tyrosine kinase receptor family member that also activates ERK1/2, we investigated the effects of the cytokine on PDGF-induced signal transduction in VSMC. PDGF also induces a biphasic activation of ERK1/2. In addition, PDGF-induced mitogenesis in VSMC is known to be ERK1/2-dependent (25.Nelson P.R. Yamamura S. Mureebe L. Itoh H. Kent K.C. J. Vasc. Surg. 1998; 27: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Quiescent VSMC were stimulated with TNFα (100 units/ml) and/or PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 10 min with or without preincubation with TNFα. As demonstrated in Fig.6 A, TNFα had no effect on PDGF-induced ERK1/2 activity. Consistent with this result, PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation (5.8 ± 0.55-fold versus control) was also not affected by TNFα (Fig. 6 B). Similar to our observations for insulin, PD98059 attenuated PDGF-stimulated BrdUrd incorporation by 43.4 ± 8.5% (p < 0.05), demonstrating that mitogenic signaling through the PDGF pathway also requires activation of ERK1/2. These data demonstrate that TNFα suppression of insulin signaling is not the result of a general effect common to all tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor pathways. The main finding of this study is that TNFα suppresses insulin-induced Shc phosphorylation and the downstream ERK1/2 activation, an important postreceptor branch of the insulin signaling cascade involved in cell growth. Our data provide the first evidence that mitogenic signaling by insulin is suppressed by TNFα. This is probably a direct consequence of TNFα blocking insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation at the level of Shc phosphorylation by the IR. We have recently shown that stimulation of VSMC proliferation by insulin is ERK1/2-dependent (7.Xi X.P. Graf K. Goetze S. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This finding is confirmed in this study, where insulin-stimulated mitogenesis was significantly inhibited by the pharmacological MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059. TNFα suppressed insulin-induced VSMC proliferation to a similar extent as it inhibited insulin-activated ERK1/2. A variety of growth factors induce a biphasic ERK1/2 activation in VSMC (21.Desbois-Mouthon C. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Auclair M. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Caron M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22.Hoshiya M. Awazu M. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23.Rao G.N. Delafontaine P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20805-20810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation has recently been linked to the late phase of ERK1/2 activation (25.Nelson P.R. Yamamura S. Mureebe L. Itoh H. Kent K.C. J. Vasc. Surg. 1998; 27: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we have previously shown that TNFα stimulates a rapid and transient activation of ERK1/2 but fails to stimulate DNA synthesis in VSMC (18.Goetze S. Xi X.-P. Kawano Y. Kawano H. Fleck E. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that pretreatment with TNFα suppresses the entire biphasic ERK1/2 response to insulin, which probably accounts for its inhibition of insulin-stimulated growth. This inhibitory effect of TNFα on insulin-stimulated mitogenic signaling, however, does not reflect a general antimitogenic action of the cytokine in VSMC, since PDGF-induced ERK1/2-dependent DNA synthesis was not suppressed. Two major pathways have been identified that can lead to the activation of ERK1/2 after insulin binds to the IR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of either IRS-1 or Shc by the IR creates docking sites for the Src homology 2 domain in the adaptor protein Grb2. IRS-1·Grb2 or Shc·Grb2 complexes then bind to the Ras effector protein SOS, a guanyl nucleotide exchange protein, through the Grb2 Src homology 3 domains that recognize proline-rich motifs. SOS activates Ras by exchanging GTP for GDP bound to the G protein, which can trigger the downstream Raf-1 → MAPK/ERK kinase → ERK1/2 protein kinase cascade. Depending on the cell type or tissue examined, IR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of either IRS-1 or Shc can activate ERK1/2. Recent findings in IRS-1-deficient mice report that insulin signaling to ERK1/2 in skeletal muscle is mediated primarily through tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor (26.Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Sonenberg N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Strikingly different results were obtained using fibroblasts from the same animal model where insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation was unaffected by the absence of IRS-1 (27.Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In these cells, IR phosphorylation of Shc was proposed to be the major route for insulin's activation of the Ras → ERK1/2 pathway. The degree to which insulin activates ERK1/2 through either IRS-1 or Shc or through both may vary significantly among different cell types. Postreceptor mechanisms for insulin-induced ERK1/2 activation are poorly characterized for VSMC. Our finding that TNFα did not affect insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 but inhibited phosphorylation of Shc and activation of ERK1/2 suggests that Shc predominantly regulates the Ras → ERK1/2 pathway in VSMC. The underlying mechanism for the transient suppression of insulin signaling to ERK1/2 via Shc by TNFα in VSMC remains to be determined. TNFα-receptor down-regulation, desensitization, and/or decay of inhibitory signaling molecules could account for this phenomenon. The inhibition of insulin-induced mitogenic signal transduction in VSMC by TNFα underscores the pluripotency of the cytokine in inhibiting insulin signaling in different tissues. This is even more interesting, since TNFα appears to affect different steps in the signaling cascades that are activated by insulin in different cell types, thereby targeting different cell functions. Studies in C2C12 muscle cells and L6 skeletal muscle cells reported that TNFα inhibited both insulin-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and glucose uptake. However, no activation of ERK1/2 by TNFα was observed, indicating a potentially different mechanism of action of TNFα in these cells (10.Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J.

In combination, these data indicate that although TNFα can interfere with insulin signaling in multiple cell types, different targets in the signaling cascades may be involved. TNFα is a cytokine that is up-regulated in the vasculature under pathological conditions. Increased expression of the cytokine has been reported after balloon injury (28.Tanaka H. Sukhova G. Schwartz D. Libby P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29.Jovinge S. Hultgardh-Nilsson A. Regnstrom J. Nilsson J. Arterioscler. Thromb.

Br. Heart J. 1995; 73: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of TNFα has been demonstrated in intimal VSMC (31.Barath P. Fishbein M.C. Cao J. Berenson J. Helfant R.H. Forrester J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 503-509PubMed Google Scholar) and plaques of atherosclerotic arteries (32.Rayment N.B. Moss E. Faulkner L. Brickell P.M. Davies M.J. Woolf N.

Pathol. 1993; 142: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar), and although several TNFα activities in the vasculature are considered proatherogenic (34.Libby P. Sukhova G. Lee R.T. Galis Z.S. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 25: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), a recent study identified accelerated atherosclerosis in mice lacking the p55-TNFα receptor, suggesting a protective effect of the cytokine in the development of atherosclerosis (35.Schreyer S.A. Peschon J.J. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26174-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). VSMC proliferation is a critical step in the progression of restenosis and is probably also an important contributor to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Hyperinsulinemia may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, possibly through direct effects on the vasculature (36.Despres J.P. Lamarche B. Mauriege P. Cantin B. Dagenais G.R. Moorjani S. Lupien P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). Here we show that TNFα interferes with mitogenic signaling of insulin through the ERK1/2 pathway and suppresses insulin-induced VSMC growth. This raises the possibility that under certain conditions the release of TNFα in the local tissue may actually exert protective effects on insulin-induced changes in the arterial wall.

Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)1 and SHC, the two best characterized substrates of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, serve as docking sites for various SH2 domain-containing proteins to generate multiple independent cellular signals that ultimately lead to various downstream biological responses (2.White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 3.Pelicci G.L. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cauallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicei P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 is known to bind to two regulatory subunits of PI 3-kinase, p85 and p55, Grb2, the tyrosine phosphatase Syp, Fyn, Nck, and Crk (4.Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers M.G.J.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4453-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase has been implicated in a wide variety of insulin effects that include stimulation of glucose transport through the translocation of Glut 4 to the cell surface, activation of glycogen synthesis, inhibition of lipolysis, and induction of membrane ruffling (7.Shephard P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). SHC can also bind to Grb2 (8.Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A. Vicentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R. Myers M.J. Backer J.M. Ulrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and through its interaction with mSOS it can cause Ras activation and subsequent increased mitogensis (9.Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Osmotic shock has been shown to increase glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by stimulating the translocation of Glut 4 to the cell surface (10.Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway is distinct from insulin in that it fails to activate PI 3-kinase or AKT. Interestingly, treatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein or microinjection of phosphotyrosine antibodies blocks both insulin and sorbitol-induced Glut 4 translocation, suggesting a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade is important for both pathways. The stimuli are not additive. Furthermore, a subsequent study showed that pretreatment with 600 mm sorbitol inhibits insulin from further increasing glucose transport (11.Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (4694): 4884Google Scholar). Although early insulin signaling such as insulin receptor autophosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and activation of PI 3-kinase are normal, osmotic stress inhibits insulin activation of AKT by stimulating a phosphatase that maintains Thr308 and Ser473 of AKT in the dephosphorylated state. Activation of a similar or identical phosphatase may be responsible for the inhibition of both basal and insulin-stimulated p70S6 kinase activities by hypertonic shock (12.Parrott L.A. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24731-24736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A prevents the inhibition of insulin activation of AKT (11.Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (4694): 4884Google Scholar) and the deactivation of p70S6 kinase (12.Parrott L.A. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24731-24736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is not known whether sorbitol activates the phosphatase through an intrinsic activation mechanism or by altering the subcellular localization of the enzyme or substrate. In the present study we further investigate the effects of osmotic shock on insulin action. Pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 600 mm sorbitol enhances by 10-fold the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 68-kDa protein. Additional characterization indicates that this protein is a peripheral protein that resides in the detergent-insoluble fraction of low density microsomes (LDM) by binding to RNA. Cytochalasin D, nocodazole, poly(A)-Sepharose 4B, and poly(U)-agarose were purchased from Sigma. Latrunculin B was from BioMol. PD 98059 and SB 203580 were from Calbiochem. Phenylarsine oxide was purchased from Aldrich. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to confluence and 48 h later subjected to differentiation as described previously (13.Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 10–14 days after differentiation. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for at least 2 h to overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Adipocytes were then incubated with DMEM alone or DMEM supplemented with insulin or sorbitol. After the treatment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 2 ml/10-cm dish of ice-cold HES (255 mm sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 100 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors and then homogenized by passing the cells 10 times through a Yamato LSC homogenizer at a speed of 1200 rotations/min at 4 °C. Subcellular fractionation was carried out by differential centrifugation as described previously (14.Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following protease inhibitors were used: 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride. 50 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphotyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using the monoclonal PY-20 antibody (Transduction Laboratories).125I-Labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (0.25 μCi/ml, ICN, Irvine, CA) was used as the secondary antibody. Radioactive bands were quantitated by a PhosphoImager SI Analyzer (Molecular Dynamics). The phospho-specific antibodies, phospho-p42/44 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) E10 monoclonal antibody, phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody, and the phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody, were from New England Biolabs. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for the detection. 0.5–1.0 mg of LDM were solubilized with 0.5–1 ml of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C in a microfuge, the supernatant was incubated overnight with 4 μg of primary antibody. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose or 50 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG affinity gel (Cappel, ICN) were added for 2 h at 4 °C to the reactions that contained polyclonal or monoclonal primary antibodies, respectively. After washing pellets four times with ice-cold Buffer A containing detergent and twice with Buffer A without detergent, proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot using PY20 antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as described above. Antibodies directed against SHC, RasGAP, Paxillin, Sam68, Grb2, and Nck were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Cbl, Cas, p62Dok, Fyn, and IRS-3 antibodies were from Santa Cruz. Fak, PTP1C, Pyk2, Syp, Src, and PI 3-kinase antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal antibodies directed against Glut 4 transporter and IRS-1 were generated by immunizing rabbits with peptides corresponding to the final 16 amino acids of each protein. Determination of whether the immunoprecipitations were successful was carried out by Western blot analyses of aliquots of the supernatants before and after immunoprecipitation. Osmotic shock has been shown to cause insulin-resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by inhibiting insulin activation of glucose transport, p70S6 kinase, glycogen synthesis, and lipogenesis (11.Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (4694): 4884Google Scholar). To further investigate the effects of osmotic shock on insulin action, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 30 min with either DMEM alone or DMEM containing 100 nm insulin, 600 mm sorbitol, or the combination of sorbitol and insulin. The cells were homogenized, fractionated by differential centrifugation, and then Western blot analyses were conducted on the various enriched subcellular compartments using a phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1). As reported previously (10.Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), insulin but not sorbitol, stimulated the tyrosine autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (95-kDa band) in the plasma membrane (PM) fraction. Interestingly, the combination of sorbitol and insulin actually increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor 2-fold compared with cells treated with insulin alone. Western blots using an insulin receptor antibody showed that the amount of receptor in the PM was identical for all conditions suggesting that sorbitol enhanced ligand-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation (data not shown). Analysis of the cytosol indicated that sorbitol did not affect insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (165-kDa band). Sorbitol alone did induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytosolic proteins in the 115–130 kDa and 50–70 kDa range as was described previously (10.Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The LDM fraction is enriched in endosomes, the Golgi apparatus, as well as insulin-responsive Glut 4-containing vesicles (15.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Darnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 has been shown to bind and activate PI 3-kinase in the LDM (16.Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic shock did not prevent tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 from associating with the LDM (Fig. 1), nor did it affect IRS-1 from binding and activating PI 3-kinase (data not shown (11.Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (4694): 4884Google Scholar)). In addition, sorbitol, but not insulin, increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of at least one protein in the 115–120-kDa protein range. The most dramatic effect, however, was the appearance of a 68-kDa protein that was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin alone, but not sorbitol, and whose phosphorylation was increased 6–10-fold when cells were treated with both insulin and sorbitol. Closer examination of the blot revealed that two additional proteins (55 and 75 kDa) had greater tyrosine phosphorylation content when cells were treated with both insulin and sorbitol compared with insulin alone, although the increases were small relative to that of pp68. Because the enhancement of pp68 phosphorylation by sorbitol was apparent from phosphotyrosine blots of whole cell lysates (data not shown), insulin must stimulate the phosphorylation of this protein rather than simply altering the subcellular localization of a sorbitol-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated 68-kDa protein from the cytosol to the LDM. The high density microsomes are enriched in endoplasmic reticulum but are also contaminated with organelles in the PM and LDM fractions (14.Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Darnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The appearance of low levels of both tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor and pp68 in this fraction (Fig. 1) is consistent with the cross-contamination. The mitochondrial/nuclear fraction contained few tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (data not shown). Wortmannin had no significant effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of any protein in any compartment with the exception that it reduced the sorbitol-induced phosphorylation of 115–120-kDa proteins in the cytosol and LDM. Because pp68 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin alone and its phosphorylation was dramatically elevated with osmotic shock and it was preferentially found in the LDM fraction, which also contains important insulin signaling molecules (17.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we further characterized the phosphorylation of this protein. 100 nm insulin was added for varying periods of time to 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were first preincubated for 15 min with 600 mm sorbitol. Antiphosphotyrosine Western blots were then conducted on LDM isolated by subcellular fractionation. Fig. 2shows that insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp68 was rapid and complete after 1 min. Although this time frame is consistent with the insulin receptor phosphorylating p68 directly (18.Madoff D.H. Martensen T.M. Lane M.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we cannot rule out the possibility that insulin activates another tyrosine kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates p68. Next we measured the insulin concentration dependence to determine whether the insulin response was because of the insulin receptor or the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (Fig. 2). Varying concentrations of insulin were added for 5 min to cells that were first pretreated for 15 min with 600 mm sorbitol. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp68 was apparent with 5 nm insulin and saturated between 50 and 100 nm insulin suggesting that the insulin and not the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor was responsible for stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation (19.White M.F. Maron R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1985; 318: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The effect of sorbitol on pp68 tyrosine phosphorylation was completely reversible (Fig. 3). Adipocytes were incubated in 600 mm sorbitol for 15 min followed by the addition of 100 nm insulin for 5 min. Cells were then washed and incubated for varying periods of time with DMEM containing insulin in the absence of sorbitol. The amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp68 in the LDM was quantitated from phosphotyrosine Western blots. The sorbitol induction of pp68 tyrosine phosphorylation was reversible and complete by 2.5 min after sorbitol removal. Maintaining insulin throughout the washout did not prevent the reversal. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 can be released from the LDM with high salt but not with Triton X-100 (17.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because of this observation in conjunction with the identification of filamentous actin in the IRS-1-containing LDM fraction, it was proposed that phosphorylated IRS-1 may be associated with the actin cytoskeleton (17.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine the extraction properties of pp68, LDM prepared from sorbitol- and insulin-treated adipocytes was incubated with either 600 mm NaCl or 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The soluble and insoluble fractions were isolated after centrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 × g. Phosphotyrosine blots on the different fractions revealed that similarly to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1, pp68 can be extracted with high salt but not with nonionic detergent (Fig. 4 A). Glut 4, on the other hand, was removed from the LDM with 1% Triton X-100 but not high salt. Treatment of sorbitol- and insulin-treated cells with either the actin-depolymerizing agents, cytochalasin D or latrunculin B, or with the tubulin depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, failed to affect the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp68 associated with the LDM (Fig.4 B). Although these compounds did not affect pp68 phosphorylation, confocal microscopy revealed that they did dramatically alter filamentous structures (data not shown). Osmotic stress is known to activate the p38 MAP kinase (20.Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) and SAPK/JNK (21.Matsuda S.

To verify the effects of insulin and sorbitol on these pathways, Western blot analyses were carried out on whole cell lysates from 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were incubated for 30 min with DMEM alone or with DMEM containing insulin, sorbitol, or the combination of insulin and sorbitol using phospho-specific antibodies directed against the activated forms of p42/44 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, or SAPK/JNK. Fig. 5 A shows that p42/44 MAP kinases were activated by both insulin and sorbitol and that these effects were additive in cells incubated with both insulin and sorbitol for 30 min. Wortmannin inhibited insulin but not sorbitol-induced activation. Inhibition of insulin activation of p42/44 MAP kinase by wortmannin has been previously reported in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes (23.Suga J. Yoshimasa Y. Yamada K. Yamamoto Y. Inoue G. Okamoto M. Hayashi T. Shigemoto M. Kosaki A. Kuzuya H. Nakao K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and in skeletal muscle (24.Wojtaszewski J.F.P. Lynge J. Jakobsen A.B. Goodyear L.J. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E724-E732PubMed Google Scholar). Sorbitol dramatically increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK. In agreement with Chenet al., (10.Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we saw very little if any effect of insulin on modulating the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. This observation is in contrast to another recent report using 3T3-L1 adipocytes (25.Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Wortmannin had no effect on the stress-induced phosphorylation of p38 or SAPK/JNK. To address whether the enhancement of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp68 by sorbitol was mediated through the activation of the p42/44 or the p38 MAP kinase pathways, we examined whether MAP kinase inhibitors could affect pp68 accumulation. Adipocytes were preincubated with either DMEM alone, the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059 (100 μm for 1 h), or with the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB 203580 (20 μm for 30 min). The cells were then treated with 600 mm sorbitol for 15 min followed by the addition of 100 nm insulin for 5 min. The amount of pp68 in the LDM was visualized by phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis. Fig. 5 B illustrates that these inhibitors had no effect on pp68 accumulation, even though they did specifically inhibit the activation of these pathways by Western blot analyses using phospho-specific antibodies (data not shown). Because we are unaware of a specific inhibitor of the SAPK/JNK pathway, we cannot address the importance of this pathway in enhancing the insulin-induced phosphorylation of pp68. There are several known 68–70-kDa proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine. By immunoprecipitating these proteins from LDM prepared from sorbitol- and insulin-treated adipocytes using commercially available antibodies followed by phosphotyrosine Western blot analyses on the precipitated proteins, we eliminated the possibility of pp68 being SHC, Src, Fyn, IRS-3, Syp, PTP1C, p62Dok, Paxillin, or Sam68 (Table I). Using this same procedure, we determined that pp68 does not interact with IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, Glut 4-containing vesicles, RasGap, Fak, Cbl, Grb2, Pyk2, Nck, Src, or Cas (Table I). In all cases we verified that the commercial antibody did in fact immunoprecipitate the appropriate protein (data not shown).Table ICandidate and interacting proteins eliminated by negative immunoprecipitation resultsCandidate proteinsPossible interacting proteinsSHC, SRC, FYN, IRS-3, SYP, PTP1C, p62DOK, PAXILLIN, p68SAMIRS-1, PI 3-KINASE, GLUT 4, RasGAP, FAK, CBL, GRB2, PYK2, NCK, SRC, CASCandidate and possible interacting proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated overnight from 0.5 to 1.0 mg of Triton X-100 solubilized LDM.

Open table in a new tab Candidate and possible interacting proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated overnight from 0.5 to 1.0 mg of Triton X-100 solubilized LDM. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot using PY20 antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. It has been reported that insulin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 70-kDa protein in A14 fibroblasts (26.Medema J.P. Pronk G.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Clark R. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 543-550PubMed Google Scholar) that were pretreated with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (PAO). This protein is not Sam68 but it does bind poly(U)-Sepharose. To determine whether pp68 binds to RNA, LDM containing pp68 were treated with RNase A for 2 h on ice prior to centrifugation at 200,000 × g. The phosphotyrosine blot (Fig. 6A) revealed that RNase treatment released pp68 but not Glut 4 from the LDM. To further confirm that pp68 is an RNA-binding protein, we tested the ability of pp68 to bind either poly(A)-Sepharose 4B, poly(U)-agarose, or agarose alone. pp68 was first released from the LDM with 600 mm NaCl. After removing the insoluble material by centrifugation, the salt concentration was diluted to 150 mm NaCl. After incubating pp68 with the RNA resins for 2 h, the samples were centrifuged, the pellets washed four times, and phosphotyrosine Western blot analyses were then carried out on the bound material. Fig. 6 B illustrates that the majority of the pp68 starting material bound to poly(A) and poly(U) resins but not to agarose alone. Although these results indicate that pp68 binds RNA, they do not address whether the binding is direct or through another protein(s). In addition to pp68, the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins pp55 and pp75 that we observed in the LDM fraction of Fig. 1 also bound to RNA. To address whether pp68 might be the same 70-kDa protein reported in A14 fibroblasts (26.Medema J.P. Pronk G.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Clark R. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 543-550PubMed Google Scholar), 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with PAO for 15 min followed by the addition of insulin for 5 min. Phosphotyrosine blots showed that a protein of 68 kDa accumulated in cells treated with PAO and insulin (Fig. 7). In addition to pp68, LDM from both sorbitol- and PAO-treated adipocytes contained proteins of 55, 75, and 95 kDa that exhibited enhanced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Because PAO is a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and the same pattern of insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins accumulated with both PAO and sorbitol, this suggests that osmotic shock may inhibit a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that leads to an increase in the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several LDM proteins, especially pp68. The 95-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is probably the β-subunit of the insulin receptor. Because the identity of the 70-kDa protein in A14 cells has not been reported, we cannot prove that pp68 is the same protein even though it appears to accumulate in the presence of PAO and insulin. However, unlike pp70 from A14 fibroblasts, pp68 does not bind to RasGAP or Grb2 (Table I). To examine whether other types of cellular stress can modulate insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp68, we determined what effect oxidative stress, heat shock, potassium depletion, and inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase had on the accumulation of pp68. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with either H2O2for 15 min, heated to 43 °C for 90 min, depleted of K+for 90 min, or incubated with 1 mm ouabain for 1 h prior to the addition of insulin for 5 min. The amount of pp68 in the LDM fraction was then analyzed from phosphotyrosine Western blots. None of these other conditions affected the level of pp68 (data not shown). Insulin mediates its biological effects by activating an intrinsic tyrosine kinase upon binding of the hormone to specific cell surface receptors (1.Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates such as the IRS proteins (2.White M.F. Mol. Cell.

In this study we identified a downstream molecule in the insulin-signaling pathway that resides in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of the LDM of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and binds to RNA. The LDM fraction is enriched in endosomes, Golgi, and insulin responsive Glut 4-containing vesicles (15.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Darnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition to pp68, other insulin signaling molecules, such as IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, and SHC, have been localized to the nonionic detergent-resistant fraction of the LDM (17.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Hill et al.(29.Hill M.M. Clark S.F. James D.E. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2629-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) identified 12 insulin-stimulated phosphoproteins in the LDM of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by combining metabolic labeling, subcellular fractionation, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The majority of these proteins are also present in the detergent insoluble fraction, including a protein with a molecular mass of 66 kDa. It was not reported, however, whether this protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine. Because pp68 did not associate with IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, or SHC, this suggests that pp68 resides in a different compartment in the LDM. Triton X-100 insolubility is a known characteristic of the actin cytoskeleton, and long filamentous structures that resemble cytoskeletal elements have been observed by electron microscopy in the detergent insoluble fraction of the LDM (17.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the observation that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with actin or tubulin-depolymerizing agents failed to affect the accumulation of pp68 in the LDM (Fig. 4 B) suggests that pp68 is not associated with the membrane skeleton. pp68 is not the first reported RNA-binding protein that is phosphorylated on tyrosine. Sam68 is a 68-kDa RNA-binding protein that is a substrate of the SRC tyrosine kinase during mitosis (30.Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 31.Fumagalli S. Totty N. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, this protein binds to several SH3 and SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules such as Grb2 (32.Richard S., Yu, D. Bloumer K.J. Hausladen D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phospholipase Cγ-1 (32.Richard S., Yu, D. Bloumer K.J. Hausladen D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell.

Iwahima M. Fujisawa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6214-6219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The RNA-binding activity is inhibited upon tyrosine phosphorylation (35.Wang L.L. Richard S. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2010-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Sam68 and pp68 appear to be different proteins based upon the failure to immunoprecipitate pp68 with Sam68-specific antibodies and on the ability of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp68 to bind RNA. A second 68-kDa RNA-binding protein that can be phosphorylated on tyrosine is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (36.Ostrowski J. Schullery D.S. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Watts J. Aebersold R. Stempka L. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3619-3628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This protein, which recruits a diverse group of molecules that includes RNA, DNA, Vav, transcription repressors, and inducible kinases, has been implicated in transcription, RNA processing, and translation (37.Bomsztyk K. Van Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Treatment with H2O2/vanadate induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of K protein in both cell culture and in mouse liver (36.Ostrowski J. Schullery D.S. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Watts J. Aebersold R. Stempka L. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3619-3628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation was shown to enhance subsequent serine phosphorylation by protein kinase C as well as increase the association of K protein with Lck and the proto-oncoprotein Vav. K protein binds preferentially to poly(C) but not to poly(U)-RNA. Tyrosine phosphorylation inhibits the protein-RNA interaction in a similar manner to Sam68. Based on the observations that tyrosine-phosphorylated pp68 bound efficiently to poly(U)-RNA (Fig. 6), that pp68 did not accumulate in adipocytes with H2O2 and insulin, and that PAO and insulin could stimulate pp68 (Fig. 7) but not K protein (26.Medema J.P. Pronk G.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Clark R. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 543-550PubMed Google Scholar) tyrosine phosphorylation, pp68 is probably not heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K. Osmotic stress enhanced the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp68 10-fold (Fig. 1). Although hypertonic shock activated both the p42/44 and the p38 MAP kinase pathways (Fig. 5 A), inhibitors of these pathways did not affect pp68 accumulation, suggesting that induction of these pathways is not responsible for the enhancement of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp68. Other types of cellular stress, such as oxidative stress, heat shock, depletion of potassium, and inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase did not modulate insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp68. PAO is a known tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Inhibition of two phosphotyrosine phosphatases, HA1 and HA2, by PAO results in the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 15-kDa fatty acid-binding protein (38.Liao K. Hoffman R.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6544-6553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PAO blocks insulin-induced RAS activation by inhibiting the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Syp (39.Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Because the same pattern of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, including pp68, accumulated in the LDM with both PAO and sorbitol treatment (Fig. 7), this suggests that osmotic shock may inhibit a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that leads to an increase in pp68. This would explain the increase in ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the PM fraction even though the amount of receptor did not change with hypertonic shock. Furthermore, inhibition of a phosphatase could result in an increase in the number of phosphorylated proteins. For example, treatment of cells with the serine phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, was shown to increase the basal phosphorylation of both AKT (11.Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19 (4694): 4884Google Scholar) and p70S6 kinase (12.Parrott L.A. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24731-24736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the 115–130 kDa and 50–70 kDa range observed when adipocytes were treated with sorbitol alone (Fig. 1 (10.Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)) may be due at least in part to an inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase(s) rather than a stimulation of phosphotyrosine kinase(s). The identity of pp68 remains elusive. We have eliminated a number of known 65–70-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Table I) as being pp68. Recently, PAO and insulin were shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 70-kDa protein in A14 fibroblasts that could bind poly(U)-RNA (26.Medema J.P. Pronk G.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Clark R. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 543-550PubMed Google Scholar). This protein was neither Sam68 nor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K. Because the identity of this 70-kDa protein has not been reported, we cannot address whether pp68 and pp70 are the same protein. In contrast to pp70, pp68 in the LDM did not associate with RasGAP or Grb2. We cannot rule out, however, that pp68 that resides in another compartment like the cytosol binds these SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins. In fact, all of the experiments on pp70 were done using total cell lysates as opposed to a LDM fraction, and osmotic shock was never used. pp68 has been purified to homogeneity, and although our initial attempts were unsuccessful, we are currently in the process of purifying enough material to obtain sequence information. Based on the elimination of known proteins and on the time and insulin concentration dependences of phosphorylation, pp68 could be a novel substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase whose ability to bind RNA may dictate its physiological function."

An active site zinc binding motif, HXXEH, which is inverted relative to the more common HEXXH motif (1.Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), characterizes this family of metallopeptidases. The geometry and mechanism of peptide cleavage at an inverted zinc-binding site has not been elucidated. Aside from nardilysin, three other members of the pitrilysin family have been identified: insulin-degrading enzyme (EC 3.4.24.56) (2.Affholter J.A. Fried V.A. Roth R.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1415-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3.Baumaister H. Muller D. Rehbein M Richter D.

DNA and Cell Biology. 1999; 18: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nardilysin is unique in that it contains an acidic region, which, depending on the particular species, is composed of 43 (human) to 59 (mouse) glutamate and aspartate residues within a 76-amino acid stretch. It has been suggested that this acidic domain might play a role in the regulation of nardilysin activity by forming charge-charge complexes with other cellular components (6.Csuhai E. Chen G. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3787-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7.Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. Arch. Biochem.

The initial characterization of the specificity of nardilysin led to the conclusion that the enzyme cleaves peptide substrates on the amino side of an arginine residue of paired basic residues (8.Chesneau V.

It has been found that although the enzyme cleaves a number of peptides between paired dibasic residues of the type Arg-Arg (dynorphin A, BAM12 residues 1–8) and Arg-Lys (α-neoendorphin), with somatostatin 28 as substrate cleavage occurs on the amino side of the arginine residue in the Arg-Lys dibasic pair (8.Chesneau V.

Here we report the use of these substrates to study the effect of amino acid substitutions at the P2, P2′, and P3 positions on the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis as well as influencing the site of cleavage. The results of this study show that P2 and P2′ residues have a significant effect on the rate of substrate hydrolysis. The site of cleavage is governed by both the residue in the P2 position and a preference to cleave on the amino side of arginine. These effects can produce multiple cleavage sites in a substrate.

For the separation of the cleavage fragments of Abz-GGFHRRHGQ-EDDnp, a concave gradient from 5 to 50% acetonitrile was employed. Peak areas were used to quantitate products.

In some cases, products were identified by mass spectrometry directly from reaction mixtures in which ammonium acetate buffer replaced phosphate buffer. When appropriate, products were identified by comparing their retention times on HPLC to authentic standards previously identified by mass spectrometry. Alternatively, peptides were identified either by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry or by electrospray ionization-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry at the University of Kentucky Mass Spectrometry Facility. For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry, peptides were prepared in an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix, which was found to minimize fragmentation of blocked peptides. Nardilysin was purified from rat testes as described previously (6.Csuhai E. Chen G. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3787-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14.Cohen P. Pierotti A.R.

Monitoring the increase in fluorescence, which occurred upon peptide bond cleavage, was used to follow enzymatic hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide substrates. A Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer connected to a strip chart recorder was utilized with an excitation wavelength of 319 nm and an emission wavelength of 419 nm. Reaction mixtures of 400 μl contained 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and variable fluorogenic peptide substrate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. The concentration of the fluorogenic peptides was determined by measuring their absorbance at 357 nm and by determining the total fluorescence change by complete hydrolysis with trypsin (11.Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Pyrek J.S. Harms A.C. Juliano L. Hersh L.B Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were calculated using the computer programs of Cleland (15.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). To assess the subsite specificity of rat nardilysin, we utilized a series of fluorogenic peptides containing the sequence Abz-GGX 1 X 2RKX 3GQ-EDDnp. Residues at positions X 1,X 2, and X 3 were varied to study effects at the P3, P2, and P2′ positions, respectively. 2The first arginine or lysine in the peptide sequence is designated the P1 residue and the second arginine or lysine as the P1′ residue. In most cases this conforms to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (16.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar), however in some peptides either there are multiple cleavage sites or the cleavage site is shifted. Previous studies showed that a P3′ residue was not required for substrate hydrolysis (10.Csuhai E. Safavi A. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12411-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); therefore, amino acid substitutions at this position were not studied. Since the bovine adrenal medulla peptide analog Abz-GGFLRRVGQ-EDDnp has been found to be a good substrate for the enzyme (10.Csuhai E. Safavi A. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12411-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) we used phenylalanine as the nonvaried P3residue, leucine as the nonvaried P2 residue, and valine as the nonvaried P2′ residue. The effect of varying the amino acid at the P2 position on the kinetics of the nardilysin reaction is shown in TableI. With the exception of a P2aspartate, the enzyme accepts a variety of amino acids at this position. In terms of K m, there is little variation (∼3-fold) among the different amino acids at the P2position. On the other hand, there is an ∼20-fold variation ink cat. The amino acids at the P2position can be grouped on the basis of their influence onk cat. Histidine and methionine are the preferred P2 residues, while the hydrophobic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and leucine constitute a group that produces reasonably good substrates. The next group contains isoleucine, alanine, asparagine, and tryptophan, which are ∼ 16 to 110 as reactive as histidine, and finally valine and serine, which exhibit ∼ 120 the reactivity of a P2histidine.Table IEffect of variable P2 residues on the kinetics of hydrolysis of the peptide series Abz-GGFXRKVGQ-EDDnpXk catK mk cat/K mPercentage cleaved at X ↓ R : R ↓ Kmin −1μmm −1 min −1 × 10 −7%His413.3 ± 15.34.4 ± 0.39.4 ± 0.39100:0Met291.6 ± 6.77.2 ± 0.34.1 ± 0.08 29:71Phe169.6 ± 15.39.4 ± 1.01.8 ± 0.11100:0Tyr155.6 ± 10.79.4 ± 1.01.7 ± 0.08100:0Leu148.7 ± 2.56.5 ± 0.52.3 ± 0.05 23:77Ile72.9 ± 5.86.2 ± 0.81.2 ± 0.060:100Ala64.5 ± 4.96.1 ± 0.81.1 ± 0.06 65:35Asn64.7 ± 1.43.0 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.07100:0Trp42.3 ± 2.05.3 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.04100:0Val24.6 ± 0.99.5 ± 0.60.3 ± 0.010:100Ser21.2 ± 1.04.0 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.03 76:24Asp<0.5>20Kinetic constants are reported along with their S.E. values.

This reflects the fact that the major difference among the P2 residues is reflected ink cat, with little variation inK m. There is a slight decrease ink cat/K m relative tok cat alone, seen with the hydrophobic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and leucine. This is the result of the slightly higher K m values seen with this group of P2 residues. Nardilysin has been shown to cleave between paired dibasic residues as well as on the amino side of an arginine as the first basic residue in a dibasic pair (8.Chesneau V. Pierotti A.R. Barré N. Créminon C. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2056-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Csuhai E. Safavi A. Hersh L.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12411-12419Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the cleavage site for each of the variable P2 residues. Reverse phase HPLC on a C4 column was used to separate and quantitate products, while mass spectrometry was used to identify products. As noted in Table I and illustrated in Fig. 1, the P2 residue has a significant influence on the site of cleavage. When histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, asparagine, or tryptophan occupy the P2 position, cleavage occurs exclusively on the amino side of arginine, which is the first basic residue of the dibasic pair (X↓RK). In contrast, with isoleucine or valine at the P2 position, cleavage occurs exclusively at the RK bond (XR↓K). When methionine and leucine occupied the P2 position, 20–30% of the cleavage occurred on the amino side of the arginine residue, and 70–80% of the cleavage occurred between the dibasic pair. When alanine and serine occupied the P2 position, the situation was reversed. In this case, 65–70% of the cleavage occurred on the amino side of the arginine, and 30–35% of the cleavage occurred between the dibasic pair. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 with a P2 tyrosine, leucine, and alanine. Thus, there is a rather significant influence of the P2 residue on both the rate of cleavage and the site of cleavage. However, there is no apparent correlation between the rate of cleavage and the site of cleavage. The effect of the P2′ residue on the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis was next examined with the results given in TableII. As with the P2 residues, different amino acids at the P2′ position have only small effects on K m but do affectk cat. Again histidine was the preferred P2′ amino acid, although in this case the P2′ histidine-containing substrate was cleaved almost 2.5 times faster than the substrate containing a P2′ tryptophan, the second most reactive P2′ residue. The P2′ residues were not as easily grouped as the P2 residues. TheK m values exhibited by the different P2′ residues varied just over a 2-fold range, while, with the exception of aspartate, k cat varied ∼8-fold. Some residues that were found to produce less reactive substrates when in the P2 position, such as tryptophan and serine, were among the P2′ residues producing substrates exhibiting highk cat values. Aspartate, which was not tolerated as a P2 residue, produced a poor yet reactive substrate as a P2′ residue. As seen with the variable P2residues, the values ofk cat/K m parallelk cat.Table IIEffect of variable P2′ residues on the kinetics of hydrolysis of the peptide series Abz-GGFLRKXGQ-EDDnpXk catK mk cat/K mPercentage cleaved at X ↓ R : R ↓ Kmin −1μmm −1 min −1 × 10 −7%His821.5 ± 45.54.8 ± 0.517.0 ± 0.910:90Trp336.8 ± 13.15.5 ± 0.46.1 ± 0.213:87Ser278.8 ± 15.210.1 ± 0.82.8 ± 0.125:75Phe176.1 ± 6.76.6 ± 0.42.7 ± 0.117:83Met166.2 ± 8.77.5 ± 0.72.2 ± 0.114:86Val148.7 ± 2.05.7 ± 0.52.6 ± 0.123:77Ala122.3 ± 5.710.0 ± 0.71.2 ± 0.0425:75Ile106.9 ± 1.95.1 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.0419:81Leu104.6 ± 3.14.9 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.0626:74Asn95.4 ± 6.59.7 ± 1.10.98 ± 0.0424:76Asp14.4 ± 0.711.0 ± 0.90.13 ± 0.0123:77Kinetic constants are reported along with their S.E. values. Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants are reported along with their S.E. values. We also examined the effect of the P2′ residue on the site of cleavage of the substrate. As noted above, the presence of a P2 leucine residue produced 77% cleavage of the Arg–Lys bond and 23% cleavage of the Leu–Arg bond. Most of the P2′ residues had little influence on this cleavage pattern with a few notable exceptions. With a P2′ histidine, 90% of the cleavage occurred at the Arg–Lys bond, and with a P2′ tryptophan 87% of the cleavage occurred at this site. We also examined the effect of the P3 position on the kinetics of the reaction. As with variable residues in the P2 and P2′ positions, with the exception of glutamate and aspartate, the residue occupying the P3position has little influence on the substrate K m(Table III). The specificity at the P3 position seemed almost the opposite of that of the P2 position, with a P3 serine and methionine producing the most reactive substrates and a P3phenylalanine and tyrosine among the least reactive substrates. The amino acids occupying the P3 position had about the same effect as the P2′ residues on k cat, showing a variation of ∼9-fold. The specificity constantk cat/K m followedk cat values as noted with the variable P2 and P′2 residues. A number of P3residues influenced the cleavage site, with serine, tyrosine, and asparagine favoring cleavage at the Arg–Lys bond and methionine, leucine, and isoleucine favoring cleavage at the Leu–Arg bond.Table IIIEffect of variable P3 residues on the kinetics of hydrolysis of the peptide Abz-GGXLRKVGQ-EDDnpXk catK mk cat/K mPercentage cleaved at X ↓ R : R ↓ Kmin −1μmm −1 min −1 × 10 −7Ser512.4 ± 41.46.5 ± 0.87.9 ± 0.384:96Met470.6 ± 19.76.7 ± 0.57.0 ± 0.2181:19Leu350.0 ± 31.19.1 ± 1.13.9 ± 0.1573:27Trp297.2 ± 11.98.0 ± 0.53.7 ± 0.7518:82Ile290.2 ± 22.96.4 ± 0.74.5 ± 0.1956:44His261.4 ± 22.95.7 ± 0.74.6 ± 0.1826:74Ala232.9 ± 25.57.4 ± 1.23.2 ± 0.1824:76Val194.6 ± 20.09.2 ± 1.32.1 ± 0.1019:81Phe148.7 ± 2.56.5 ± 0.52.3 ± 0.0523:77Tyr111.0 ± 7.69.2 ± 0.91.2 ± 0.44 2:98Asn57.2 ± 3.65.4 ± 0.61.1 ± 0.0523:77Glu<5.5>8Asp<2.0>10Kinetic constants are reported along with their S.E. values. Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants are reported along with their S.E. values. Further analysis of the data in Tables I and II permits an assignment of the rate-limiting step of the nardilysin reaction with the synthetic peptides to be the actual bond-breaking step. The nardilysin reaction follows Scheme 1, in which a single substrate is converted to two products. The rate-determining step of the reaction could be the bond-breaking step (k 3), the dissociation of the first product P (k 5), or the dissociation of the second product Q (k 7). We can arbitrarily assign the product derived from the C-terminal or EEDnp-containing part of the substrate as P and the product derived from the N-terminal or Abz-containing part of the substrate as Q. The data in Table I show that different k cat values are obtained when identical products (RKVGQ-EDDnp or KVGQ-EDDnp) are formed from substrates containing variable P2 residues. If the release of the product P (k 5 in Scheme 1) were rate-limiting, all of these substrates would exhibit the samek cat. Similarly, as seen in Table II, substrates that release the common products Abz-GGFLR or Abz-GGFL show variablek cat values. Therefore, release of the product Q (k 7 in Scheme 1) cannot be rate-limiting. The data are thus consistent with the cleavage step (k 3) being the rate-determining step. From the rate equation for a kinetic mechanism involving a single substrate yielding two products, k cat is defined ask 3 k 5 k 7/(k 5 k 7+ k 4 k 7 +k 3 k 7 +k 3 k 5)/Et. If the bond-breaking step (k 3) is rate-limiting,k cat reduces to k 3/Et. Similarly, K m, which is defined ask 7(k 3 k 5+ k 2 k 5 +k 2 k 4)/k 1(k 5 k 7+ k 4 k 7 +k 3 k 7 +k 3 k 5), becomesk 2/k 1, the true dissociation constant K d, whenk 3 is rate-limiting. E ⇄k2k1 [S] ESk7⇅k8 [Q]k4⇅k3 EQ ⇆k6 [P]k5 EPQ Scheme 1Since histidine residues appear to be the best P2 and P2′ residues, we synthesized the potential “ideal” substrate Abz-GGFHRRHGQ-EDDnp and measured its kinetics. This substrate yielded a K m of 2.2 μm,k cat of 455 min−1, and a k cat/K m of 20.7 × 107 min−1m−1. This substrate is similar in reactivity to substrates containing either a P2 or P2′ histidine residue. Abz-GGFHRRHGQ-EDDnp has the potential to carry two additional positive charges at acidic pH. The pK a values of these two histidines were determined to be ∼6.1 and 6.6 by electrometric titration. It was of interest to measure the pH dependence of the cleavage of Abz-GGFHRRHGQ-EDDnp compared with a substrate with nonionizable P2 and P2′ residues, namely Abz-GGFLRRVGQ-EDDnp. As shown in Fig.2, the K m for hydrolysis of Abz-GGFHRRHGQ-EDDnp increased with increasing pH between pH 6.5 and 7.0 and then remained essentially unchanged. We could not go lower than pH 6.5 due to irreversible inactivation of the enzyme (7.Csuhai E. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Hersh L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The curve shows a pK a of ∼7 and a slope of −1.9. This pK a reflects the ionization of the histidine in the enzyme substrate complex. The observation that theK m for Abz-GGFHRRHGQ-EDDnp leveled off at alkaline pH to a value of ∼2.5 μm provides an estimate of theK m for the substrate when both the P2and P2′ histidines are in their free base form. It can be estimated from the data in Fig. 2 that the diprotonated form of the substrate bound approximately 70 times better than the free base form. In order to verify these findings, we measured the pH dependence for the hydrolysis of Abz-GGFH(Me)2RRH(Me)2GQ-EDDnp in which N,N-dimethylhistidine, which carries a permanent positive charge, was substituted for each of the two histidines. As shown in Fig. 2, the K m of the hydrolysis of the peptide containing the dimethylhistidines was essentially constant over the pH range studied and exhibited approximately the same K m as Abz-GGFHRRHGQ-EDDnp at pH 6.5. The K m for the substrate Abz-GGFLRRVGQ-EDDnp with nonionizable P2 and P2′ residues was essentially pH-independent over the same pH range (Fig. 2). Although not shown, the pH dependence of V max for substrates containing ionizable and nonionizable amino acids was essentially the same. We also examined the pH dependence for substrates containing either a P2 or a P2′ histidine. The pH dependence ofK m with these substrates was similar to the pH dependence with the substrates containing histidine in both the P2 and P2′ positions, except the slope of the lines decreased to −0.94 for a P2 histidine and −0.90 for a P2′ histidine. This is shown in Fig.3 A for a P2histidine and in Fig. 3 B for a P2′ histidine. With these substrates, the pK a of the histidine in the enzyme-substrate complex was also ∼7. It can be estimated that the protonated forms of these substrates bound ∼10-fold better than the free base form. As shown in Fig. 3, the pH dependence for the parent substrate containing nonionizable P2 and P2′ residues was pH-independent. Interestingly, although the corresponding substrates containing a single dimethylhistidine exhibited the expected pH-independent profile, the positively charged dimethylhistidine exhibited a K m value that was intermediate between the free base form and the protonated histidine-containing peptides (Fig. 3). In order to determine whether the presence of a protonated histidine at the P2 and/or P2′ position would influence the site of cleavage, we examined the products formed at pH 6.5 and pH 8.0 by reverse phase HPLC. At pH 6.5, the substrate Abz-GGFHRRHGQ-EDDnp is cleaved both at the amino side of the dibasic pair (His–Arg bond) as well as between the dibasic pair (Arg–Arg bond), Fig.4. Based on the area of the product peaks, it can be estimated that both sites are cleaved at approximately the same rate at pH 6.5. At pH 8.0, cleavage at the Arg–Arg bond increases to 66% cleavage. We found that the site of cleavage of the nonionizable substrate Abz-GGFLRRVGQ-EDDnp did not change between pH 6.5 and pH 8. With a permanent positive charge at both the P2 and P2′ positions, three cleavage sites were observed: between the His(Me)2–Arg bond, between the Arg–Arg bond, and between the Arg–His(Me)2 bond. We also examined the effect of pH on the cleavage site for the substrates containing a single histidine at either the P2or the P2′ site. As noted in Table I, at pH 7 when histidine occupies the P2 position, cleavage occurs on the amino side of the first arginine residue in the dibasic pair. We found that this pattern did not change when cleavage was conducted at pH 6.5 or at pH 8.0. With a P2′ histidine, there was also no effect of pH on the site of cleavage. Thus, protonation of the histidine per se does not influence the cleavage site. With a dimethylhistidine in the P2 position, cleavage occurred on the amino side of the first arginine residue of the dibasic pair, similar to what was observed with a His in this position. However, a dimethylhistidine in the P2′ position produced cleavage on the amino side of the dibasic pair (∼20% of total cleavage), between the dibasic pair (∼50% of total cleavage), and on the carboxyl side of the dibasic pair (∼30% of total cleavage). This last cleavage suggests that dimethylhistidine was recognized as a basic residue. We utilized the synthetic fluorogenic substrates to determine ifN-arginine dibasic convertase is truly an arginine-specific enzyme. We thus compared the reactivity of substrates containing arginine or lysine at the P1′ or P1 position, while at the same time looking at the influence of the P2residue. We used P2 residues that appeared to favor cleavage between the dibasic pair (isoleucine), on the amino side of the dibasic pair (tyrosine) or produced a mixture of these two cleavages (leucine). As shown in TableIV, varying the dibasic pair has little effect on K m regardless of the P2residue. On the other hand, there are noticeable effects of the P1′ and P1 basic residues onk cat,k cat/K m, and the cleavage site, and these are dependent on the P2 residue. With a P2 leucine, the enzyme exhibits the highestk cat values with arginine at the P1′ site but exhibits a similar reactivity with either arginine or lysine at the P1 site. As shown in Fig.5 and summarized in Table IV, cleavage between the dibasic pair represents the major route of hydrolysis. However, cleavage on the amino side of the dibasic pair is seen with arginine occupying the P1 position. When tyrosine occupies the P2 position, a P1 arginine produces the highest k cat values. Although cleavage is favored on the amino side of the first basic residue of the dibasic pair, the presence of a P1′ arginine produces significant cleavage between the dibasic pair. When isoleucine is in the P2 position, higher k cat values are obtained with a P1′ arginine. However, regardless of the P1′ or P1 basic residue, cleavage occurs exclusively between the dibasic pair.Table IVEffect of P1P1 basic residues on the kinetics of hydrolysis and the cleavage of Abz-GGFXP1P1 ′VGQ-EDDnpX = L P1P1′ =k catK mk cat/K mPercentage cleaved at L↓P1↓P1′min −1μmm −1 min −1 × 10 −7Arg-Arg594.9 ± 34.63.6 ± 0.316.5 ± 0.597:93Lys-Arg585.2 ± 32.85.1 ± 0.411.5 ± 0.351:99Arg-Lys148.7 ± 2.56.5 ± 0.53.2 ± 0.0523:77Lys-Lys129.8 ± 5.47.3 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.065:95X = Y P1P1′ =k catK mk cat/K mPercentage cleaved at Y↓P1↓P1′min −1μmm −1 min −1 × 10 −7Arg-Lys157.5 ± 6.88.3 ± 0.71.9 ± 0.07100:0Arg-Arg113.9 ± 2.72.6 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.1665:35Lys-Arg24.3 ± 0.333.0 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.0164:36Lys-Lys11.2 ± 0.283.9 ± 0.40.3 ± 0.01100:0X = I P1P1′ =k catK mk cat/K mPercentage cleaved at I↓P1↓P1′min −1μmm −1 min −1 × 10 −7Arg-Arg943.8 ± 10.83.3 ± 0.128.4 ± 0.530:100Lys-Arg725.4 ± 32.47.4 ± 0.69.8 ± 0.290:100Arg-Lys73.6 ± 3.07.2 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.030:100Lys-Lys11.9 ± 0.77.5 ± 0.80.2 ± 0.010:100Kinetic constants are reported along with their S.E. values.

Pierotti A.R. Barré N. Créminon C. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2056-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to examine the effects of varying residues in the P3, P2, and P2′ positions on the kinetics of cleavage as well as the on site of cleavage. The amino acid in the S2 subsite seems to have the greatest influence on both k cat and the site of cleavage, with little effect on K m. Residues in the S2′ subsite generally exhibit smaller effects onk cat, have little effect onK m, and with a few exceptions have little influence on the site of cleavage. The same can be said for residues in the S3 subsite, except that these have a greater influence on the cleavage site. As noted above, the kinetic K mappears to reflect the true affinity of the enzyme for its peptide substrate, while k cat reflects the rate of peptide bond cleavage. There is a general lack of variance ofK m with different amino acids at the P3, P2, and P2′ positions but a significant variance of k cat dependent on the particular amino acid in these positions. This may be explained by the use of the binding energy derived from substrate-enzyme subsite interactions for catalysis. Thus, binding interactions at each subsite contribute to catalysis. Within the P2 position, the presence of the aromatic amino acids, histidine, or asparagine favors cleavage on the amino side of the arginine residue, which is the first basic residue of the dibasic pair. In contrast, the bulky aliphatic amino acids valine and isoleucine induce cleavage exclusively between the dibasic pair. Other P2 residues produce partial effects. The small aliphatic side chains of alanine and serine cause a more favorable cleavage at the amino side of arginine, while the larger methionine and leucine tend to favor cleavage between the paired basic residues. Since the mechanism of bond cleavage is considered to be independent of the residues within the peptide substrate, the positioning of the substrate relative to the catalytic site will determine which bonds are broken. Two mechanisms can therefore be envisioned that account for changes in the bond being cleaved dependent on residues in the putative P2 position. In the first mechanism, the residues of the substrate interact with enzyme subsites in a variable manner. For example, aromatic amino acids fit into the S1 subsite rather than the expected S2 subsite, causing the first basic residue of the dibasic pair to occupy the S1′ subsite. The second basic residue of the dibasic pair becomes relatively unimportant, since it becomes a P2′ residue. Different amino acids in the P2 position of the substrate can bind in this mode to varying degrees and can also bind in a more “normal” manner whereby the basic residues in the dibasic pair occupy the S1 and S1′ subsites. It would appear that the rate of substrate cleavage is not significantly influenced by the mode of binding. Substrates that, according to this postulate, bind with the nonbasic residue in the S1 subsite show a wide range of k cat values. They vary from among the highest k cat values for His- and Phe-containing substrates to among the lowest for the Trp-containing substrate. Evidence that favors this hypothesis comes from the recent observation that nardilysin cleaves β-endorphin 1–31 at a single basic residue between a Phe18–Lys19 bond within the sequence Leu17-Phe18-Lys19-Asn20. 3O. Oakley and L. B. Hersh, manuscript in preparation. Camargo et al. (17.Camargo A.C.M. Gomes M.D. Reichl A.P. Ferro E.S. Jacchieri S. Hirata I.Y. Juliano L. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) noted a shift in the cleavage site of peptides by thimet oligopeptidase (endopeptidase 24.15) dependent on which residue occupied a C-terminal position. They favored a similar mechanism involving two distinct modes of substrate binding. An alternative explanation is that the binding of aromatic amino acids, histidine, or asparagine within the enzyme subsites is the same as with any other substrate. However, these residues distort the active site in such a way as to place catalytic residues in a conformation that favors cleavage on the amino side of the first basic residue in the dibasic pair. When His or Trp occupy the P2′ position of the substrate, cleavage between the dibasic pair is favored, and the highestk cat values among the variable P2′ residues are observed. This would suggest that these two amino acids produce the most favorable interactions within the S2′ subsite. The presence of a His as either the P2 or P2′ residue produces high k cat values and favors cleavage on the amino side of the arginine residue of the dibasic pair. Protonation of the His at either position increases the affinity more than 10-fold, with no effect on k cat. However, the protonated His does not appear to be recognized as a “basic residue,” since the cleavage site does not change between a protonated His and a free base His. This can be contrasted to the presence of N,N-dimethylhistidine as the P2′ residue in which it appears this residue was recognized as a basic residue. We also determined the influence of arginine versus lysine as the P1 or P1′ residue. Regardless of the P2 residue, higher k cat values were always obtained when cleavage occurred on the amino side of an arginine residue. This was seen regardless of whether cleavage occurred between the dibasic pair or on the amino side of the first basic residue of the dibasic pair. In terms of the actual cleavage site, there appear to be two forces at work. On the one hand, the P2 residue influences whether cleavage occurs between the dibasic pair or on the amino side of the first basic residue of the dibasic pair. On the other hand, the enzyme exhibits a preference for cleavage on the amino side of arginine. The relative contribution of these two forces determines at which site a substrate is cleaved and can produce multiple cleavage sites within the same substrate. In summary, the cleavage of peptide substrates by nardilysin is influenced not only by the presence of a dibasic pair but also by residues occupying adjacent subsites on the enzyme. The elucidation of a number of these effects provides the first step toward understanding the complex cleavage pattern of this and similar peptidases. We thank Dr. W. W. Cleland for helpful discussions of the kinetic data."
https://openalex.org/W2034368061,"DNA topoisomerase II is an essential nuclear enzyme for proliferation of eukaryotic cells and plays important roles in many aspects of DNA processes. In this report, we have demonstrated that the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIα, as measured by decatenation of kinetoplast DNA and by relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA, was stimulated ∼2−3-fold by the tumor suppressor p53 protein. In order to determine the mechanism by which p53 activates the enzyme, the effects of p53 on the topoisomerase IIα-mediated DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium were assessed using the prototypical topoisomerase II poison, etoposide. p53 had no effect on the ability of the enzyme to make double-stranded DNA break and religate linear DNA, indicating that the stimulation of the enzyme catalytic activity by p53 was not due to alteration in the formation of covalent cleavable complexes formed between topoisomerase IIα and DNA. The effects of p53 on the catalytic inhibition of topoisomerase IIα were examined using a specific catalytic inhibitor, ICRF-193, which blocks the ATP hydrolysis step of the enzyme catalytic cycle. Clearly manifested in decatenation and relaxation assays, p53 reduced the catalytic inhibition of topoisomerase IIα by ICRF-193. ATP hydrolysis assays revealed that the ATPase activity of topoisomerase IIα was specifically enhanced by p53. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that p53 physically interacts with topoisomerase IIα to form molecular complexes without a double-stranded DNA intermediary in vitro. To investigate whether p53 stimulates the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II in vivo, we expressed wild-type and mutant p53 in Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells lacking functional p53. Wild-type, but not mutant, p53 stimulated topoisomerase II activity in nuclear extract from these transfected cells. Our data propose a new role for p53 to modulate the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIα. Taken together, we suggest that the p53-mediated response of the cell cycle to DNA damage may involve activation of topoisomerase IIα.

During this cycle, the enzyme covalently binds to DNA forming an intermediate called topoisomerase II-DNA covalent cleavable complex (1.Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Topoisomerase II is the intracellular target for a variety of active agents currently used in the treatment of human cancers (1.Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

By stabilizing the covalent enzyme-associated DNA complexes, these drugs shift the DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of the enzyme reaction toward the cleavage state. These drugs are able to convert biological intermediate in topoisomerase II activity into a lethal one ultimately leading to cell death and thus act as cellular poisons (1.Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu.

Since the cellular level of topoisomerase II in proliferating cells is higher than that of quiescent cells, these deleterious aspects of the enzyme confer selective sensitivity of proliferative tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of these drugs (1.Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 13.Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res.

Unlike the topoisomerase II poisons, catalytic inhibitors have been reported to inhibit topoisomerase II activity without significantly stabilizing cleavable complexes. These drugs inhibit DNA topoisomerase II activity at a step prior to the formation of the cleavable complex and thus act as antagonists of DNA topoisomerase II poisons (17.Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A.

Such catalytic inhibition may also play a role in the cytotoxicity and anticancer activity of DNA topoisomerase II poisons. Agents identified as poisons and/or catalytic inhibitors have proven to be useful in understanding the mechanisms of the topoisomerase II-catalyzed reactions in addition to their clinical use in cancer chemotherapy. There are two closely related isoforms of human topoisomerase II that have been designated as topoisomerase IIα and IIβ, which are encoded by genes located on chromosome 17 and 3, respectively (21.Chung T.D.Y. Drake F.H. Tan K.B. Per S.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9431-9435Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 22.Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L.

Crooke S.T. Mao J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar). These isoforms exist as homodimers, and their amino acid sequences show homology at regions believed to be functionally significant. Topoisomerase IIα and IIβ isoforms differ in important biochemical and pharmacological properties including sensitivity to topoisomerase II-targeting drugs, thermal stability, cellular localization, and cell cycle regulation (24.Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This suggests that their roles in the cell may not be the same. Consistent with a cell division-specific role, the expression of topoisomerase IIα gene is associated with the proliferation status of cells. The level of topoisomerase IIα protein is very low in G1 phase, increases in S phase, and is maximal in G2/M phase, whereas the level of topoisomerase IIβ remains relatively constant throughout the cell cycle (25.Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that expression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53 is able to decrease substantially the activity of the topoisomerase IIα gene promoter (26.Sandri M.I. Isaacs R.J. Ongkeko W.M. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. Broggini M. Vikhanskaya F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4464-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27.Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of wild-type p53 may reduce normal regulatory suppression of topoisomerase IIα gene expression, resulting in accelerated cell proliferation, chromosomal rearrangements, and gene amplification seen in tumor cells. These data suggest that topoisomerase IIα is one of the downstream targets for p53-dependent regulation of cell cycle progression. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that functions as a negative regulator of cell proliferation (28.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 29.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). Inactivation of p53 by a deletion or mutation in the p53 gene or by the selective interaction with certain viral or cellular proteins leads to a selective growth advantage, resulting in tumor progression and therefore is strongly correlated with human cancer (30.Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 31.Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). Although wild-type p53 protein acts as a transcriptional activator of a number of downstream effector genes containing p53-binding sites (32.Farmer G. Bargonetti J. Zhu H. Friedman P. Prywes R. Prives C. Nature. 1992; 358: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 33.Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Genotoxic lesions leading to DNA strand breaks result in a rapid increase of p53 protein levels (38.Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Depending on cell type, the microenvironment of a cell, and p53 levels, the induction of wild-type, but not mutant, p53 might lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (28.Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 29.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). p53-induced cell cycle arrest at the G1phase has been associated with increased expression ofp21/WAF1/CIP1 gene, which encodes a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (39.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). It has been also reported that expression of p53 has been associated with growth arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (41.Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 42.Steward N. Hicks G.G. Paraskevas F. Mowat M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies on mammalian cells using topoisomerase II inhibitors that do not stabilize covalent cleavable complexes have shown that topoisomerase II is required for complete chromosome condensation and for entry into mitosis (43.Downes C.S. Clarke D.J. Mullinger A.M. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Creighton A.M. Johnson R.T. Science. 1994; 372: 467-470Google Scholar, 44.Anderson H. Roberge M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 83-90PubMed Google Scholar). These results also suggest that exit from G2 phase is regulated by the catenation-sensitive checkpoint, which is modulated through a system different from the DNA damage-sensitive checkpoint (43.Downes C.S. Clarke D.J. Mullinger A.M. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Creighton A.M. Johnson R.T. Science. 1994; 372: 467-470Google Scholar). However, since p53 inhibits topoisomerase IIα gene expression (27.Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the p53-induced G2 arrest could be linked to the topoisomerase IIα-dependent G2 arrest. In this study, we have demonstrated that p53 stimulates the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIα in vitro and in vivo. The results presented indicate that p53 modulates the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIα by specifically enhancing the rate of the enzyme-mediated ATP hydrolysis. Our data suggest that the p53-mediated response of cell cycle to DNA damage may, at least in part, involve activation of topoisomerase IIα. Purified human topoisomerase IIα, and kinetoplast DNA (k-DNA),1were obtained from Topogen, Inc. Etoposide was purchased from Sigma. ICRF-193 was a generous gift from Dr. R. Ishida, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan. Supercoiled plasmid DNA was purified using standard methods. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega. Radioactive nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Full-length human p53 cDNA was cloned into theBamHI and SalI sites of pGEX-5X-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein GST-p53 was expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α cells by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. GST protein itself was produced from bacteria carrying an empty pGEX-5X-3 vector. To generate polyhistidine-tagged proteins, full-length p53 cDNA was ligated into pQE32 vector (Qiagen), in-frame with a 6× polyhistidine amino-terminal tag. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli M15 cells by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified using nickel-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The final protein preparation was dialyzed against TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol), and stored at −80 °C. Topoisomerase II activity was assayed either by the ATP-dependent decatenation of k-DNA or relaxation of negatively supercoiled pBluescript in the presence or absence of recombinant p53. The decatenation reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 120 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 0.2 μg of k-DNA and the indicated amounts of topoisomerase IIα. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5% Sarcosyl, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 25% glycerol, and the products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Enzyme activity is expressed in units, where 1 unit is defined as amount of the enzyme required to fully decatenate 0.2 μg of k-DNA in 15 min at 37 °C. The relaxation reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl of assay buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mmKCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 0.2 μg of negatively supercoiled pBluescript, and the indicated amounts of topoisomerase IIα. The reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of 10% SDS. DNA samples were then analyzed on a 1.2% native agarose gel. The amounts of DNA products were quantified by densitometric analysis using the Eagle Eye II imaging system (Stratagene). Topoisomerase II cleavage reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl of cleavage buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm ATP, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 0.2 μg of negatively supercoiled pBluescript and 50 μmetoposide in the presence or absence of recombinant p53. The reactions were initiated by adding the indicated amounts of topoisomerase IIα. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the cleavage complexes were trapped by addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS followed by topoisomerase II digestion with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 45 °C. The reaction products were purified with phenol/chloroform extraction and electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. For mapping cleavage sites, topoisomerase II cleavage reactions were performed on a whole plasmid DNA, linearized withHindIII, and run into a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The DNA was transferred onto nylon membrane and hybridized with 32P-labeledHindIII-PvuII fragment and autoradiographed. Topoisomerase II religation reactions were performed in a total volume of 120 μl of cleavage buffer containing 1.2 μg of negatively supercoiled pBluescript, 12 units of purified topoisomerase IIα, 50 μm etoposide, and GST or GST-p53. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the enzyme-mediated religation was induced by shifting the temperature from 37 to 65 °C. Aliquotes (20 μl) were withdrawn at various times and stopped by addition of SDS to 1%. Following topoisomerase II digestion with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 45 °C, the products were phenol/chloroform extracted and electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The amounts of DNA products were quantified by densitometric analysis. ATPase assays were performed in a total volume of 20 μl of relaxation assay buffer containing 0.3 μg of negatively supercoiled pBluescript, 2 units of topoisomerase IIα, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi/reaction), and 0 or 300 nm polyhistidine-tagged p53. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at various intervals up to 30 min and quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 50 mm EDTA and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate to each reaction. Each quenched sample (1 μl) was chromatographed in triplicate on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck). Plates were developed by chromatography in fleshly made 400 mm NH4HCO3. The dried plates were exposed to imaging plates, and the exposed screens were scanned using a Bio-Imaging analyzer (Fuji, BAS-2500). The concentration of ATP hydrolyzed was determined by dividing the free inorganic phosphate counts by the total number of counts per lane and multiplying that fraction by the starting ATP concentration. Forty units of purified topoisomerase IIα were mixed with 1.8 μm GST or GST-p53 in a total volume of 600 μl of assay buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 8 mmMgCl2, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min on ice. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h on ice in the presence of a monoclonal antibody against p53, Pab1801, or Pab240 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), under gentle agitation. 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, were added to the mixtures and further incubated on ice for 1 h under gentle agitation. Protein G-Sepharose was sedimented, washed three times, and resuspended in a 20 μl of assay buffer. The presence of topoisomerase IIα in the immunoprecipitated complexes was determined by immunoblot analysis. The supernatants and immunoprecipitants (20 μl each) were electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Topoisomerase IIα was detected with an antibody against human topoisomerase IIα (Topogen, Inc.). The human p53 expression plasmids and the empty vector used in this study have been described previously (30.Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). All of the p53 constitutive expression constructs were produced with a cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer expression vector. The Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) as described previously (45.Kim J.C. Yoon J.B. Koo H.S. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26130-26137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 Saos-2 cells were transfected with 5 μg of p53 expression plasmids. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized from the plate, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 4 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer, and the nuclear proteins were extracted as described previously (46.Son Y.S. Suh J.M. Ahn S.H. Kim J.C. Yi J.Y. Hur K.C. Hong W.S. Muller M.T. Chung I.K. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. In order to determine the effects of p53 on the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIα, we assayed enzyme activity by the decatenation of k-DNA in the presence of GST-p53 fusion protein. The experiment shown in Fig. 1 Areveals the effect of increasing amounts of topoisomerase IIα on enzyme-catalyzed DNA decatenation in the presence or absence of GST-p53. The amounts of decatenated k-DNA products rose proportionally with the enzyme levels. Decatenation activity was ∼2−3-fold higher in the presence of GST-p53 than in the absence of GST-p53 as determined by comparison of the band intensities of the decatenated k-DNA molecules in several enzyme dilutions. For further comparison of the stimulatory effect of GST-p53, k-DNA was incubated with topoisomerase IIα at a concentration where approximately 50% of catenated k-DNA molecules were converted to decatenated molecules in the absence of GST-p53 (Fig. 1 B). A gradual decrease in amounts of trapped catenated k-DNA in the well and the appearance of decatenated k-DNA bands were observed by increasing the concentration of GST-p53. In order to determine whether the stimulatory effect of GST-p53 is attributed to p53, catenated k-DNA was mixed with topoisomerase IIα at a concentration selected to give a detectable amount of decatenated k-DNA. After incubation for 16 min, a full decatenation activity was detected by addition of GST-p53 (Fig. 1 C), whereas only a partial increase in amount of decatenated k-DNA was observed by addition of either GST or buffer. Since inactivation of p53 by a mutation in the p53 gene results in tumor progression, we investigated the effects of mutant p53 proteins on the decatenation activity of topoisomerase IIα. When equal amounts of topoisomerase IIα were treated with mutant p53-22/23 containing a double amino acid mutation, decatenation activity was not significantly altered as compared with wild-type p53 (Fig. 1 D). Similar results were obtained when mutant p53 proteins (p53–248 and p53–273) containing a single amino acid mutation were used for the decatenation reaction (data not shown). When the polyhistidine-tagged p53 produced in bacteria was used in the k-DNA decatenation reactions, the similar stimulatory effects were observed. Furthermore, the polyhistidine-tagged p53 concentrations needed for maximum topoisomerase IIα activation were comparable to those for GST-p53. None of the recombinant p53 proteins decatenated k-DNA in the absence of topoisomerase IIα, indicating that the observed effects were not due to bacterial enzymes copurifying with the p53 proteins. To ensure that the stimulatory effects of p53 were not confined to the decatenation activity of topoisomerase IIα, DNA relaxation assays were performed. Fig. 2 A shows the effects of GST-p53 on increasing amounts of topoisomerase IIα in a supercoiled DNA relaxation assay. When identical amounts of topoisomerase IIα were assayed, the fraction of relaxed DNA was greater in the presence of GST-p53 than in the absence of GST-p53. This was also manifested by a decrease in the supercoiled DNA band intensities. For example, 1 unit of topoisomerase IIα was only minimally active in DNA relaxation in the absence of GST-p53. However, at this enzyme concentration, input supercoiled DNA was fully relaxed in the presence of GST-p53. When increasing amounts of GST-p53 were incubated with a fixed concentration of enzyme, the relaxation activity was also stimulated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). Since the formation of covalent cleavable complexes between topoisomerase II and DNA is one of the crucial steps in enzyme activity, the effects of p53 on the cleavage of s"

Analysis of cystic fibrosis-associated missense mutations in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1), including A455E, S549R, Y563N, and P574H, revealed reduced levels of mature CFTR with elevated levels of carboxyl-terminal polypeptide fragments of 105 and 90 kDa. These fragments appear early in biogenesis and degrade rapidly in four distinct cell types tested including the bronchial epithelial IB3–1 cell line. They were detected at highest levels with CFTRA455E where the 105-kDa fragment accounted for 40% of newly synthesized polypeptide but for only 20 and 7% of nascent wild type and mutant ΔF508 proteins, respectively. The bands represent core- and unglycosylated forms of the same CFTR fragment supporting that precursor forms are correctly inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteolytic cleavage would be predicted to occur on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum within the NBD1-R domain segment, but pharmacological testing did not support involvement of the 26 S proteasome. The examined missense mutations in NBD1 manifest differently than the major mutant, ΔF508, and highlight a critical conformational aspect of biogenesis of CFTR.

The precise defects have not been elucidated for many mutations, but deficiencies can be broadly classified into at least six groups (2.Zielenski J. Tsui L.-C. Annu. Rev.

A multidomain membrane protein, such as CFTR, attains its overall native conformation by co- and post-translational folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (15.Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). These processes have been shown to be inefficient for wild type CFTR (CFTRwt), as only 20–50% of nascent polypeptides mature beyond the ER (16.Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B.

A number of the components of the ER and associated proteins have been implicated in monitoring the production and elimination of misfolded wild type (wt) and mutant CFTR. Prolonged interactions between CFTRΔF508 and two chaperones, Hsp70 and calnexin, have been shown to occur in comparison to wt (20.Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 21.Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has also been demonstrated that Hsp40 and Hsp90 contribute to the folding of CFTR (22.Loo M. Jensen T. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Riordan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 23.Meacham G. Lu Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson T. Cyr D.M.

Whether the interactions of these molecular chaperones prevent the removal of specific forms of incompletely folded polypeptides or help to promote degradation is not known, although it was noted that interruption of Hsp90 binding seems to lead to accelerated degradation of both the wt and ΔF508 forms (22.Loo M. Jensen T. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Riordan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Misfolded proteins are commonly targeted for degradation via the lysosomal proteolytic system or the cytoplasmic degradative system involving the proteasome (25.Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 26.Coux O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). Lysosomal degradation does not appear to contribute substantially to the degradation of either core-glycosylated wt or ΔF508 CFTR (16.Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Proteasomal degradation of most proteins is dependent on the covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules and elimination by the 26 S proteolytic complex (for review see Ref. 27.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6818) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibitor sensitivity and the detection of ubiquitin CFTR conjugates has demonstrated that immature wt and ΔF508 CFTR are degraded, at least in part, by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (28.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 29.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R.

Although the observations with the major mutation outline the significance of CFTR maturation and provide an explanation for the absence of mutant protein at the cell surface, many aspects of CFTR biogenesis remain unknown. Further, although many CF mutations show trafficking problems (30.Seibert F.S. Linsdell P. Loo T.W. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

To gain additional insight into the determinants of CFTR expression we have analyzed the production and processing of a series of CF-associated NBD1 missense mutations and have identified a group that show defects that appear distinct from CFTRΔF508. The identified pathway also appears with CFTRwt and thus highlights a mechanism that contributes to the notable inefficiency of CFTR maturation. The CFTR mutants A455E, S549R, P574H, and Y563N were generated from pBQ6.2 (34.Rommens J.M. Dho S. Bear C.E. Kartner N. Kennedy D. Riordan J.R. Tsui L.C. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar) was carried out with the oligonucleotides C1–1Z (5′-ATGACTGTCAAAGATCTCAC) that corresponds to native CFTR sequence and CHArev (5′-CGCGTACGGCCGTTACAAGCTAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCATATGGGTACATAAGCCTTGTATCTTGCAC) to incorporate the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) inframe, prior to the natural stop codon (amino acid 1480) of the CFTR cDNA. All polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were confirmed by sequencing after insertion into recipient vectors. Expression vector (pCMV) constructions and CHA-CFTR mutants were generated by shuttling appropriate restriction fragments between untagged and tagged cDNA versions and confirmed by sequencing or restriction digestion analysis. HEK293, COS-7, and CHO-duk− cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. IB3–1 cells were grown under the same conditions in LHC-8 medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. Subconfluent cells grown in 100-mm plates were transfected according to the SuperFect reagent protocol provided by the manufacturer (Qiagen), using 10 μg of the appropriate CFTR expression plasmid, 250 ng of pCMV β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, and 30 μl of the SuperFect reagent in 3 ml of medium containing FBS. After an 8-h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for an additional 16 h in normal culture medium prior to harvest or as indicated in individual experiments. Transfected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in 2 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor) for 20 min on ice. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed and used for immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipitation. Protein concentrations were determined (Bradford assay; Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard, and the total protein concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/ml. 25 μg of protein were loaded on each gel lane for the Western blots. To assess the amount of RIPA insoluble CFTR, the insoluble remains were resuspended in 90 μl of RIPA (minus SDS) and treated with 100 units of DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 15 min at room temperature followed by incubation in the presence of 1% SDS for 15 min at 55 °C. The SDS concentration was then diluted to 0.1% with RIPA (minus SDS), and any remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Proteins from equal proportions of cells were used in the comparison of the pellets to the supernatants. Endoglycosidase H and N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) digestions were performed as specified by the manufacturer. In brief, 100 μg of total protein was digested with 1000 units of enzyme for 2 h at 37 °C. The deglycosylated protein was then prepared for SDS-PAGE (with 50% reaction loaded per lane) by precipitating with trichloroacetic acid and sodium deoxycholate as described (38.Spector D.L.

Immunoreactive protein was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were carried out essentially as described (21.Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected on 100-mm plates were split 24 h post-transfection onto four 60-mm plates and grown for an additional 24 h. After incubation in methionine- and cysteine-free α-MEM for 30 min at 37 °C, the transfected cells were pulsed in the same medium containing 140 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at 37 °C. After the pulse period, cells were washed twice with growth medium and chased at 37 °C in complete α-Minimal essential media supplemented with 10% FBS for the times indicated. Proteasome inhibitor studies were performed using 50 μmeach of MG-132 and ALLN (Calbiochem) and 10 μmlactacystin (Calbiochem). HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated CFTR expression constructs were preincubated with or without inhibitors for 60 min and metabolically labeled in the presence or absence of the inhibitors as described above. Metabolically labeled CFTR was isolated by immunoprecipitation with M3A7 and L12B4 antibodies as a mixture as described previously (16.Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) or individually. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as above; the gels were then fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% ethanol, soaked for 30 min in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dried. Labeled proteins were visualized by exposing the gels to Kodak BIOMAX MR film at −70 °C for 1–3 days. The radioactivity associated with the immunoprecipitated CFTR bands was quantified using a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). COS-7 cells transfected with CHA-CFTR were split 24 h post-transfection and cultured on 12-mm circular coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100, respectively, for 30-min durations at room temperature. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-BSA) for 30 min, and the cells were subsequently incubated with HA.11 and diluted 1:1000 in PBS-BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS-BSA and incubated with 1:1000 donkey anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS-BSA, once with PBS, and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Indirect immunofluorescence was examined with a Nikon E1000 fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using a CCD camera and IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics). N-Linked oligosaccharide modification of CFTR can be followed by the rapid conversion of the nascent polypeptide (band A) to a core-glycosylated form (band B) with subsequent conversion to a complex-glycosylated mature form (band C) (18.Cheng S.H.

Complex glycosylation reflects the trafficking of core-glycosylated CFTR through thecis-medial-Golgi to the plasma membrane. Band B and the predominant band C forms of CFTRwt are recognized in both heterologous and endogenous expression systems. Many CFTR polypeptides with CF-associated mutations fail to undergo correct processing such that only the core-glycosylated forms are identified (30.Seibert F.S. Linsdell P. Loo T.W. Hanrahan J.W.

To rapidly assay the fate of mutants and analyze their patterns of degradation, a HA epitope for high affinity monoclonal antibodies was introduced into the coding region of CFTR at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1 A). A similarly positioned epitope has been introduced by others to achieve large scale purification of CFTR leading to functional chloride channels in reconstituted systems (43.Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Garami E. Huan L. Hewryk M. Wang Y. Galley K. Bear C. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was used to directly compare the glycosylation states of wt and mutant CFTR versions (Fig. 1 B) to those with the CHA epitope (Fig. 1 C). At steady state, the level of expression of bands B and C in HEK293 cells was comparable for tagged and untagged CFTRwt. Analysis of the S549R mutant showed measurable but intermediate levels of band C, whereas A455E, Y563N, and P574H mutants showed markedly reduced levels using both tagged and untagged CFTR. All mutants were expressed at a high level as revealed by the prominent band B. As expected, both CFTRΔF508 and CHA-ΔF508 failed to be expressed as the complex glycosylated form (18.Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). We also examined the subcellular distribution of the CHA-CFTRs in COS-7 cells using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.2). Predominant levels of CHA-CFTRwt appear at the cell surface, in contrast to CHA-ΔF508 and CHA-A455E, as described in alternate reports with untagged versions (18.Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 44.Ostedgaard L. Zeiher B. Welsh M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2091-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants reside intracellularly, with a reticular, ER-like distribution. Consistent with the observed steady state glycosylation pattern, CHA-S549R shows both cell surface and ER-like staining. These results affirm that wt and mutant CHA-tagged CFTRs reflect the behavior of their untagged counterparts. In addition to full-length CFTR forms, both the M3A7 and the anti-HA antibodies revealed products with relative molecular masses of 105 and 90 kDa that were most prominent in detergent extracts of HEK293 cells expressing the A455E and S549R mutants (Fig. 1, B and C,lanes 4 and 5). These polypeptides were detected at lower steady state levels in cells expressing CFTRwt or CHA-CFTRwt (lanes 2) and were negligible for CFTRΔF508 or CHA-ΔF508 (lanes 3). The placement of the epitope tag establishes that the fragments contain the carboxyl terminus with an apparent molecular mass that would include at least the complete R domain, the second series of transmembrane spanning segments, and the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2) (Fig. 1 A). The results with the monoclonal antibody M3A7 (Fig. 1 B) are consistent with this interpretation as its epitope resides in NBD2 (40.Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Three sets of experiments were designed to confirm that the identified and presumed degradation intermediates do not reflect a peculiar facet of overexpression in HEK293 cells. The first involved an analysis of the extract preparation to examine the compartmentalization of CFTR, the second involved analysis of the intermediates at reduced expression levels with the A455E mutant, and the third involved expression in alternate cell types. CFTRwt is solubilized and can be extracted with RIPA buffer containing a mixture of ionic and non-ionic detergents (16.Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar,21.Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the formation of protein aggregates may differ between mutants (45.Johnston J. Ward C. Kopito R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar), we used a high concentration of SDS to extract the RIPA insoluble polypeptides. Immunoblot analysis indicated that less than 10% of total immunoreactive band B or carboxyl-terminal polypeptides were present in the original CHA-A455E pellet (Fig.3 A). In addition, overexposure of an immunoblot revealed that CHA-CFTRwt and ΔF508 pellets did not contain appreciable levels of either the 105- and 90-kDa bands (Fig.3 B). The occurrence of the 90-kDa band, most prominent with the A455E mutant, does suggest that it is relatively less soluble. A series of parallel transfections were carried out using the standard conditions described for Fig. 1 and using 1/10 and 1/20 the amount of the CHA-A455E expression plasmid (Fig. 3 C). A prolonged immunoblot exposure was necessary to detect the expressed CFTR polypeptides at the lower plasmid levels, but the occurrence and steady state proportions of the 105- and 90-kDa fragments and band B remained consistent at all levels of expression. Together, these results confirm that solubility differences between the CFTRs and overexpression do not account for the varied accumulation of the carboxyl-terminal fragments. Transient transfections were carried out with CHA-tagged CFTRwt, ΔF508, and A455E in COS-7, CHO-duk−, and CF bronchial epithelium IB3–1 cell lines. Immunoblot analysis of detergent extracts indicated that although the levels varied between the cell types, CHA-A455E consistently revealed the most prominent accumulation of the 105- and 90-kDa bands (Fig. 4,A–C). The 90-kDa band was difficult to detect in the detergent extracts of CHO-duk− and IB3–1 cells reflecting both a lower steady state level and the reduced solubility of this fragment (Fig. 4, B and C, and data not shown). Consistent with the observations made in HEK293 cells, reduced levels of the intermediates were identified for CFTRwt in all cell types. Accordingly, immunoblot analysis of CHA-ΔF508 did not readily reveal the carboxyl-terminal fragments; they could be detected but only with prolonged exposure of the blots. To further examine the prevalence of the intermediates in the IB3–1 cell line, untagged wt and mutant CFTR constructs were transfected and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 3 h (Fig. 4 D). The increased sensitivity clearly shows the accumulation of the 105-kDa intermediate in both the wt and A455E extracts. These results are consistent with the steady state immunoblot analyses and suggest that the 105-and 90-kDa fragments reflect a feature of CFTR biogenesis that is bypassed by the major mutant because of its specific folding defect and degradation fate (16.Lukacs G.L.

Together, these data suggest that the observed carboxyl fragments reflect common processes in multiple cell types including those of epithelial origin and that differences in accumulation of the carboxyl fragments between CHA-CFTRs are intrinsic to the polypeptide being expressed. Given their carboxyl-terminal constitution, the 105- and 90-kDa immunoreactive polypeptides were suspected to be degradation products, although it was not immediately apparent when or how they were generated. CFTR degradation events may occur during the folding of the nascent polypeptide at the ER, upon modification in the"

In the present study, we further characterized the mode of interaction between the chaperonins and the native-like αβ heterodimer. The αβ heterodimer, as an intact entity, was found to bind to GroEL at a 1:1 stoichiometry with a K D of 1.1 × 10−7m. The 1:1 molar ratio of the GroEL-αβ complex was confirmed by the ability of the complex to bind a stoichiometric amount of denatured lysozyme in thetrans cavity. Surprisingly, in the presence of Mg-ADP, GroES was able to cap the GroEL-αβ complex in cis, despite the size of 86 kDa of the heterodimer (with a His6tag and a linker). Incubation of the GroEL-αβ complex with Mg-ATP, but not AMP-PNP, resulted in the release of α monomers. In the presence of Mg-ATP, the β subunit was also released but was unable to assemble with the α subunit, and rebound to GroEL. The apparent differential subunit release from GroEL is explained, in part, by the significantly higher binding affinity of the β subunit (K D < 4.15 × 10−9m) than the α (K D = 1.6 × 10−8m) for GroEL. Incubation of the GroEL-αβ complex with Mg-ATP and GroES resulted in dissociation and discharge of both the α and β subunits from GroEL. The β subunit upon binding to GroEL underwent further folding in thecis cavity sequestered by GroES. This step rendered the β subunit competent for reassociation with the soluble α subunit to produce a new heterodimer. We propose that this mechanism is responsible for the iterative annealing of the kinetically trapped heterodimeric intermediate, leading to an efficient α2β2 assembly of human branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase.

Among the most well studied molecular chaperones are group I chaperonins comprising bacterial GroEL/GroES, mitochondrial Hsp60/Hsp10, and plant Cpn60/Cpn21. GroEL is a double-ring complex with two heptameric rings of identical 57-kDa subunits stacked upon one another back-to-back (4.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Each GroEL monomer contains an apical, an intermediate, and an equatorial domain. The apical domain forms a heptameric GroEL ring with a diameter of 45 Å, which allows for the binding and passage of unfolded or partially folded proteins. The equatorial domain contains the ATP-binding site and provides the interring contacts. The two domains are linked through the flexible intermediate domain. GroES is a single heptameric ring of identical 10-kDa monomers (5.Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 6.Mande S.C. Mehra V. Bloom B.R. Hol W.G.H. Science. 1996; 271: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The structure of the GroEL14-ADP7-GroES7 complex (7.Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) confirms that binding of GroES to the apical domain of GroEL induces anen bloc domain movement observed previously in cryoelectron microscopy (8.Roseman A.M. Chen S.X. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this movement results in doubling the volume of the cis ring cavity of GroEL to accommodate a polypeptide of larger than 70 kDa in size (7.Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). In support of this suggestion, the 75-kDa methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (9.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S.

The mechanism by which GroEL/GroES promote proper folding of target proteins or synthetic peptides has been extensively studied. The productive folding occurs in the cis ring that houses the unfolded or partially folded proteins, which are sequestered from the bulk solvent by the GroES (9.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O.

Horwich A.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The folding of proteins in the GroEL cavity is driven by Mg-ATP hydrolysis in the equatorial domain of thecis ring. Both rings of the GroEL double ring complex alternate to become the cis ring during GroEL/GroES-mediated folding cycles (13.Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This leads to the term “two-stroke engine” for the GroEL/GroES folding machine (14.Lorimer G. Nature. 1997; 388: 720-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15.Xu Z. Sigler P.B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Communications between the apical and equatorial domains of GroEL via the intermediate domain are essential to promote proper folding of the target protein. Mutations in the intermediate domain disrupt these communications and therefore the folding capacities of GroEL/GroES (16.Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The peptide binding site in the apical domain has recently been identified by NMR (17.Chatellier J. Buckle A.M.

Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) using minichaperones of GroEL comprising sequences of the apical domain. These studies showed independently that the flexible groove between helices H8 and H9 is the peptide-binding site for the apical domain (21.Feltham J.L. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 193-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GroEL binds to a wide range of structures ranging from the extended β-strands and α-helixes to folded states with exposed hydrophobic side chains (17.Chatellier J. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22.Wang Z. Feng H.P. Landry S.J. Maxwell J. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12537-12546Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Despite the above advances, only limited information is available regarding the potential role of GroEL/GroES in oligomeric protein assembly. The prevailing thought is that these chaperonins assist the folding of peptides into assembly-competent monomers and that spontaneous assembly proceeds in the bulk solution (23.Zheng X. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Fedorov A.V. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have revisited the question by studying folding and assembly of a natural target protein, i.e. the human mitochondrial α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD).1 This thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme is a component of the mammalian mitochondrial BCKD complex (5 × 106daltons in size) organized around a 24-mer dihydrolipoyl transacylase core, to which BCKD, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, a specific kinase, and a specific phosphatase are noncovalently attached (25.Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1239-1277Google Scholar). BCKD is a heterotetrameric protein comprising two 45,500-dalton α subunits and two 37,800-dalton β subunits. The crystal structure of the α2β2 heterotetramer of human BCKD has been recently solved at 2.7 Å (26.Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.L. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The data provide important structural insights into the previously established assembly pathway of human BCKD (27.Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which proceeds through an αβ heterodimeric intermediate (Fig.1). Interactions between α and β′ and α′ and β subunits of the two heterodimers result in the assembly of a native heterotetramer. These heterologous subunit interactions are blocked by a human mutation Y393N in the α subunit. This locks the mutant enzyme in the permanent heterodimeric state (26.Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.L. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our previous data showed that interactions of the αβ heterodimeric intermediate with GroEL/GroES are obligatory during α2β2assembly of BCKD (28.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We subsequently showed that GroEL/GroES promote the dissociation/reassociation of the αβ heterodimeric intermediate during the reconstitution of BCKD in vitro (29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate a pivotal role of the chaperonins in mediating the iterative annealing of assembly intermediates for subsequent higher order oligomerization. In the present study, we further characterize the nature of interactions between GroEL/GroES and the αβ heterodimeric intermediate to better understand the mechanism by which these chaperonins promote productive protein assembly. Bacterial chaperonins GroEL, GroES, and recombinant α2β2 heterotetramers of human BCKD were prepared as described previously (28.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled and nonlabeled αβ heterodimeric intermediates of BCKD were expressed and purified also as reported previously (29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The native BCKD heterotetramer (35 μg) was incubated in 50 μl of 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm NaCl, 400 mm KSCN, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 23 °C for 45 min. The mixture containing resultant αβ heterodimers (29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was diluted to 200 mm KSCN and extracted with Ni2+-NTA resin for 1 h at 23 °C. The resin was washed with 10 mm imidazole in buffer containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated in 300 μl of the same buffer or with an added 330 μg of GroEL for 4 h at 23 °C in the presence of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After collection of the supernatant, the resin was washed, and proteins bound to the resin were eluted with 200 mmimidazole. One-twentieth volume of the supernatant and one-fifth of the eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Different amounts of35S-labeled αβ heterodimers (specific radioactivity 24,642 cpm/μg of protein) were added to GroEL (final concentration 0.94 μm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation for 24 h at 23 °C, the mixture was applied to an HPLC G3000SWXL column. GroEL-containing fractions were collected, and aliquots (100 μl) were counted for radioactivity. K D was obtained by fitting the data using the DynaFit 2.14 program (30.Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) according to the scheme: αβ + GroEL ⇌ GroEL-αβ. Lysozyme (Sigma) at 20 mg/ml was completely denatured and reduced in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mmdithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h. After adjusting the pH to 2.0 with HCl, denatured and reduced lysozyme was dialyzed against 10 mm HCl for 2–3 h and then against 0.1 m acetic acid with two changes. The GroEL-αβ complex was formed by incubating GroEL with an excess amount of His6-tagged αβ heterodimers at 4 °C for 24 h, followed by purification on a fast protein liquid chromatography Superdex-200 column. The GroEL-αβ complex was incubated with Ni2+-NTA resin and 10 mm Mg-ATP in the presence or absence of GroES for 30 min at 23 °C. The resin was spun down and washed with 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, and 15 mm imidazole. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer and separated on a 10–25% sucrose density gradient spun at 210,000 × gfor 16 h at 4 °C. Proteins in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The GroEL-αβ complex at 0.8 μg/μl was subjected to limited digestion with 4 μg/ml proteinase K at 23 °C for 10 min under different conditions, and the digestion was quenched with 4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Final concentrations of the additives were as follows: Mg-ATP, 8 mm; Mg-ADP, 8 mm; and GroES, 0.4 μg/μl. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using combined antibodies to the α and β subunits as probes. GroEL- His6-α and GroEL-β-His6 complexes, with a His6 tag at N and C termini, respectively, were prepared as described previously (28.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The GroEL-polypeptide complex at 0.2 μg/μl was incubated with 10 mm Mg-ATP in the presence or absence of 0.1 μg/μl GroES and Ni2+-NTA at 23 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 500 μl. Proteins bound to Ni2+-NTA were eluted with 500 μl of 200 mm imidazole. Incubation mixture without Ni2+-NTA and fractions eluted from the resin were separated on a 10–30% sucrose density gradient at 210,000 ×g for 16 h at 4 °C. The gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the released α and β subunits in the top six fractions were quantified by densitometry. The total amount of α or β subunit in the incubation mixture at zero time served as a 100% control. Different amounts of Ca2+-depleted α-lactalbumin (Sigma) were incubated with 0.5 mm EGTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol at 23 °C for 15 min to achieve the molten globule state (31.Hayer-Hartl M.K. Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3192-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To the incubation mixture, the GroEL-α or the GroEL-β complex (1 mg/ml) and 0.1 mm Mg-ATP were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min. The reformed GroEL-polypeptide complex was purified on an HPLC G4000SWXL column in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The GroEL-containing fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The amount of the α or β subunit still bound to GroEL was quantified by densitometry. The level of the α or β subunit complexed with GroEL in the absence of α-lactalbumin was set as 100%. The amounts of the α or β subunit that remained bound to GroEL were plotted against the initial concentrations of reduced α-lactalbumin (r-LA) in the incubation mixture. Computer fitting using the DynaFit 2.14 program was based on the following models: α or β + GroEL ⇌ GroEL-α or GroEL-β (K D1), r-LA + GroEL ⇌ GroEL-r-LA (K D2). The protein concentrations of GroEL, GroES, and denatured lysozyme were determined spectrophotometrically using published extinction coefficient of 0.21 ml/mg/cm (32.Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), 0.14 ml/mg/cm (33.Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and 2.37 ml/mg/cm (34.Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The other proteins were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein reagent from Pierce with absorbance read at 595 nm. We have shown previously that interaction of the αβ heterodimer with chaperonins GroEL/GroES is an obligatory step during the α2β2 assembly of BCKD (28.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To further delineate the nature of this interaction, we determined the amount of GroEL required for the efficient reconstitution of BCKD with the αβ heterodimeric intermediate as a substrate. Fig.2 shows that the maximal yield of BCKD activity was obtained when the molar ratio of GroEL to the αβ heterodimer reached approximately 1:1. It was uncertain whether the αβ heterodimer bound to GroEL as an entity or as dissociated α and β monomers resulting from an equilibrium that existed between the αβ heterodimer and the dissociated monomers. We addressed this question by incubating the Ni2+-NTA-immobilized His6-αβ heterodimer (with the His6 tag on the α subunit) with GroEL (Fig.3 A). Following the incubation at 23 °C for 4 h, proteins in the supernatant and the fractions eluted from Ni2+-NTA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The presence of the GroEL-β complex in the supernatant would be diagnostic of the dissociation of His6-αβ heterodimer. Fig. 3 B shows that in the presence of the buffer alone, the His6-α and untagged β subunits remain assembled and immobilized on Ni2+-NTA. Incubation of Ni2+-NTA-His6-αβ with GroEL did not produce the soluble GroEL-β complex to be released into the supernatant. The small amount of GroEL in the eluted fraction indicates a grossly substoichiometric level of GroEL bound to the His6-αβ heterodimer immobilized on Ni2+-NTA. The data clearly establish that the αβ heterodimer is a stable species that exists in a negligible dissociation equilibrium with monomers, so as to allow the heterodimer to bind to GroEL as an intact entity. The affinity of the αβ heterodimer for GroEL was measured by incubating increasing concentrations of35S-labeled heterodimers with GroEL at 23 °C for 24 h to ensure the complete binding (29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the GroEL fractions collected from HPLC was quantified to determine the concentration of the bound αβ heterodimer. The stoichiometry of GroEL to the αβ heterodimer in the GroEL-αβ complex was estimated by computer simulation. The DynaFit 2.14 program was used based on the scheme αβ + GroEL ⇌ GroEL-αβ, with one binding site for the αβ heterodimer per GroEL 14-mer. The result showed a good fit with the probability of randomness p > 5% (35.Gunst R.F. Mason R.L. Owen D.B. Regression Analysis and Its Application: A Data-oriented Approach. Marcel Dekker, New York1980: 232-234Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (K D) according to this scheme was 1.1 × 10−7m(Fig. 4). A second scheme assumed that GroEL possessed two binding sites for αβ heterodimers and that binding was sequential. A computer simulation based on this second scheme did not yield meaningful constants for the second binding site in the sequence (data not shown). It was therefore concluded that each GroEL molecule can bind only one αβ heterodimer. The 1:1 stoichiometry of the GroEL-αβ complex established above strongly suggested that the unoccupied cavity in trans on GroEL was capable of binding small unfolded proteins. To confirm this, we incubated GroEL with a saturating amount of αβ heterodimers at 4 °C for 48 h. To the GroEL-αβ complex purified by gel filtration, denatured and fully reduced lysozyme was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 23 °C. Fig.5 A shows that lysozyme co-purifies with the GroEL-αβ complex on HPLC at a 1:1 molar ratio of lysozyme to GroEL, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The result indicates that the GroEL-αβ complex can still bind a stoichiometric amount of lysozyme and confirms the model in which a GroEL molecule accommodates only one αβ heterodimer. Our earlier studies have established that GroES is essential for the reconstitution of BCKD α2β2 heterotetramers with the GroEL-αβ complex as a substrate (28.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the size of the αβ heterodimer is 86 kDa with a His6 tag and a linker. This raises the possibility that cis capping of the GroEL-αβ complex by GroES may not occur. We investigated this question by carrying out limited digestion of the GroES-GroEL-αβ complex with proteinase K. Fig. 5 B shows that in the presence of Mg-ADP, a stable GroES-GroEL-αβ ternary complex can be isolated by HPLC. The subunit stoichiometry is GroEL:α:β:GroES = 14:1:1:7, as determined by densitometry. The result indicates 1 mol of bound GroES in each mol of the GroES-GroEL-αβ complex. Fig.6 (upper panel) shows that in the presence of Mg-ADP, where a stable GroES-GroEL-αβ complex is formed, a significant amount of the α or β subunit is protected from proteinase K digestion (lane 4) compared with the starting undigested GroEL-αβ complex (lane 1), as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Western blotting confirms the presence of 42% of the intact α or β subunits after proteinase K digestion (lane 4), against the undigested GroEL-αβ complex (lane 1) (Fig. 6, lower panel). We interpret the data to indicate that, despite the oversize of the αβ heterodimer, GroES binds to the GroEL-αβ complex equally in cis and in trans, similar to results obtained with GroEL-small polypeptide complexes (10.Saikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11.Huang Y.-S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As also shown in Fig. 6, the αβ heterodimer is not protected from proteolysis in the absence of a stable GroES-GroEL-αβ complex, when GroES and ADP are omitted (lane 2), no nucleotides are added (lane 3), or Mg-ATP instead of Mg-ADP is present (lane 5). The data show the protective effect of GroES during proteinase K digestion throughcis capping of the GroEL-αβ complex. To further understand the mechanism by which chaperonins promote dissociation of the αβ heterodimer (29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of nucleotides and GroES on release of the α and the β subunits from the GroEL-αβ complex. The GroEL-αβ complex with a His6 tag on the α subunit was incubated with Ni2+-NTA at zero time under different conditions. After incubation at 23 °C for 30 min, proteins eluted with imidazole from the resin were separated on a sucrose density gradient. As shown in Fig. 7 (upper panel), the Ni2+-NTA-extracted GroEL-αβ complex with no addition remained essentially intact, with a slight leaching of the α subunit from the complex during the ultracentrifugation. In the presence of Mg-ATP, a significant amount of the His6-tagged α subunit was released from the GroEL-αβ complex and sedimented as Ni2+-NTA-extractable monomers near the top of the gradient (middle panel, fractions 3–5). However, no β subunit was detected across the sucrose density gradient. Similar experiments were performed in the presence of Mg-ADP or AMP-PNP, but no release of α monomers was observed (data not shown). The results indicate that ATP hydrolysis, and not binding of the nucleotide, is necessary and sufficient for the dissociation of the αβ heterodimer. Significantly, in the presence of both Mg-ATP and GroES, a fraction of the β subunit is released from GroEL and folds into an assembly-competent conformation capable of association with the α subunit. The reformed αβ heterodimer with a His6-tagged α subunit can now be extracted with Ni2+-NTA (Fig. 7,lower panel). To compare the extent of the α and β subunits released from individual GroEL-polypeptide complexes, these complexes were incubated with Mg-ATP, with or without GroES. The subunit released from GroEL was separated on a sucrose density gradient and expressed as a percentage of that present in the starting GroEL-polypeptide complex. As shown in Fig. 8, in the presence of Mg-ATP, approximately 13% of the α subunit were released from the GroEL-α complex after a 1-h incubation; no β subunit was discharged from the GroEL-β complex (lane 1). The addition of both Mg-ATP and GroES resulted in a sharp increase in the release of the α subunit from the GroEL-α complex (lane 2). The discharge of the β subunit from the GroEL-β complex is also increased from 0% to approximately 11% (lane 2). When Ni2+-NTA was included in the incubation mixture at zero time to trap the released subunit, the levels of the released α and β subunits from individual GroEL-polypeptide complexes with Mg-ATP alone are both significant at 89 and 55%, respectively (lane 3). Similarly, significant discharges of the α and β subunits at 84 and 63%, respectively, were observed, when both Mg-ATP and GroES were included along with the Ni2+-NTA trap (lane 4). The free α subunit, but not β, was released from the GroEL-αβ complex in the presence of Mg-ATP (Fig. 7,middle panel). In the absence of Ni2+-NTA, the level of the released α subunit was higher than the β subunit with individual GroEL-α and GroEL-β complexes (Fig. 8, panels 1 and 2). These results, taken together, strongly suggested that the two BCKD subunits have different affinity for GroEL. These properties were studied using reduced and calcium-depleted α-lactalbumin (r-LA) to compete with the BCKD subunits for binding to GroEL. r-LA in the molten globule state binds to GroEL with relatively high affinity (36.Murai N. Taguchi H. Yoshida M J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19957-19963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Competitive binding studies were carried out by the addition of different concentrations of r-LA to the GroEL-α or the GroEL-β complex in the presence of Mg-ATP. The level of the α or β subunit remaining bound to GroEL reflects the affinity of either subunit for GroEL relative to r-LA. Fig. 9 shows that the presence of a 0–50 μm concentration of r-LA does not significantly reduce the amount of the β subunit bound to GroEL. Even at 100 μm r-LA, the level of the bound β subunit is decreased by only 10%. In contrast, the level of the bound α subunit drops precipitously over the 0–50 μm concentration range of r-LA. The data show the markedly higher affinity of the β subunit than the α for GroEL. Computer simulation gave rise to aK D value of 1.6 × 10−8m for the GroEL-α complex and K D of 8.3 × 10−7m for the GroEL-r-LA complex. The latter constant is in agreement with the binding constant of acid-denatured α-lactalbumin with GroEL (37.Makio T. Arai M. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With respect to K D for the GroEL-β complex, only 10% of the β subunit was released from GroEL in the presence of a 200-fold excess of r-LA. Therefore, we estimated the K D for the GroEL-β complex to be less than 4.15 × 10−9m by dividing the K D for the GroEL-r-LA complex by 200. The present study was designed to provide further mechanistic insights into the mode of interactions between GroEL/GroES and the αβ heterodimeric intermediate during the α2β2 assembly of human mitochondrial BCKD. The requirement for a stoichiometric amount of GroEL to the αβ heterodimer for the maximal recovery of BCKD activity indicates that the formation of a stable GroEL-αβ complex is essential during the BCKD assembly. This is in variance with the refolding of malate dehydrogenase, where a catalytic amount of GroEL forms a transient complex with the monomeric intermediate during the refolding of homodimeric enzyme (38.Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The direct binding of the αβ heterodimer to GroEL as an intact undissociated entity was unequivocally established by using the Ni2+-NTA immobilized heterodimer with a His6 tag on the α subunit as a ligand (Fig. 3). If an equilibrium had existed between the immobilized αβ heterodimer and dissociated α and β subunits, the addition of exogenous GroEL would have shifted the equilibrium to favor the formation of individual GroEL-α and GroEL-β complexes. The failure to recover the untagged GroEL-β complex in the supernatant ruled out the possibility that the heterodimer dissociates into individual subunits prior to binding to GroEL. The 1:1 stoichiometry of GroEL to the heterodimer is indicated kinetically by the titration of reconstituted BCKD activity (Fig. 2) and by the direct measurement of the amount of the heterodimer bound to GroEL (Fig. 4). This 1:1 stoichiometry in the GroEL-αβ complex was further supported by the ability of the complex, which was obtained with saturating concentrations of the heterodimer, to bind one molecule of fully unfolded lysozyme. The data are consistent with a topology in which one end of the GroEL double ring complex binds the heterodimer, and the opposite end accommodates the denatured lysozyme. A similar result was also observed in GroEL complexed with a homodimeric intermediate of d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (39.Li J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10790-10794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the basis for the “half of the sites” binding (39.Li J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10790-10794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) of the native-like substrate by GroEL is presently unknown. It is possible that occupation of the cis cavity by a large folded intermediate causes a narrowing of the opening in the transring. The constricted orifice may allow for the passage of small unfolded polypeptides but not a second molecule of the highly structured assembly intermediate. The putative conformational alterations in the apical domain of the trans ring of the GroEL-αβ complex remain to be studied by cryoelectron microscopy. The binding of one molecule of GroES in the presence of Mg-ADP by the GroEL-αβ complex, on the other hand, raises a question as to whether GroES is able to cap in cis the GroEL cavity occupied by the 86-kDa heterodimer. To date, no unfolded polypeptides larger than 70 kDa have been shown to be sequestered in cisby GroES (9.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 10.Saikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11.Huang Y.-S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10405-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cis capping of the GroEL-αβ complex by GroES, as demonstrated by the proteinase K digestion, was an unexpected finding. According to the structure of the GroEL14-ADP7-GroES7 complex, the volume of the cis cavity is estimated to be 175,000 Å3 (7.Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 14.Lorimer G. Nature. 1997; 388: 720-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These authors have suggested that thecis GroEL cavity is capable of accommodating a globular protein or even an expanded volume molten globule intermediate with a molecular mass of greater than 70 kDa. This speculation is supported by the present study, which shows that the 86-kDa heterodimer can be capped by GroES in cis. We argue that the highly structured assembly intermediate is more compact than the unfolded polypeptides. This allows for the residence of the heterodimer in the ciscavity of GroEL despite the high molecular mass of the target protein. The cis capping of the GroEL-αβ complex by GroES thus facilitates efficient folding or unfolding of the heterodimer to proceed in the sequestered cavity of GroEL. The αβ heterodimer is a misfolded intermediate in a low energy state. The binding energy, provided upon the binding of the heterodimer and nucleotide to GroEL, probably weakens the interaction between the α and β subunit but is still not enough to dissociate the heterodimer, since no released α subunit was observed in the presence of AMP-PNP or ADP (data not shown). In the presence of Mg-ATP, the β subunit is also dissociated from GroEL but is unable to reassemble with the soluble released α monomer and rebinds to GroEL (Fig. 7). Since the β subunit is without a His6 tag, the GroEL-β complex is not extracted by Ni2+-NTA. The preferential release of the α subunit by ATP hydrolysis ensures the ciscapping of the resultant GroEL-β complex by GroES, since the 37.8-kDa β subunit is well within the size limit for this mechanism. The efficient cis folding produces the β subunit competent for reassembly with the α subunit, with the regeneration of αβ heterodimers separated on the sucrose density gradient. The results confirm and extend the thesis that GroEL/GroES promote the dissociation and reassociation of the αβ heterodimer to facilitate the assembly of α2β2 heterotetramer at the quaternary level (29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This mechanism is consistent with GroEL-assisted folding through the unfolding of misfolded intermediates (40.Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The release of both α and β subunits from individual GroEL-α and GroEL-β complexes with Mg-ATP alone is indicated by the extraction of both subunits with Ni2+-NTA (Fig. 8). However, with Mg-ATP alone, the majority of the released α subunit rebinds to GroEL. When both Mg-ATP and GroES are present, essentially all of the released α subunit stays in solution. The results indicate that GroES is required to augment the proper folding of the denatured α subunit. In contrast, with Mg-ATP alone, all of the β subunit discharged from the GroEL-β complex rebinds to GroEL. With both Mg-ATP and GroES present, only a small fraction of β subunit is folded and exists as a soluble species. This folded β subunit is conceivably capable of assembly with the soluble α subunit. The differential dependence of the α and β subunits on GroEL/GroES for folding, can be explained, at least in part, by the recently determined BCKD structure (Fig. 1). During assembly, the two homologous heterodimeric intermediates (αβ and α′β′) assemble into a native BCKD α2β2 heterotetramer. The β subunit as shown in the heterodimer is divided into two distinct domains, with each domain comprising four parallel central β strands and several α-helices that pack against the strands in variable orientations. This conformation fits the type of structures that has recently been suggested to depend on GroEL/GroES for folding (41.Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The β subunit contains mostly strands that fold slowly and need to be precisely packed into the α/β architecture and thus are prone to misfold. In contrast, the α subunit in the heterodimer and native BCKD comprises essentially α helices that are less prone to misfolding. The data are consistent with the higher affinity of the β subunit (K D < 4.1 × 10−9m) than the α subunit (K D = 1.6 × 10−8m). This in turn accounts for the retarded release of the β subunit from GroEL-αβ complex as compared with the α subunit. Fig. 10 illustrates a working model for chaperonin-dependent α2β2assembly of human BCKD. Our earlier results showed that GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP facilitate folding of the α and β subunits into assembly-competent monomers on different GroEL scaffolds (28.Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The αβ heterodimer initially formed is not capable of spontaneous dimerization and is termed a “bad” dimer. The slow binding (t 12 = 54.8 min) of bad dimers to GroEL produces stable GroEL-αβ complexes (29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg-ATP alone, the α subunit released from the GroEL-αβ complex exists as soluble monomers. In contrast, the β subunit discharged from the complex is not capable of reassembly with the α subunit and therefore rebinds to GroEL. In the presence of both Mg-ATP and GroES, the β subunit undergoes multiple rounds of cis folding, resulting in the release of the assembly-competent β subunit that reassociates with the α monomer to produce new heterodimers. A fraction of the regenerated αβ heterodimers are productive or “good” dimers that are capable of rapid (t 12 = 1.83 min) spontaneous dimerization into inactive heterotetramers, followed by a slow (t 12 = 2.93 min) conversion to active heterotetramers (29.Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the reformed heterodimers are partitioned between good and bad dimers with the latter having to rebind to GroEL. Thus, the cycle perpetuates until all the bad dimers are converted to good dimers. This model describes a central role of GroEL/GroES in protein assembly through iterative annealing of nonproductive assembly intermediates.

InLeishmania where heterologous expression of GPI-PLC causes a GPI deficiency, the enzyme existed as a tetramer. Hence, oligomerization of GPI-PLC is associated with high enzyme activity bothin vivo and in vitro. variant surface glycoprotein 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate dimethyl sulfoxide deoxycholate disuccinimidyl suberate dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate dithiothreitol lauryl dimethyl amine oxide m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester phosphate-buffered saline glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C Trypanosoma brucei GPI-PLC binding protein endoplasmic reticulum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mannose glucosamine phosphatidylinositol Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans. In the bloodstream of a vertebrate host, the plasma membrane of the parasite is covered with a variant surface glycoprotein (VSG),1 a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecule. These trypanosomes contain a GPI-specific phospholipase C (1.Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

GPI-PLC is highly specific for GPIs (k cat, 2.92 × 103min−1; K m, 360 nm) (1.Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

Turnover of the enzyme-substrate complex is regulated by thio-myristoylation and palmitoylation of the enzyme (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Efficient substrate recognition by GPI-PLC requires a glucosaminylinositol moiety on the substrate (8.Morris J.C. Ping-Sheng L. Shen T.Y. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GPI-PLC activity is detectable only in developmental stages of the parasite where VSG is present. As revealed by immunoelectron microscopic analysis, GPI-PLC is associated with vesicular structures on the cytoplasmic side of intracellular membranes (9.Bülow R. Griffiths G. Webster P.

(Oxf.). 1982; 4: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). While T. brucei divides every 6–8 h, the half-life of cell-associated VSG is 32–34 h (11.Black S.J. Hewett R.S. Sendashonga C.N. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1982; 4: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12.Bülow R. Nonnengasser C. Overath P. Mol. Biochem.

Clearly, VSG is not released actively by GPI-PLC. This situation is in sharp contrast to the phenotype ofLeishmania major or Trypanosoma cruzi that have been stably transfected with a cDNA for the T. bruceiGPI-PLC (14.Mensa-Wilmot K. Garg N. McGwire B.S. Lu H.G. Zhong L. Armah D.A. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15.Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In Leishmania promastigotes (extracellular insect-stage form), gp63, the major GPI-anchored protein, is secreted constitutively into the culture medium due to a GPI deficiency (15.Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Replication of Leishmania amastigotes (the intracellular mammalian stage) is severely inhibited by GPI-PLC expression (14.Mensa-Wilmot K. Garg N. McGwire B.S. Lu H.G. Zhong L. Armah D.A. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A similar phenotype has been noted in T. cruzi where division of the cell nucleus is blocked as a result of a GPI deficiency (16.Garg N. Tarleton R.L. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12482-12491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and differentiation of amastigotes to trypomastigotes is inhibited (17.Garg N. Postan M. Mensa-Wilmot K. Tarleton R.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4055-4060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPI intermediates (e.g. GlcN-PI and Man1–3GlcN-PI) are found on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (18.Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These compounds appear to co-localize with GPI-PLC, given the data from the in vivo transfection studies withLeishmania and T. cruzi. Why then in T. brucei are these GPIs spared from cleavage by this potent membrane-bound phospholipase C? It is estimated that there are 2.4 × 104 molecules of glycolipid A (ethanolamine-phospho-Man3-GlcN-Ins-phospho-dimyrisotylglycerol), the prefabricated GPI anchor (19.Doering T.L. Pessin M.S. Hoff E.F. Hart G.W. Raben D.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9215-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 3.5 × 104molecules of GPI-PLC (3.Bülow R. Overath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11918-11923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this represents an excess of the enzyme over the complete GPI anchor. With a turnover number (k cat) of 2920 min−1(6.Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), GPI-PLC could cleave all the glycolipid A inside T. brucei within seconds. Since the parasites remain capable of adding GPIs to VSG, it seems clear that GPI-PLC is somehow prevented from depleting T. brucei of GPI anchors. The absence of the GPI-negative phenotype observed with transgenic T. cruzi andL. major expressing GPI-PLC is indirect evidence for regulation of the enzyme in T. brucei. In lieu of efforts to understand factors that might control activity of GPI-PLC in T. brucei, we characterized the native state of the purified enzyme, and we explored possible contributions of self-association to enzyme activity both in vivo andin vitro. Our observations led us to propose a model for post-translational regulation of GPI-PLC activity in vivowhere prevention of tetramerization might play an important role. Monomorphic T. brucei strain 427 bloodstream form was used in this work. Parasites were grown in rodents and harvested by chromatography on DE52 (20.Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Superdex 75 HR10/30 column, Superdex 200 HR10/30 column, the fast protein liquid chromatography system, and [35S]methionine were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Lauryl dimethyl amine oxide (LDAO), Nonidet P-40 (protein grade), and transferrin were purchased from Calbiochem. Thesit and aprotinin were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. GelCode Blue, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), dithiobissuccinimidyl propionate (DSP), and m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS) were purchased from Pierce. Gel filtration standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Sodium deoxycholate (DOC), CHAPS, and all other reagents were from Sigma. Purified recombinant GPI-PLC expressed in Escherichia coli (1–2 μg) was preincubated in 20–30 μl of 37.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.3, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, containing one of these reagents as follows: 3–4 m urea, 100 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 1% Nonidet P-40, or 0.1–2% CHAPS at 27 °C for 5 min. Samples were resolved by continuous glycine non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (pH 9.5; 5% minigel (Bio-Rad)) (21.Best S. Speicher D.W. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocol in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 10.0.1-10.3.11Google Scholar). To keep track of protein migration, 2 μl of 1% bromphenol blue was added to each sample prior to loading. Gels were run at 16 A for either 30 min or 4–5 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized with GelCode Blue (Pierce). Standards used were α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa, pI = 4–5), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, pI = 5.4–5.9), ovalbumin (43 kDa, pI = 4.6), bovine serum albumin (66-kDa monomer and 132-kDa dimer, pI = 4.7), and urease (272-kDa trimer and 545-kDa hexamer, pI = 5.0) (Sigma). Seven micrograms of marker proteins were analyzed. Molecular sieving was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography on either Superdex 75 HR10/30 at 5 °C or Superdex 200 HR10/30 at 27 °C. For all runs, a 100-μl sample was loaded, and 500-μl fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The void volume of the columns was determined with blue dextran, using PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4; pH 7.4) as running buffer. Prior to loading each sample, the columns were equilibrated with 3 column volumes of PBS containing the indicated amounts of detergent (see figure legends). For each running buffer, the columns were calibrated with thyroglobulin (670 kDa), IgG (160 kDa), transferrin (80 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa). Protein peaks were monitored byA 280 absorption. Purified GPI-PLC (620 ng) in 5 μl of 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.3, containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (6.Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was added to 95 μl of the indicated running buffer (see figure legends) and incubated at 27 °C for 5 min before loading onto the specified column. The elution profile of GPI-PLC was determined by assaying 5 μl of each fraction for enzyme activity (22.Mensa-Wilmot K. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 56: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). T. brucei (5 × 108parasites) was lysed hypotonically in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing a protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The membranous pellet obtained was solubilized with 500 μl of PBS containing either 1% Nonidet P-40 or 1% CHAPS. An aliquot of each sample (107cell equivalents for Nonidet P-40 and 108 cell equivalents for CHAPS) was fractionated on the indicated gel filtration column. Two μg of SDS-depleted [3H]myristate-labeled membrane-form variant surface glycoprotein was used as substrate in buffer AB (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, unless otherwise indicated. Cleaved [3H]dimyristoylglycerol was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting (6.Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Detergent is needed for solubilization of GPI-PLC under all conditions because it is an integral membrane protein. Replacement of Nonidet P-40 in the purified recombinant protein was therefore achieved by serial dilution into the detergent chosen to replace Nonidet P-40. Purified enzyme (6.2 ng) in 5 μl of 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.3, containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (6.Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was diluted 10-fold into buffer AB lacking Nonidet P-40. A 5-μl aliquot of the diluted enzyme (620 pg) was diluted further into a new detergent by adding 45 μl of buffer AB containing 1% of the detergent. To measure enzyme activity, 5 μl of each sample was assayed in 25 μl of the corresponding buffer AB, in which the detergent being tested had replaced Nonidet P-40. (Residual Nonidet P-40 is now 0.002%.) Enzyme reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at either 5 or 27 °C. Purified GPI-PLC (124 ng/μl in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.3, 1% Nonidet P-40) was diluted 10-fold into PBS to reduce the concentration of Nonidet P-40 and Tris. A 10-μl aliquot (124 ng) of the diluted enzyme was then placed in a microcentrifuge tube containing 11.6 μl of deionized water and 3 μl each of 10× PBS and 10% of the specified detergent. These actions resulted in a 30-fold dilution of the original enzyme sample. After a 5-min preincubation at 2, 15, or 27 °C, cross-linking was initiated by addition of 2.4 μl of 3.125 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and the reactions were incubated under one of these conditions as follows: 2 °C for 40 min, 15 °C for 40 min, or 27 °C for 10 min. The final concentration of DSS was 250 μm. In control experiments, 2.4 μl of Me2SO was added. To quench the reactions, 2.5 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was introduced, and after 5 min incubation on ice, 10 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer added. Samples were heated at 90 °C for 2–3 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% minigel; Bio-Rad), and GPI-PLC was detected by Western blotting (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). T. brucei(2 × 108 cells) was metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and washed with PBS. Parasites were resuspended in 396 μl of PBS. To initiate cross-linking, 4 μl of 100 mm DSS, DSP, or MBS (m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester), all membrane-permeable reagents, was added. In control experiments, 4 μl of Me2SO was introduced. Parasites were incubated at 27 °C for 30 min, after which reactions were quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were lysed 1ml of in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8. A membranous pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, 10 min at 4 °C, and solubilized in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation dilution buffer ((1% v/v) Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm EDTA, 10 units/ml aprotinin). [35S]Methionine-labeled GPI-PLC was immunoadsorbed to anti-GPI-PLC monoclonal antibody (mc2A6-6) (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by phosphorimaging (Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad)). Western blotting with anti-BiP antibody (23.Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed as described (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with 10 μl of the detergent-solubilized extract. Leishmania(2.5 × 108 promastigotes) expressing T. brucei GPI-PLC (15.Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (15.Mensa-Wilmot K. LeBowitz J.H. Chang K.P. Al-Qahtani A. McGwire B.S. Tucker S. Morris J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and washed with PBS. Parasites were resuspended in 990 μl of PBS, pH 7.4. Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm MBS. Ten μl of Me2SO was introduced in control experiments. Parasites were incubated at 27 °C for 30 min. Reactions were quenched and analyzed as described under “In Vivo Cross-linking of T. brucei.” T. brucei was metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and parasites (2.5 × 108) were lysed hypotonically (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A membranous pellet obtained by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) was resuspended in 450 μl of PBS. Cross-linking was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 2.5 mm DSS, or DSP, followed by incubation at either 27 °C for 5 min or 2 °C for 40 min. In control experiments, 50 μl of Me2SO was added. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was solubilized and analyzed as described under “In Vivo Cross-linking of T. brucei.” Immunoadsorption of GPI-PLC to a monoclonal antibody was performed as described previously (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A 40-μl aliquot of the cross-linked reaction mixture containing recombinant GPI-PLC (∼120 ng) was analyzed by Western blotting (7.Armah D.A. Mensa-Wilmot K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5931-5939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled GPI-PLC, from intact cells or lysates, was immunoadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose-mc2A6-6 beads (6.Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and eluted by heating at 90 °C for 2–3 min in 25 μl of 2.5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. When preservation of DSP cross-links was required, a modified 2.5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer lacking Tris and β-mercaptoethanol was used. Such samples were only warmed at 37 °C for 5 min. Eluates were separated from the Sepharose beads by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min at 27 °C. A 30-μl aliquot of each supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% minigel) and processed for phosphorimaging or fluorographic detection with BioMaxTM MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). GPI-PLC is a 39-kDa polypeptide (24.Hereld D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8914-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In native gel electrophoresis, it was detected as a diffuse band that barely entered a 5% minigel (without DTT or SDS) (Fig.1 A, lane 6). Absence of SDS from the sample and running buffers may explain the diffuse nature of protein bands in this experiment. Urea (up to 4 m) was added in an attempt to disrupt hydrogen bonds and dissociate what appeared to be a complex of unusual shape and/or size. The mobility of GPI-PLC did not change (Fig. 1 A, lane 7; Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Likewise, pretreatment with DTT (100 mm) to reduce disulfide bonds failed to alter mobility of GPI-PLC in the native gel (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). When the enzyme was treated with both DTT (100 mm) and urea (4 m), a minor change occurred in its migration (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Treatment with 1% SDS caused GPI-PLC to run off the gel (data not presented), most likely due to denaturation and net negative charge introduced by the detergent. CHAPS caused a significant change in the mobility of GPI-PLC, resolving it into two species (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). A titration of the detergent revealed that 0.5% was sufficient for optimal migration of GPI-PLC (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2–5). The major species of GPI-PLC detected during electrophoresis in CHAPS is labeled F (Fig.1 C). Two conclusions can be drawn from these observations. First, the size, shape, or net charge of GPI-PLC can be modulated by CHAPS. (The detergent has no net charge (Fig. 8).) Second, the quaternary structure of GPI-PLC is not dependent on disulfide bonds. One hypothesis to explain the altered mobility of GPI-PLC in the native gel after addition of CHAPS was that the detergent changed the quaternary structure of the enzyme. To examine this proposal, GPI-PLC was analyzed by gel filtration in a buffer containing different detergents, some with structures similar to CHAPS. A Superdex 75 HR10/30 column employed for this purpose had a void volume of 9 ml (fraction 18) and a bed volume of 24 ml (fraction 48). The experiment was performed at 5 °C. Proteins of 100 kDa and higher were excluded from the column. In 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the peak of GPI-PLC activity was in fraction 22, close to the elution position of an 80-kDa standard (Fig.2 A). The migration of enzyme activity is consistent with that of a dimer (78 kDa). Twelve percent of the enzyme activity was detected in the void volume (Fig.2 A), suggesting one of two possibilities. First, GPI-PLC forms complexes (e.g. trimers) larger than 100 kDa. Alternatively, GPI-PLC may be associated with micelles of the detergent that have a molecular mass of 90 kDa such that a monomer-micelle complex will have a mass of 130 kDa, causing it to be excluded from the column. In 1% Nonidet P-40 GPI-PLC was predominantly dimeric (data not shown). To determine whether the hydrophilic head group or hydrophobic tail of Nonidet P-40 contributed to dimerization of GPI-PLC, Thesit (65–68 kDa) whose hydrophilic head is identical to that of Nonidet P-40 was tested. In 1% Thesit, most of GPI-PLC was a dimer and 29% of the enzyme eluted in the void volume (Fig. 2 A). More importantly, detection of dimers suggest that the polymeric oxyethylene ((CH2-CH2-O)9–10) head (present in both Nonidet P-40 and Thesit) may be sufficient to cause oligomerization of purified GPI-PLC. In CHAPS, the majority of the enzyme migrated with a molecular mass greater than the 39-kDa monomer but less than the 80-kDa dimer (Fig.2 B). This finding is consistent with the assignment of a 47-kDa molecular size to the enzyme, after adsorption to a 7-kDa CHAPS micelle (1.Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13813-13819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only 23% of the total activity migrated as a dimer (Fig.2 B). About 13% of active enzyme eluted in fraction 19 (Fig.2 B), suggesting the presence of larger oligomers. Analysis of the enzyme in 2% LDAO produced similar results. The majority of GPI-PLC behaved as monomer, with about 23% dimers and 11% of oligomers (data not presented). To test the effects of temperature on interactions between GPI-PLC monomers, gel filtration was performed at 27 °C. Initial observations indicated that the peak of enzyme activity was outside the optimal separation range of Superdex 75 HR10/30 column (i.e.larger than 80 kDa) (data not presented). Therefore Superdex 200 HR10/30 with an optimal separation range up to 600 kDa was used. In 0.1% Nonidet P-40, the peak of enzyme activity was found in fraction 22, indicating that GPI-PLC was a tetramer (Fig. 2 C). About 17% of the activity migrated as a larger oligomer in fraction 19 (Fig.2 C). In contrast, CHAPS (2%) converted GPI-PLC into monomers and dimers predominantly (63% of activity) (Fig.2 D). Tetramers comprised 26% of the activity (Fig.2 D). Taken together, these observations indicate that (i) GPI-PLC can oligomerize, and (ii) temperature as well as detergents can influence the distribution between monomers and oligomers of the enzyme. At 5 °C, CHAPS and LDAO promote formation and/or stabilization of monomers, whereas Nonidet P-40 and Thesit enable detection of dimers. At 27 °C, GPI-PLC is a tetramer in Nonidet P-40 but exists primarily as dimers and monomers in CHAPS. Finally, from a comparison of the gel filtration data with that obtained from the native gel analysis, it seems likely that the slow species detected during native gel electrophoresis in Nonidet P-40 (S, Fig. 1 C) represents the tetramer of GPI-PLC. The faster-moving species in CHAPS (F, Fig. 1 C) may correspond to dimers and monomers. Capitalizing on the ability of detergents and temperature to modulate self-association of GPI-PLC, we investigated whether different oligomers of the enzyme possessed varying activity. When an enzyme assay was performed in Nonidet P-40 at 5 °C where GPI-PLC is predominantly dimeric (Fig.2 A), the activity was 1.7-fold higher than the monomer (Fig.3) found in CHAPS (Fig. 2 B). This implies that dimeric GPI-PLC may be slightly more active than the monomer. To compare the activity of dimeric GPI-PLC with that of the tetramer, enzyme was assayed in Nonidet P-40 at 27 °C (Fig. 2 C) and compared with its activity in CHAPS at 27 °C (Fig. 2 D). Tetrameric GPI-PLC was 3.6-fold more active than dimers and monomers (Fig. 3). An attempt to isolate tetramers generated by cross-linking for the purposes of activity determination was not feasible, since DSS, DSP, and MBS were all found to inhibit the activity of the enzyme (data not presented). Replacement of Nonidet P-40 with Thesit or LDAO reduced GPI-PLC activity 2–4-fold at 5 °C (Fig. 3). Deoxycholate (1%) completely inhibited GPI-PLC activity at both 5 and 27 °C (Fig. 3). When the assay was performed at 37 °C in 1% of detergent, GPI-PLC was 20-fold more active in Nonidet P-40 than in CHAPS, Thesit, LDAO, or DOC (Fig. 3). These observations indicate that GPI-PLC activity is increased under conditions where tetramer formation or stabilization is enhanced. Additional evidence for self-association of GPI-PLC was obtained by chemical cross-linking. Purified GPI-PLC migrates normally as a 39-kDa protein after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.4 A, lane 1). Following cross-linking with DSS, the major product formed was a doublet, most likely tetramers and (possibly) pentamers (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–6). Interestingly, denaturation of GPI-PLC with SDS inhibits cross-linking by DSS, leaving the monomer as the predominant species (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7 and 8). Aberrant (possibly intramolecular) cross-linking might also have occurred in the presence of SDS, since a ladder of bands with apparent molecular masses of 80 kDa and larger is visible (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7 and8). To test whether intermediates between monomers and tetramers could be detected, cross-linking was performed (i) at lower temperatures, or (ii) in the presence of Tris (16.7 mm). At 2 °C, dimers of GPI-PLC were detected in both Nonidet P-40 and CHAPS (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). In addition, a small proportion of trimers was detected. The species of GPI-PLC marked with anasterisk in Fig. 4 B (lanes 2 and3) could arise from intramolecular monomer cross-linking tha"
