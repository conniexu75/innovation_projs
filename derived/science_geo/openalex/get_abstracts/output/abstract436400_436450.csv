https://openalex.org/W1979728801,"Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13-amino-acid peptide that functions as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone through the activation of the neurotensin receptor NTSR1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In the brain, NTS modulates the activity of dopaminergic systems, opioid-independent analgesia, and the inhibition of food intake; in the gut, NTS regulates a range of digestive processes. Here we present the structure at 2.8 Å resolution of Rattus norvegicus NTSR1 in an active-like state, bound to NTS8–13, the carboxy-terminal portion of NTS responsible for agonist-induced activation of the receptor. The peptide agonist binds to NTSR1 in an extended conformation nearly perpendicular to the membrane plane, with the C terminus oriented towards the receptor core. Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first insight into the binding mode of a peptide agonist to a GPCR and may support the development of non-peptide ligands that could be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders, cancer and obesity. The X-ray crystal structure of a rat neurotensin receptor in complex with the C-terminal portion of neurotensin is presented; this is the first structure of a member of the β group of class A G-protein-coupled receptors. Neurotensin is a short peptide that can act as a neurotransmitter, a digestive hormone, and a regulator of cardiac output and blood pressure. In this manuscript, the authors solve an X-ray crystal structure of the carboxy-terminal portion of neurotensin bound to a rat neurotensin receptor. This is the first structure of a member of the beta group of class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and the first published structure of a GPCR bound to a peptide agonist. This structure should facilitate the development of non-peptide drugs that could be used to treat neurological disorders, cancer and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2035968737,"Increased mitochondrial calcium entry has been implicated in myocardial death, heart failure and related conditions. Here, the authors show that inhibition of the multifunctional Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in a mouse model of ischaemia reperfusion injury reduces infarct size and mitochondrial-triggered cell death and dysfunction. This is due to reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ entry through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter and enhanced Ca2+ tolerance of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This suggests that CaMKII inhibition could reduce adverse responses to common forms of pathological myocardial stress. Myocardial cell death is initiated by excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ entry causing Ca2+ overload, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and dissipation of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (ΔΨm)1,2. However, the signalling pathways that control mitochondrial Ca2+ entry through the inner membrane mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU)3,4,5 are not known. The multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is activated in ischaemia reperfusion, myocardial infarction and neurohumoral injury, common causes of myocardial death and heart failure; these findings suggest that CaMKII could couple disease stress to mitochondrial injury. Here we show that CaMKII promotes mPTP opening and myocardial death by increasing MCU current (IMCU). Mitochondrial-targeted CaMKII inhibitory protein or cyclosporin A, an mPTP antagonist with clinical efficacy in ischaemia reperfusion injury6, equivalently prevent mPTP opening, ΔΨm deterioration and diminish mitochondrial disruption and programmed cell death in response to ischaemia reperfusion injury. Mice with myocardial and mitochondrial-targeted CaMKII inhibition have reduced IMCU and are resistant to ischaemia reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction and neurohumoral injury, suggesting that pathological actions of CaMKII are substantially mediated by increasing IMCU. Our findings identify CaMKII activity as a central mechanism for mitochondrial Ca2+ entry in myocardial cell death, and indicate that mitochondrial-targeted CaMKII inhibition could prevent or reduce myocardial death and heart failure in response to common experimental forms of pathophysiological stress."
https://openalex.org/W2155574792,"The primary function of the thyroid gland is to metabolize iodide by synthesizing thyroid hormones, which are critical regulators of growth, development and metabolism in almost all tissues. So far, research on thyroid morphogenesis has been missing an efficient stem-cell model system that allows for the in vitro recapitulation of the molecular and morphogenic events regulating thyroid follicular-cell differentiation and subsequent assembly into functional thyroid follicles. Here we report that a transient overexpression of the transcription factors NKX2-1 and PAX8 is sufficient to direct mouse embryonic stem-cell differentiation into thyroid follicular cells that organize into three-dimensional follicular structures when treated with thyrotropin. These in vitro-derived follicles showed appreciable iodide organification activity. Importantly, when grafted in vivo into athyroid mice, these follicles rescued thyroid hormone plasma levels and promoted subsequent symptomatic recovery. Thus, mouse embryonic stem cells can be induced to differentiate into thyroid follicular cells in vitro and generate functional thyroid tissue."

Identification of cellular and molecular events in synapse formation and maintenance is a key step to understand human perception, learning, memory, and cognition. A key role for astrocytes in synapse formation and function has been proposed. Here, we show that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling is a novel synaptogenic pathway for cortical neurons induced by murine and human astrocytes. By combining gain and loss of function approaches, we show that TGF-β1 induces the formation of functional synapses in mice. Further, TGF-β1-induced synaptogenesis involves neuronal activity and secretion of the co-agonist of the NMDA receptor, d-serine. Manipulation of d-serine signaling, by either genetic or pharmacological inhibition, prevented the TGF-β1 synaptogenic effect. Our data show a novel molecular mechanism that might impact synaptic function and emphasize the evolutionary aspect of the synaptogenic property of astrocytes, thus shedding light on new potential therapeutic targets for synaptic deficit diseases.

Local structural differences were observed around D299G, but not around T399I, SNP site.These local differences cause the modulation of surface properties of TLR4, which may affect ligand binding.This study provides structural evidence of the functionality of the mutant TLR4 carrying the SNPs. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its coreceptor MD-2 recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and signal the innate immune response. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of human TLR4, D299G and T399I, have been identified and suggested to be associated with LPS hyporesponsiveness. Moreover, the SNPs have been proposed to be associated with a variety of infectious and noninfectious diseases. However, how the SNPs affect the function of TLR4 remains largely unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of the human TLR4 (D299G/T399I)·MD-2·LPS complex at 2.4 Å resolution. The ternary complex exhibited an agonistic ""m""-shaped 2:2:2 architecture that was similar to that of the human wild type TLR4·MD-2·LPS complex. Local structural differences that might affect the binding of the ligands were observed around D299G, but not around T399I, SNP site."
https://openalex.org/W2075100821,"Telomerase is an essential enzyme that counteracts the telomere attrition accompanying DNA replication during cell division. Regulation of the promoter activity of the gene encoding its catalytic subunit, the telomerase reverse transcriptase, is established as the dominant mechanism conferring the high telomerase activity in proliferating cells, such as embryonic stem and cancer cells. This study reveals a new mechanism of telomerase regulation through non-coding small RNA by showing that microRNA-498 (miR-498) induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) decreases the mRNA expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase. MiR-498 was first identified in a microarray analysis as the most induced microRNA by 1,25(OH)2D3 in ovarian cancer cells and subsequently validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays in multiple human cancer types. A functional vitamin D response element was defined in the 5-prime regulatory region of the miR-498 genome, which is occupied by the vitamin D receptor and its coactivators. Further studies showed that miR-498 targeted the 3-prime untranslated region of human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA and decreased its expression. The levels of miR-498 expression were decreased in malignant human ovarian tumors as well as human ovarian cancer cell lines. The ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to decrease human telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA and to suppress ovarian cancer growth was compromised when miR-498 was depleted using the sponges in cell lines and mouse tumor models. Taken together, our studies define a novel mechanism of telomerase regulation by small non-coding RNAs and identify miR-498 as an important mediator for the anti-tumor activity of 1,25(OH)2D3.

Telomeres maintain genomic stability by protecting the linear chromosome ends from being recognized as DNA breaks that would need repair. They undergo frequent remodeling during important biological events such as development, proliferation, and neoplastic transformation, etc. (1.Blackburn E.H. Switching and signaling at the telomere.Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). The telomeric TTAGGG repeats are replenished by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that consists of a catalytic reverse transcriptase protein subunit (e.g. TERT) (2.Harrington L. McPhail T.

Telomerase activity is very low in adult somatic cells, and the inability of DNA replication machinery to reproduce telomeres is the reason why cells show progressive telomere shortening with ongoing cell division until some telomeres reach a critically shortened length and induce a DNA damage checkpoint that causes replicative senescence. Proliferative cells such as embryonic stem and cancer cells contain high telomerase activity regulated primarily at the level of hTERT transcription (6.Wang S. Zhu J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 18842-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consistently, hTERT is overexpressed in almost 90% of human cancer cells by up to 100-fold over their normal counterpart, which confers a strong selective advantage for continued growth of malignant cells (7.Smith L.L. Coller H.A. Roberts J.M. Telomerase modulates expression of growth-controlling genes and enhances cell proliferation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Besides promoter regulation of the hTERT gene, little is known about other mechanisms that control telomerase activity, although post-translational modification of TERT has been reported (8.Liu K. Hodes R.J. Weng N. Cutting edge. Telomerase activation in human T lymphocytes does not require increase in telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) protein but is associated with hTERT phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.J.

MicroRNAs. Target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15907) Google Scholar). Different from small interference RNAs (siRNAs), which are often from exogenous sources, miRNAs are encoded by genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (10.Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S.

Bradley A. Identification of mammalian microRNA host genes and transcription units.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1902-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Once transcribed, primary miRNA transcripts are cleaved in the nucleus by the Drosha complex or spliced into precursor miRNAs of about 70 nucleotides and then cleaved in the cytoplasm by the Dicer complex into mature miRNA duplexes of about 22 nucleotides. One of the mature miRNA duplex strands is incorporated into the argonaute-containing RNA-induced silencing complex, whereas the other strand is released and degraded (12.Maniataki E. Mourelatos Z. A human, ATP-independent, RISC assembly machine fueled by pre-miRNA.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2979-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The miRNA strand in the RNA-induced silencing complex interacts with target messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules by either perfect or near perfect matches in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) whereby they induce mRNA degradation or translational inhibition (9.Bartel D.P.

Small RNAs with a big role in gene regulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (5647) Google Scholar). In humans, about 700 miRNAs have been identified, and more than one-third of all human genes have been predicted to be miRNA targets (9.Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs.

The active metabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3)) is not only known for its crucial role in maintaining mineral homeostasis and skeletal functions (17.Dusso A.S.

Vitamin D deficiency.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357: 266-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (10696) Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 exhibits antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and differentiation-inducing properties as well as immunomodulatory effects in a variety of human cancers (20.Garland C.F. Garland F.C. Gorham E.D. Lipkin M. Newmark H. Mohr S.B. Holick M.F. The role of vitamin D in cancer prevention.Am. J. Public Health. 2006; 96: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The biological effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 are mediated through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which belongs to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid nuclear hormone receptors (21.Evans R.M. The steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily.Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6322) Google Scholar, 22.Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Molecular mechanisms of action of steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily members.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the VDR forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to vitamin D-responsive elements (VDREs) in the regulatory region of target genes to activate or repress their transcription (23.Zou A.

This study identifies miR-498 as a primary target gene for 1,25(OH)2D3, which binds to the 3′-UTR of hTERT and decreases its mRNA expression to induce cell death. The studies reveal a new mechanism of telomerase regulation by vitamin D and define a role for miRNAs in mediating the tumor suppressive activity of the nutraceutical compound. 1,25(OH)2D3 was from Calbiochem. Baculovirus-expressed human VDR protein and human RXRβ protein were from Affinity BioReagents Inc. (Golden, CO). Anti-VDR antibody was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (San Diego, CA). OVCAR3, A2780, A2780-CP, and C13 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% FCS. OV2008, CAOV3, MCF-7, Ishikawa, and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% FCS. BG1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% FCS. All cells are maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Frozen human borderline and malignant ovarian tumor tissues were obtained from the Tissue Procurement Facility at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, and their usage for the studies was approved by the institutional review board at the University of South Florida. For miRNA microarray analyses, OVCAR3 cells of about 70% confluence were treated with vehicle control (ethanol (EtOH)) or 10−7 m 1,25(OH)2D3 for 6 days. Small RNAs were isolated from treated cells using the mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The miRNA microarray analysis was performed by LC Sciences (Houston, TX). Ten micrograms of total RNA were labeled with Cy3 (EtOH) or Cy5 (VD) fluorescent dyes, which produces a green and red color, respectively. Dye switching was performed to eliminate dye bias. Pairs of labeled samples were hybridized to dual-channel microarrays. Microarray assays were performed on a μParaFlo microfluidics chip with each of the detection probes containing a nucleotide sequence of coding segment complementary to a specific miRNA sequence. The arrays were designed to detect miRNA transcripts corresponding to 327 miRNAs contained in the Sanger miRBase Release 8.0. The maximum signal level of threshold and background probes was 190. Data were analyzed by subtracting the background followed by signal normalization with a LOWESS (locally weighted regression) filter. The ratio of the 2 sets of detected signals (log2 transformed and balanced) and the p values of the t test were calculated. Differentially detected signals were those with p values less than 0.01. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 1 μg of total cellular RNA with random hexamer primers and thermostable reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Analyses of hTERT and GAPDH expression by RT-PCR were performed as described previously (26.Jiang F. Bao J. Li P. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. Induction of ovarian cancer cell apoptosis by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 through the down-regulation of telomerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53213-53221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To quantify hTERT and GAPDH expression, PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel. PCR products were hybridized with a gene-specific probe, and signals were detected using a CSPD (Chloro-5-substituted adamantyl-1,2-dioxetane phosphate) chemiluminescence-based Southern blot analysis system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Small RNAs were isolated from tissues and cells using the mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Drosha, miR-498, and RNU6 (U6) expressions were measured by RT-PCR with following primers. Drosha primers were 5′-CACCTGTTCTAGCAGCTCAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCCCACTGAAGCATATTG-3′, miR-498 primers were 5′-TTTCAAGCCAGGGGGCGTTTTTC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCAAGCTCTGGAGGTGCTTTTC-3′, and U6 primers were 5′-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3′ and 5′-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3′. The amplification of target genes was carried out using 1 μl of reverse transcription product in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. The PCR reaction included a 5-min denaturation at 94 °C followed by 32 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 15 s with a final extension phase of 10 min. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Taqman microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to quantify mature miRNA expression as previously described (27.Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Real-time quantification of microRNAs by stem-loop RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4053) Google Scholar). U6 was used as endogenous control for miRNA expression studies. PCR reactions were performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1.33 μl of reverse transcription product, 1.0 μl of 5× TaqMan micro-assay mix, and 10 μl TaqMan 2× universal PCR Master Mix. Reactions were run on the ABI Prism 7900 Fast Real-Time PCR system in triplicate. The PCR reaction was conducted by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s of denaturing at 95 °C and 1 min of annealing at 60 °C. The miRNA expression level at each time point was normalized with cognate U6 level by subtracting the Cycle threshold (Ct) value for U6 from Ct for miR498 to produce a ΔCt. The -fold of induction over vehicle control was calculated based on the formula 2−(ΔCt(1,25(OH)2D3) − ΔCt(vehicle)). p91023B-VDR (28.Baker A.R. McDonnell D.P. Hughes M. Crisp T.M. Mangelsdorf D.J.

To construct miR-498 target validation vector, the 3′-UTR fragment of hTERT containing the miR-498 binding site was amplified by PCR (forward, 5′-GATCACTAGTTGGCCACCCGCCCACA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGAAAGCTTCCCCCATCCAGGTGCAGCTGGGT-3′) to generate SpeI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. To generate the control vector, 3′-UTR regions lacking the target site were amplified by PCR (forward, 5′-GATCACTAGTCCCGGGACGACGCT-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGAAAGCTTGGGTCCTTCTCAGGGT-3′). The amplified fragments were cloned into the SpeI and HindIII sites of pMIR-Report luciferase vector (Ambion). To construct the miR-498 expression vector, pre-miR-498 double-stranded oligos were synthesized and inserted into the EcoRI site of pBS/U6 vector.

To generate pGL3-VDRE1 luciferase, the VDRE1 (585 bp) fragment was generated by PCR using primers 5′-CGGCTAGCGGAATTACCCTCCCCGCTCGAGTTCATCAGGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCCCCGGGTTAAAACCCAGACTCTGAGACCA-3′ (reverse) and cloned into the NheI and SmaI sites of pGL3-promoter vector. pGL3-VDRE2 luciferase was constructed similarly by generating a NheI site at the 5′-end and a SmaI at the 3′ end of the VDRE2 fragment (407 bp). The sequence of VDRE2 primers is 5′-CGGCTAGCTATCTGTCGACGCGTTTGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCCCCGGGAGGCCCTCATTCTGTTACTTCTT-3′ (reverse). To mutate VDRE2 luciferase reporter, CA dinucleotides in the second half-site were replaced with TT using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The forward (5′-GCTTAATACCTAGCTCAATAGGTTTTGCAAACCACCACGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCGTGGTGGTTTGCAAAACCTATTGACCTAGGTATTAAGC-3′) primers were designed according to manufacturer's instructions. The PCR reactions were started with incubation at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 18 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C and a final 5-min extension at 68 °C. The PCR products were digested with 10 units of DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C before being transformed into the XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells. After transformed colonies were screened by PCR, the mutant plasmids produced from the clones were isolated, purified, and sequenced. Vectors expressing control and miR-498 “sponges” were constructed based on a method described in previous reports (16.Valastyan S. Reinhardt F. Benaich N. Calogrias D. Szász A.M. Wang Z.C. Brock J.E.

Oligos with seven repetitive miR-498 complementary sequences were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Each segment was designed with no spacers for miR-498 sponge (miR-498-SP) or with a four-nucleotide spacer at positions 9–12 for bulged sponge (miR-498-bSP). The entire cassette was cloned into the pBabe-puro vector digested with BamHI and SalI. The control sponge was designed based on a non-existent miRNA targeting CXCR4 as described previously (29.Ebert M.S. Neilson J.R. Sharp P.A. MicroRNA sponges. Competitive inhibitors of small RNAs in mammalian cells.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). Drosha-specific siRNA was synthesized by Thermo Fischer Scientific (Waltham, MA). The sense and antisense sequences of Drosha siRNA oligos were 5′-AAGGACCAAGUAUUCAGCAAGdTdT-3′ and 5′-CUUGCUGAAUACUUGGUCCUUdTdT-3′, respectively. Nonspecific scrambled siRNA oligos were used as controls. 2′-O-Methyl (2′-O-me) siRNA oligonucleotides (antisense inhibition of miR-498) were synthesized by Ambion. The sequence of 2′-O-me-anti-miR-498 (2′-O-me-miR-498) is 5′-UUUCAAGCCAGGGGGCGUUUUUC-3′. 2′-O-me-scrambled miR (2′-O-me-control) (5′-AAAACCUUUUGACCGAGCGUGUU-3′) was used as a control. For transfections, cells were plated at 1.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. One day after plating, transfections were performed with Lipofectamine following the protocol from Invitrogen. Forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with either vehicle (EtOH)) or 10−7 m 1,25(OH)2D3. For longer treatments, cells were placed in fresh medium with new compounds every 2 days. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (24.Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. G2/M arrest by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in ovarian cancer cells mediated through the induction of GADD45 via an exonic enhancer.J. Biol.

For the establishment of stable clones, OVCAR3 or OV2008 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pBABE vector expressing control or MiR-498 sponges and the pGL3 control plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The stable clones were obtained through selection with 2 μg/ml puromycin for about 5 weeks. Telomerase activity was measured by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay using the telomerase PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) as described (26.Jiang F. Bao J. Li P. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. Induction of ovarian cancer cell apoptosis by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 through the down-regulation of telomerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53213-53221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The expression levels of mature miRNAs in tissue samples and cells were also measured by RPAs with a mirVana miRNA detection kit (Ambion). Small RNA from different tissues and cells were isolated for RT-PCR. Probes for miRNA detection were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and end-labeled with 32P using the mirVana probe and marker kit (Ambion). Briefly, 1 μg total RNA was incubated with 32P-labeled probes, which were prepared by [γ-32P]ATP using a T4 polynucleotide kinase labeling system. After digestion to remove the probe that was not bound by target miRNA, the radiolabeled products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 15% gel. The signals were visualized and quantified with a phosphorimaging system (Bio-Rad). EMSA was performed as described previously (31.Li P. Lee H. Guo S. Unterman T.G. Jenster G. Bai W. AKT-independent protection of prostate cancer cells from apoptosis mediated through complex formation between the androgen receptor and FKHR.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 104-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with 32P using a T4 polynucleotide kinase labeling system (Invitrogen). 1 μl of radiolabeled probe (about 50,000 cpm) was mixed with 19 μl of DNA binding reaction mixture that contained 250 ng of VDR and RXR in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10−7 m 1,25(OH)2D3. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. For competition and supershift experiments, VDR and RXR proteins were preincubated with a 100-fold excess of cold VDRE1 or VDRE2 probes and 2 μg of VDR antibody, respectively, on ice for 20 min before EMSA reactions. The reaction mixture was resolved in a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and protein-oligo complexes were revealed by autoradiography. The sequence in sense orientation of oligonucleotides used for producing complementary double-strand oligos is: VDRE1, 5′-CATCAGGTGAGGAAGTTGAGACC-3′; VDRE2, 5′-CCTAGGTCAATAGGTTCAGCAA-3′; hOC, 5′-ACTCACCGGGATGAACGGGGGCATT-3′. For ChIP assays, OVCAR3 cells were treated with EtOH or 10−7 m 1,25(OH)2D3 for 60 min and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. Then the cells were lysed in buffer containing 5 mm PIPES (pH 8.0), 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. Cell nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture. Soluble chromatin was prepared by sonication and diluted in buffer containing 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitates were prepared with rat anti-VDR antibody or rat IgG (Sigma). 24-Hydroxylase (CYP24) was used as a positive control. DNA was extracted from the immunocomplexes using a QIAquick spin kit. 2 μl (of 30 μl) of the DNA extracts were used for PCR with primers: VDRE1, forward, 5′- ATGATTCCTAGCTAGCGAGATATAGATGATATCAGA-3′; reverse, 5′- AACCATAGTCTTCCCCCGGGTGGGTGTGAATTCCCAGT-3′; VDRE2, forward, 5′-ACTGGAACCTTGCCTGGCCA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCAGGCCCTCATTCTGTTA-3′; CYP24, forward, 5′-CAGACGCGGCAGCTTTTCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGTTTCCTCCTGTCCCTCTC-3′. PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. To determine the apoptotic index, cells were treated with EtOH or 10−7 m 1,25(OH)2D3 for 6 days, harvested by trypsin digestion, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell suspensions were incubated with phycoerythrin (PE) and 7-amino-actinomycin according to manufacturer's protocol (PE Annexin V kit, BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was performed in a FACScan (BD Biosciences). For each data point, duplicate samples were analyzed, and the experiment was reproduced three times. To analyze cell growth, methylthiazole tetrazolium assays were performed as described previously (32.Mosmann T. Rapid colorimetric assay for cellular growth and survival. Application to proliferation and cytotoxicity assays.J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46439) Google Scholar).

The Notch signaling pathway is a well known regulator of skeletal muscle stem cells known as satellite cells. Loss of Notch1 signaling leads to spontaneous myogenic differentiation. Notch1, normally expressed in satellite cells, is targeted for proteasomal degradation by Numb during differentiation. A homolog of Notch1, Notch3, is also expressed in these cells but is not inhibited by Numb. We find that Notch3 is paradoxically up-regulated during the early stages of differentiation by an enhancer that requires both MyoD and activated Notch1. Notch3 itself strongly inhibits the myogenic transcription factor Mef2c, most likely by increasing the p38 phosphatase Mkp1, which inhibits the Mef2c activator p38 MAP kinase. Active Notch3 decreases differentiation. Mef2c, however, induces microRNAs miR-1 and miR-206, which directly down-regulate Notch3 and allow differentiation to proceed. Thus, the myogenic differentiation-induced microRNAs miR-1 and -206 are important for differentiation at least partly because they turn off Notch3. We suggest that the transient expression of Notch3 early in differentiation generates a temporal lag between myoblast activation by MyoD and terminal differentiation into myotubes directed by Mef2c."
https://openalex.org/W2025988357,"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is expressed predominantly in tissues exposed to high levels of bile acids and controls bile acid and lipid homeostasis. FXR(-/-) mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and show an increased prevalence for intestinal malignancies, suggesting a role of FXR as a tumor suppressor in enterohepatic tissues. The N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) has been recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, which is downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma and many other malignancies.We show reduced NDRG2 mRNA in livers of FXR(-/-) mice compared to wild type mice and both, FXR and NDRG2 mRNAs, are reduced in human HCC compared to normal liver. Gene reporter assays and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation data support that FXR directly controls NDRG2 transcription via IR1-type element(s) identified in the first introns of the human, mouse and rat NDRG2 genes. NDRG2 mRNA was induced by non-steroidal FXR agonists in livers of mice and the magnitude of induction of NDRG2 mRNA in three different human hepatoma cell lines was increased when ectopically expressing human FXR. Growth and metastasis of SK-Hep-1 cells was strongly reduced by non-steroidal FXR agonists in an orthotopic liver xenograft tumor model. Ectopic expression of FXR in SK-Hep1 cells reduced tumor growth and metastasis potential of corresponding cells and increased the anti-tumor efficacy of FXR agonists, which may be partly mediated via increased NDRG2 expression. FXR agonists may show a potential in the prevention and/or treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma, a devastating malignancy with increasing prevalence and limited therapeutic options."

Macrophage ABCA1 has been previously shown to suppress the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine. In the present study, we demonstrate that ABCA1 also promotes the secretion of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine critical for inflammation resolution. ABCA1+/+ bone marrow-derived macrophages secrete more IL-10 but less proinflammatory cytokines than ABCA1−/− bone marrow-derived macrophages, similar to alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. We present evidence that ABCA1 activates PKA and that this elevated PKA activity contributes to M2-like inflammatory response from ABCA1+/+ bone marrow-derived macrophages. Furthermore, cholesterol lowering by statins, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, or filipin also activates PKA and, consequently, transforms macrophages toward M2-like phenotype. Conversely, cholesterol enrichment suppresses PKA activity and promotes M1-like inflammatory response. As the primary function of ABCA1 is cholesterol removal, our results suggest that ABCA1 activates PKA by regulating cholesterol. Indeed, forced cholesterol enrichment in ABCA1-expressing macrophages suppresses PKA activation and elicits M1-like response. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel protective process by ABCA1-activated PKA in macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2159435454,"Pest Risk Analyses (PRAs) are conducted worldwide to decide whether and how exotic plant pests should be regulated to prevent invasion. There is an increasing demand for science-based risk mapping in PRA. Spread plays a key role in determining the potential distribution of pests, but there is no suitable spread modelling tool available for pest risk analysts. Existing models are species specific, biologically and technically complex, and data hungry. Here we present a set of four simple and generic spread models that can be parameterised with limited data. Simulations with these models generate maps of the potential expansion of an invasive species at continental scale. The models have one to three biological parameters. They differ in whether they treat spatial processes implicitly or explicitly, and in whether they consider pest density or pest presence/absence only. The four models represent four complementary perspectives on the process of invasion and, because they have different initial conditions, they can be considered as alternative scenarios. All models take into account habitat distribution and climate. We present an application of each of the four models to the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, using historic data on its spread in Europe. Further tests as proof of concept were conducted with a broad range of taxa (insects, nematodes, plants, and plant pathogens). Pest risk analysts, the intended model users, found the model outputs to be generally credible and useful. The estimation of parameters from data requires insights into population dynamics theory, and this requires guidance. If used appropriately, these generic spread models provide a transparent and objective tool for evaluating the potential spread of pests in PRAs. Further work is needed to validate models, build familiarity in the user community and create a database of species parameters to help realize their potential in PRA practice."

The protein specifically recognizes 5'-triphosphorylated RNA structures that are released into the cell by viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C. To understand the energetic basis for viral RNA recognition by RIG-I, we studied the binding of RIG-I domain variants to a family of dsRNA ligands. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the isolated RIG-I domains each make important contributions to affinity and that they interact using different strategies. Covalent linkage between the domains enhances RNA ligand specificity while reducing overall binding affinity, thereby providing a mechanism for discriminating virus from host RNA."

Unfortunately, there is still no effective therapy to this fatal disease and the median survival is generally less than one year from the time of diagnosis. Discovery of ligands that can bind specifically to this type of tumor cells will be of great significance to develop early molecular imaging, targeted delivery and guided surgery methods to battle this type of brain tumor.We discovered two target-specific aptamers named GBM128 and GBM131 against cultured human glioblastoma cell line U118-MG after 30 rounds selection by a method called cell-based Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (cell-SELEX). These two aptamers have high affinity and specificity against target glioblastoma cells. They neither recognize normal astraglial cells, nor do they recognize other normal and cancer cell lines tested. Clinical tissues were also tested and the results showed that these two aptamers can bind to different clinical glioma tissues but not normal brain tissues. More importantly, binding affinity and selectivity of these two aptamers were retained in complicated biological environment.The selected aptamers could be used to identify specific glioblastoma biomarkers. Methods of molecular imaging, targeted drug delivery, ligand guided surgery can be further developed based on these ligands for early detection, targeted therapy, and guided surgery of glioblastoma leading to effective treatment of glioblastoma."

Cells were treated with 100 nm dexa for 24, 48, or 72 h, respectively for RNA extraction, protein extraction, and ATM-dependent phosphorylation evaluations.TABLE 1Genotypes of AT lymphoblastoid cell linesGenotypeAllele 1Allele 2MutationConsequenceMutationConsequenceAT28RMcpd Htz5692C→TNonsense/truncationIVS37 + 2T→CSplicing/truncationAT50RMcpd Htz7792C→TNonsense/truncation8283delTCDeletion/truncationAT129RMHmz8283delTCDeletion/truncation8283delTCDeletion/truncation Open table in a new tab Total RNA was extracted from LCLs treated or not with dexa using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was obtained by PowerScript reverse transcriptase (Clontech). Long distance PCRs were performed by the Advantage 2 PCR kit (Clontech) with specific primers to amplify the CDS of the ATM gene, whereas all other routine PCRs were carried out using the Hot-Rescue DNA polymerase kit (Diatheva). To perform the S1 nuclease protection assay, a specific DNA probe complementary to ATMdexa1 junction was designed. Labeling of the DNA probe was performed by [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) incorporation using Klenow fragment, and probe was purified by gel permeation. Total RNA extracted from treated AT cell lines was hybridized with the radiolabeled probe for 18 h at 68 °C after which the hybridization mixture was subjected to S1 nuclease (Promega) digestion. Digested products were finally analyzed on 4% urea-PAGE, and dried gel exposed over Bio-Rad imaging screen cassette was subsequently analyzed using the Bio-Rad GS 250 molecular imager system. One-microgram aliquots of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers as primers and the SMARTScribe reverse transcriptase from Clontech according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized cDNAs were then diluted 1/5 and used as templates in SYBR Green quantitative real time PCR assays, performed with the Hot-Rescue real time PCR kit (Diatheva). PCR reactions were set up in a volume of 25 μl containing 0.3 μm of gene-specific primers, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.625 units of Hot-Rescue DNA polymerase, and 1 μl of diluted cDNA. DNA amplifications were carried out in the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system platform (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate, and multiple blanks were included in each analysis. Quantitative real time PCR primers were obtained from Sigma-Genosys. HPRT1 gene from Homo sapiens was used as internal standard (HPRT1 forward TATGCTGAGGATTTGGAAAGGG and reverse AGAGGGCTACAATGTGATGG). Primer sequences designed to specifically recognize the ATMdexa1 variant were: forward ATCTAGATCGGCATTCAGATTCCA and reverse GTTTAGTAATTGGCTGGTCTGC, whereas primer sequences designed to amplify the native ATM were: forward AAATTCTAGTGCCAGTCAGAGC and reverse TTGCTTTAATCACATGCGATGG. Cycle conditions were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 two-step cycles of 20 s at 94 °C and 40 s at 68 °C for HPRT1 and native ATM, whereas for ATMdexa1 amplification, we set up 40 three-step cycles (15 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 65 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C). Amplification plots were analyzed using the 7500 System SDS software (Applied Biosystems), and relative expression data were calculated with the 2−ΔΔCt method as described by Winer et al. (19.Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Development and validation of real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for monitoring gene expression in cardiac myocytes in vitro.Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The specificity of the amplification products was confirmed by examining thermal denaturation plots, by sample separation in a 2% DNA-agarose gel, and by amplicon sequencing. HeLa cells were transfected with the noncanonical spliced ATMdexa1 transcript to assess the mRNA translation. The mammalian expression vector p3×Flag-CMVTM-14 (Sigma) was used for HeLa transfection by ESCORTTM IV transfection reagent (Sigma). In detail, the cDNA of interest was cloned into p3×Flag vector in-frame with GFP so that any translation of ATMdexa1, harboring the PI3K domain in the correct frame, would determine the subsequent translation of the GFP. Transfected cells were subjected to fluorescent microscopy observation and Western blotting for the detection of the translated fusion protein. Microscopic observations were performed by Leica DMLB fluorescent microscope equipped with a DC300F CCD camera. To confirm ATMdexa1 translation in yeasts and to identify the start codon used on ATMdexa1 mRNA, p426-based vectors were employed to transform INVsc1 yeast strain (Invitrogen). Briefly, full ATMdexa1 and the second half of the same cDNA, immediately downstream of the putative start codon (Met-825), were cloned in p426 expression vector to produce recombinant His-tagged proteins (Fig. 1). Recombinant proteins were purified through nickel-Sepharose high performance (Amersham Biosciences) affinity chromatography, from INVsc1 transformed with p426His-ATMdexa1-His and p426His-MetMet-His constructs, respectively, and analyzed by Western blotting. Yeast strains lacking ATM homologue were used in the complementation assay to investigate the functionality of the translated ATMdexa1 protein. In particular, KSC1368 (single mutant for the ATM yeast homolog, tel1Δ) and KSC1402 (double mutant for homologues of ATM and ATR, mec1-81Δtel1Δ) yeast strains were kindly supplied by Prof. Katsunori Sugimoto (20.Nakada D. Shimomura T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. The ATM-related Tel1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae controls a checkpoint response following phleomycin treatment.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ATMdexa1 complementation assay was performed using pYES2 (Invitrogen) or pYES2-ATMdexa1 to transform KSC yeasts. Recombinants were grown on solid or liquid selective medium. Serial dilutions of transformed cells were seeded on solid selective medium containing 5 μg/ml phleomycin at pH 8.0. Transfected yeasts were also inoculated in liquid selective medium supplemented with phleomycin, and growth was monitored for 18 h. Recombinant GST-miniATM was produced in Escherichia coli and purified, under native conditions, by GSH-agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich), to be employed in an in vitro kinase assay essentially as described by Sarkaria et al. (21.Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinases by the radiosensitizing agent wortmannin.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant ATM was diluted in kinase buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 6000 Ci/mmol), and 25 μg/μl PHAS-I (Sigma), with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm NaOV3, in a total volume reaction of 40 μl. Kinase reactions were conducted for 30 min at 30 °C. Different conditions were tested including two ATM concentrations both in the absence and in the presence of the specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. In the appropriate conditions, proteins were preincubated with 400 nm wortmannin for 30 min at room temperature before running the kinase reaction. Reactions were stopped with 4× Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed on 14% SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity was revealed by a Bio-Rad GS 250 molecular imager. Human lymphoblastoid cell lines established from AT patients were treated with 100 nm dexa. After 48 h, total proteins were extracted from treated and untreated cells, 20 μg/sample was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose, and membrane was probed with anti-ATM antibodies. To determine the subcellular localization of miniATM, AT LCLs were transfected with a p3×Flag-based vector to express the identified miniATM protein fused to its C terminus with GFP or FLAG peptide. Transient transfection was performed through electroporation essentially as reported by Ref. 22.Xia F. Liber H.L. Electroporation of human lymphoblastoid cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 48: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar; 1 × 108 cells were added with 30 μg of plasmid, subjected to electric shock, and grown for 48 h in complete RPMI. Protein expression was then assessed by fluorescence microscopy, and fluorescent emission was used to determine the subcellular localization of miniATM in expressing cells. Localization was also performed by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were layered on a polylysine-treated glass coverslip and subsequently fixed by 4% formaldehyde in PBS. After treatment in cold methanol and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, surfaces were blocked by 3% BSA and 5% goat serum solution in PBS. Anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used 1/80 in 1% BSA/PBS solution, whereas the secondary anti-mouse TRITC-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was utilized 1/150 in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing procedures, DNA was stained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Washed slides were mounted and embedded with ProLong antifade reagent (Invitrogen). To confirm a regained kinase activity in AT LCLs by dexa, likely through miniATM induction, we developed an in vitro assay along the lines of Shiotani and Zou (23.Shiotani B. Zou L. A human cell extract-based assay for the activation of ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 782: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This assay provides an “ex vivo ” kinase assay thanks to native protein extraction and the addition of DNA double strand breaks. We optimized the assay to our needs using total protein extracts from control and treated LCLs, adding DNA double strand breaks with no overhangs to selectively induce ATM activity despite the activity of ATR (23.Shiotani B. Zou L. A human cell extract-based assay for the activation of ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 782: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and investigating the phosphorylation of H2A.X substrate (24.Yuan J. Adamski R. Chen J. Focus on histone variant H2AX: to be or not to be.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3717-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In particular, total protein extracts were obtained through mild sonication in nondenaturing lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.2% Tween 20). Equivalent amounts of protein (20 μg) were diluted in reaction buffer and ATP buffer, as reported (23.Shiotani B. Zou L. A human cell extract-based assay for the activation of ATM and ATR checkpoint kinases.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 782: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 160 ng of blunt-ended plasmid DNA in a total 40-μl volume reaction. Reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Nitrocellulose membranes were finally incubated with primary antibody against phospho-H2A.X in serine 139. Concurrently, the same assay using control protein extract from untreated AT LCLs supplemented with recombinant GST-miniATM was performed. For ATM half-life determination, all LCLs were treated with 25 μm cycloheximide (Sigma; stock solution 25 mg/ml in ethanol, stored at −20 °C) 48 h after dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/dexa addition. Samples were harvested just before cycloheximide treatment, for the time point 0, whereas the others were collected after 2, 4, and 8 h after the addition of the translation inhibitor. Cell extracts were prepared for Western immunoblot analysis. Antibodies used in Western blotting analyses were: anti-GFP, anti-ATM H-248, anti-ATM 2C1, and anti-B-glucuronidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-ATM core protein (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-histidine tag (Serotec); anti-AKT and phospho-specific antibodies against AKT(Ser-473), c-RAF(Ser-338), ERK1/2(Thr-202/Tyr-204), Chk1(Ser-345) (purchased from Cell Signaling Technology); anti-H2A.XSer139 (Millipore); and anti-ATM 1B10 (Abnova). With the initial aim of finding possible exon-skipping events, we performed long distance PCR (from start to stop codon of ATM CDS) on cDNA obtained from lymphoblastoid cell lines established from AT patients, treated or not with dexa. Although in control samples the ∼9000-bp amplicon representing the whole CDS of native ATM mRNA was detected, in tester samples a smaller PCR product was observed (Fig. 2A). The sequence revealed an unusual splicing event using nucleotides 255 and 7843 as alternative 5′ and 3′ excision sites (Fig. 2B). This causes the complete deletion of the exons from 4 to 51 and the joining of exon fragments 3 and 52. Unexpectedly, an SDR sequence of CCTCA at the 3′ end was identical to that of the immediate upstream 5′ end of the deleted sequence; one copy of the SDR was excised, and the other copy was retained in the resultant transcript. This new ATM transcript has been identified in all tested LCLs treated with dexa, including both wild type and ATM-mutated lines (see Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Quantification of ATMdexa1 and full-length ATM versus ATMdexa1, by quantitative real time PCR. A, ATMdexa1 transcript was quantified in wild type and AT lymphoblastoid cells receiving 100 nm dexa with respect to untreated LCLs. In AT samples, the drug treatment leads to ATMdexa1 overexpression, whereas WT resulted in minimal or negative affect by the drug. AT cells are more sensitive to dexa exposure, ranging from 4- to 35-fold change overexpression. (p < 0.05 Wilcoxon matched pairs test n = 6). B, raw data from full-length ATM and ATMdexa1 mRNA quantification were compared by box and whiskers plot. Target amounts are reported in Log10 ^ΔCT (HPRT1 as housekeeping gene). Although the amount of ATMdexa1 resulted in marked increase only in treated AT LCLs (p < 0.05 Wilcoxon matched pairs test), the full-length mRNA was unaffected by dexa (p < 0.05 Wilcoxon matched pairs test n = 6). Based on these results, ATMdexa1 formation is independent of full-length ATM mRNA synthesis, suggesting that the alternative spliced ATMdexa1 variant is directly prompted by dexa. atmFL, full-Length ATM; atmXA1, ATMdexa1. Error bars indicate mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because experimental evidences prove that some of the noncanonical splicing events described in the literature could be in vitro artifacts generated by reverse transcriptase (25.Houseley J. Tollervey D. Apparent non-canonical trans-splicing is generated by reverse transcriptase in vitro.PLoS. One. 2010; 5: e12271Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we performed an S1 nuclease protection assay to directly prove the new ATM variant authenticity (Fig. 2C). We designed a DNA probe complementary to the mRNA region surrounding the noncanonical exons 3–52 junction of ATM (Fig. 2D). The probe contained 6 mismatching nucleotides 20 residues before its 5′ terminus (total length 384 nucleotides) to distinguish the protected probe from the undigested one. As reported in Fig. 2C, we were able to detect the protected probe (360 residues long), proving the actual existence of the alternative spliced ATM variant induced by dexa (ATMdexa1). Surprisingly, an additional band just below the expected one was identified. By in silico analysis, we found an alternative hybridization event that leads to a larger mismatch producing a shorter protected probe (351 nucleotides in length). Moreover, the hybridization of the probe on the precursor of the ATM transcript generates two truncated bands because of the binding upstream and downstream of the junction (bands of 131 bp, out of gel resolution range, and of 234 bp, respectively). The extent of ATMdexa1 transcript expression, in the presence and in the absence of dexa stimulus, was evaluated by quantitative real time PCR. Suitable primers, surrounding the noncanonical spliced ATMdexa1 junction, were designed to selectively amplify the newly identified transcript at the expense of the full-length one. The average Ct values for ATMdexa1 were normalized against average Ct values for the HPRT1 transcript used as housekeeping gene. The expression differences in three AT and one WT LCLs were extrapolated. In the presence of dexa stimulus, ATMdexa1 expression resulted in marked increase (up to 35-fold change increase) in all tested ATM−/− LCLs (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, ATMdexa1 expression in wild type LCL was minimally or negatively affected by the drug. To prove that the action of dexamethasone relies on the noncanonical splicing induction and exclude a generic effect on the overall ATM expression, the expression of the native full-length messenger was also estimated. Only in two LCLs (AT50RM and AT129RM), a very slightly induction, statistically not significant, of the transcript was observed (with a magnitude up to 100-fold lower when compared with ATMdexa1), whereas in WT and in AT28RM, a down-expression was evidenced (Fig. 3B). The sequence analysis of the ATMdexa1 transcript revealed that the canonical ATM start codon leads to a truncated protein due to a reading frameshift occurring after the described exon junction (Fig. 4). At any rate, various start codons following native ATG could theoretically prime the translation of several ORFs. The translation of these ORFs would escape the mutations contained in the analyzed cDNA maintaining the complete PI3K domain of the native protein. To verify the actual recognition and translation of one of the ORFs, the whole isolated cDNA of ATMdexa1 was cloned in a mammalian expression vector, fused in its 3′ terminus to a GFP, and subsequently transfected into HeLa cells. As reported in Fig. 5A, the GFP fluorescence was detectable in transfected cells, proving that alternative start codons of ATMdexa1 could be effectively recognized and translated in vivo. Protein extracts from transfected and untransfected cells were also tested by Western blotting using anti-GFP and two different anti-ATM antibodies recognizing the core (amino acids 1248–1332) and the C terminus (H-248, amino acids 2830–3056) of the WT protein, respectively. Immunoreactivity with anti-GFP and ATM H-248 revealed, in transfected cells, the same band with an electrophoretic mobility of about 60 kDa corresponding to the fusion protein ATMdexa1-GFP (predicted molecular mass of the longest ORF fused with GFP ∼56 kDa) (Fig. 5B). No bands were detected with both antibodies in untransfected cells. As further evidence, the antibody raised against the amino acids 1248–1332 was not able to recognize the fused protein (last panel) because this region is deleted in the putative ATM variant protein.FIGURE 5Translation of the ATMdexa1 transcript. A, fluorescence imaging of HeLa cells transfected with p3×Flag-ATMdexa1-GFP fusion protein. GFP translation has been placed in subordination to ATMdexa1 PI3K domain translation in the p3×Flag expression vector and used to transfect HeLa cells. B, Western blots performed on protein extracts from control and transfected HeLa cells revealed a fusion protein recognized both by anti-GFP and by anti-ATM antibodies. In particular, ATM antibody H-248 raised against the C terminus of ATM protein cross-reacted with ATMdexa1-GFP protein, whereas ATM antibody raised against amino acids (aa) in the central portion of the native protein did not. C, identification of the start codon on ATMdexa1 was performed by cloning both the full-length cDNA of ATMdexa1 and the second half of the same cDNA downstream of the putative ATG revealed by in silico ORF prediction (named MetMet, see also Fig. 4). Both constructs were transformed in yeast INVsc strain, and recombinant His-tagged proteins were purified; immunoblot revealed the same band from both recombinants, proving that translation is prompted by the putative ATG at position 825 or downstream giving a protein with the entire PI3K domain (miniATM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATMdexa1 start codon identification was performed by cloning both the entire ATMdexa1 cDNA and the second half of the transcript downstream of position 825 (Fig. 4, blue sequence) in a double-His-tagged yeast expression vector (tags in the N and C terminus).

https://openalex.org/W2042763822,"The RING finger nuclear factor RNF168 is required for recruitment of several DNA damage response factors to double strand breaks (DSBs), including 53BP1 and BRCA1. Because 53BP1 and BRCA1 function antagonistically during the DSB repair pathway homologous recombination (HR), the influence of RNF168 on HR has been unclear. We report that RNF168 depletion causes an elevated frequency of two distinct HR pathways (homology-directed repair and single strand annealing), suppresses defects in HR caused by BRCA1 silencing, but does not suppress HR defects caused by disruption of CtIP, RAD50, BRCA2, or RAD51. Furthermore, RNF168-depleted cells can form ionizing radiation-induced foci of the recombinase RAD51 without forming BRCA1 ionizing radiation-induced foci, indicating that this loss of BRCA1 recruitment to DSBs does not reflect a loss of function during HR. Additionally, we find that RNF168 and 53BP1 have a similar influence on HR. We suggest that RNF168 is important for HR defects caused by BRCA1 loss.

However, these two DNA damage response factors appear to act antagonistically during DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR), in that the loss of 53BP1 can rescue HR in BRCA1-deficient cells (5Bunting S.F.

Thus, determining how RNF168 influences HR, relative to BRCA1 and 53BP1, is important to understand its role during genome maintenance. HR includes at least two distinct pathways (7Moynahan M.E.

J. 2009; 423: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Homology-directed repair (HDR) is a conservative HR pathway that involves strand invasion of a homologous template via the recombinase RAD51, followed by nascent DNA synthesis. In contrast, single strand annealing (SSA) is a nonconservative HR pathway that bridges two homologous segments that flank a DSB, thereby causing a deletion between the homologous segments. Accordingly, a key mechanistic distinction between HDR and SSA is the relative requirement for RAD51, in that RAD51 and its co-factor BRCA2 are required for HDR but inhibit SSA (9Stark J.M.

In contrast, several factors that influence DSB end processing mutually affect HDR and SSA.

We show that depletion of RNF168 causes an elevated frequency of HDR and SSA and substantially suppresses HR defects (HDR, SSA, and RAD51 IRIF) and anaphase chromosome separation defects caused by BRCA1 silencing. Furthermore, we find that cells depleted of RNF168 can form RAD51 IRIF without forming BRCA1 IRIF. In contrast, depletion of RNF168 does not suppress HR defects in cells deficient in several other HR factors (CtIP, RAD50, BRCA2, and RAD51). Finally, we show that 53BP1 influences HR similarly to RNF168. These findings indicate that RNF168 is important for HR defects caused by BRCA1 silencing. The U2OS reporter cell lines were described previously (19Gunn A. Bennardo N. Cheng A. Stark J.M.

To generate the siRNF168#18-resistant expression vector, silent mutations were introduced into FLAG-RNF168 WT and C19S (23Lilley C.E. Chaurushiya M.S. Boutell C. Landry S. Suh J. Panier S.

To generate pCAGGS-dn53BP1, a segment of 53BP1 (encoding amino acids Asp-1052 to Pro-1639) was fused downstream from tandem nuclear localization signals and a HA immunotag, which was then inserted into pCAGGS-BSKX (9Stark J.M.

For RNAi, 1 × 105 cells were plated on top of a mixture of 5 pmol of each siRNA incubated with 1.8 μl of RNAiMAX for 25 min. For experiments with two different siRNAs, siCTRL is added to each of the single siRNA transfections to ensure the same total concentration of siRNA (10 pmol). Two days after siRNA transfection, these cells were co-transfected with siRNA as described above (10 pmol total) with 0.8 μg of I-SceI expression vector (pCBASce) using 3.6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Some I-SceI transfections also included 0.4 μg of pCAGGS-FLAG-RNF168, 0.4 μg of pCAGGS-dn53BP1, 0.4 μg of pCAGGS-BSKX (EV), 0.4 μg of BARD1-hb202, 0.2 μg of BRC3, or 0.1 μg of RAD51-K133R. For 53BP1−/− experiments, 105 cells were plated 1 day prior to transfection with 0.8 μg of pCBASce along either with 0.8 μg of 53BP1 expression vector (24Dimitrova N. Chen Y.C. Spector D.L. de Lange T. 53BP1 promotes non-homologous end joining of telomeres by increasing chromatin mobility.Nature. 2008; 456: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) or a control empty vector (pCMV/EV) or with a GFP expression vector alone (pCAGGS-NZEGFP) (25Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. XRCC3 promotes homology-directed repair of DNA damage in mammalian cells.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), each with 3.6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Three days after I-SceI transfection, the percentage of GFP+ cells was determined by FACS analysis (CYAN ADP, Dako). For comparison, the repair value for each transfection was divided by the mean repair value for the parallel control transfection (i.e., siCTRL and/or EV). Additionally, absolute GFP+ frequencies are presented in supplemental Table S1. The repair values are the means of at least three independent transfections, error bars reflect the standard deviation, and statistics were performed with the unpaired t test. For immunoblot analysis, protein was extracted 2 days after transfection using 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% IGEPAL, 1 mm DTT, and Roche protease inhibitor mixture and eight freeze/thaw cycles. Equal amounts of protein (Bio-Rad protein assay) were loaded for each immunoblot. The blots were probed with the following antibodies for detection by ECL (GE/Amersham Biosciences): BRCA1 (Abcam, ab16780), RNF168 (Millipore, 06-1130), actin (Sigma, A2066), 53BP1 (Abcam, ab36823), GAPDH (Abcam, ab9482), and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2004 and sc-2005). For cell cycle analysis, 2 days after siRNA treatment, the cells were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 10 mm) for 1 h, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody (BD Biosciences, 51–33284X) and propidium iodide (Sigma). The values are the means of three independent transfections, and statistics were performed as for the repair assays. For anaphase and IRIF analysis, cells were plated on chamber slides the day after siRNA or plasmid transfection. For anaphase analysis, following 2 days of culturing on the slides, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde followed by immunostaining with anti-PICH antibody (Abnova H00054821-D01P) and counterstaining by DAPI in Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired using an AX-70 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a 40× NA 0.75 UPlanFl objective, with Retiga Exi camera (QImaging) and ImagePro software (MediaCybernetics). For each siRNA treatment condition, >100 anaphases were accumulated from several independent transfections (n ≥ 3). Anaphase bridges were scored as continuous DAPI staining between anaphase chromosomes. Subsequently, localization of PICH at anaphase bridges was scored. Statistics were performed with Fisher's exact test. To examine IRIF, following 1 day of culturing on the slides, the cells were treated with IR (Mark 1 irradiator Cs137) and allowed to recover prior to fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde. For RAD51 and BRCA1 IRIF, pre-extraction (25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Triton X-100) was performed before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde. Antibodies used for immunofluorescence: anti-Rad51 (Santa Cruz, H-92), anti-RPA (Calbiochem, RPA34-20 and Ab-3), anti-53BP1 (Abcam, ab36823), anti-BRCA1 (Santa Cruz, D-9), and anti-HA immunotag (Bethyl Laboratories, A190–107F). Subsequently, the slides were stained with Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG and/or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen), and DAPI in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired as for the anaphase analysis. Regarding quantification of IRIF, for RAD51 IRIF, >150 cells were scored for the presence of ≥5 RAD51 foci to determine the frequency of RAD51 IRIF+ cells. RAD51 IRIF frequencies represent the means of three independent transfections, and statistics were performed using the unpaired t test. For the RAD51 and BRCA1 co-staining experiment, RAD51 IRIF+ cells were secondarily scored as containing <5 BRCA1 foci (IRIF−), to determine the frequency of RAD51 IRIF+/BRCA1 IRIF− cells. For the RPA IRIF experiment, >200 cells for each siRNA treatment, accumulated from two independent transfections, were scored for the number of RPA IRIF. The statistics for the RAD51/BRCA1 co-staining, and RPA staining, were performed with Fisher's exact test. We examined the influence of RNF168 during distinct DSB repair events, using a panel of previously described GFP-based reporters that contain a recognition site for the rare-cutting endonuclease I-SceI (Fig. 1A) (22Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. Alternative-NHEJ is a mechanistically distinct pathway of mammalian chromosome break repair.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). With DR-GFP, GFP+ is restored via HDR of an I-SceI-induced DSB that uses a downstream homologous template. With SA-GFP, GFP+ is restored via SSA between two repeats that flank an I-SceI-induced DSB, which causes a 2.7-kb deletion. Notably, GFP+ cells in SA-GFP could also potentially arise via HDR with crossing over, although such HDR events are rare in mitotic cells (26LaRocque J.R. Stark J.M. Oh J. Bojilova E. Yusa K.

Biol. 2004; 24: 9305-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In addition to HR, we have examined alternative end joining (Alt-EJ), which is similar to SSA but using shorter stretches of homology that are closer to DSB ends. Such Alt-EJ repair events do not require the classical nonhomologous end joining factors that mediate V(D)J recombination (28Guirouilh-Barbat J. Huck S. Bertrand P. Pirzio L. Desmaze C. Sabatier L.

To examine Alt-EJ, we used EJ2-GFP, in which GFP+ is restored by repair that bridges 8 nucleotides of microhomology flanking the I-SceI-induced DSB, which causes a 35-bp deletion (22Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. Alternative-NHEJ is a mechanistically distinct pathway of mammalian chromosome break repair.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of RNAi depletion of RNF168 on these DSB repair events, we transfected siRNAs into human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cell lines containing these reporters (19Gunn A. Bennardo N. Cheng A. Stark J.M. Correct end use during end joining of multiple chromosomal double strand breaks is influenced by repair protein RAD50, DNA-dependent protein kinase DNA-PKcs, and transcription context.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42470-42482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and subsequently expressed I-SceI. After these transfections, we determined the percentage of GFP+ cells using FACS analysis, which provides the frequency of the repair event marked by restoration of a GFP+ cassette. Depletion of RNF168 via siRNF168 (pool of four siRNAs), relative to a nontargeting siCTRL, was confirmed by immunoblotting (2-fold; Fig. 1B) and quantitative RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S1B). From these experiments, we found that siRNF168 treatment caused an increase in HDR and SSA (both 1.6-fold) but had no significant effect on Alt-EJ (Fig. 1B). The above findings indicate that RNF168 is important to inhibit HR; however RNF168 is critical for recruiting the HR factor BRCA1 to DSBs, as measured by IRIF analysis (1Stewart G.S. Panier S.

A corollary of this hypothesis is that HR defects caused by BRCA1 loss can be suppressed by RNF168 depletion. To test this notion, we examined repair in U2OS cells with RNAi-mediated silencing of RNF168, BRCA1, or both BRCA1 and"
https://openalex.org/W2009847261,"Dysfunction of the inner ear as caused by presbyacusis, injuries or noise traumata may result in subjective tinnitus, but not everyone suffering from one of these diseases develops a tinnitus percept and vice versa. The reasons for these individual differences are still unclear and may explain why different treatments of the disease are beneficial for some patients but not for others. Here we for the first time compare behavioral and neurophysiological data from hearing impaired Mongolian gerbils with (T) and without (NT) a tinnitus percept that may elucidate why some specimen do develop subjective tinnitus after noise trauma while others do not. Although noise trauma induced a similar permanent hearing loss in all animals, tinnitus did develop only in about three quarters of these animals. NT animals showed higher overall cortical and auditory brainstem activity before noise trauma compared to T animals; that is, animals with low overall neuronal activity in the auditory system seem to be prone to develop tinnitus after noise trauma. Furthermore, T animals showed increased activity of cortical neurons representing the tinnitus frequencies after acoustic trauma, whereas NT animals exhibited an activity decrease at moderate sound intensities by that time. Spontaneous activity was generally increased in T but decreased in NT animals. Plastic changes of tonotopic organization were transient, only seen in T animals and vanished by the time the tinnitus percept became chronic. We propose a model for tinnitus prevention that points to a global inhibitory mechanism in auditory cortex that may prevent tinnitus genesis in animals with high overall activity in the auditory system, whereas this mechanism seems not potent enough for tinnitus prevention in animals with low overall activity."
https://openalex.org/W2076581982,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common intracranial cancer but despite recent advances in therapy the overall survival remains about 20 months. Whole genome exon sequencing studies implicate mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (RTK) for driving tumor growth in over 80% of GBMs. In spite of various RTKs being mutated or altered in the majority of GBMs, clinical studies have not been able to demonstrate efficacy of molecular targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors in GBMs. Activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways has been implicated as a possible means by which inhibition of a single RTK has been ineffective in GBM. In this study, we sought a combination of approved drugs that would inhibit in vitro and in vivo growth of GBM oncospheres. A combination consisting of gefitinib and sunitinib acted synergistically in inhibiting growth of GBM oncospheres in vitro. Sunitinib was the only RTK inhibitor that could induce apoptosis in GBM cells. However, the in vivo efficacy testing of the gefitinib and sunitinib combination in an EGFR amplified/PTEN wild type GBM xenograft model revealed that gefitinib alone could significantly improve survival in animals whereas sunitinib did not show any survival benefit. Subsequent testing of the same drug combination in a different syngeneic glioma model that lacked EGFR amplification but was more susceptible to sunitinib in vitro demonstrated no survival benefit when treated with gefitinib or sunitinib or the gefitinib and sunitinib combination. Although a modest survival benefit was obtained in one of two animal models with EGFR amplification due to gefitinib alone, the addition of sunitinib, to test our best in vitro combination therapy, did not translate to any additional in vivo benefit. Improved targeted therapies, with drug properties favorable to intracranial tumors, are likely required to form effective drug combinations for GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2169428416,"MYBBP1A is a predominantly nucleolar transcriptional regulator involved in rDNA synthesis and p53 activation via acetylation. However little further information is available as to its function. Here we report that MYBBP1A is developmentally essential in the mouse prior to blastocyst formation. In cell culture, down-regulation of MYBBP1A decreases the growth rate of wild type mouse embryonic stem cells, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and of human HeLa cells, where it also promotes apoptosis. HeLa cells either arrest at G2/M or undergo delayed and anomalous mitosis. At mitosis, MYBBP1A is localized to a parachromosomal region and gene-expression profiling shows that its down-regulation affects genes controlling chromosomal segregation and cell cycle. However, MYBBP1A down-regulation increases the growth rate of the immortalized NIH3T3 cells. Such Mybbp1a down-regulated NIH3T3 cells are more susceptible to Ras-induced transformation and cause more potent Ras-driven tumors. We conclude that MYBBP1A is an essential gene with novel roles at the pre-mitotic level and potential tumor suppressor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2008108655,"Regulation of transcriptional activity of heat shock factor-1 (HSF1) is widely thought to be the main point of control for heat shock protein (Hsp) expression.Glutamine increases Hsf1 gene transcription in a C/EBPβ-dependent manner and up-regulates HSF1 activity.Glutamine is an activator for both HSF1 expression and transactivation.Glutamine-induced HSF1 expression provides a novel mechanistic frame for HSF1-Hsp axis regulation. Heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1) is the master regulator for cytoprotective heat shock protein (Hsp) expression. It is widely thought that HSF1 expression is non-inducible, and thus the key control point of Hsp expression is regulation of the transactivation activity of HSF1. How HSF1 expression is regulated remains unknown. Herein we demonstrate that glutamine (Gln), a preferred fuel substrate for the gut, enhanced Hsp expression both in rat colonic epithelium in vivo and in cultured non-transformed young adult mouse colonic epithelial cells. This was associated with up-regulation of the transactivation activity of HSF1 via increased HSF1 trimerization, nuclear localization, DNA binding, and relative abundance of activating phosphorylation at Ser-230 of HSF1. More intriguingly, Gln enhanced HSF1 protein and mRNA expression and Hsf1 gene promoter activity. Within the -281/-200 region of the Hsf1 promoter, deletion of the putative CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) binding site abolished the HSF1 response to Gln. C/EBPβ was further shown to bind to this 82-bp sequence both in vitro and in vivo. Gln availability strikingly altered the ratio of C/EBPβ inhibitory and active isoforms, i.e. liver-enriched inhibitory protein and liver-enriched activating protein. Liver-enriched inhibitory protein and liver-enriched activating protein were further shown to be an independent repressor and activator, respectively, for Hsf1 gene transcription, and the relative abundance of these two C/EBPβ isoforms was demonstrated to determine Hsf1 transcription. We show for the first time that Gln not only enhances the transactivation of HSF1 but also induces Hsf1 expression by activating its transcription in a C/EBPβ-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2020938932,"Recovery from disturbance in deep water is poorly understood, but as anthropogenic impacts increase in deeper water it is important to quantify the process. Exploratory hydrocarbon drilling causes physical disturbance, smothering the seabed near the well. Video transects obtained by remotely operated vehicles were used to assess the change in invertebrate megafaunal density and diversity caused by drilling a well at 380 m depth in the Norwegian Sea in 2006. Transects were carried out one day before drilling commenced and 27 days, 76 days, and three years later. A background survey, further from the well, was also carried out in 2009. Porifera (45% of observations) and Cnidaria (40%) dominated the megafauna. Porifera accounted for 94% of hard-substratum organisms and cnidarians (Pennatulacea) dominated on the soft sediment (78%). Twenty seven and 76 days after drilling commenced, drill cuttings were visible, extending over 100 m from the well. In this area there were low invertebrate megafaunal densities (0.08 and 0.10 individuals m(-2)) in comparison to pre-drill conditions (0.21 individuals m(-2)). Three years later the visible extent of the cuttings had reduced, reaching 60 m from the well. Within this area the megafaunal density (0.05 individuals m(-2)) was lower than pre-drill and reference transects (0.23 individuals m(-2)). There was a significant increase in total megafaunal invertebrate densities with both distance from drilling and time since drilling although no significant interaction. Beyond the visible disturbance there were similar megafaunal densities (0.14 individuals m(-2)) to pre-drilling and background surveys. Species richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity and multivariate techniques showed similar patterns to density. At this site the effects of exploratory drilling on megafaunal invertebrate density and diversity seem confined to the extent of the visible cuttings pile. However, elevated Barium concentration and reduced sediment grain size suggest persistence of disturbance for three years, with unclear consequences for other components of the benthic fauna."
https://openalex.org/W2150071707,"Currently, the cost of cellulase enzymes remains a key economic impediment to commercialization of biofuels. Enzymes from glycoside hydrolase family 48 (GH48) are a critical component of numerous natural lignocellulose-degrading systems. Although computational mining of large genomic data sets is a promising new approach for identifying novel cellulolytic activities, current computational methods are unable to distinguish between cellulases and enzymes with different substrate specificities that belong to the same protein family. We show that by using a robust computational approach supported by experimental studies, cellulases and non-cellulases can be effectively identified within a given protein family. Phylogenetic analysis of GH48 showed non-monophyletic distribution, an indication of horizontal gene transfer. Enzymatic function of GH48 proteins coded by horizontally transferred genes was verified experimentally, which confirmed that these proteins are cellulases. Computational and structural studies of GH48 enzymes identified structural elements that define cellulases and can be used to computationally distinguish them from non-cellulases. We propose that the structural element that can be used for in silico discrimination between cellulases and non-cellulases belonging to GH48 is an ω-loop located on the surface of the molecule and characterized by highly conserved rare amino acids. These markers were used to screen metagenomics data for ""true"" cellulases."
https://openalex.org/W2048653487,"Background The BARD1 gene encodes for the BRCA1-associated RING domain (BARD1) protein. Germ line and somatic mutations in BARD1 are found in sporadic breast, ovarian and uterine cancers. There is a plethora of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which may or may not be involved in the onset of female cancers. Hence, before planning a larger population study, it is advisable to sort out the possible functional SNPs. To accomplish this goal, data available in the dbSNP database and different computer programs can be used. To the best of our knowledge, until now there has been no such study on record for the BARD1 gene. Therefore, this study was undertaken to find the functional nsSNPs in BARD1. Result 2.85% of all SNPs in the dbSNP database were present in the coding regions. SIFT predicted 11 out of 50 nsSNPs as not tolerable and PolyPhen assessed 27 out of 50 nsSNPs as damaging. FastSNP revealed that the rs58253676 SNP in the 3′ UTR may have splicing regulator and enhancer functions. In the 5′ UTR, rs17489363 and rs17426219 may alter the transcriptional binding site. The intronic region SNP rs67822872 may have a medium-high risk level. The protein structures 1JM7, 3C5R and 2NTE were predicted by PDBSum and shared 100% similarity with the BARD1 amino acid sequence. Among the predicted nsSNPs, rs4986841, rs111367604, rs13389423 and rs139785364 were identified as deleterious and damaging by the SIFT and PolyPhen programs. Additionally, I-Mutant showed a decrease in stability for these nsSNPs upon mutation. Finally, the ExPASy-PROSIT program revealed that the predicted deleterious mutations are contained in the ankyrin ring and BRCT domains. Conclusion Using the available bioinformatics tools and the data present in the dbSNP database, the four nsSNPs, rs4986841, rs111367604, rs13389423 and rs139785364, were identified as deleterious, reducing the protein stability of BARD1. Hence, these SNPs can be used for the larger population-based studies of female cancers."

https://openalex.org/W1996736397,"The western corn rootworm (WCR) is one of the economically most important pests of maize. A better understanding of microbial communities associated with guts and eggs of the WCR is required in order to develop new pest control strategies, and to assess the potential role of the WCR in the dissemination of microorganisms, e.g., mycotoxin-producing fungi.Total community (TC) DNA was extracted from maize rhizosphere, WCR eggs, and guts of larvae feeding on maize roots grown in three different soil types. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and ITS fragments, PCR-amplified from TC DNA, were used to investigate the fungal and bacterial communities, respectively. Microorganisms in the WCR gut were not influenced by the soil type. Dominant fungal populations in the gut were affiliated to Fusarium spp., while Wolbachia was the most abundant bacterial genus. Identical ribosomal sequences from gut and egg samples confirmed a transovarial transmission of Wolbachia sp. Betaproteobacterial DGGE indicated a stable association of Herbaspirillum sp. with the WCR gut. Dominant egg-associated microorganisms were the bacterium Wolbachia sp. and the fungus Mortierella gamsii.The soil type-independent composition of the microbial communities in the WCR gut and the dominance of only a few microbial populations suggested either a highly selective environment in the gut lumen or a high abundance of intracellular microorganisms in the gut epithelium. The dominance of Fusarium species in the guts indicated WCR larvae as vectors of mycotoxin-producing fungi. The stable association of Herbaspirillum sp. with WCR gut systems and the absence of corresponding sequences in WCR eggs suggested that this bacterium was postnatally acquired from the environment. The present study provided new insights into the microbial communities associated with larval guts and eggs of the WCR. However, their biological role remains to be explored."

The purpose of this study was 1) to investigate application of PEG modified GMNPs (PGMNPs) as a drug carrier of the chemotherapy compound doxorubicin (DOX) in vitro; 2) to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of DOX-conjugated PGMNPs (DOX-PGMNPs) using an EMF-guided delivery in vivo. Methods First, DOX-PGMNPs were synthesized and the cytotoxicity of DOX-PGMNPs was assessed in vitro. Second, upon intravenous administration of DOX-PMGPNs to H22 hepatoma cell tumor-bearing mice, the DOX biodistribution in different organs (tissues) was measured. The antitumor activity was evaluated using different treatment strategies such as DOX-PMGPNs or DOX-PMGPNs with an EMF-guided delivery (DOX-PGMNPs-M). Results The relative tumor volumes in DOX-PGMNPs-M, DOX-PGMNPs, and DOX groups were 5.46±1.48, 9.22±1.51, and 14.8±1.64, respectively (each p<0.05), following treatment for 33 days. The life span of tumor-bearing mice treated with DOX-PGMNPs-M, DOX-PGMNPs, and DOX were 74.8±9.95, 66.1±13.5, and 31.3±3.31 days, respectively (each p<0.05). Conclusion This simple and adaptive nanoparticle design may accommodate chemotherapy for drug delivery optimization and in vivo drug-target definition in system biology profiling, increasing the margin of safety in treatment of cancers in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2057430646,"Angiogenesis is essential for solid tumour growth, whilst the molecular profiles of tumour blood vessels have been reported to be different between cancer types. Although presently available anti-angiogenic strategies are providing some promise for the treatment of some cancers it is perhaps not surprisingly that, none of the anti-angiogenic agents available work on all tumours. Thus, the discovery of novel anti-angiogenic targets, relevant to individual cancer types, is required. Using Affymetrix microarray analysis of laser-captured, CD31-positive blood vessels we have identified 63 genes that are upregulated significantly (5–72 fold) in angiogenic blood vessels associated with human invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast as compared with blood vessels in normal human breast. We tested the angiogenic capacity of a subset of these genes. Genes were selected based on either their known cellular functions, their enriched expression in endothelial cells and/or their sensitivity to anti-VEGF treatment; all features implicating their involvement in angiogenesis. For example, RRM2, a ribonucleotide reductase involved in DNA synthesis, was upregulated 32-fold in IDC-associated blood vessels; ATF1, a nuclear activating transcription factor involved in cellular growth and survival was upregulated 23-fold in IDC-associated blood vessels and HEX-B, a hexosaminidase involved in the breakdown of GM2 gangliosides, was upregulated 8-fold in IDC-associated blood vessels. Furthermore, in silico analysis confirmed that AFT1 and HEX-B also were enriched in endothelial cells when compared with non-endothelial cells. None of these genes have been reported previously to be involved in neovascularisation. However, our data establish that siRNA depletion of Rrm2, Atf1 or Hex-B had significant anti-angiogenic effects in VEGF-stimulated ex vivo mouse aortic ring assays. Overall, our results provide proof-of-principle that our approach can identify a cohort of potentially novel anti-angiogenic targets that are likley to be, but not exclusivley, relevant to breast cancer."

The MT dynamics is coordinately regulated by MT-stabilizing and -destabilizing proteins that promote or attenuate polymerization, respectively, which in turn modulates resulting functions. For example, MT-destabilizing protein mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) plays an important role in mitotic spindle assembly as well as in faithful chromosome segregation (1Manning A.L.

PAK1 plays a prominent role in mitosis as well as in actin and microtubule remodeling. For example, PAK1 phosphorylates myosins, a family of actin-based molecular motor proteins (15Brzeska H.

The microtubule depolymerization assay was performed in a 15-μl volume reaction buffer containing BRB80, 1 mm DTT, 133 μg/ml casein, 1.5 mm MgATP, and 1.5 μm rhodamine-labeled and GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules. Reactions were started with incubation of the kinase and GST-MCAK in the reaction buffer for 10 min without the microtubules, and then the polymerization or depolymerization was initiated by the addition of microtubules. Reactions were allowed to incubate for 5–20 min, and then 2 μl of each reaction was put on a glass slide and sealed under the coverslip. An LSM-710 confocal microscope was used to capture 25 images for each time point. Representative figures from three individual experiments are shown here. For quantitation, the number of microtubules per 71 × 56-μm fields from three individual micrographs for each sample was counted. The segmented line tool of the ImageJ software was used to draw a line across the length of the microtubules to get the exact length of the microtubules. Only microtubules greater than 6 μm were considered for analysis of each sample. Data represents mean ± S.D. of all counted samples. The MT regrowth or polymerization assay was carried out as described elsewhere (7Zhang L. Shao H. Huang Y. Yan F. Chu Y. Hou H. Zhu M. Fu C. Aikhionbare F. Fang G. Ding X. Yao X.

ZR-75 cells were grown on coverslips. After 24–36 h of growth, nocodazole treatments for microtubule biogenesis assays were performed. Briefly, cells were treated with 4 μm nocodazole for 30 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and then incubated in medium with 10% serum for 0 and 15 min, respectively, to allow for new microtubule biogenesis. A mouse monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin was used for colocalization of tubulin with PAK1 or MCAK, respectively. Goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555 antibody was used for tubulin, and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 was used for PAK1 or MCAK. For quantitation, 25 cells were scored for each condition, a fraction of cells with different lengths of microtubules were counted using the Zen software in the LSM 710 confocal microscope, and quantification of the microtubules was carried out using ImageJ software. siRNAs against PAK1 (catalogue number M-003521-03) and Aurora-A (catalogue number L-003545-01) were purchased from Dharmacon RNAi Technologies, and siRNA against MCAK (catalogue number sc-105596) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 100 nmol/liter siRNA (control, PAK1, and Aurora-A) was used to transfect the cells along with 4 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates following the manufacturer's protocol. Specific protein knockdown was checked after 48 h of transfection by Western blot analysis. In vitro transcription and translation of PAK1 was performed using a T7 TnT kit (Promega) in which 1 μg of plasmid DNA was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. The GST pulldown assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST and GST-fused full-length proteins and deletion constructs immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) with in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein in GST binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Bound proteins were isolated by incubating the reaction mixture with rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with GST binding buffer, the proteins were eluted in 4× SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Cells were grown in complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). Whenever needed, cells were incubated with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 h followed by an 8-h release in complete medium. This procedure was repeated, and after the second release, cells were washed thrice with PBS and incubated in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 30 min on ice. The protein concentration was estimated, and an equal concentration of protein was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the appropriate antibodies, and detected using an ECL detection kit. Immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C using 1 μg of antibody/mg of protein. Complexes were collected using protein G beads by incubating with rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, proteins were detected as mentioned earlier. Cells were grown on glass coverslips. After 24 h, nocodazole (10 ng/ml) was added to the medium, and cells were incubated for 16 h. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and stained for γ-tubulin, PAK1, phospho-MCAK, pericentrin, and Aurora-A using the appropriate antibodies followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green; Invitrogen) or Alexa 546 (red; Invitrogen). The coverslips were counterstained with DAPI (blue; Invitrogen) for DNA. Coverslips were mounted in SlowFade mounting medium (Invitrogen) and sealed onto glass slides. Samples were imaged using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 710) equipped with a 63×/1.4 numeric aperture objective following established methods. Quantitative analysis was conducted using the Zen software. The images were taken at room temperature, and each representative image is at the same cellular level and magnification. The microtubules of PAK1 wild-type and PAK1−/− MEFs were imaged using a super-resolution microscope (Leica Microsystems). The nuclei were stained with DRAQ5 for 5 min. Images of the nuclei are confocal images. The images of the microtubules are super-resolution images. The images were cropped and merged with the images of the nuclei. To explore the possible role of PAK1 signaling in MT remodeling, we performed an in vivo MT regrowth/polymerization assay in PAK1−/− and PAK1 wild-type MEFs. We observed decreased MT regrowth/polymerization in the PAK1−/− MEFs as compared with the wild-type PAK1 MEFs due to MT depolymerization activity in the absence of PAK1 (Fig. 1A). Because we observed decreased MT biogenesis under the PAK1-depleted condition in PAK1−/− MEFs, we further analyzed the MT biogenesis/polymerization activity under PAK1 overexpression conditions. For this purpose, we chose an isogenic MCF-7/T423E cell line stably expressing PAK1 wherein the effect of PAK1 hyperactivation could be studied in the same cells under a regulatable expression of catalytically active PAK1 (24Bagheri-Yarmand R.

We found increased MT regrowth/polymerization under PAK1 overexpression in MCF-7/T423E cells after treatment with doxycycline compared with untreated cells presumably due to defective MT depolymerization activity (Fig. 1B). Together, these results suggest that PAK1 signaling regulates MT depolymerization and associated MT dynamics. From the published data, it is evident that Auroras play a significant role in MT dynamics by phosphorylating MCAK. PAK1 is an upstream kinase of Auroras, and because of its established role in MT dynamics, we evaluated the association of PAK1 with the endogenous Auroras and MCAK during mitosis. We found that MCAK effectively interacts with PAK1, γ-tubulin, Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and pericentrin, whereas PAK1 interacts with all the above proteins with the exception of Aurora-B in the centrosomes (Fig. 2, A and B). This raises the possibility that Aurora-B and PAK1 may reside in different complexes. Consistent with these findings, we also found evidence of colocalization of the endogenous PAK1 with MCAK, Aurora-A, and γ-tubulin using confocal scanning microscopy (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that PAK1 interacts selectively with MCAK·Aurora-A·γ-tubulin and regulates MT dynamics. As PAK1 is upstream of Aurora-A kinase and found to be associated with MCAK in the centrosomes (Fig. 2, A–C), we next investigated the ability of PAK1 to phosphorylate MCAK. We found that selective depletion of PAK1 compromises the phosphorylation status of the endogenous MCAK as well as the amount of PAK1 pulled down by MCAK (Fig. 3A). Consistently, we also observed a decreased phosphorylation of MCAK in PAK1−/− MEFs (Fig. 3B) compared with PAK1 wild-type MEFs, providing a clue that MCAK might be a PAK1-interacting substrate. Furthermore, PAK1 enzyme but not kinase-dead enzyme readily phosphorylates the GST-MCAK (Fig. 3C). Results from in vitro phosphorylation studies involving purified PAK1 enzyme and a series of MCAK deletion constructs revealed the presence of a PAK1 phosphorylation site or sites within the N-terminal amino acid 1–187 and 1–255 regions (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, results from GST pulldown assays indicated that 35S-labeled PAK1 interacts with amino acids 1–591 of MCAK (Fig. 3E). Group-based phosphorylation site predicting and scoring platform (GPS) (33Zhou F.F. Xue Y. Chen G.L. Yao X. GPS: a novel group-based phosphorylation predicting and scoring method.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) analysis of this region revealed the presence of potential PAK1 phosphorylation sites in MCAK: Ser-95, Ser-111, and Ser-192 (supplemental Fig. 2A). We next individually mutated these serine residues to alanine in the full-length GST-MCAK and evaluated the phosphorylation of MCAK mutants in vitro. We noticed an inability of PAK1 to phosphorylate MCAK-S111A and -S192A mutants as compared with the wild-type MCAK (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 2B), suggesting that MCAK contains two PAK1 phosphorylation sites, Ser-192 and Ser-111. To validate the PAK1 phosphorylation of MCAK in a physiologically relevant setting, we cotransfected ZR-75 breast cancer cells with T7-MCAK or T7-MCAK-S192A, T7-MCAK-S111A, or T7-MCAK-S192A/S111A mutant, and in vivo phosphorylation assays involving metabolic labeling of cells with labeled orthophosphoric acid were performed. Consistent with in vitro studies, we noticed a substantial reduction in the phosphorylation of MCAK-S192A and -S111A as well as the MCAK-S111A/S192A double mutant as compared with MCAK (Fig. 4B). From the earlier studies, it is evident that serum induces PAK1 activity (34Charvet C. Auberger P. Tartare-Deckert S. Bernard A. Deckert M. Vav1couples T cell receptor to serum responsible factor-dependent transcription via a MEK dependent pathway.J. Biol.

Kaplan D.R. Suppression of Rac activity induces apoptosis of human glioma cells but not normal human astrocytes.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2131-2140PubMed Google Scholar); accordingly, we found increased phosphorylation of MCAK in the presence of serum (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that MCAK is a cognate substrate of PAK1 and that Ser-111 and Ser-192 are the functionally active PAK1 phosphorylation sites in MCAK. Because both PAK1 and MCAK participate in MT remodeling, we explored whether PAK1 could regulate the MT depolymerization activity of MCAK. We incubated rhodamine-labeled, GMPCPP-stabilized MT with PAK1 and MCAK for 5 min and visualized its polymerization status by immunofluorescence. As expected, incubation of GMPCPP-stabilized MT with MCAK depolymerized the MT. Surprisingly, inclusion of PAK1 completely inhibited the ability of MCAK to depolymerize MT, revealing for the first time the ability of PAK1 to regulate the depolymerization activity of MCAK (Fig. 5A). To identify the region of MCAK responsible for the noticed inhibitory effect of PAK1 on MT depolymerization, we used MCAK deletion mutants encompassing various domains and identified the minimal catalytic domain (amino acids 188–591) containing depolymerization activity, which could be completely inhibited by PAK1 (Fig. 5A) presumably due to phosphorylation of MCAK. Computational GPS analysis of the region encompassing amino acids 188–591 revealed the presence of only one PAK1 phosphorylation site, Ser-192. To validate the functional significance of the presumed PAK1 phosphorylation site, we next showed the inability of PAK1 to inhibit the MT depolymerization activity of phosphorylation-deficient MCAK-S192A mutant (Fig. 5B). Such an effect was not observed with the MCAK-S95A mutant (supplemental Fig. 3A), suggesting that active PAK1-mediated phosphorylation of MCAK on Ser-192 might be required to inhibit the depolymerization activity of MCAK by PAK1 signaling. To investigate the significance of MCAK Ser-192 upon MT depolymerization in vivo, we transfected ZR-75 cells with GFP-MCAK, MCAK-S192A-GFP, or MCAK-S111A-GFP, and cells were treated with nocodazole to completely depolymerize the microtubules. Cells were fixed after allowing microtubules to regrow for 15 min. We noticed an increased microtubule polymerization/regrowth in the cells transfected with MCAK-S192A compared with the cells expressing either MCAK, MCAK-S111A, or MCAK-S95A (Fig. 5, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 3B). These findings suggested that PAK1 phosphorylation of MCAK at Ser-192 contributes to MT dynamics. However, because results from MCAK-S192A and MCAK-S111A suggest that the phosphorylation of both serine residues might be trans-regulated, it remains possible that the intact Ser-111 site may not be phosphorylated in MCAK-S192A. Therefore, we suggest that MCAK Ser-192 preferentially regulates MT dynamics with a potential, yet to be demonstrated, hidden contribution of the Ser-111 site. Furthermore, we did not find any difference in the MT depolymerization between control and Aurora-A siRNA-treated ZR-75 cells (supplemental Fig. 4), suggesting the involvement of upstream activated kinases such as PAK1 in the regulation of MT depolymerization activity. Because PAK1 is upstream of Aurora-A (20Zhao Z.S. Lim J.P. Ng Y.W. Lim L. Manser E. The GIT-associated kinase PAK targets to the centrosome and regulates Aurora-A.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and MCAK Ser-192 could be phosphorylated by both PAK1 (this study) and Aurora-A (36Tanenbaum M.E. Medema R.H. Akhmanova A. Regulation of localization and activity of the microtubule depolymerase MCAK.Bioarchitecture. 2011; 1: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Katayama H. Sasai K.

Aurora kinase-A regulates kinetochore/chromatin associated microtubule assembly in human cells.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 2691-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the lack of any effect of Aurora-A knockdown on MT depolymerization might be due to phosphorylation of MCAK Ser-192 by PAK1 as the sole kinase in the absence of Aurora-A. Because PAK1 also phosphorylates MCAK on Ser-111 (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 2), we next evaluated the significance of PAK1 phosphorylation of MCAK at Ser-111 for its centrosomal targeting in human cells. ZR-75 cells transfected with GFP-MCAK, GFP-MCAK-S192A, GFP-MCAK-S111A (but with an intact Ser-192), and GFP-MCAK-S95A were subjected to double thymidine block and then allowed to progress through mitosis for centrosomal localization studies. We found localization of MCAK, MCAK-S192A and -S95A but not MCAK-S111A to the centrosomes along with centrosomal marker protein pericentrin (Fig. 6A and supplemental Fig. 5). Furthermore, we found evidence of defective centrioles in the PAK1−/− MEFs as compared with the wild-type PAK1 MEFs presumably due to lack of Ser-111 phosphorylation in MCAK by PAK1 (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. 6A) in addition to any hidden contribution of the Ser-192 site, which might be trans-regulated by Ser-111. Because MCAK is phosphorylated by PAK1 (Fig. 3, A–D) and PAK1−/− MEFs contain easily detectable levels of PAK2 and PAK3 (28Molli P.R. Li D.Q. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Pakala S.B. Katayama H. Sen S. Iyer J. Chernoff J. Tsai M.Y. Nair S.S. Kumar R. Arpc1b, a centrosomal protein, is both an activator and substrate of Aurora-A.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the defect in the centrioles is mainly due to the lack of PAK1. Accordingly, we noticed evidence of abnormal spindles with short microtubules as well as multinucleated cells in the PAK1−/− MEFs as compared with the wild-type PAK1 MEFs (Fig. 6, C, D, and E, and supplemental Fig. 6, B–D). Because such phenotypic effects are normally associated with abnormalities associated with centrosomal proteins (38Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A.

Direct interaction of pericentrin with cytoplasmic dynein light intermediate chain contributes to mitotic spindle organization.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), these findings suggest an inherent role of PAK1 phosphorylation of Ser-111 in MCAK for its centrosomal targeting. We identified MCAK as a novel PAK1-interacting substrate. MCAK is a potent MT depolymerizer and can track tips of polymerizing MT. Its ability to tip track depends on phosphorylation, which may regulate the association of MCAK with the MT lattice as well as with other interacting proteins. Several other proteins orchestrate the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Many of these proteins are destabilizing proteins that are important for inhibiting the MT polymerization and inducing disassembly. During mitosis, MCAK is tightly regulated by kinases and can either abrogate or accelerate the MT depolymerizing activity. The absence or inhibition of MCAK in cells or from Xenopus egg extracts causes abnormal spindles with long MTs as well as improperly attached chromosomes that lead to mis-segregation. Here we show that PAK1 can interact and phosphorylate MCAK in a physiologically relevant setting. The PAK1-mediated phosphorylation events at Ser-111 and Ser-192 localized MCAK to centrosomes and inhibited its MT depolymerization activity, respectively. In Fig. 4B, we observed that both the single mutants of MCAK (S111A and S192A) are as effective as the double mutant of MCAK in abolishing the in vivo phosphorylation of MCAK, raising the possibility of interdependence in the Ser-111 and Ser-192 phosphorylation. Ser-192 of MCAK is also phosphorylated by another kinase, Aurora-A, to attenuate its MT depolymerization. The noted PAK1-regulated MCAK function may be independent of Aurora-A activity or it may be in coordination with Aurora-A where PAK1 phosphorylates Aurora-A (20Zhao Z.S. Lim J.P. Ng Y.W. Lim L. Manser E. The GIT-associated kinase PAK targets to the centrosome and regulates Aurora-A.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 237-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylates MCAK (6Zhang X. Lan W. Ems-McClung S.C. Stukenberg P.T. Walczak C.E.

It is known that PAK1 plays an instrumental role in the phosphorylation and targeting of Aurora-A kinase to the centrosomes where Aurora-A kinase is needed for the centrosomal duplication and separation during mitosis (20Zhao Z.S.

Earlier studies suggest that MCAK phosphorylation in the N-terminal region by mitotic kinases like Aurora-A and Aurora-B targets MCAK to spindle poles, centromeres, kinetochores, and chromosome arms (5Zhang X.

Biol. 2004; 14: 273-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As PAK1 is phosphorylating the N-terminal region of MCAK at position Ser-111 similarly to Auroras, we do speculate that PAK1 is involved in the localization of MCAK to centromeres and spindle poles during mitosis. Furthermore, depletion of PAK1 considerably increased MT depolymerization, whereas overexpression of PAK1 diminished the ability of MCAK to remove tubulin subunits from the microtubule end. The presence of MCAK in the same complex as PAK1, γ-tubulin, Aurora-A, and pericentrin suggests that PAK1 interacts with MCAK at the centrosomes during mitosis, and these functions could be regulated by two independent kinases. In brief, the findings presented here have identified MCAK as a novel PAK1-interacting substrate and revealed the exclusivity of phosphorylation-site specific functions of MCAK by the same kinase. Based on these findings, we propose that PAK1 phosphorylation of MCAK at positions Ser-192 and Ser-111 regulates MT dynamics and centrosomal targeting of MCAK, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2011249747,"Recognition of virus infection by innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including membrane-associated toll-like receptors (TLR) and cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors (RLR), activates cascades of signal transduction pathways leading to production of type I interferons (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines that orchestrate the elimination of the viruses. Although it has been demonstrated that PRR-mediated innate immunity plays an essential role in defending virus from infection, it also occasionally results in overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines that cause severe inflammation, blood vessel leakage and tissue damage. In our efforts to identify small molecules that selectively enhance PRR-mediated antiviral, but not the detrimental inflammatory response, we discovered a compound, RO 90–7501 (‘2’-(4-Aminophenyl)-[2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazol]-5-amine), that significantly promoted both TLR3 and RLR ligand-induced IFN-β gene expression and antiviral response, most likely via selective activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our results thus imply that pharmacological modulation of PRR signal transduction pathways in favor of the induction of a beneficial antiviral response can be a novel therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2000622797,"A currently obscure area of steroid hormone action is where the component factors, including receptor and reporter gene, act. The DNA binding of factors can be precisely defined, but the location and timing of factor binding and action are usually not equivalent. These questions are addressed for several factors (e.g. glucocorticoid receptor (GR), reporter, TIF2, NCoR, NELF-A, sSMRT, and STAMP) using our recently developed competition assay. This assay reveals both the kinetically defined mechanism of factor action and where the above factors act relative to both each other and the equilibrium equivalent to the rate-limiting step, which we call the concentration limiting step (CLS). The utility of this competition assay would be greatly increased if the position of the CLS is invariant and if the factor acting at the CLS is known. Here we report that the exogenous GREtkLUC reporter acts at the CLS as an accelerator for gene induction by GRs in U2OS cells. This mechanism of reporter function at the CLS persists with different reporters, factors, receptors, and cell types. We, therefore, propose that the reporter gene always acts at the CLS during gene induction and constitutes a landmark around which one can order the actions of all other factors. Current data suggest that how and where GR and the short form of SMRT act is also constant. These results validate a novel and rational methodology for identifying distally acting factors that would be attractive targets for pharmaceutical intervention in the treatment of diseases involving GR-regulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W2092150015,"The APPL1 and APPL2 proteins (APPL (adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interaction, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and leucine zipper-containing protein)) are localized to their own endosomal subcompartment and interact with a wide range of proteins and small molecules at the cell surface and in the nucleus. They play important roles in signal transduction through their ability to act as Rab effectors. (Rabs are a family of Ras GTPases involved in membrane trafficking.) Both APPL1 and APPL2 comprise an N-terminal membrane-curving BAR (Bin-amphiphysin-Rvs) domain linked to a PH domain and a C-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain. The structure and interactions of APPL1 are well characterized, but little is known about APPL2. Here, we report the crystal structure and low resolution solution structure of the BARPH domains of APPL2. We identify a previously undetected hinge site for rotation between the two domains and speculate that this motion may regulate APPL2 functions. We also identified Rab binding partners of APPL2 and show that these differ from those of APPL1, suggesting that APPL-Rab interaction partners have co-evolved over time. Isothermal titration calorimetry data reveal the interaction between APPL2 and Rab31 has a K(d) of 140 nM. Together with other biophysical data, we conclude the stoichiometry of the complex is 2:2."

Interestingly, recent reports have shown that the F1 complex can serve as a cell surface receptor for apparently unrelated ligands. Here we show for the first time the presence of the F1-ATPase at the cell surface of normal or cancerous colonic epithelial cells. Using surface plasmon resonance technology and mass spectrometry, we identified a peptide hormone product of the gastrin gene (glycine-extended gastrin (G-gly)) as a new ligand for the F1-ATPase. By molecular modeling, we identified the motif in the peptide sequence (E(E/D)XY), that directly interacts with the F1-ATPase and the amino acids in the F1-ATPase that bind this motif. Replacement of the Glu-9 residue by an alanine in the E(E/D)XY motif resulted in a strong decrease of G-gly binding to the F1-ATPase and the loss of its biological activity. In addition we demonstrated that F1-ATPase mediates the growth effects of the peptide. Indeed, blocking F1-ATPase activity decreases G-gly-induced cell growth. The mechanism likely involves ADP production by the membrane F1-ATPase, which is induced by G-gly. These results suggest an important contribution of cell surface F1-ATPase in the pro-proliferative action of this gastrointestinal peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2068613322,"The iminosugar N-(5'-adamantane-1'-yl-methoxy)-pentyl-1-deoxynoijirimycin (AMP-DNM), an inhibitor of glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis is known to ameliorate diabetes, insulin sensitivity and to prevent liver steatosis in ob/ob mice. Thus far the effect of GSL synthesis inhibition on pre-existing NASH has not yet been assessed. To investigate it, LDLR(-/-) mice were kept on a western-type diet for 12 weeks to induce NASH. Next, the diet was continued for 6 weeks in presence or not of AMP-DNM in the diet. AMP-DNM treated mice showed less liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Induction of fatty acid beta-oxydation was observed, as well as a reduction of plasma lipids. Our study demonstrates that AMP-DNM treatment is able to significantly correct pre-existing NASH, suggesting that inhibiting GSL synthesis may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of this pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2030747538,"The H(+),K(+)-ATPase pumps protons or hydronium ions and is responsible for the acidification of the gastric fluid. It is made up of an α-catalytic and a β-glycosylated subunit. The relation between cation translocation and the organization of the protein in the membrane are not well understood. We describe here how pure and functionally active pig gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase with an apparent Stokes radius of 6.3 nm can be obtained after solubilization with the non-ionic detergent C(12)E(8), followed by exchange of C(12)E(8) with Tween 20 on a Superose 6 column. Mass spectroscopy indicates that the β-subunit bears an excess mass of 9 kDa attributable to glycosylation. From chemical analysis, there are 0.25 g of phospholipids and around 0.024 g of cholesterol bound per g of protein. Analytical ultracentrifugation shows one main complex, sedimenting at s(20,)(w) = 7.2 ± 0.1 S, together with minor amounts of irreversibly aggregated material. From these data, a buoyant molecular mass is calculated, corresponding to an H(+),K(+)-ATPase α,β-protomer of 147.3 kDa. Complementary sedimentation velocity with deuterated water gives a picture of an α,β-protomer with 0.9-1.4 g/g of bound detergent and lipids and a reasonable frictional ratio of 1.5, corresponding to a Stokes radius of 7.1 nm. An α(2),β(2) dimer is rejected by the data. Light scattering coupled to gel filtration confirms the monomeric state of solubilized H(+),K(+)-ATPase. Thus, α,β H(+),K(+)-ATPase is active at least in detergent and may plausibly function as a monomer, as has been established for other P-type ATPases, Ca(2+)-ATPase and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2017781525,"Studies into the genetic origins of tumor cell chemoactivity pose significant challenges to bioinformatic mining efforts. Connections between measures of gene expression and chemoactivity have the potential to identify clinical biomarkers of compound response, cellular pathways important to efficacy and potential toxicities; all vital to anticancer drug development. An investigation has been conducted that jointly explores tumor-cell constitutive NCI60 gene expression profiles and small-molecule NCI60 growth inhibition chemoactivity profiles, viewed from novel applications of self-organizing maps (SOMs) and pathway-centric analyses of gene expressions, to identify subsets of over- and under-expressed pathway genes that discriminate chemo-sensitive and chemo-insensitive tumor cell types. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to quantify the accuracy of discriminating genes to predict tumor cell chemoactivity. LDA results find 15% higher prediction accuracies, using ∼30% fewer genes, for pathway-derived discriminating genes when compared to genes derived using conventional gene expression-chemoactivity correlations. The proposed pathway-centric data mining procedure was used to derive discriminating genes for ten well-known compounds. Discriminating genes were further evaluated using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to reveal a cellular genetic landscape, comprised of small numbers of key over and under expressed on- and off-target pathway genes, as important for a compound’s tumor cell chemoactivity. Literature-based validations are provided as support for chemo-important pathways derived from this procedure. Qualitatively similar results are found when using gene expression measurements derived from different microarray platforms. The data used in this analysis is available at http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo (GPL96, GSE32474)."

https://openalex.org/W2029025686,"Fibrin(ogen) mediates sustained tumor cell adhesion and survival in the pulmonary vasculature, thereby facilitating the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells. CD44 is the major functional fibrin receptor on colon carcinoma cells. Growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), induce post-translational protein modifications, which modulate ligand binding activity. In view of the roles of PDGF, fibrin(ogen) and CD44 in cancer metastasis, we aimed to delineate the effect of PDGF on CD44-fibrin recognition. By immunoprecipitating CD44 from PDGF-treated and untreated LS174T colon carcinoma cells, which express primarily CD44v, we demonstrate that PDGF enhances the adhesion of CD44v-coated beads to immobilized fibrin. Enzymatic inhibition studies coupled with flow-based adhesion assays and autoradiography reveal that PDGF augments the binding of CD44v to fibrin by significantly attenuating the extent of CD44 sulfation primarily on chondroitin and dermatan sulfate chains. Surface plasmon resonance assays confirm that PDGF enhances the affinity of CD44v-fibrin binding by markedly reducing its dissociation rate while modestly increasing the association rate. PDGF mildly reduces the affinity of CD44v-hyaluronan binding without affecting selectin-CD44v recognition. The latter is attributed to the fact that CD44v binds to selectins via sialofucosylated O-linked residues independent of heparan, dermatan and chondroitin sulfates. Interestingly, PDGF moderately reduces the sulfation of CD44s and CD44s-fibrin recognition. Collectively, these data offer a novel perspective into the mechanism by which PGDF regulates CD44-dependent binding of metastatic colon carcinoma cells to fibrin(ogen)."
https://openalex.org/W2055028077,"The recently discovered human parvovirus 4 (PARV4) has been associated with seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. High prevalence is seen especially in intravenous drug users. The virus has been detected in blood products and persons who have been repeatedly transfused have shown to be a risk-group. Furthermore, reports from different parts of the world suggesting a prevalence ranging from zero to one third of the healthy population and the virus is thought to cause a latent or persistent infection. We investigated the presence of PARV4 DNA and parvovirus B19 (B19) DNA in serum from 231 severely immunocompromised cancer patients that have been exposed for blood products. Compared to B19, which was found in 3.9% of the patients, we found no evidence of PARV4. Our results may indicate a very low prevalence of the virus in Sweden, and it would be useful to measure the real PARV4 exposure of the healthy population as well as individuals with known risk factors by serology."
https://openalex.org/W2025989222,"Correspondence noise is a major factor limiting direction discrimination performance in random-dot kinematograms [1]. In the current study we investigated the influence of correspondence noise on Dmax, which is the upper limit for the spatial displacement of the dots for which coherent motion is still perceived. Human direction discrimination performance was measured, using 2-frame kinematograms having leftward/rightward motion, over a 200-fold range of dot-densities and a four-fold range of dot displacements. From this data Dmax was estimated for the different dot densities tested. A model was proposed to evaluate the correspondence noise in the stimulus. This model summed the outputs of a set of elementary Reichardt-type local detectors that had receptive fields tiling the stimulus and were tuned to the two directions of motion in the stimulus. A key assumption of the model was that the local detectors would have the radius of their catchment areas scaled with the displacement that they were tuned to detect; the scaling factor k linking the radius to the displacement was the only free parameter in the model and a single value of k was used to fit all of the psychophysical data collected. This minimal, correspondence-noise based model was able to account for 91% of the variability in the human performance across all of the conditions tested. The results highlight the importance of correspondence noise in constraining the largest displacement that can be detected."
