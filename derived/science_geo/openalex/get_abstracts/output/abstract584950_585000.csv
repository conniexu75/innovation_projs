https://openalex.org/W2607135274,"Dependence on exogenous serine means that tumour growth is restricted in mice on a low-serine diet; this effect on tumour growth can be amplified by antagonizing the antioxidant response. Tumours acquire different metabolic adaptations to foster accelerated growth. This can lead to their dependence on crucial nutrients for anabolism. It had been shown that some non-essential amino acids, including serine, are required for tumour growth in mice. This report explores the effect of serine deprivation in endogenous tumour mouse models, uncovering how different oncogenic adaptations lead tumours to rely on exogenous serine or upregulate its cellular synthesis. Dependence on exogenous serine renders tumours sensitive to serine-deprivation diets, and this effect on tumour growth can be amplified by antagonizing the anti-oxidant response. The authors take a step towards dissecting how the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer may be explored therapeutically in the future. The non-essential amino acids serine and glycine are used in multiple anabolic processes that support cancer cell growth and proliferation (reviewed in ref. 1). While some cancer cells upregulate de novo serine synthesis2,3,4, many others rely on exogenous serine for optimal growth5,6,7. Restriction of dietary serine and glycine can reduce tumour growth in xenograft and allograft models7,8. Here we show that this observation translates into more clinically relevant autochthonous tumours in genetically engineered mouse models of intestinal cancer (driven by Apc inactivation) or lymphoma (driven by Myc activation). The increased survival following dietary restriction of serine and glycine in these models was further improved by antagonizing the anti-oxidant response. Disruption of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (using biguanides) led to a complex response that could improve or impede the anti-tumour effect of serine and glycine starvation. Notably, Kras-driven mouse models of pancreatic and intestinal cancers were less responsive to depletion of serine and glycine, reflecting an ability of activated Kras to increase the expression of enzymes that are part of the serine synthesis pathway and thus promote de novo serine synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2607008467,"Mammalian genomes are spatially organized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin into chromatin loops and topologically associated domains, which have important roles in gene regulation and recombination. By binding to specific sequences, CTCF defines contact points for cohesin-mediated long-range chromosomal cis-interactions. Cohesin is also present at these sites, but has been proposed to be loaded onto DNA elsewhere and to extrude chromatin loops until it encounters CTCF bound to DNA. How cohesin is recruited to CTCF sites, according to this or other models, is unknown. Here we show that the distribution of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl). In CTCF-depleted fibroblasts, cohesin cannot be properly recruited to CTCF sites but instead accumulates at transcription start sites of active genes, where the cohesin-loading complex is located. In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70 kilobase-long regions at 3'-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge on each other. Changing gene expression modulates the position of these 'cohesin islands'. These findings indicate that transcription can relocate mammalian cohesin over long distances on DNA, as previously reported for yeast cohesin, that this translocation contributes to positioning cohesin at CTCF sites, and that active genes can be freed from cohesin either by transcription-mediated translocation or by Wapl-mediated release."
https://openalex.org/W2605479282,"The ability to visualize directly a large number of distinct molecular species inside cells is increasingly essential for understanding complex systems and processes. Even though existing methods have successfully been used to explore structure-function relationships in nervous systems, to profile RNA in situ, to reveal the heterogeneity of tumour microenvironments and to study dynamic macromolecular assembly, it remains challenging to image many species with high selectivity and sensitivity under biological conditions. For instance, fluorescence microscopy faces a 'colour barrier', owing to the intrinsically broad (about 1,500 inverse centimetres) and featureless nature of fluorescence spectra that limits the number of resolvable colours to two to five (or seven to nine if using complicated instrumentation and analysis). Spontaneous Raman microscopy probes vibrational transitions with much narrower resonances (peak width of about 10 inverse centimetres) and so does not suffer from this problem, but weak signals make many bio-imaging applications impossible. Although surface-enhanced Raman scattering offers high sensitivity and multiplicity, it cannot be readily used to image specific molecular targets quantitatively inside live cells. Here we use stimulated Raman scattering under electronic pre-resonance conditions to image target molecules inside living cells with very high vibrational selectivity and sensitivity (down to 250 nanomolar with a time constant of 1 millisecond). We create a palette of triple-bond-conjugated near-infrared dyes that each displays a single peak in the cell-silent Raman spectral window; when combined with available fluorescent probes, this palette provides 24 resolvable colours, with the potential for further expansion. Proof-of-principle experiments on neuronal co-cultures and brain tissues reveal cell-type-dependent heterogeneities in DNA and protein metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions, underscoring the potential of this 24-colour (super-multiplex) optical imaging approach for elucidating intricate interactions in complex biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2606478035,"Ageing drives changes in neuronal and cognitive function, the decline of which is a major feature of many neurological disorders. The hippocampus, a brain region subserving roles of spatial and episodic memory and learning, is sensitive to the detrimental effects of ageing at morphological and molecular levels. With advancing age, synapses in various hippocampal subfields exhibit impaired long-term potentiation, an electrophysiological correlate of learning and memory. At the molecular level, immediate early genes are among the synaptic plasticity genes that are both induced by long-term potentiation and downregulated in the aged brain. In addition to revitalizing other aged tissues, exposure to factors in young blood counteracts age-related changes in these central nervous system parameters, although the identities of specific cognition-promoting factors or whether such activity exists in human plasma remains unknown. We hypothesized that plasma of an early developmental stage, namely umbilical cord plasma, provides a reservoir of such plasticity-promoting proteins. Here we show that human cord plasma treatment revitalizes the hippocampus and improves cognitive function in aged mice. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), a blood-borne factor enriched in human cord plasma, young mouse plasma, and young mouse hippocampi, appears in the brain after systemic administration and increases synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent cognition in aged mice. Depletion experiments in aged mice revealed TIMP2 to be necessary for the cognitive benefits conferred by cord plasma. We find that systemic pools of TIMP2 are necessary for spatial memory in young mice, while treatment of brain slices with TIMP2 antibody prevents long-term potentiation, arguing for previously unknown roles for TIMP2 in normal hippocampal function. Our findings reveal that human cord plasma contains plasticity-enhancing proteins of high translational value for targeting ageing- or disease-associated hippocampal dysfunction."

Planets cause a dip in the light received when they pass in front of their parent stars. M stars have masses less than 60 per cent that of the Sun, and account for three-quarters of our Galaxy's stellar population. Seven Earth-sized planets are known to transit such a star, TRAPPIST-1, at 12 parsecs from Earth, but their masses and therefore their densities are rather poorly constrained. Jason Dittman et al. report observations of LHS 1140b, a planet with a radius 1.4 times that of Earth that is transiting an M dwarf star 12 parsecs from Earth and receiving sufficient insolation to place it in the liquid-water, 'habitable zone'. They measure the mass to be 6.6 times that of Earth, which suggests a rocky bulk composition. M dwarf stars, which have masses less than 60 per cent that of the Sun, make up 75 per cent of the population of the stars in the Galaxy1. The atmospheres of orbiting Earth-sized planets are observationally accessible via transmission spectroscopy when the planets pass in front of these stars2,3. Statistical results suggest that the nearest transiting Earth-sized planet in the liquid-water, habitable zone of an M dwarf star is probably around 10.5 parsecs away4. A temperate planet has been discovered orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest M dwarf5, but it probably does not transit and its true mass is unknown. Seven Earth-sized planets transit the very low-mass star TRAPPIST-1, which is 12 parsecs away6,7, but their masses and, particularly, their densities are poorly constrained. Here we report observations of LHS 1140b, a planet with a radius of 1.4 Earth radii transiting a small, cool star (LHS 1140) 12 parsecs away. We measure the mass of the planet to be 6.6 times that of Earth, consistent with a rocky bulk composition. LHS 1140b receives an insolation of 0.46 times that of Earth, placing it within the liquid-water, habitable zone8. With 90 per cent confidence, we place an upper limit on the orbital eccentricity of 0.29. The circular orbit is unlikely to be the result of tides and therefore was probably present at formation. Given its large surface gravity and cool insolation, the planet may have retained its atmosphere despite the greater luminosity (compared to the present-day) of its host star in its youth9,10. Because LHS 1140 is nearby, telescopes currently under construction might be able to search for specific atmospheric gases in the future2,3."
https://openalex.org/W4250703007,"Starting with alkyl carboxylic acids, a simple olefin synthesis using any substitution pattern or geometry, based on amide-bond synthesis with nickel- or iron-based catalysis, is described. Olefins are ubiquitous functional groups in organic chemistry and are typically installed in small molecules by the formation of a carbon–carbon double bond. Here, Phil Baran and colleagues report a decarboxylative alkyl-vinyl cross-coupling that offers a cheap and simple route to olefins with defined geometry and substitution pattern. The nickel or iron catalysts extract carbon dioxide from the carboxylic acid, which is activated in a similar way to peptide-bond formation. The alkene is then attached with a vinyl zinc reagent. The authors exemplify their method by preparing more than 60 olefins and synthesizing 16 natural products. One such example offers a short route to macrocyclic polyketides from the commodity chemical diethyl tartrate. Olefin chemistry, through pericyclic reactions, polymerizations, oxidations, or reductions, has an essential role in the manipulation of organic matter1. Despite its importance, olefin synthesis still relies largely on chemistry introduced more than three decades ago, with metathesis2 being the most recent addition. Here we describe a simple method of accessing olefins with any substitution pattern or geometry from one of the most ubiquitous and variegated building blocks of chemistry: alkyl carboxylic acids. The activating principles used in amide-bond synthesis can therefore be used, with nickel- or iron-based catalysis, to extract carbon dioxide from a carboxylic acid and economically replace it with an organozinc-derived olefin on a molar scale. We prepare more than 60 olefins across a range of substrate classes, and the ability to simplify retrosynthetic analysis is exemplified with the preparation of 16 different natural products across 10 different families."

https://openalex.org/W2605540202,"Human members of the solute carrier 1 (SLC1) family of transporters take up excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain and amino acids in peripheral organs. Dysregulation of the function of SLC1 transporters is associated with neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Here we present crystal structures of a thermostabilized human SLC1 transporter, the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), with and without allosteric and competitive inhibitors bound. The structures reveal architectural features of the human transporters, such as intra- and extracellular domains that have potential roles in transport function, regulation by lipids and post-translational modifications. The coordination of the allosteric inhibitor in the structures and the change in the transporter dynamics measured by hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveal a mechanism of inhibition, in which the transporter is locked in the outward-facing states of the transport cycle. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and pharmacology of human SLC1 transporters. High-resolution structures of the thermostabilized human excitatory amino acid transporter EAAT1, alone or in association with its substrate or small molecule inhibitors, reveal architectural features of human SLC1 transporters and an allosteric mechanism of inhibition. Amino acid transporters of the solute carrier 1 (SLC1) family have been associated with several neurological and metabolic disorders in humans, but information about their structure has been limited to a simpler homologue from an archeal microorganism. Nicolas Reyes and colleagues present several high-resolution structures of the human excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), a key component of glutamatergic synapses, alone or in association with its substrate or small inhibitor molecules. The structures reveal mechanistic determinants that are specific to human SLC1 carriers, such as regulation by lipids or post-translational modifications, and present an allosteric pocket that could aid further drug design. On the basis of these structures, researchers will be able to propose how specific mutations affect EAAT1 transport mechanics at a molecular level and therefore suggest more effective treatment approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2605934824,"The identification of homotypic SLAMF7 interactions responsible for haematopoietic tumour cell phagocytosis by macrophages when the inhibitory receptor/ligand interaction of SIRPα/CD47 is blocked therapeutically. Phagocytosis of tumour cells has a critical role in cancer control, but the pro-phagocytic receptors responsible for this process are largely unknown. André Veillette and colleagues identify homotypic SLAMF7 interactions that are responsible for phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells by macrophages when the inhibitory receptor–ligand interaction of CD47–SIRPα is blocked therapeutically. The authors suggest that the presence of SLAMF7 receptors on haematopoietic tumours could therefore be an important factor in blockade therapy. Cancer cells elude anti-tumour immunity through multiple mechanisms, including upregulated expression of ligands for inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors1,2. Phagocytosis by macrophages plays a critical role in cancer control3,4,5,6. Therapeutic blockade of signal regulatory protein (SIRP)-α, an inhibitory receptor on macrophages, or of its ligand CD47 expressed on tumour cells, improves tumour cell elimination in vitro and in vivo7,8,9,10, suggesting that blockade of the SIRPα–CD47 checkpoint could be useful in treating human cancer11,12,13,14. However, the pro-phagocytic receptor(s) responsible for tumour cell phagocytosis is(are) largely unknown. Here we find that macrophages are much more efficient at phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells, compared with non-haematopoietic tumour cells, in response to SIRPα–CD47 blockade. Using a mouse lacking the signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of homotypic haematopoietic cell-specific receptors, we determined that phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells during SIRPα–CD47 blockade was strictly dependent on SLAM family receptors in vitro and in vivo. In both mouse and human cells, this function required a single SLAM family member, SLAMF7 (also known as CRACC, CS1, CD319), expressed on macrophages and tumour cell targets. In contrast to most SLAM receptor functions15,16,17, SLAMF7-mediated phagocytosis was independent of signalling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) adaptors. Instead, it depended on the ability of SLAMF7 to interact with integrin Mac-1 (refs 18, 19, 20) and utilize signals involving immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs21,22. These findings elucidate the mechanism by which macrophages engulf and destroy haematopoietic tumour cells. They also reveal a novel SAP adaptor-independent function for a SLAM receptor. Lastly, they suggest that patients with tumours expressing SLAMF7 are more likely to respond to SIRPα–CD47 blockade therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2554260667,"The quantum of heat conductance of ballistic one-dimensional (1D) channels, being gQ=k0T with k0=pi^2*2kB^2/3h (T - temperature, kB - Boltzmann's constant, h - Planck's constant), is an important fundamental constant. While the quantization of the electrical conductance of 1D ballistic conductors has long been experimentally established, a demonstration of the quantization of thermal conductance proved to be much harder. It has already been accomplished for weakly interacting systems of phonons, photons, and electronic Fermi-liquids. Theoretically, however, the quantization must also hold in strongly interacting systems, such as the Fractional Quantum Hall effect (FQHE), where electrons fractionalize into anyons and chargeless quasiparticles such as neutral Majorana fermions. Since the bulk in the FQHE is incompressible, it is not expected to contribute significantly to the heat conductance, which is determined by chiral 1D edge modes. The thermal conductance reflects topological properties of the FQH electronic systems to which the electrical conductance gives no access. Here, we present results of extensive measurements of the heat conductance in 'particle-like' (Laughlin's) and 'hole-like' fractional states. We verify the universal value of the quantum of thermal conductance of the charged fractional modes as well as for chargeless neutral modes. We also prove the validity of the theoretical predictions for the more complex (and less studied) 'hole-like' states. Heat transport measurements open a door to ample information, not easily accessible by conductance measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2607405708,"Surface meltwater drains across ice sheets, forming melt ponds that can trigger ice-shelf collapse, acceleration of grounded ice flow and increased sea-level rise. Numerical models of the Antarctic Ice Sheet that incorporate meltwater's impact on ice shelves, but ignore the movement of water across the ice surface, predict a metre of global sea-level rise this century in response to atmospheric warming. To understand the impact of water moving across the ice surface a broad quantification of surface meltwater and its drainage is needed. Yet, despite extensive research in Greenland and observations of individual drainage systems in Antarctica, we have little understanding of Antarctic-wide surface hydrology or how it will evolve. Here we show widespread drainage of meltwater across the surface of the ice sheet through surface streams and ponds (hereafter 'surface drainage') as far south as 85° S and as high as 1,300 metres above sea level. Our findings are based on satellite imagery from 1973 onwards and aerial photography from 1947 onwards. Surface drainage has persisted for decades, transporting water up to 120 kilometres from grounded ice onto and across ice shelves, feeding vast melt ponds up to 80 kilometres long. Large-scale surface drainage could deliver water to areas of ice shelves vulnerable to collapse, as melt rates increase this century. While Antarctic surface melt ponds are relatively well documented on some ice shelves, we have discovered that ponds often form part of widespread, large-scale surface drainage systems. In a warming climate, enhanced surface drainage could accelerate future ice-mass loss from Antarctic, potentially via positive feedbacks between the extent of exposed rock, melting and thinning of the ice sheet."
https://openalex.org/W2605401275,"Meltwater stored in ponds and crevasses can weaken and fracture ice shelves, triggering their rapid disintegration. This ice-shelf collapse results in an increased flux of ice from adjacent glaciers and ice streams, thereby raising sea level globally. However, surface rivers forming on ice shelves could potentially export stored meltwater and prevent its destructive effects. Here we present evidence for persistent active drainage networks-interconnected streams, ponds and rivers-on the Nansen Ice Shelf in Antarctica that export a large fraction of the ice shelf's meltwater into the ocean. We find that active drainage has exported water off the ice surface through waterfalls and dolines for more than a century. The surface river terminates in a 130-metre-wide waterfall that can export the entire annual surface melt over the course of seven days. During warmer melt seasons, these drainage networks adapt to changing environmental conditions by remaining active for longer and exporting more water. Similar networks are present on the ice shelf in front of Petermann Glacier, Greenland, but other systems, such as on the Larsen C and Amery Ice Shelves, retain surface water at present. The underlying reasons for export versus retention remain unclear. Nonetheless our results suggest that, in a future warming climate, surface rivers could export melt off the large ice shelves surrounding Antarctica-contrary to present Antarctic ice-sheet models, which assume that meltwater is stored on the ice surface where it triggers ice-shelf disintegration."
https://openalex.org/W2605896263,"Mechanistic air pollution modeling is essential in air quality management, yet the extensive expertise and computational resources required to run most models prevent their use in many situations where their results would be useful. Here, we present InMAP (Intervention Model for Air Pollution), which offers an alternative to comprehensive air quality models for estimating the air pollution health impacts of emission reductions and other potential interventions. InMAP estimates annual-average changes in primary and secondary fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations-the air pollution outcome generally causing the largest monetized health damages-attributable to annual changes in precursor emissions. InMAP leverages pre-processed physical and chemical information from the output of a state-of-the-science chemical transport model and a variable spatial resolution computational grid to perform simulations that are several orders of magnitude less computationally intensive than comprehensive model simulations. In comparisons run here, InMAP recreates comprehensive model predictions of changes in total PM2.5 concentrations with population-weighted mean fractional bias (MFB) of -17% and population-weighted R2 = 0.90. Although InMAP is not specifically designed to reproduce total observed concentrations, it is able to do so within published air quality model performance criteria for total PM2.5. Potential uses of InMAP include studying exposure, health, and environmental justice impacts of potential shifts in emissions for annual-average PM2.5. InMAP can be trained to run for any spatial and temporal domain given the availability of appropriate simulation output from a comprehensive model. The InMAP model source code and input data are freely available online under an open-source license."

However, it has been challenging to directly observe these complexes and their functional roles in living systems. In this work, we have used wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopy to investigate the spatial organization of metabolic enzymes participating in glucose metabolism in human cells. We provide compelling evidence that human liver-type phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKL), which catalyzes a bottleneck step of glycolysis, forms various sizes of cytoplasmic clusters in human cancer cells, independent of protein expression levels and of the choice of fluorescent tags. We also report that these PFKL clusters colocalize with other rate-limiting enzymes in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, supporting the formation of multienzyme complexes. Subsequent biophysical characterizations with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and FRET corroborate the formation of multienzyme metabolic complexes in living cells, which appears to be controlled by post-translational acetylation on PFKL. Importantly, quantitative high-content imaging assays indicated that the direction of glucose flux between glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and serine biosynthesis seems to be spatially regulated by the multienzyme complexes in a cluster-size-dependent manner.

Glucose metabolism involves two reciprocal pathways: glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, during which glucose flux partitions between energy metabolism and anabolic biosynthetic pathways (supplemental Fig. S1). To regulate both the flux and allocation of glucose-derived pathway intermediates, the cell needs mechanisms to coordinate the activities of the pathway enzymes. Specifically, cancer cells have evolved to control their metabolic activity by genetic alterations of isozyme expression and/or post-translational modifications of the rate-limiting enzymes of glucose metabolism, thus preferentially directing pathway intermediates into building block biosynthesis (1Christofk H.R.

However, there are still many challenges ahead when exploring new dimensions of glycolytic enzymes and their complexes, particularly in living human cells. Given the tissue specificity of the band 3 protein in erythrocytes or the unique Z-line structure of myocytes, the observed metabolic complexes in these cells do not fully provide mechanistic insights of how such enzyme complexes are organized in other human cell types absent their reported scaffolds. Importantly, the metabolic influence of these complexes on cells remains to be further elucidated. Therefore, we sought to identify such complexes in living human cancer cells and their functional contributions to cellular metabolism. In this work, we provide several lines of compelling evidence that every cytoplasmic, rate-limiting enzyme involved in glycolysis, as well as gluconeogenesis, is spatially compartmentalized into three different sizes of cytoplasmic clusters in human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa and human breast carcinoma Hs578T cells. As controls, we validate that the varying sizes of the enzyme cluster observed in HeLa and Hs578T cells are independent of the expression levels of tagged enzymes, as well as the tagging method. Subsequent biophysical analyses using FRET and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) techniques corroborate the formation of multienzyme metabolic complexes in live cells. We further demonstrate that the multienzyme complex for glucose metabolism is a spatially distinct cellular entity from other cytoplasmic cellular bodies, including stress granules (22Tourrière H.

A new view into the regulation of purine metabolims: the purinosome.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2017; 42: 141-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Importantly, we provide evidence to support the cluster-size-dependent functional roles of the multienzyme metabolic assemblies at single-cell levels. Collectively, we demonstrate the existence of a multienzyme metabolic complex for glucose metabolism in living human cells, providing new mechanistic insights regarding how a cell regulates the direction of glucose flux between energy metabolism and anabolic biosynthetic pathways at single-cell levels. We first investigated subcellular locations of the metabolic enzymes of glucose metabolism using fluorescent protein tags under fluorescence live-cell microscopy. We found that human liver-type phosphofructokinase 1, tagged with a monomeric form of enhanced green fluorescent protein (PFKL-mEGFP), forms discrete cytoplasmic clusters of varying sizes in transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1, A–C). This clustering pattern of PFKL-mEGFP was also identified in human breast carcinoma Hs578T cells (Fig. 1, D–F) and human pancreatic adenocarcinoma Pa04C and Pa18C cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Moreover, the PFKL clusters were formed when mEGFP was alternatively tagged at the N terminus of PFKL (mEGFP-PFKL) (supplemental Fig. S2C). To better characterize the diverse clustering phenomena, we analyzed the size distribution of PFKL-mEGFP clusters at single-cell levels when Hs578T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (dFBS) (described under “Experimental procedures”). Based on the entirety of the data presented in this work, we have categorized the varying sizes of PFKL-mEGFP clusters into three distinguishable subgroups for clarification (Fig. 1, A–G). In the first subgroup, which represents 58.3 ± 4.7% of transfected Hs578T cells (Fig. 1G), PFKL-mEGFP proteins assembled throughout the cytoplasm into a number of small clusters. The small-sized clusters are defined as having less than 0.1 μm2 (Fig. 1, A and D) based on the calculated area of the point spread function for the mEGFP emission (i.e. 0.1 μm2) (27Cole R.W. Jinadasa T. Brown C.M. Measuring and interpreting point spread functions to determine confocal microscope resolution and ensure quality control.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6: 1929-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Line scan fluorescent intensity analysis across the cell also supports that this phenomena was clearly distinguishable from the diffusive pattern exhibited by other mEGFP-tagged metabolic enzymes including, but not limited to, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase (25An S.

Kohnhorst C.L. Esemoto N.N. An S. Dynamic architecture of the purinosome involved in human de novo purine biosynthesis.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3). In the second subgroup, ∼97% of PFKL-mEGFP clusters in 13.4 ± 3.3% transfected cells displayed medium-sized clusters, ranging from 0.1 to 3 μm2 in size (Fig. 1G and supplemental Fig. S4A). However, relative to the second subgroup, the third subgroup of transfected cells exhibited an increased fraction of large-sized clusters (i.e. ∼16% versus 3%) (supplemental Fig. S4B), ranging between 3 and 8 μm2, which were randomly distributed in the cytoplasm in the presence of smaller clusters (Fig. 1, C and F). 26.7 ± 3.6% of transfected Hs578T cells are assigned to the third subgroup (Fig. 1G). In summary, we have defined three differently sized PFKL-mEGFP clusters at single-cell levels in HeLa and Hs578T cells, namely small-, medium-, and large-sized clusters. We then investigated whether the clustering formation of PFKL-mEGFP would be relevant for human cancer cells. Because three different sizes of PFKL-mEGFP clusters were observed in human breast cancer Hs578T cells, we selected to test the formation of PFKL-mEGFP clusters in a non-cancerous human normal breast cell line, Hs578Bst, because this cancer/non-cancerous pair of breast tissue cell lines were derived from the same patient (29Hackett A.J. Smith H.S. Springer E.L. Owens R.B. Nelson-Rees W.A. Riggs J.L. Gardner M.B. Two syngeneic cell lines from human breast tissue: the aneuploid mammary epithelial (Hs578T) and the diploid myoepithelial (Hs578Bst) cell lines.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1977; 58: 1795-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). From our cluster size analysis of non-cancerous breast Hs578Bst cells, we found that PFKL-mEGFP formed a number of small clusters (i.e. ∼0.1 μm2) throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A), as well as medium-sized clusters (< 3 μm2) (Fig. 2B). However, non-cancerous Hs578Bst cells did not induce large-sized fluorescent clusters. Although additional non-cancerous normal cells may need to be evaluated, we hypothesize that large-sized clusters of PFKL-mEGFP in Hs578T cells are a cancer-relevant cellular phenomenon. We further evaluated the formation of large-sized PFKL clusters in the cancerous Hs578T cells when they were maintained in the non-cancerous Hs578Bst-supporting medium. Please note that although cancerous Hs578T cells were cultured in the RPMI 1640 and 10% dFBS, the non-cancerous Hs578Bst cells were cultured in Hybri-Care medium (ATCC) supplemented with 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 10% FBS, and 30 ng/ml mouse EGF. However, in the Hs578Bst-supporting medium, 23.4 ± 4.5% of Hs578T cells showed the formation of large-sized clusters, which is similar to the percentage of cells (26.7 ± 3.6%) showing large-sized clusters in Fig. 1G. Therefore, we conclude that large-sized clusters in cancerous Hs578T cells are induced regardless of the differences of the two cell culture conditions. To evaluate whether the varying size of PFKL-mEGFP clusters is dependent on the protein expression level, we further quantitated the mean or total fluorescent intensity per cell as an indication of the protein expression level in single cells. However, we did not identify any positive or negative correlation between the mean or total fluorescent intensity per cell and the average size of clusters per cell or the number of clusters per cell (Fig. 1, H–K, and supplemental Fig. S4C). As an added note, the relationship between the size of individual cells and the average size of clusters per cell or the number of clusters per cell also appears to be random (supplemental Fig. S4, D and E). Collectively, we conclude that neither the formation of the fluorescent clusters by PFKL-mEGFP, nor their size, is governed by the expression levels of PFKL-mEGFP at single-cell levels. To examine whether endogenous PFKL exhibits similar cytoplasmic clustering patterns in non-transfected cells, we performed immunocytochemistry against endogenous PFKL in HeLa and Hs578T cells. Although chemical manipulation sometimes alters subcellular distribution of endogenous proteins during fixation and permeabilization (30Schnell U. Dijk F. Sjollema K.A. Giepmans B.N. Immunolabeling artifacts and the need for live-cell imaging.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we observed in >95% of fixed cells that the subcellular distribution of endogenous PFKL appears to be discrete clusters in the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. S5), much as we observed in transfected cells expressing PFKL-mEGFP. We did not detect immunofluorescent signal absent primary, secondary, or both antibodies in our controls. In addition, our results are consistent with the subcellular distribution of immunostained PFKLs in other fixed human cells, as can be seen at the Human Protein Atlas. Taken together, these data indicate that the subcellular distribution of PFKL-mEGFP in transfected cells mirrors the distribution pattern of endogenous PFKL, setting us to investigate real-time spatial dynamics of the PFKL-mEGFP clusters in live cells. We also demonstrated as controls that other enzymes in glucose metabolism whose subcellular locations are genetically determined were properly localized in their designated organelles when tagged with mEGFP in the presence and absence of monomeric orange fluorescent protein-tagged PFKL (PFKL-mOFP). mEGFP-tagged hexokinase 1 and 2 and pyruvate carboxylase were explicitly associated with mitochondria in HeLa and Hs578T cells (supplemental Fig. S6A) (28Kyoung M. Russell S.J. Kohnhorst C.L. Esemoto N.N. An S. Dynamic architecture of the purinosome involved in human de novo purine biosynthesis.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas mEGFP-tagged glucose-6-phosphatase 3 stained the endoplasmic reticulum in HeLa and Hs578T cells (supplemental Fig. S6B). The ectopic expression of mEGFP alone did not induce any manner of fluorescent foci with or without PFKL-mOFP in our experimental conditions in either HeLa or Hs578T cells. We conclude that along with other metabolic enzymes showing diffusive patterns in the cytoplasm with mEGFP tags (supplemental Fig. S3C) (25An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J. Reversible compartmentalization of de novo purine biosynthetic complexes in living cells.Science. 2008; 320: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 28Kyoung M. Russell S.J. Kohnhorst C.L. Esemoto N.N. An S. Dynamic architecture of the purinosome involved in human de novo purine biosynthesis.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the mEGFP tag does not alter subcellular locations of metabolic enzymes involved in glucose metabolism in living human cells. Additionally, we have constructed tetracysteine (TC) motif-conjugated variants of PFKL. Briefly, the TC motif, which is composed of only six amino acids (e.g. N-CCPGCC-C), can be fluorescently labeled with small biarsenical compounds (31Hoffmann C. Gaietta G. Zürn A. Adams S.R. Terrillon S. Ellisman M.H. Tsien R.Y. Lohse M.J. Fluorescent labeling of tetracysteine-tagged proteins in intact cells.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of TC-mediated fluorescent staining in our conditions, we first transfected Hs578T cells with dually tagged PFKL with TC and mEGFP (i.e. PFKL-TC-mEGFP). We then incubated the cells with a biarsenical resorufin-derivative agent, namely ReAsH-EDT2 (ThermoFisher Scientific), to visualize the PKFL clusters. Clearly, colocalization of ReAsH (in the red channel) and mEGFP (in the green channel) signals supports the specific labeling of ReAsH to PFKL-TC-mEGFP in our conditions (supplemental Fig. S7, A–C). Finally, our live-cell imaging with PFKL-TC demonstrated three differently sized clusters in the presence of ReAsH (supplemental Fig. S7D) as PFKL-mEGFP in the cytoplasm of Hs578T cells. Collectively, we conclude that the mEGFP tag did not arbitrarily promote the formation of fluorescent clusters in cells. We have also investigated whether the fluorescent clusters formed by PFKL-mEGFP are composed of mobile proteins or insoluble protein aggregates. Using FRAP, we photobleached the various sizes of PFKL-mEGFP clusters ranging from ∼0.3 to ∼8 μm2 in live Hs578T cells and then monitored the recovery of fluorescent intensities in the photobleached areas (supplemental Fig. S8). We first performed FRAP on the minor population of Hs578T cells, in which transfected PFKL-mEGFP does not form any kind of cluster (i.e. <2% of transfected cells). The diffusion coefficient of the non-clustering PFKL-mEGFP was 0.114 ± 0.045 μm2/s (NFRAP = 10). However, the diffusion coefficients of PFKL-mEGFP within the medium- and large-sized clusters are similar to each other; i.e. Dapp = 0.018 ± 0.009 μm2/s (NFRAP = 80). The ∼7-fold difference in the diffusion coefficients of PFKL-mEGFP indicates that the diffusion of PFKL-mEGFP is noticeably hindered in cluster-positive Hs578T cells, suggesting potential interactions with other biomolecules. Nonetheless, this FRAP analysis strongly supports the possibility that the PFKL-mEGFP clusters are composed of “mobile” enzymes rather than insoluble protein aggregates, regardless of their sizes in Hs578T cells. From our FRAP analysis, we anticipated that PFKL-mEGFP would be involved in specific or non-specific protein-protein interactions in cluster-positive Hs578T cells. To identify potential protein partners of PFKL in the spatially distinct compartments, we first carried out dual-color colocalization microscopy with other enzymes in glucose metabolism. Fourteen enzymes participate in glycolysis and/or gluconeogenesis. Half of these, including PFKL, catalyze irreversible reactions and thus control the rate-limiting steps in either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Our live-cell imaging revealed that three cytoplasmic, rate-limiting enzymes in either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis (i.e. mEGFP-tagged liver-type fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-mEGFP), pyruvate kinase M2 (mEGFP-PKM2), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK1-mEGFP)) formed coclusters with PFKL-mOFP in both HeLa and Hs578T cell lines (Fig. 3, A–I). The coclustering efficiency between FBPase-mEGFP and PFKL-mOFP among cotransfected Hs578T cells was ∼85%. Importantly, we observed coclusters having various sizes between ∼0.5 and ∼8 μm2 in Hs578T cells, indicating that medium- and large-sized clusters are multienyzme compartments. Colocalization of PFKL-mEGFP with FBPase-mOFP was also monitored after we reversed the fusion of the fluorescent tags in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S9). Collectively, this indicates that all four cytoplasmic, rate-limiting enzymes in glucose metabolism (i.e. PFKL, FBPase, PKM2, and PEPCK1) are spatially organized into multienzyme complexes in live human cells. We further investigated whether the colocalization of these enzymes indicates the occurrence of direct protein-protein associations within the cluster site. Particularly, PFKL and FBPase catalyze the same step of glucose metabolism, though in opposite directions. The activities of both enzymes are reciprocally regulated by a set of allosteric metabolites, and thus it has been proposed that they might directly interact as a means to further this reciprocal control mechanism. However, evidence of this proposed protein-protein interaction had been circumstan"

The impacts of residents’ daily activities and appliance usages on the power consumption of the entire household are incorporated to improve the accuracy of the forecasting model. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) we addressed short-term electricity load forecasting for 24 hours ahead, not on the aggregate but on the individual household level, which fits into the Residential Power Load Forecasting (RPLF) methods; (2) for the forecasting, we utilized a household specific dataset of behaviors that influence power consumption, which was derived using segmentation and sequence mining algorithms; and (3) an extensive load forecasting study using different forecasting algorithms enhanced by the household activity patterns was undertaken."

An emerging model of this process is the elevator mechanism, in which a substrate-binding transport domain moves a large distance across the membrane. This mechanism has been characterized by a transition between two states, but the conformational path that leads to the transition is not yet known, largely because the available structural information has been limited to the two end states. Here we present crystal structures of the inward-facing, intermediate, and outward-facing states of a concentrative nucleoside transporter from Neisseria wadsworthii. Notably, we determined the structures of multiple intermediate conformations, in which the transport domain is captured halfway through its elevator motion. Our structures present a trajectory of the conformational transition in the elevator model, revealing multiple intermediate steps and state-dependent conformational changes within the transport domain that are associated with the elevator-like motion."

Worldwide, more than 43% of deaths among under five year children is contributed by neonates. Half of the neonatal death occur in the first day of life. Recommendations about newborn care practices may conflict with local beliefs and practices. So, it is important to understand the existing newborn care practice and factors affecting it in order to take interventions so as to decrease neonatal death. Objective To assess magnitude of essential neonatal care utilization and associated factors among women visiting public health facilities in Aksum Town, Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, 2015. Methods Facility based cross sectional study was conducted from December 30, 2015 to January 31, 2016.The sampled population are 423 women who gave live births within the last 6 months prior to data collection. Systematic random sampling technique was employed. Data were entered, coded and cleaned using Epi info version 7, and SPSS Version 21 software was used for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with essential neonatal care utilization. Variables with P-value <0.2 in the bivariable logistic regression model were included in to multivariable logistic regression model, and finally variables with P-value <0.05 were considered as independent factors. Odds ratio was used to measure strength of association at 95% confidence level. Result A total of 423 mothers included in the study. Prevalence of safe cord care, optimal breast feeding, thermal care and baby received Tetracycline eye ointment and vaccine at birth were 42.8%, 63.1%, 32.6% and 44.7% among the respondents respectively. Only 113(26.7%) of the participants fulfilled essential new born care practice. Occupation, parity and counseling on essential new born care during delivery were significantly associated with utilization of essential new born care. Employed women (AOR = 7.08; 95% CI (2.21, 12.72), 2–3 number of deliveries (AOR = 1.84; 95% CI (1.04, 3.26) and received counseling about essential new born car during delivery (AOR = 3.36; 95% CI (1.86, 6.08) were more likely to practice essential neonatal care practice than their counterparts. Conclusion and recommendation Around three-fourth of mothers were not practicing Essential Newborn Care (ENC). Occupation, parity and essential new born care counseling during delivery were significantly associated with utilization of ENC. Promotion of information at community level, women empowerment and staff training is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2605827772,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are powerful regulators of diverse biologic processes. However, the function of most miRNAs in angiogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we identified miR-191–5p (miR-191) as a potent inhibitor of blood vessel development. Transfection of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells with miR-191 mimic (miR-191m) inhibited their proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Moreover, vascular sprouting of miR-191m–transfected mouse aortic rings was significantly reduced when compared with controls. Transfection with miR-191 inhibitor (miR-191i) induced proangiogenic effects. The anti- and proangiogenic activities of miR191m and −191i were further demonstrated in vivo. Additional molecular biologic analyses revealed that miR-191m activates NF-kB signaling by up-regulating the mRNA expression of p65. miR-191 also increased the mRNA levels of the antiangiogenic factors p21 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and reduced the expression of the proangiogenic factors eNOS and matrix metalloproteinase-1 and −9. Blockade of NF-kB activation with Bay 11–7082 reversed the antiangiogenic effects of miR-191m.

In the light of the role of synovium in the pathogenesis and the symptoms of OA, synovium-targeted therapy is a promising strategy to mitigate the symptoms and progression of OA. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), a secreted homodimeric protein, possesses unique and potent anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties in many cell types. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is an inducible anti-inflammatory and stress responsive enzyme that has been proven to prevent injuries caused by many diseases. Despite the similar anti-inflammatory profile and their involvement in the pathogenesis of arthritic diseases, no studies have as yet explored the possibility of any association between the expression of TGF-β1 and HO-1.TGF-β1-induced HO-1 expression was examined by HO-1 promoter assay, qPCR, and Western blotting. The siRNAs and enzyme inhibitors were utilized to determine the intermediate involved in the signal transduction pathway. We showed that TGF-β1 stimulated the synthesis of HO-1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which can be mitigated by blockade of the phospholipase (PLC)γ/protein kinase C alpha (PKC)α pathway. We also showed that the expression of miRNA-519b, which blocks HO-1 transcription, is inhibited by TGF-β1, and the suppression of miRNA 519b could be reversed via blockade of the PLCγ/PKCα pathway.TGF-β1 stimulated the expression of HO-1 via activating the PLCγ/PKCα pathway and suppressing the downstream expression of miRNA-519b.

https://openalex.org/W2606042440,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is the oxygen-sensitive subunit of the transcription factor HIF-1, and its expression is increased in placentas from pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia (PE). Fetal growth restriction (FGR) and PE often share a common pathophysiology; however, it is unknown whether increased placental HIF-1α occurs in FGR. We previously demonstrated that aberrant maternal inflammation in rats resulted in altered utero-placental perfusion and FGR, both of which were prevented by administration of the nitric oxide mimetic glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Our aim here was to determine whether abnormal maternal inflammation causing FGR is linked to placental HIF-1α accumulation and whether GTN administration could prevent increases in placental HIF-1α.Levels of inflammatory factors in maternal plasma were measured using a multiplex assay after an injection of low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rats on gestational day (GD) 13.5. Following three additional daily LPS injections from GD14.5-16.5, GD17.5 placentas were harvested for HIF-1α immunolocalisation; serial sections were also stained for the hypoxia marker pimonidazole. A subset of rats received LPS injections along with GTN delivered continuously (25 μg/h via a transdermal patch) on GD12.5-GD17.5.Within two hours of LPS administration, levels of maternal pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased compared with saline-treated controls. GD17.5 placentas of growth-restricted fetuses exhibited increased HIF-1α accumulation; however, this did not correlate with pimonidazole staining for which no differences were observed between groups. Furthermore, the LPS-mediated increases in maternal inflammatory cytokine levels and placental HIF-1α accumulation did not occur in rats treated with GTN.Our results demonstrate that inflammation-induced FGR is associated with increased placental HIF-1α accumulation; however, expression of this transcription factor may not correlate with regions of hypoxia in late-gestation placentas. The GTN-mediated attenuation of placental HIF-1α accumulation in LPS-treated rats provides insight into the mechanism by which GTN improves inflammation-induced complications of pregnancy."

This affects hair growth in otherwise healthy animals. In this study, we investigate whether a prolonged naturalistic life-stress exposure affects cytokine balance and hair parameters in healthy humans. 33 (18 exam, 15 comparison) female medical students with comparable sociobiological status were analyzed during a stressful final examination period, at three points in time (T) 12 weeks apart. T1 was before start of the learning period, T2 between the three-day written exam and an oral examination, and T3 after a 12 week rest and recovery from the stress of the examination period. Assessments included: self-reported distress and coping strategies (Perceived Stress Questionnaire [PSQ], Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress [TICS]), COPE), cytokines in supernatants of stimulated peripheral blood mononucleocytes (PBMCs), and trichogram (hair cycle and pigmentation analysis). Comparison between students participating in the final medical exam at T2 and non-exam students, revealed significantly higher stress perception in exam students. Time-wise comparison revealed that stress level, TH1/TH2 cytokine balance and hair parameters changed significantly from T1 to T2 in the exam group, but not the control. However, no group differences were found for cytokine balance or hair parameters at T2. The study concludes that in humans, naturalistic stress, as perceived during participation in a major medical exam, has the potential to shift the immune response to TH1 and transiently hamper hair growth, but these changes stay within a physiological range. Findings are instructive for patients suffering from hair loss in times of high stress. Replication in larger and more diverse sample populations is required, to assess suitability of trichogram analysis as biological outcome for stress studies."

Disease-associated mutations in G1 studied to date are believed to induce complete loss of receptor function through disruption of either receptor trafficking or signaling activity. Given that N-terminal truncation of G1 and other adhesion G protein-coupled receptors has been shown to significantly increase the receptors' constitutive signaling, we examined two different bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria-inducing extracellular loop mutations (R565W and L640R) in the context of both full-length and N-terminally truncated (ΔNT) G1. Interestingly, we found that these mutations reduced surface expression of full-length G1 but not G1-ΔNT in HEK-293 cells. Moreover, the mutations ablated receptor-mediated activation of serum response factor luciferase, a classic measure of Gα12/13-mediated signaling, but had no effect on G1-mediated signaling to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) luciferase. Given these differential signaling results, we sought to further elucidate the pathway by which G1 can activate NFAT luciferase. We found no evidence that ΔNT activation of NFAT is dependent on Gαq/11-mediated or β-arrestin-mediated signaling but rather involves liberation of Gβγ subunits and activation of calcium channels. These findings reveal that disease-associated mutations to the extracellular loops of G1 differentially alter receptor trafficking, depending on the presence of the N terminus, and differentially alter signaling to distinct downstream pathways.

These receptors are broadly expressed in various tissues and involved in numerous aspects of normal physiology as well as pathological processes (1Hamann J. Aust G. Araç D. Engel F.B. Formstone C.

Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors.Pharmacol. Rev. 2015; 67: 338-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Adhesion GPCRs possess extremely long extracellular N termini that are often decorated with multiple protein/protein interaction domains. An unusual feature of these receptors is their ability to autocatalytically cleave into N-terminal fragment (NTF) and C-terminal fragment (CTF) protomers. Autoproteolysis is mediated by the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, which is found on the receptors' extracellular NT near the first transmembrane domain (2Araç D. Boucard A.A. Bolliger M.F. Nguyen J. Soltis S.M. Südhof T.C. Brunger A.T.

Postcleavage, the NTF and CTF remain non-covalently associated for at least some period of time. Deletion or removal of the NTF has been demonstrated to strikingly enhance the signaling activity of many aGPCRs, suggesting that the NTF normally suppresses the activity of the CTF when the two protomers are in complex (3Okajima D.

We previously investigated this model for G1 and found that the stalk is indeed essential for some but not all signaling outputs (35Kishore A. Purcell R.H. Nassiri-Toosi Z. Hall R.A. Stalk-dependent and stalk-independent signaling by the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors GPR56 (ADGRG1) and BAI1 (ADGRB1).J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 3385-3394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, for other aGPCRs, such as ADGRB1 (BAI1), the presence of the extracellular stalk does not appear to matter at all for receptor signaling activity (35Kishore A. Purcell R.H. Nassiri-Toosi Z. Hall R.A. Stalk-dependent and stalk-independent signaling by the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors GPR56 (ADGRG1) and BAI1 (ADGRB1).J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 3385-3394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These findings led us to posit that aGPCRs may be capable of at least two distinct modes of signaling activity: stalk-dependent and stalk-independent. For G1, the stalk was found to be required for activation of serum response factor (SRF) luciferase, a traditional measure of activity for Gα12/13-coupled receptors (36Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. The small GTP-binding protein Rho links G protein-coupled receptors and Gα12 to the serum response element and to cellular transformation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The stalk-independent activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) luciferase, however, was found in those studies to rely on both G protein-dependent and -independent components and has not been clearly defined in terms of the relevant signaling cascade. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two BFPP-causing mutations, R565W and L640R, on receptor surface expression and signaling. These studies were performed on both full-length G1 and the ΔNT truncated receptor that mimics the cleaved, active receptor. Moreover, the signaling studies assessed both stalk-dependent and stalk-independent signaling activity. The results of these studies have provided new insights into the regulation of G1 signaling and the mechanisms by which these mutations cause human disease. We generated four mutants version of G1: full-length (FL) and ΔNT receptors harboring either the R565W or L640R mutation (Fig. 1). The ΔNT versions of G1 lack most of the N terminus (Δ amino acids 1–382) up to the site of predicted GAIN domain cleavage and therefore mimic the CTF of G1 that is cleaved at the GAIN domain and undergoes dissociation from the NTF. We assessed the surface trafficking of each mutant in HEK-293T cells in relation to its wild-type counterpart via a cell surface biotinylation approach. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, we observed that the surface expression and total expression of both full-length mutants were drastically reduced in comparison with the wild-type full-length receptor. Surprisingly, however, the ΔNT mutants displayed no significant deficits in surface expression compared with the wild-type ΔNT receptor (Fig. 2, C and D). It should be noted that the major band observed in Western blots for both full-length and ΔNT G1 exhibits a molecular mass of ∼40–45 kDa. The full-length receptor is efficiently cleaved in HEK-293T cells, and under the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE utilized here, the non-covalent associations between the NTF and CTF regions are lost. Thus, Western blotting of the full-length and ΔNT receptors results in detection of the same major band as the C-terminal antibody detects the same CTF species for both versions of the receptor.Figure 2R565W and L640R mutations have differential effects on the surface expression of full-length versus ΔNT ADGRG1.

IB, immunoblotting; CT, C terminus; NS, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A key difference between the full-length and ΔNT receptors is that G1-ΔNT has a fully exposed extracellular stalk, whereas the stalk of the full-length receptor is mostly hidden due to either a lack of GAIN cleavage or masking by the associated NTF. The exposed stalk of G1 has agonistic properties (10Stoveken H.M. Hajduczok A.G. Xu L. Tall G.G. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors are activated by exposure of a cryptic tethered agonist.Proc.

Conn P.M. Chaperoning G protein-coupled receptors: from cell biology to therapeutics.Endocr. Rev. 2014; 35: 602-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis of the stalk as a pharmacological chaperone, we generated a stalkless version of the L640R G1 mutant (SL-L640R (Δ amino acids 1–403); Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, however, SL-L640R retained normal surface expression and trafficked to the plasma membrane at levels comparable with wild-type ΔNT, L640R-ΔNT and the wild-type stalkless receptor. These data suggest that the extracellular stalk (stachel) of G1 does not act as a pharmacological chaperone as its presence made no difference for trafficking of the L640R mutant. We next assessed the signaling activity of the mutant receptors in HEK-293T cells in two distinct gene reporter assays: SRF luciferase and NFAT luciferase. In the SRF luciferase assay (Fig. 4A), none of the mutant receptors elicited significant levels of activity. In contrast, expression of the ΔNT mutant receptors resulted in substantial activation of NFAT luciferase that was comparable with the activity induced by wild-type G1-ΔNT (Fig. 4B). Another measure of GPCR activity is association with β-arrestins (38Reiter E. Lefkowitz R.J. GRKs and β-arrestins: roles in receptor silencing, trafficking and signaling.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 159-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). We previously showed that G1-ΔNT associates robustly with β-arrestin2, whereas the full-length receptor does not (4Paavola K.J. Stephenson J.R. Ritter S.L. Alter S.P. Hall R.A.

Chem. 2016; 291: 3385-3394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore we assessed whether ΔNT-L640R could also associate with β-arrestin2 even though it is deficient in signaling to SRF luciferase. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that ΔNT and ΔNT-L640R associate with β-arrestin2 to a similar extent, thereby providing further evidence that the mutant receptor is capable of achieving an active conformation. Given that the R565W and L640R mutations disrupted signaling to SRF luciferase but preserved signaling to NFAT luciferase and interaction with β-arrestins, we explored whether β-arrestins might be involved in mediating G1 signaling to NFAT luciferase. Overexpression of β-arrestins typically arrests G protein-dependent signaling by GPCRs but enhances β-arrestin-dependent signaling activity (39Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. β-Arrestin scaffolding of the ERK cascade enhances cytosolic ERK activity but inhibits ERK-mediated transcription following angiotensin AT1a receptor stimulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and thus we studied G1 signaling in the absence and presence of β-arrestin overexpression. As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of β-arrestin2 significantly impaired signaling to SRF luciferase by full-length G1 and G1-ΔNT but had no significant effect on the ability of either version of G1 to activate NFAT luciferase (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that β-arrestins can arrest G1 signaling to SRF luciferase but are not significantly involved in G1 signaling to NFAT luciferase. To further explore the potential role of β-arrestins in G1 signaling, we sought to remove key phosphorylation sites from the C terminus of G1 as phosphorylation of GPCR C termini is typically required for β-arrestin association (40Tian X. Kang D.S. Benovic J.L. β-Arrestins and G protein-coupled receptor trafficking.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 219: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As a starting point for these studies, we focused on Ser-690, which is predicted by phosphorylation motif prediction algorithms to be a GPCR kinase phosphorylation site (41Xue Y. Ren J. Gao X. Jin C. Wen L. Yao X. GPS 2.0, a tool to predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites in hierarchy.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1598-1608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and has been identified in phosphoproteomic studies to be a highly phosphorylated reside on the G1 C terminus (42Goswami T. Li X. Smith A.M. Luderowski E.M. Vincent J.J. Rush J. Ballif B.A. Comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of neonatal and adult murine brain.Proteomics. 2012; 12: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We mutated this serine to an alanine (S690A) in both FL and ΔNT versions of G1, but subsequent co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that ΔNT-S690A associated with β-arrestin2 to the same extent as wild-type ΔNT (Fig. 6, A and B). These data suggest that this residue is not essential for β-arrestin recruitment. Nonetheless, in the course of performing these experiments, we noted that this mutation markedly enhanced surface expression of the ΔNT mutant (Fig. 6, C and D) and enhanced G1-ΔNT signaling to both SRF and NFAT luciferase (Fig. 6, E and F). Thus, these findings demonstrate that G1-mediated signaling to both SRF and NFAT luciferase is not saturated under our assay conditions, which as discussed below has important implications for interpreting the differential changes in signaling induced by the R565W and L640R mutations in the different pathways downstream of G1. To shed further light on G1 signaling to NFAT luciferase and how this pathway may be mechanistically distinct from G1 signaling to SRF luciferase, we performed a set of inhibitor studies. First, we assessed whether G1 might be capable of activating the Gαq/11 pathway in addition to coupling to Gα12/13. However, as shown in Fig. 7A, we observed that U71322, an inhibitor of phospholipase Cβ and therefore a blocker of the Gαq/11 signaling cascade, had no effect on G1 activation of NFAT luciferase. Another mechanism by which GPCRs can increase cellular calcium levels to activate NFAT luciferase is via activation of plasma membrane calcium channels. Thus, we assess"

Despite the common belief that the restoration of functions that are affected by CES can take several years postoperatively, follow up seldom exceeds the first year after surgery. Long term outcome of especially micturition, defecation and sexual function-which are by definition affected in CES-are unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate 1) postoperative long term outcome of micturition, defecation and sexual function in CES patients 2) attitude of patients towards received hospital care with regard to (recovery of) these functions.CES patients were selected by screening the records of all patients operated on lumbar herniated disc in our university hospital between 1995-2010. A questionnaire was sent to the selected CES patients evaluating current complaints of micturition, defecation and sexual function and attitude towards delivered care with focus on micturition, defecation and sexual function.Thirty-seven of 66 eligible CES patients were included (response rate 71%, inclusion rate 56%). Median time after surgery was 13.8 years (range 5.8-21.8 years). Dysfunction at follow up was highly prevalent: 38% micturition dysfunction, 43% defecation dysfunction and 54% sexual dysfunction. Younger age at presentation was associated with sexual dysfunction at follow up: for every year younger at presentation, odds ratio for sexual dysfunction at follow up was 1.11 (p = 0.035). Other associations with outcome were not identified. Two-third of the CES patients wished their neurosurgeon had given them more prognostic information about micturition, defecation and sexual function.The presented data demonstrate that dysfunction of micturition, defecation and sexual function are still highly prevalent in a large number of CES patients even years postoperatively. These alarming follow up data probably have a devastating effect on personal perceived quality of life, which should be studied in more detail. CES patients communicate a clear demand for more prognostic information. The presented figures enable clinicians to inform their CES patients more realistically about long term postoperative outcome of micturition, defecation and sexual function after surgical intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2606374560,"Background The muscle-tendon properties of the semitendinosus (ST) and gracilis (GR) are substantially altered following tendon harvest for the purpose of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). This study adopted a musculoskeletal modelling approach to determine how the changes to the ST and GR muscle-tendon properties alter their contribution to medial compartment contact loading within the tibiofemoral joint in post ACLR patients, and the extent to which other muscles compensate under the same external loading conditions during walking, running and sidestep cutting. Materials and methods Motion capture and electromyography (EMG) data from 16 lower extremity muscles were acquired during walking, running and cutting in 25 participants that had undergone an ACLR using a quadruple (ST+GR) hamstring auto-graft. An EMG-driven musculoskeletal model was used to estimate the medial compartment contact loads during the stance phase of each gait task. An adjusted model was then created by altering muscle-tendon properties for the ST and GR to reflect their reported changes following ACLR. Parameters for the other muscles in the model were calibrated to match the experimental joint moments. Results The medial compartment contact loads for the standard and adjusted models were similar. The combined contributions of ST and GR to medial compartment contact load in the adjusted model were reduced by 26%, 17% and 17% during walking, running and cutting, respectively. These deficits were balanced by increases in the contribution made by the semimembranosus muscle of 33% and 22% during running and cutting, respectively. Conclusion Alterations to the ST and GR muscle-tendon properties in ACLR patients resulted in reduced contribution to medial compartment contact loads during gait tasks, for which the semimembranosus muscle can compensate."

https://openalex.org/W2606403514,"Background and aims Metabolic Syndrome (Mets) and increased serum uric acid (SUA), are well known renal risk predictors and often coexist in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Whether they independently contribute to the onset of CKD is at present unclear. Methods and results Within the AMD Annals database we identified patients with T2D and normal renal function and urine albumin excretion at baseline and regular follow-up visits during a 4-year period. Blood pressure, BMI, HDL, triglycerides, and SUA were available in 14,267 patients. The association between Mets and/or hyperuricemia (HU, top fifth gender specific quintile) and the occurrence of renal outcomes were evaluated. Results At baseline 59% of patients (n = 8,408) showed Mets and 18% (n = 2,584) HU. Over the 4-year follow-up, 14% (n = 1,990) developed low eGFR (i.e. below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 26% (n = 3,740) albuminuria. After adjustment for confounders, BP≥130/85, low HDL, triglycerides ≥150 and HU were independently related to the development of low eGFR (1.57, P<0.001; 1.13, P = 0.056; 1.18, P = 0.008; 1.26, P = 0.001) and of albuminuria (1.35, P<0.001; 1.18, P = 0.001; 1.15, P = 0.002; 1.24, P = 0.001), respectively. The incidence of low eGFR was higher in patients with HU independent of the presence or absence of Mets (21%, OR 1.30, p = 0.009 and 20%, 1.57, p<0.000 respectively), while albuminuria occurred more frequently in those with Mets and HU (32%, OR 1.25, p = 0.005) as compared to the reference group. Conclusions HU and Mets are independent predictors of CKD and its individual components in patients with T2D."

The aim of this study was to examine the association of sleep duration and quality with CKD and glomerular hyperfiltration in young and middle-aged adults.We conducted a cross-sectional study of men and women who underwent a health checkup examination, including assessment of sleep duration and quality (n = 241,607). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and glomerular hyperfiltration was defined as eGFR above the age-/sex-specific 95th percentile.In a multinomial logistic regression analysis adjusting for relevant confounders, the adjusted prevalence ratios for CKD (95% confidence interval) comparing sleep durations of ≤ 5, 6, 8, and 9 hours with 7 hours were 1.22 (0.95-1.55), 0.93 (0.75-1.14), 0.97 (0.75-1.26), and 1.56 (1.06-2.30) in men and 0.98 (0.68-1.43), 1.03 (0.72-1.46), 1.39 (0.97-2.00), and 1.31 (0.78-2.22) in women, respectively. The corresponding prevalence ratios (95% confidence interval) for glomerular hyperfiltration were 1.00 (0.93-1.08), 0.97 (0.91-1.03), 1.03 (0.94-1.13), and 1.39 (1.13-1.72) in men and 1.04 (0.95-1.14), 0.96 (0.90-1.04), 1.11 (1.02-1.20), and 1.28 (1.14-1.45) in women, respectively. Poor subjective sleep quality was associated with glomerular hyperfiltration in men and women.In this large study of young and middle-aged adults, we found that long sleep duration was associated with CKD and glomerular hyperfiltration. Additionally, poor subjective sleep quality was associated with increased prevalence of glomerular hyperfiltration, suggesting the importance of adequate quantity and quality of sleep for kidney function."

In mice, the TGF-β superfamily is implicated in the regulation of white and brown adipose tissue differentiation. The kielin/chordin-like protein (KCP) is a secreted regulator of the TGF-β superfamily pathways that can inhibit both TGF-β and activin signals while enhancing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. However, KCP's effects on metabolism and obesity have not been studied in animal models. Therefore, we examined the effects of KCP loss or gain of function in mice that were maintained on either a regular or a high-fat diet. KCP loss sensitized the mice to obesity and associated complications such as glucose intolerance and adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis. In contrast, transgenic mice that expressed KCP in the kidney, liver, and adipose tissues were resistant to developing high-fat diet-induced obesity and had significantly reduced white adipose tissue. Moreover, KCP overexpression shifted the pattern of SMAD signaling in vivo, increasing the levels of phospho (P)-SMAD1 and decreasing P-SMAD3. Adipocytes in culture showed a cell-autonomous effect in response to added TGF-β1 or BMP7. Metabolic profiling indicated increased energy expenditure in KCP-overexpressing mice and reduced expenditure in the KCP mutants with no effect on food intake or activity. These findings demonstrate that shifting the TGF-β superfamily signaling with a secreted protein can alter the physiology and thermogenic properties of adipose tissue to reduce obesity even when mice are fed a high-fat diet.

Metabolic disease is reaching epidemic proportions in the developed world, primarily due to the increased availability of high caloric foods and the decrease in daily physical activity (2Doria A.

WAT functions not only as a nutrient storage center but also as an endocrine organ by secreting proteins such as leptin and adiponectin that provide signals to regulate appetite and nutrient metabolism. In contrast to nutrient storage, brown adipose tissue (BAT) functions as a thermogenic organ by converting triglycerides into heat to maintain body temperature in homotherms (4Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Brown adipose tissue: function and physiological significance.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4518) Google Scholar).

In adipose tissue, increased numbers of macrophages are associated with the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and increased extracellular matrix deposition (14Keophiphath M. Achard V. Henegar C.

Metab. 2010; 299: E1016-E1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). A more recent study suggests that inflammation in adipose tissue does have an adaptive advantage for tissue remodeling in the absence of which more ectopic lipid accumulation is seen in other tissues (16Wernstedt Asterholm I. Tao C. Morley T.S. Wang Q.A. Delgado-Lopez F. Wang Z.V. Scherer P.E. Adipocyte inflammation is essential for healthy adipose tissue expansion and remodeling.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 103-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Obesity and insulin resistance are also closely linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which covers a broad spectrum of liver pathology that includes inflammation, fibrosis, hepatic steatosis, and cirrhosis and may ultimately progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (17Asrih M. Jornayvaz F.R. Metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: is insulin resistance the link?.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2015; 418: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). TGF-β is a proinflammatory cytokine whose role in kidney, liver, lung, and cardiac fibrosis is well documented. More recently, the importance of TGF-β superfamily signaling in determining the types of adipose tissue and the effects of a high-fat diet (HFD) on obesity and associated complications have been studied in several different experimental model systems (18Yadav H. Rane S.G. TGF-β/Smad3 signaling regulates brown adipocyte induction in white adipose tissue.Front. Endocrinol. 2012; 3: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Zamani N. Brown C.W. Emerging roles for the transforming growth factor-β superfamily in regulating adiposity and energy expenditure.Endocr. Rev. 2011; 32: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A deletion of SMAD3 in mice prevented HFD-induced obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance with phenotypic changes in WAT tissue that resembled BAT (20Yadav H. Quijano C. Kamaraju A.K.

The BMP proteins are also implicated in the transition of WAT to a more brown or beige phenotype. Elevated expression of BMP4 in adipose tissue of transgenic mice reduced the mass of gonadal WAT and promoted a beige phenotype (21Qian S.W. Tang Y. Li X. Liu Y. Zhang Y.Y. Huang H.Y. Xue R.D.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: E798-E807Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Strikingly, a deletion of the BMP type 1A receptor in brown fat depletes these tissues in mice but results in a compensatory change in white fat to mimic a brownlike, or beige, fat phenotype (22Schulz T.J. Huang P. Huang T.L. Xue R. McDougall L.E. Townsend K.L. Cypess A.M. Mishina Y. Gussoni E. Tseng Y.H. Brown-fat paucity due to impaired BMP signalling induces compensatory browning of white fat.Nature. 2013; 495: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Induction of BMP8 through a HFD can increase thermogenesis by enhanced signaling through the p38MAPK/cAMP-response element-binding protein pathway in BAT and regulation of neuropeptides in response to norepinephrine in the hypothalamus (23Whittle A.J. Carobbio S. Martins L. Slawik M. Hondares E. Vázquez M.J. Morgan D. Csikasz R.I. Gallego R. Rodriguez-Cuenca S. Dale M. Virtue S. Villarroya F. Cannon B.

The regulation of TGF-β superfamily signaling is complex and encompasses mechanisms that function both within and outside of the cell. The TGF-β family ligands are disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers that form heterotetramers with type I and type II transmembrane receptor kinases. Activated type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates the receptor-activated SMAD proteins, which transduce the signal to the nucleus. The accessibility of either TGF-β or BMPs to their corresponding receptors can be inhibited or enhanced by the actions of secreted proteins. Extracellular inhibitors of BMP signaling include vertebrate chordin, which binds directly to BMPs through the cysteine-rich (CR) domains containing CXXCXC and CCXXC motifs (24Larraín J. Bachiller D.

Although chordin blocks BMP/receptor interactions, the multi-CR domain protein KCP enhances BMP/receptor interactions to increase the efficacy of signaling (27Lin J. Patel S.R. Cheng X. Cho E.A. Levitan I. Ullenbruch M. Phan S.H. Park J.M. Dressler G.R. Kielin/chordin-like protein, a novel enhancer of BMP signaling, attenuates renal fibrotic disease.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, KCP is also able to inhibit TGF-β and activin signaling (28Lin J. Patel S.R. Wang M. Dressler G.R. The cysteine-rich domain protein KCP is a suppressor of transforming growth factor β/activin signaling in renal epithelia.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4577-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Conversely, the CR domain protein connective tissue growth factor enhances TGF-β-mediated signaling while suppressing the BMP-dependent pathway (29Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF) modulates cell signalling by BMP and TGF-β.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a mutant kcp allele show no gross developmental abnormalities, although kcp mutations can enhance the renal developmental phenotype in mutants of Cv2 (30Ikeya M. Kawada M. Kiyonari H. Sasai N. Nakao K. Furuta Y. Sasai Y. Essential pro-Bmp roles of crossveinless 2 in mouse organogenesis.Development. 2006; 133: 4463-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a gene that encodes a related multi-CR domain activator of BMPs. In animal models of renal disease, kcp−/− mice are sensitized to developing renal interstitial fibrosis (27Lin J. Patel S.R. Cheng X. Cho E.A. Levitan I. Ullenbruch M. Phan S.H. Park J.M.

Med. 2005; 11: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a process regulated by both BMPs and TGF-β. The kcp−/− mice exhibit lower BMP signaling and higher TGF-β signaling as measured by specific P-SMAD readouts after renal injury. Conversely, in mice that express a KCP transgene, a reciprocal shift in the balance of TGF-β and BMP signaling made animals more resistant to developing interstitial fibrosis in the kidney (31Soofi A. Zhang P. Dressler G.R. Kielin/chordin-like protein attenuates both acute and chronic renal injury.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2013; 24: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the livers of aged mice or in mice fed a high-fat diet to induce non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, loss of KCP promoted hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis, whereas expression of a KCP transgene was protective (32Soofi A. Wolf K.I. Ranghini E.J. Amin M.A. Dressler G.R. The kielin/chordin-like protein KCP attenuates nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2016; 311: G587-G598Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe how loss and gain of KCP function impact body mass, body composition, and the effects of diet-induced obesity on nutrient metabolism. Initial observations indicated that kcp−/− mice gained more weight over time, whereas KCP transgenic mice (kcpTg) remained lean. The KCP protein altered the amount and type of body fat to greatly impact metabolism. Thus, transgenic KCP expression protected mice from HFD-induced obesity, whereas the KCP-deficient mutant mice are more susceptible to metabolic dysfunction even on a normal diet (ND). By modulating KCP protein to alter the signaling balance between BMPs and TGF-β and associated P-SMADs, fat composition, thermoregulation, and metabolism were all impacted. These data suggest that altering TGF-β superfamily signaling by secreted regulatory proteins can attenuate the negative effects of obesity-induced metabolic syndrome. We had created a kcp−/− allele by conventional gene targeting (27Lin J. Patel S.R. Cheng X. Cho E.A. Levitan I. Ullenbruch M. Phan S.H. Park J.M. Dressler G.R. Kielin/chordin-like protein, a novel enhancer of BMP signaling, attenuates renal fibrotic disease.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and a kcpTg allele using the mouse PEPCK promoter driving the KCP cDNA coding region with an amino-terminal human Igκ secretory signal and a carboxyl-terminal myc epitope tag (31Soofi A. Zhang P. Dressler G.R. Kielin/chordin-like protein attenuates both acute and chronic renal injury.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2013; 24: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both kcp−/− and kcpTg mice were viable and fertile with no gross morphological defects. As reported previously, aged kcp−/− mice exhibit liver pathology that was accentuated when the mice were put on a high-fat diet to induce obesity (32Soofi A. Wolf K.I. Ranghini E.J. Amin M.A. Dressler G.R. The kielin/chordin-like protein KCP attenuates nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2016; 311: G587-G598Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To more precisely quantitate the changes in body mass, growth curves were determined for kcp−/−, kcp+/+, and kcpTg mice when fed a ND or HFD (Fig. 1, A and B). On normal diet, both kcp+/+ and kcp−/− mice were on average about 25% heavier than kcpTg. After 12 weeks on a high-fat diet, both kcp+/+ and kcp−/− were more than 80% heavier than the kcpTg mice. In fact, the kcpTg mice did not gain significantly more weight on the high-fat diet compared with the normal diet. We did not observe any gross skeletal abnormalities or evidence of dwarfism as body lengths were not significantly different between the genotypes. Body composition analyses indicated that the difference in body weights on both diets between WT or kcp−/− and the kcpTg mice was due in large part to less white adipose tissue in the kcpTg mice with no significant difference in fluid composition (Fig. 1, C and D). Obesity-induced metabolic disorder in mice can lead to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. To assess the effects of KCP loss and overexpression on glucose metabolism, we performed glucose tolerance testing (Fig. 1, E and F). kcp+/+, kcp−/−, and kcpTg mice maintained on normal diets had similar glucose tolerance. However on the high-fat diets, the kcp+/+ and kcp−/− mice had impaired glucose tolerance compared with their lean counterparts, whereas the kcpTg mice showed glucose uptake similar to the mice on a normal diet (180 ± 25 mg/dl after 15 min). In those mice, fasting insulin levels were significantly higher in the kcp−/− animals, consistent with the development of glucose intolerance (Fig. 1G). To evaluate the mechanism of impaired weight gain in the kcpTg mice, we first measured average body temperatures as an indicator of metabolic function and thermoregulation. The kcpTg mice had significantly higher average body temperatures, almost a full degree more, than kcp+/+ or kcp−/− mice regardless of the diet conditions (Fig. 1H). Subsequently, mice of all three genotypes were fed either normal or high-fat diets for 8 weeks and then adapted to single metabolic cages for 4 weeks. Multiple metabolic parameters were then measured over a 3-day time period (Fig. 2A). Among the mice fed a normal diet, the only significant difference among the genotypes was that the kcpTg mice oxidized more glucose compared with kcp+/+ and kcp−/−. However, the mice kept on a HFD exhibited multiple differences among the three genotypes. The kcpTg mice had higher total energy expenditure compared with kcp+/+, whereas the kcp−/− mice expended less energy than kcp+/+. The differences are best illustrated in average oxygen consumption, as adjusted for lean body mass, over the light and dark cycles of a 3-day test period (Fig. 2B). The kcpTg mice used ∼14% more oxygen compared with kcp+/+, whereas the kcp−/− mice used 25% less oxygen over the 3-day period. Similar statistically significant data can be seen when energy expenditure is averaged over time for the three genotypes (Fig. 2C). The increased energy expenditure in kcpTg mice was not reflected by any more activity or any more food consumption as there were no significant differences among the three genotypes. The kcpTg mice were able to oxidize more glucose and fat compared with kcp+/+, whereas kcp−/− mice oxidized less glucose but similar amounts of fat compared with kcp+/+. The increased energy and oxygen consumption, despite no change in food intake or activity, are consistent with the significantly increased body temperature in kcpTg mice and suggest altered thermoregulation. To determine whether this was due to a neuroendocrine effect or responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE), we challenged the mice with a single dose of NE and measured the metabolic rates (Fig. 2D). Mice were kept at a thermoneutral temperature of 30 °C and anesthetized for baseline readings. Subsequently, a single injection of NE significantly increased respiration and energy expenditure in all three genotypes with no significant differences. The three genotypes were also subjected to a series of temperature challenges by first housing mice at 22 °C for 1 day, 30 °C for another day, and then 4 °C for 2 days (Fig. 2E). All three genotypes exhibited a decrease in energy expenditure and oxygen consumption at 30 °C followed by a nearly 3-fold increase in energy expenditure at 4 °C. As previous results indicated, average body temperatures at 22 °C were significantly higher in kcpTg mice, but this effect was reduced at 30 °C (Fig. 2F). Strikingly, at 4 °C, average subcutaneous body temperatures appeared lower in the kcpTg mice, which may reflect the reduced amount of insulating subcutaneous body fat in these animals. To determine the mechanisms underlying the reduced amount of white adipose tissue in kcpTg mice, we characterized both white and brown adipose tissues in mice kept on a HFD. Although kcpTg mice had less visceral fat, we were able to isolate enough epididymal WAT (eWAT) for histology and protein expression analyses. By Western blot analyses, kcpTg eWAT had significantly lower levels of P-SMAD3 but higher levels of P-SMAD1 compared with either kcp+/+ or kcp−/− eWAT (Fig. 3, A and B). These data are entirely consistent with prior results showing inhibition of TGF-β signaling and enhancement of BMP signaling by KCP protein. Furthermore, the kcpTg eWAT had higher levels of UCP1, which increases heat production and is usually associated with brown fat (Fig. 3, A and C). The kcpTg eWAT tissues also had higher levels of PPARγ, PGC1, P-AKT, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, all proteins associated with a more beige fat phenotype (Fig. 3, A and C). Also of note were the increased levels of P-ERK in the kcp−/− eWAT; P-ERK is known to phosphorylate PPARγ and increase expression of diabetes-associated genes (33Banks A.S. McAllister F.E. Camporez J.P. Zushin P.J. Jurczak M.J. Laznik-Bogoslavski D. Shulman G.I. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. An ERK/Cdk5 axis controls the diabetogenic actions of PPARγ.Nature. 2015; 517: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We also used quantitative RT-PCR to assess gene expression for adiponectin, kcp, and pgc1 (Fig. 3D), all of which were higher in the kcpTg mice and lower in the kcp−/− mice compared with the kcp+/+ animals. In mice fed a HFD, the eWAT tissue also exhibited differences in histology and in markers for inflammation among the three genotypes (Fig. 4). Trichrome staining showed extracellular collagen deposition in kcp−/− eWAT with many large adipocytes and evidence of enhanced inflammation. The average cross-sectional area of eWAT cells was approximately half in kcpTg adipocytes, whereas the kcp−/− adipocytes were even larger than kcp+/+ cells (Fig. 4, A–C and J). Whole-mount immunofluorescence examined macrophage infiltration and crownlike structures in eWAT as a measure of the inflammatory response that correlates with high-fat diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance (Fig. 4, D–F and K). The kcpTg mice had few if any crownlike structures and MAC2-positive macrophages in eWAT. However, the obese kcp+/+ and especially the kcp−/− animals had large numbers of macrophages present in eWAT. We also looked for evidence of fibrosis by Picrosirius Red staining for collagen deposition. The kcp−/− animals showed increased collagen matrix deposition in eWAT compared with kcp+/+ mice, whereas the kcpTg mice had significantly less collagen deposition when fed a high-fat diet (Fig. 4, G–I and L). Given the increased body temperature and metabolism in kcpTg mice, we also examined interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) for protein expression and histology. Protein expression levels in iBAT of mice fed a ND showed that kcpTg mice had elevated levels of P-SMAD1 and PPARγ but no significant differences in UCP1 (Fig. 5, A–C). The kcp−/− mice showed slightly more P-SMAD3 and less PPARγ but no significant differences in P-SMAD1 or UCP1 compared with kcp+/+ animals (Fig. 5, A–C). The kcpTg mice also demonstrated myc-KCP expression in iBAT, indicating that the PEPCK promoter used for the transgene is actively expressed in this tissue. When mice were kept on a HFD, differences in protein expression levels in iBAT from kcpTg and kcp−/− mice were more pronounced (Fig. 5, D–F). kcp−/− mice had less P-SMAD1 and higher levels of P-SMAD3 compared with kcpTg mice (Fig. 5F). In addition, levels of P-ERK were higher in kcp−/− mice. Levels of UCP1 were significantly higher in kcpTg mice as were PGC1 and PPARγ (Fig. 5E) compared with kcp−/− mice. Histology of iBAT indicated that the kcp−/− mice fed a normal diet exhibited increased lipid storage in iBAT, compared with WT, that became even more pronounced on the HFD (Fig. 6). Histology of BAT generally shows densely staining cytoplasm because of the density of mitochondria that fuel thermoregulation. Consistent with our metabolic data, kcpTg mice had very densely staining iBAT compared with WT on both normal diet and HFD (Fig. 6) with only minimal lipid accumulation. Finally, to test whether the differences in brown and white adipocytes were cell-autonomous and could reflect the response to TGF-β superfamily ligands, we cultured differentiated adipocytes isolated from inguinal WAT and interscapular BAT tissues of all three genotypes kept on a ND (Fig. 7). Differentiated adipocytes isolated from inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) showed that the kcpTg cells had a stronger response to BMP4 with higher levels of P-SMAD1 (Fig. 7A). Cells isolated from kcp−/− mice showed a higher basal level of P-SMAD3 and a stronger response to TGF-β despite having less total SMAD3. Also of note, the kcpTg cells expressed more UCP1, suggesting a more beige phenotype. The differentiated adipocytes isolated from iBAT showed a weaker BMP4 response in kcp−/− cells but no difference in the kcpTg cells. P-SMAD3 was not significantly affected in iBAT cells. However, kcp−/− cells had significantly lower UCP1 and PGC1 levels. The protein lysates were collected 2 h after addition of ligands, which did not affect expression of the non-phosphorylated proteins. Thus, the adipocytes that express myc-KCP have altered cell-autonomous responses to TGF superfamily ligands, consistent with the known role for KCP in modifying the receptor/ligand interactions. That these effects were observed on a ND indicates that they are not due to obesity or associated metabolic syndrome. The cultured cells are also removed from any infiltrating immune cells and associated cytokines, suggesting a direct effect of KCP on TGF-β superfamily signaling in adipocytes. We have utilized both gain and loss of KCP function in genetically engineered mice to demonstrate that KCP can regulate the T"
https://openalex.org/W2606340423,"A guide dog is a domestic dog (Canis familiaris) that is specifically educated to provide mobility support to a blind or visually impaired owner. Current dog suitability assessments focus on behavioural traits, including: trainability, reactivity or attention to environmental stimuli, low aggressiveness, fearfulness and stress behaviour, energy levels, and attachment behaviour. The aim of this study was to find out which aspects of guide dog behaviour are of key importance to guide dog owners themselves. Sixty-three semi-structured interview surveys were carried out with guide dog owners. Topics included the behaviour of their guide dog both within and outside their working role, and also focused on examples of behaviour which might be considered outside a guide dog owner's typical expectations. Both positive and negative examples and situations were covered. This allowed for the discovery of new perspectives and emerging themes on living and working with a guide dog. Thematic analysis of the results reveals that a dog's safe behaviour in the face of traffic was the most important positive aspect of a guide dog's behaviour and pulling or high tension on the lead and /or harness was the most discussed negative aspect. Other aspects of guide dog behaviour were highlighted as particularly pleasing or disappointing by owners including attentiveness to the task, work, environment and owner; confidence in work and decision making (with confident dogs resulting in confident owners) obedience and control; calmness and locating objectives. The results reveal important areas of behaviour that are not currently considered priorities in guide dog assessments; these key areas were consistency of behaviour, the dog's maturity and the dog's behaviour in relation to children. The survey revealed a large range in what owners considered problematic or pleasing behaviours and this highlights the heterogeneity in guide dog owners and the potential multifarious roles of the guide dog. This study contributes to the literature on which behaviour is considered appropriate or inappropriate in dogs and on the nature of human-animal interactions."

If attentional bias is indeed of importance, changing this bias should then in turn have effects on insomnia complaints. In this double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial we investigated the efficacy of attentional bias modification training in the treatment of insomnia.We administered baseline, post-test, and one-week follow-up measurements of insomnia severity, sleep-related worry, depression, and anxiety. Participants meeting DSM-5 criteria for insomnia were randomized into an attentional bias training group (n = 67) or a placebo training group (n = 70). Both groups received eight training sessions over the course of two weeks. All participants kept a sleep diary for four consecutive weeks (one week before until one week after the training sessions).There was no additional benefit for the attentional bias training over the placebo training on sleep-related indices/outcome measures.The absence of the effect may be explained by the fact that there was neither attentional bias at baseline nor any reduction in the bias after the training. Either way, this study gives no support for attentional bias modification training as a stand-alone intervention for ameliorating insomnia complaints."
https://openalex.org/W2606673626,"Background The chemokine receptor CXCR4 plays a crucial role in tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive glioma. Phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), a catabolic enzyme of PC metabolism, is involved in several aspects of cancer biology and its inhibition down-modulates the expression of growth factor membrane receptors interfering with their signaling pathways. In the present work we investigated the possible interplay between CXCR4 and PC-PLC in GBM cells. Methods Confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation, western blot analyses, and the evaluation of migration and invasion potential were performed on U87MG cells after PC-PLC inhibition with the xanthate D609. The intracellular metabolome was investigated by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; lactate levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were analyzed by colorimetric assay. Results Our studies demonstrated that CXCR4 and PC-PLC co-localize and are associated on U87MG cell membrane. D609 reduced CXCR4 expression, cell proliferation and invasion, interfering with AKT and EGFR activation and expression. Metabolic analyses showed a decrease in intracellular lactate concentration together with a decrement in LDH activity. Conclusions Our data suggest that inhibition of PC-PLC could represent a new molecular approach in glioma biology not only for its ability in modulating cell metabolism, glioma growth and motility, but also for its inhibitory effect on crucial molecules involved in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2606437437,"Environmental stressors impact marine larval growth rates, quality and sizes. Larvae of the Antarctic bivalve, Laternula elliptica, were raised to the D-larvae stage under temperature and pH conditions representing ambient and end of century projections (-1.6°C to +0.4°C and pH 7.98 to 7.65). Previous observations using light microscopy suggested pH had no influence on larval abnormalities in this species. Detailed analysis of the shell using SEM showed that reduced pH is in fact a major stressor during development for this species, producing D-larvae with abnormal shapes, deformed shell edges and irregular hinges, cracked shell surfaces and even uncalcified larvae. Additionally, reduced pH increased pitting and cracking on shell surfaces. Thus, apparently normal larvae may be compromised at the ultrastructural level and these larvae would be in poor condition at settlement, reducing juvenile recruitment and overall survival. Elevated temperatures increased prodissoconch II sizes. However, the overall impacts on larval shell quality and integrity with concurrent ocean acidification would likely overshadow any beneficial results from warmer temperatures, limiting populations of this prevalent Antarctic species."

However, effective and environmentally friendly chemical methods for controlling this pest have not been discovered to date. In the present study, we performed HiSeq2500 sequencing of transcriptomes of the male and female adult antennae, adult legs and third instar larvae, and we identified 54 candidate odorant receptors (ORs), including 1 odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco) and 5 pheromone receptors (PRs), 18 ionotropic receptors (IRs), 13 gustatory receptors (GRs), 34 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), including 1 general odorant binding protein (GOBP1) and 3 pheromone binding proteins (PBPs), 10 chemosensory proteins (CSPs) and 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). The results of RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses showed the expression levels of most genes in the antennae were higher than that in the legs and larvae. Furthermore, PR4, OR1-4, 7-11, 13-15, 23, 29-32, 34, 41, 43, 47/IR7d.2/GR5b, 45, 7/PBP2-3, GOBP1, OBP3, 8 showed female antennae-biased expression, while PR1/OBP2, 7/IR75d/CSP2 showed male antennae-biased expression. However, IR1, 7d.3, 68a/OBP11, 20-22, 28/CSP9 had larvae enriched expression, and OBP15, 17, 25, 29/CSP5 were mainly expressed in the legs. The results shown above indicated that these genes might play a key role in foraging, seeking mates and host recognition in the L. sticticalis. Our findings will provide the basic knowledge for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of the olfactory system of L. sticticalis and potential novel targets for pest control strategies."

Although the cause of sporadic inclusion body myositis is unknown, GNE myopathy is associated with mutations in GNE. GNE harbors two enzymatic activities required for biosynthesis of sialic acid in mammalian cells. Mutations to both GNE domains are linked to GNE myopathy. However, correlation between mutation-associated reductions in sialic acid production and disease severity is imperfect. To investigate other potential effects of GNE mutations, we compared sialic acid production in cell lines expressing wild type or mutant forms of GNE. Although we did not detect any differences attributable to disease-associated mutations, lectin binding and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that GNE deficiency is associated with unanticipated effects on the structure of cell-surface glycans. In addition to exhibiting low levels of sialylation, GNE-deficient cells produced distinct N-linked glycan structures with increased branching and extended poly-N-acetyllactosamine. GNE deficiency may affect levels of UDP-GlcNAc, a key metabolite in the nutrient-sensing hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, but this modest effect did not fully account for the change in N-linked glycan structure. Furthermore, GNE deficiency and glucose supplementation acted independently and additively to increase N-linked glycan branching. Notably, N-linked glycans produced by GNE-deficient cells displayed enhanced binding to galectin-1, indicating that changes in GNE activity can alter affinity of cell-surface glycoproteins for the galectin lattice. These findings suggest an unanticipated mechanism by which GNE activity might affect signaling through cell-surface receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2605789832,"Synthesizing polycationic polymers directly from existing drugs overcomes the drug-loading limitations often associated with pharmacologically inert nanocarriers. We recently described nanocarriers formed from a first-generation polyamine analogue, bis(ethyl)norspermine (BENSpm), that could simultaneously target polyamine metabolism while delivering therapeutic nucleic acids. In the current study, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of self-immolative nanocarriers derived from the second-generation polyamine analogue PG-11047. Polyamines are absolutely essential for proliferation and their metabolism is frequently dysregulated in cancer. Through its effects on polyamine metabolism, PG-11047 effectively inhibits tumor growth in cancer cell lines of multiple origins as well as in human tumor mouse xenografts. Promising clinical trials have been completed verifying the safety and tolerance of this rotationally restricted polyamine analogue. We therefore used PG-11047 as the basis for Nano11047, a biodegradable, prodrug nanocarrier capable of targeting polyamine metabolism. Following exposure of lung cancer cell lines to Nano11047, uptake and intracellular degradation into the parent compound PG-11047 was observed. The release of PG-11047 highly induced the polyamine catabolic enzyme activities of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) and spermine oxidase (SMOX). By contrast, the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis and a putative oncogene, was decreased. Consequently, intracellular levels of the natural polyamines were depleted concurrent with tumor cell growth inhibition. This availability of Nano11047 as a novel drug form and potential nucleic acid delivery vector will potentially benefit and encourage future clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2606370414,"There is growing evidence in the literature suggesting that caste differentiation in the stingless bee, Melipona scutellaris, and other bees in the genus Melipona, is triggered by environmental signals, particularly a primer pheromone. With the proper amount of food and a chemical stimulus, 25% of females emerge as queens, in agreement with a long-standing ""two loci/two alleles model"" proposed in the 1950s. We surmised that these larvae must be equipped with an olfactory system for reception of these chemical signals. Here we describe for the first time the diversity of antennal sensilla in adults and the morphology of larvae of M. scutellaris. Having found evidence for putative olfactory sensilla in larvae, we next asked whether olfactory proteins were expressed in larvae. Since the molecular basis of M. scutellaris is still unknown, we cloned olfactory genes encoding chemosensory proteins (CSP) and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) using M. scutellaris cDNA template and primers designed on the basis CSPs and OBPs previously reported from the European honeybee, Apis mellifera. We cloned two CSP and two OBP genes and then attempted to express the proteins encoded by these genes. With a recombinant OBP, MscuOBP8, and a combinatorial single-chain variable fragment antibody library, we generated anti-MscuOBP8 monoclonal antibody. By immunohistochemistry we demonstrated that the anti-MscuOBP8 binds specifically to the MscuOBP8. Next, we found evidence that MscuOBP8 is expressed in M. scutellaris larvae and it is located in the mandibular region, thus further supporting the hypothesis of olfactory function in immature stages. Lastly, molecular modeling suggests that MscuOBP8 may function as a carrier of primer pheromones or other ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2605647834,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia disorder, is caused by a non-coding ATTCT microsatellite repeat expansion in the ataxin 10 gene. In a subset of SCA10 families, the 5'-end of the repeat expansion contains a complex sequence of penta- and heptanucleotide interruption motifs which is followed by a pure tract of tandem ATCCT repeats of unknown length at its 3'-end. Intriguingly, expansions that carry these interruption motifs correlate with an epileptic seizure phenotype and are unstable despite the theory that interruptions are expected to stabilize expanded repeats. To examine the apparent contradiction of unstable, interruption-positive SCA10 expansion alleles and to determine whether the instability originates outside of the interrupted region, we sequenced approximately 1 kb of the 5'-end of SCA10 expansions using the ATCCT-PCR product in individuals across multiple generations from four SCA10 families. We found that the greatest instability within this region occurred in paternal transmissions of the allele in stretches of pure ATTCT motifs while the intervening interrupted sequences were stable. Overall, the ATCCT interruption changes by only one to three repeat units and therefore cannot account for the instability across the length of the disease allele. We conclude that the AT-rich interruptions locally stabilize the SCA10 expansion at the 5'-end but do not completely abolish instability across the entire span of the expansion. In addition, analysis of the interruption alleles across these families support a parsimonious single origin of the mutation with a shared distant ancestor."

The purpose of this study was to develop statistical models that accurately describe holistic body shape, thickness, and leanness. We hypothesized that there are unique body shape features that are predictive of mortality beyond standard clinical measures. We developed algorithms to process whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans into body thickness and leanness images. We performed statistical appearance modeling (SAM) and principal component analysis (PCA) to efficiently encode the variance of body shape, leanness, and thickness across sample of 400 older Americans from the Health ABC study. The sample included 200 cases and 200 controls based on 6-year mortality status, matched on sex, race and BMI. The final model contained 52 points outlining the torso, upper arms, thighs, and bony landmarks. Correlation analyses were performed on the PCA parameters to identify body shape features that vary across groups and with metabolic risk. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to identify sex and race, and predict mortality risk as a function of body shape parameters. These parameters are novel body composition features that uniquely identify body phenotypes of different groups and predict mortality risk. Three parameters from a SAM of body leanness and thickness accurately identified sex (training AUC = 0.99) and six accurately identified race (training AUC = 0.91) in the sample dataset. Three parameters from a SAM of only body thickness predicted mortality (training AUC = 0.66, validation AUC = 0.62). Further study is warranted to identify specific shape/composition features that predict other health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2605907096,"Migratory waterfowl are often viewed as vehicles for the global spread of influenza A viruses (IAVs), with mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) implicated as particularly important reservoir hosts. The physical demands and energetic costs of migration have been shown to influence birds’ body condition; poorer body condition may suppress immune function and affect the course of IAV infection. Our study evaluated the impact of body condition on immune function and viral shedding dynamics in mallards naturally exposed to an H9 IAV, and then secondarily exposed to an H4N6 IAV. Mallards were divided into three treatment groups of 10 birds per group, with each bird’s body condition manipulated as a function of body weight by restricting food availability to achieve either a -10%, -20%, or control body weight class. We found that mallards exhibit moderate heterosubtypic immunity against an H4N6 IAV infection after an infection from an H9 IAV, and that body condition did not have an impact on shedding dynamics in response to a secondary exposure. Furthermore, body condition did not affect aspects of the innate and adaptive immune system, including the acute phase protein haptoglobin, heterophil/lymphocyte ratios, and antibody production. Contrary to recently proposed hypotheses and some experimental evidence, our data do not support relationships between body condition, infection and immunocompetence following a second exposure to IAV in mallards. Consequently, while annual migration may be a driver in the maintenance and spread of IAVs, the energetic demands of migration may not affect susceptibility in mallards."

The optimum pH values were 8.5 (NAD+) and 6.0 (NADP+).The Km values for NAD+ and NADP+ were 113 μM and 184 μM respectively, while the Km values for DL-isocitrate were 9.0 μM (NAD+), 8.0 μM (NADP+). The MfIDH specificity (kcat/Km) was only 5-times higher for NAD+ than for NADP+. The purified MfIDH displayed maximal activity at 60°C. Heat-inactivation studies showed that the MfIDH was remarkably thermostable, retaining full activity at 50°C and losting ca. 50% of its activity after one hour of incubation at 75°C. The enzyme was insensitive to the presence of intermediate metabolites, with the exception of 2 mM ATP, which caused 50% inhibition of NADP+-linked activity. The indispensability of the N6 amino group of NAD(P)+ in its binding to MfIDH was demonstrated. MfIDH showed high sequence similarity with bacterial NAD(P)+-dependent type I isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) rather than with eukaryotic NAD+-dependent IDHs. The unique double coenzyme specificity of MfIDH potentially resulted from the Lys340, Ile341 and Ala347 residues in the coenzyme-binding site of the enzyme. The discovery of a type I IDH with double coenzyme specificity elucidates the evolution of this subfamily IDHs and may provide fundamental information for engineering enzymes with desired properties."

To efficiently conserve, manage, and use such germplasm resources, an understanding of the genetic structure and differentiation of local rice landraces is required. In this study, we analyzed 188 accessions of rice landraces collected from localities across an altitudinal gradient from 425 to 2, 274 m above sea level in Yunnan Province, China using ten target genes and 48 SSR markers. We detected clear differentiation of the rice landraces into indica and japonica groups and further separation of the accessions in each group into two subgroups according to altitude, including a lower altitude subgroup and higher altitude subgroup. The AMOVA results showed significant genetic differentiation among altitude zones at SSRs and most genes, except Os1977 and STS22. We further determined that differentiation among landrace populations followed a model of isolation by altitude, in which gene flow was higher among populations at similar altitude levels than across different altitude levels. Our findings demonstrated that both adaptation to altitude and altitude-dependent gene flow played key roles in the genetic differentiation of rice landraces in Yunnan, China."
https://openalex.org/W2607170597,"Homozygous tau knockout (Mapt-/-) mice develop age-dependent dopaminergic (DA) neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), supporting an important function of tau in maintaining the survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (mDANs) during aging. However, it remains to be determined whether the microtubule-associated protein tau regulates the differentiation and survival of mDANs during embryonic developmental stages. Here, we show that tau haploinsufficiency in postnatal day 0 (P0) heterozygous (Mapt+/-) pups, but not a complete loss of tau in the Mapt-/- littermates, led to a significant reduction of DA neurons in the VTA. This selective loss of DA neurons correlated with a similar reduction in orthodenticle homeobox 2 (Otx2), which is restricted to VTA neurons at the postmitotic stage and selectively controls the neurogenesis and survival of specific neuronal subtypes of VTA. Moreover, the prenatal developmental cell death in the Mapt+/- VTA specifically increased, and the expression of microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-1A was significantly up-regulated in the P0 Mapt-/- , but not the Mapt+/- , pups. These results suggest that tau haploinsufficiency, without the compensation effect of MAP1A, induces reduction of Otx2 expression, increases prenatal cell death, and accordingly leads to selective loss of VTA DA neurons in the early postnatal stage. Our findings highlight the impact of tau haploinsufficiency on the survival of mDANs and indicate that tau may participate in midbrain development in a dose-dependent way.-Zheng, M., Jiao, L., Tang, X., Xiang, X., Wan, X., Yan, Y., Li, X., Zhang, G., Li, Y., Jiang, B., Cai, H., Lin, X. Tau haploinsufficiency causes prenatal loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and reduction of transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2605855221,"Genetic research into complex diseases is frequently hindered by a lack of clear biomarkers for phenotype ascertainment. Phenotypes for such diseases are often identified on the basis of clinically defined criteria; however such criteria may not be suitable for understanding the genetic composition of the diseases. Various statistical approaches have been proposed for phenotype definition; however our previous studies have shown that differences in phenotypes estimated using different approaches have substantial impact on subsequent analyses. Instead of obtaining results based upon a single model, we propose a new method, using Bayesian model averaging to overcome problems associated with phenotype definition. Although Bayesian model averaging has been used in other fields of research, this is the first study that uses Bayesian model averaging to reconcile phenotypes obtained using multiple models. We illustrate the new method by applying it to simulated genetic and phenotypic data for Kofendred personality disorder-an imaginary disease with several sub-types. Two separate statistical methods were used to identify clusters of individuals with distinct phenotypes: latent class analysis and grade of membership. Bayesian model averaging was then used to combine the two clusterings for the purpose of subsequent linkage analyses. We found that causative genetic loci for the disease produced higher LOD scores using model averaging than under either individual model separately. We attribute this improvement to consolidation of the cores of phenotype clusters identified using each individual method."
