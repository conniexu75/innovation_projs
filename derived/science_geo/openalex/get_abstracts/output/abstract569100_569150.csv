https://openalex.org/W2521774961,"The human genome contains 25 genes coding for selenocysteine-containing proteins (selenoproteins). These proteins are involved in a variety of functions, most notably redox homeostasis. Selenoprotein enzymes with known functions are designated according to these functions: TXNRD1, TXNRD2, and TXNRD3 (thioredoxin reductases), GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, and GPX6 (glutathione peroxidases), DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3 (iodothyronine deiodinases), MSRB1 (methionine sulfoxide reductase B1), and SEPHS2 (selenophosphate synthetase 2). Selenoproteins without known functions have traditionally been denoted by SEL or SEP symbols. However, these symbols are sometimes ambiguous and conflict with the approved nomenclature for several other genes. Therefore, there is a need to implement a rational and coherent nomenclature system for selenoprotein-encoding genes. Our solution is to use the root symbol SELENO followed by a letter. This nomenclature applies to SELENOF (selenoprotein F, the 15-kDa selenoprotein, SEP15), SELENOH (selenoprotein H, SELH, C11orf31), SELENOI (selenoprotein I, SELI, EPT1), SELENOK (selenoprotein K, SELK), SELENOM (selenoprotein M, SELM), SELENON (selenoprotein N, SEPN1, SELN), SELENOO (selenoprotein O, SELO), SELENOP (selenoprotein P, SeP, SEPP1, SELP), SELENOS (selenoprotein S, SELS, SEPS1, VIMP), SELENOT (selenoprotein T, SELT), SELENOV (selenoprotein V, SELV), and SELENOW (selenoprotein W, SELW, SEPW1). This system, approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, also resolves conflicting, missing, and ambiguous designations for selenoprotein genes and is applicable to selenoproteins across vertebrates.

This system, approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, also resolves conflicting, missing, and ambiguous designations for selenoprotein genes and is applicable to selenoproteins across vertebrates. Selenium is an essential trace element in humans, which is present in proteins in the form of the 21st proteinogenic amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec). 2The abbreviations used are: Sec, selenocysteine; TXNRD, thioredoxin reductases; GPX, glutathione peroxidase; DIO, iodothyronine deiodinase; SEPHS2, selenophosphate synthetase 2; SELENOF, 15-kDa selenoprotein; SELENOH, selenoprotein H; SELENOI, selenoprotein I; SELENOK, selenoprotein K; SELENOM, selenoprotein M; SELENON, selenoprotein N; SELENOO, selenoprotein O; SELENOP, selenoprotein P; SELENOS, selenoprotein S; SELENOT, selenoprotein T; SELENOV, selenoprotein V; SELENOW, selenoprotein W; HGNC, HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. Sec is co-translationally inserted into a polypeptide chain in response to in-frame UGA codons directed by the Sec insertion sequence element, a stem-loop structure in the 3′-UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs. The human genome contains 25 selenoprotein genes (1.Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigó R. Gladyshev V.N. Characterization of mammalian selenoproteomes.Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar), and selenoproteins are essential for embryo development and human health (2.Bösl M.R. Takaku K. Oshima M. Nishimura S. Taketo M.M. Early embryonic lethality caused by targeted disruption of the mouse selenocysteine tRNA gene (Trsp).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Why 21? the significance of selenoproteins for human health revealed by inborn errors of metabolism.FASEB J. 2016; (July 29): 414Google Scholar). Among the selenoproteins, 13 have known functions; at least 12 of them serve as oxidoreductases, wherein Sec is the catalytic redox-active residue. The redox theme is also common for selenoproteins in other organisms (4.Fomenko D.E. Xing W. Adair B.M. Thomas D.J. Gladyshev V.N. High-throughput identification of catalytic redox-active cysteine residues.Science. 2007; 315: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The remaining 12 selenoproteins either have no known function, or their functions are only partially established. One of the selenoproteins, selenoprotein P (5.Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Regulation of selenium metabolism and transport.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2015; 35: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), requires special mention as it has more than one Sec. It is a major plasma selenoprotein that delivers selenium primarily from the liver to other organs (6.Carlson B.A. Novoselov S.V. Kumaraswamy E. Lee B.J. Anver M.R. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. Specific excision of the selenocysteine tRNA[Ser]Sec (Trsp) gene in mouse liver demonstrates an essential role of selenoproteins in liver function.J. Biol.

Gene disruption discloses role of selenoprotein P in selenium delivery to target tissues.Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and is involved in selenium transport and metabolism within organs. However, this protein also has an N-terminal Sec-containing thioredoxin domain similar to that found in most selenoproteins with known functions, which points to a potential redox function. Several other selenoproteins, including selenoproteins H, M, T, V, W, and Sep15, also possess thioredoxin-like domains, suggesting redox-related functions (8.Dikiy A. Novoselov S.V. Fomenko D.E. Sengupta A. Carlson B.A. Cerny R.L. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N.

Selenoproteins are not all homologous, but are characterized by their incorporation of Sec. Historically they have been given designations by the groups that discovered them, e.g. because of its presence in plasma the respective selenoprotein was named selenoprotein P (9.Motsenbocker M.A. Tappel A.L. A selenocysteine-containing selenium-transport protein in rat plasma.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10.Burk R.F. Gregory P.E. Some characteristics of 75Se-P, a selenoprotein found in rat liver and plasma, and comparisons of it with selenoglutathione peroxidase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), or because of its size another protein was called the 15-kDa selenoprotein or Sep15 (11.Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.T. Wootton J.C. Hatfield D.L. A new human selenium-containing protein. Purification, characterization, and cDNA sequence.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8910-8915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, some selenoproteins were identified independently by two or more groups, which created confusion and discrepancies in the field. For example, the same protein was named selenoprotein R by one group (12.Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. New mammalian selenocysteine-containing proteins identified with an algorithm that searches for selenocysteine insertion sequence elements.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), but discovered concurrently and designated by another group as selenoprotein X (13.Lescure A. Gautheret D. Carbon P. Krol A. Novel selenoproteins identified in silico and in vivo by using a conserved RNA structural motif.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38147-38154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This protein was then functionally characterized (14.Kryukov G.V. Kumar R.A. Koc A. Sun Z. Gladyshev V.N. Selenoprotein R is a zinc-containing stereo-specific methionine sulfoxide reductase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4245-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and renamed MsrB1 (for methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase 1) (15.Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Methionine sulfoxide reduction in mammals: characterization of methionine-R-sulfoxide reductases.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), but all three designations persist in the literature and/or databases. Another problematic example is the nomenclature used for thioredoxin reductases. The names for the first thioredoxin reductase, which had been known decades before its selenoprotein nature was discovered (16.Holmgren A. Bovine thioredoxin system: purification of thioredoxin reductase from calf liver and thymus and studies of its function in disulfide reduction.J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are generally internally consistent, although they differ in the abbreviations used, e.g. TR1 and TrxR1 (17.Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Physiological functions of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar). The second and third thioredoxin reductases discovered, however, were named inconsistently by the authors, wherein the mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase was designated as TrxR2 (18.Lee S.R. Kim J.R. Kwon K.S. Yoon H.W. Levine R.L. Ginsburg A. Rhee S.G. Molecular cloning and characterization of a mitochondrial selenocysteine-containing thioredoxin reductase from rat liver.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4722-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and TR3 (19.Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Redox regulation of cell signaling by selenocysteine in mammalian thioredoxin reductases.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and the testis-specific thioredoxin-glutathione reductase has been alternatively labeled as TR2 (19.Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Redox regulation of cell signaling by selenocysteine in mammalian thioredoxin reductases.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), TrxR3, or TGR. Designations are also confusing for several other selenoproteins. For example, selenoprotein S was named SelS (1.Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigó R. Gladyshev V.N. Characterization of mammalian selenoproteomes.Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar), but a later paper introduced the designation VIMP (20.Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. A membrane protein complex mediates retro-translocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol.Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Similarly, selenoprotein H was named SelH (1.Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigó R. Gladyshev V.N. Characterization of mammalian selenoproteomes.Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar), but also C11orf31, and selenoprotein I was named SelI (1.Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigó R. Gladyshev V.N. Characterization of mammalian selenoproteomes.Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar), but also called EPT1 (21.Horibata Y. Hirabayashi Y. Identification and characterization of human ethanolaminephosphotransferase1.J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 503-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To avoid confusion, and at the instigation of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), we describe a new standardized designation system for human (and other vertebrate) selenoproteins. Human gene designations are approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), and genes in other mammals follow the same designations. Selenoproteins have traditionally been published using SEL or SEP symbols followed by a letter or a number. Unfortunately, for naming the genes encoding these proteins, the SEL root was not an option as it was already approved for the selectin gene family; for example, SELP is the approved gene symbol for selectin P (P-selectin) and not selenoprotein P. Some selenoprotein genes had been approved using the root SEP (i.e. SEPN1, SEPP1, and SEPW1) but this could not be utilized for all selenoproteins as selenoprotein T gene would then be SEPT or SEPT1, and SEPT# is already used for the septin genes. HGNC does not use the same root for unrelated groups of genes (e.g. SEL for selectins and selenoproteins) and does not endorse the use of multiple root symbols for genes sharing a common name (e.g. SEP and SEL for selenoprotein). With a view to solving these issues, HGNC approached selenoprotein researchers to propose a new unifying root symbol for all selenoprotein genes. We propose that all selenoproteins (except those that have been functionally characterized, e.g. with enzymatic activity) use the root symbol SELENO followed by a letter. This gene nomenclature is designed to highlight selenium, the key functional site in these proteins, and to provide a new and unambiguous root for these genes. The new nomenclature applies to 12 human selenoprotein genes as detailed in Table 1. Selenoproteins with known functions will continue to use the same designations (Table 2). Once functions are established for other selenoproteins, they may be renamed, as required. The proposed designations apply to the selenoprotein genes; although the same designations may be used for many of the encoded proteins, traditional names of selenoproteins, e.g. selenoprotein P, may also be used.TABLE 1Selenoprotein genes using the new SELENO rootSymbolNameSynonymsRefs.SELENOFSelenoprotein FSelenoprotein 15, SEP1511.Gladyshev V.N.

Although the inflammatory nature of M-MΦ in acute stroke has been well documented, their role during the resolution phase of stroke is less clear. With emerging evidence for the involvement of scavenger receptors in innate immunity, this study addresses an M-MΦ CD36 role in mediating phagocytosis during the recovery phase of stroke. Stroke increases CD36 and TSP-1/2 mRNA levels in the ipsilateral hemisphere at acute (3-day (d)) and recovery (7d) periods. Quantification of total, intracellular, and cell surface CD36 protein levels showed relatively unchanged expression at 3d post-ischemia. At 7d, there was a significant increase in cell surface CD36 (p < 0.05) with a concurrent reduction of intracellular CD36 (p < 0.05) in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Both cell surface and intracellular CD36 were found in whole brain lysates, whereas cell surface CD36 was predominantly detected in isolated brain mononuclear cells, blood monocytes, and peritoneal macrophages, suggesting that cell surface CD36 expressed in the post-ischemic brain originates from the periphery. The stroke-induced CD36 mRNA level correlated with increased expression of lysosomal acid lipase, an M2 macrophage marker. Functionally, higher CD36 expression in M-MΦ is correlated with higher phagocytic indices in post-ischemic brain immune cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of CD36 attenuated phagocytosis in peritoneal macrophages and brain M-MΦ. These findings demonstrate that cell surface CD36 on M-MΦ mediates phagocytosis during the recovery phase in post-stroke brains and suggests that CD36 plays a reparative role during the resolution of inflammation in ischemic stroke.

The peels are used under two states: fresh and residual (after essential oil extraction). Organic acid (citric acid) and mineral acid (sulfuric acid) were used in the pectin extraction. The aim of this study is the evaluation the effect of extraction conditions on pectin yield, degree of esterification “DE” and on molecular weight “Mw”. Results showed that the pectin yield was higher using the residual peels. Moreover, both peels allow the obtainment of a high methoxyl pectin with DE >50%. The molecular weight was calculated using Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation which describes its relationship with intrinsic viscosity. This later was determined using four equations; Huggins equation, kramer, Schulz-Blaschke and Martin equation. The molecular weight varied from 1.538 x1005 to 2.47x1005 g/mol for grapefruit pectin and from 1.639 x1005 to 2.471 x1005 g/mol for orange pectin."

In particular, exosomes derived from 293T cells are used most frequently, although exosome dosing has varied greatly among studies. Considering their biological origin, it is crucial to characterize the molecular composition of exosomes if large doses are to be administered in clinical settings. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the protein, messenger RNA and microRNA profiles of 293T cell-derived exosomes; then, we characterized these data using Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia for Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. Our study will provide the basis for the selection of 293T cell-derived exosome drug delivery systems. Profiling the exosomal signatures of 293T cells will lead to a better understanding of 293T exosome biology and will aid in the identification of any harmful factors in exosomes that could cause adverse clinical effects."
https://openalex.org/W2521740846,"SCCmec elements are very important mobile genetic elements in Staphylococci that carry beta-lactam resistance genes mecA/mecC, recombinase genes and a variety of accessory genes. Twelve main types and a couple of variants have yet been described. In addition, there are also other SCC elements harbouring other markers. In order to subtype strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) based on variations within their SCCmec elements, 86 markers were selected from published SCC sequences for an assay based on multiplexed primer extension reactions followed by hybridisation to the specific probes. These included mecA/mecC, fusC, regulatory genes, recombinase genes, genes from ACME and heavy metal resistance loci as well as several genes of unknown function. Hybridisation patterns for published genome or SCC sequences were theoretically predicted. For validation of the microarray based assay and for stringent hybridisation protocol optimization, real hybridization experiments with fully sequenced reference strains were performed modifying protocols until yielded the results were in concordance to the theoretical predictions. Subsequently, 226 clinical isolates from two hospitals in the city of Dresden, Germany, were characterised in detail. Beside previously described types and subtypes, a wide variety of additional SCC types or subtypes and pseudoSCC elements were observed as well as numerous composite elements. Within the study collection, 61 different such elements have been identified. Since hybridisation cannot recognise the localisation of target genes, gene duplications or inversions, this is a rather conservative estimate. Interestingly, some widespread epidemic strains engulf distinct variants with different SCCmec subtypes. Notable examples are ST239-MRSA-III, CC5-, CC22-, CC30-, and CC45-MRSA-IV or CC398-MRSA-V. Conversely, identical SCC elements were observed in different strains with SCCmec IVa being spread among the highest number of Clonal Complexes. The proposed microarray can help to distinguish isolates that appear similar or identical by other typing methods and it can be used as high-throughput screening tool for the detection of putative new SCC types or variants that warrant further investigation and sequencing. The high degree of diversity of SCC elements even within so-called strains could be helpful for epidemiological typing. It also raises the question on scale and speed of the evolution of SCC elements."
https://openalex.org/W2513402838,"A history of childhood adversity is associated with psychotic disorder, with an increase in risk according to number or severity of exposures. However, it is not known why only some exposed individuals go on to develop psychosis. One possibility is pre-existing genetic vulnerability. Research on gene-environment interaction in psychosis has primarily focused on candidate genes, although the genetic effects are now known to be polygenic. This pilot study investigated whether the effect of childhood adversity on psychosis is moderated by the polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS). Data were utilised from the Genes and Psychosis (GAP) study set in South London, UK. The GAP sample comprises 285 first-presentation psychosis cases and 256 unaffected controls with information on childhood adversity. We studied only white subjects (80 cases and 110 controls) with PRS data, as the PRS has limited predictive ability in patients of African ancestry. The occurrence of childhood adversity was assessed with the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA.Q) and the PRS was based on genome-wide meta-analysis results for schizophrenia from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Higher schizophrenia PRS and childhood adversities each predicted psychosis status. Nevertheless, no evidence was found for interaction as departure from additivity, indicating that the effect of polygenic risk scores on psychosis was not increased in the presence of a history of childhood adversity. These findings are compatible with a multifactorial threshold model in which both genetic liability and exposure to environmental risk contribute independently to the etiology of psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W2523403179,"In oscillating mechanical systems, nonlinearity is responsible for the departure from proportionality between the forces that sustain their motion and the resulting vibration amplitude. Such effect may have both beneficial and harmful effects in a broad class of technological applications, ranging from microelectromechanical devices to edifice structures. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on the amplitude, in particular, jeopardizes the use of nonlinear oscillators in the design of time-keeping electronic components. Nonlinearity, however, can itself counteract this adverse response by triggering a resonant interaction between different oscillation modes, which transfers the excess of energy in the main oscillation to higher harmonics, and thus stabilizes its frequency. In this paper, we examine a model for internal resonance in a vibrating elastic beam clamped at its two ends. In this case, nonlinearity occurs in the form of a restoring force proportional to the cube of the oscillation amplitude, which induces resonance between modes whose frequencies are in a ratio close to 1:3. The model is based on a representation of the resonant modes as two Duffing oscillators, coupled through cubic interactions. Our focus is put on illustrating the diversity of behavior that internal resonance brings about in the dynamical response of the system, depending on the detailed form of the coupling forces. The mathematical treatment of the model is developed at several approximation levels. A qualitative comparison of our results with previous experiments and numerical calculations on elastic beams is outlined."
https://openalex.org/W2523623386,"Introduction High intensity zones (HIZ) of the lumbar spine are a phenotype of the intervertebral disc noted on MRI whose clinical relevance has been debated. Traditionally, T2-weighted (T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been utilized to identify HIZ of lumbar discs. However, controversy exists with regards to HIZ morphology, topography, and association with other MRI spinal phenotypes. Moreover, classification of HIZ has not been thoroughly defined in the past and the use of additional imaging parameters (e.g. T1W MRI) to assist in defining this phenotype has not been addressed. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study of 814 (69.8% females) subjects with mean age of 63.6 years from a homogenous Japanese population was performed. T2W and T1W sagittal 1.5T MRI was obtained on all subjects to assess HIZ from L1-S1. We created a morphological and topographical HIZ classification based on disc level, shape type (round, fissure, vertical, rim, and enlarged), location within the disc (posterior, anterior), and signal type on T1W MRI (low, high and iso intensity) in comparison to the typical high intensity on T2W MRI. Results HIZ was noted in 38.0% of subjects. Of these, the prevalence of posterior, anterior, and both posterior/anterior HIZ in the overall lumbar spine were 47.3%, 42.4%, and 10.4%, respectively. Posterior HIZ was most common, occurring at L4/5 (32.5%) and L5/S1 (47.0%), whereas anterior HIZ was most common at L3/4 (41.8%). T1W iso-intensity type of HIZ was most prevalent (71.8%), followed by T1W high-intensity (21.4%) and T1W low-intensity (6.8%). Of all discs, round types were most prevalent (anterior: 3.6%, posterior: 3.7%) followed by vertical type (posterior: 1.6%). At all affected levels, there was a significant association between HIZ and disc degeneration, disc bulge/protrusion and Modic type II (p<0.01). Posterior HIZ and T1W high-intensity type of HIZ were significantly associated with disc bulge/protrusion and disc degeneration (p<0.01). In addition, posterior HIZ was significantly associated with Modic type II and III. T1W low-intensity type of HIZ was significantly associated with Modic type II. Conclusions This is the first large-scale study reporting a novel classification scheme of HIZ of the lumbar spine. This study is the first that has utilized T2W and T1W MRIs in differentiating HIZ sub-phenotypes. Specific HIZ sub-phenotypes were found to be more associated with specific MRI degenerative changes. With a more detailed description of the HIZ phenotype, this scheme can be standardized for future clinical and research initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W2523465551,"The recently acquired genome sequence of globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus) has been used to catalog the genome’s content of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. More than 177,000 perfect SSRs were revealed, equivalent to an overall density across the genome of 244.5 SSRs/Mbp, but some 224,000 imperfect SSRs were also identified. About 21% of these SSRs were complex (two stretches of repeats separated by <100 nt). Some 73% of the SSRs were composed of dinucleotide motifs. The SSRs were categorized for the numbers of repeats present, their overall length and were allocated to their linkage group. A total of 4,761 perfect and 6,583 imperfect SSRs were present in 3,781 genes (14.11% of the total), corresponding to an overall density across the gene space of 32,5 and 44,9 SSRs/Mbp for perfect and imperfect motifs, respectively. A putative function has been assigned, using the gene ontology approach, to the set of genes harboring at least one SSR. The same search parameters were applied to reveal the SSR content of 14 other plant species for which genome sequence is available. Certain species-specific SSR motifs were identified, along with a hexa-nucleotide motif shared only with the other two Compositae species (sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and horseweed (Conyza canadensis)) included in the study. Finally, a database, called “Cynara cardunculus MicroSatellite DataBase” (CyMSatDB) was developed to provide a searchable interface to the SSR data. CyMSatDB facilitates the retrieval of SSR markers, as well as suggested forward and reverse primers, on the basis of genomic location, genomic vs genic context, perfect vs imperfect repeat, motif type, motif sequence and repeat number. The SSR markers were validated via an in silico based PCR analysis adopting two available assembled transcriptomes, derived from contrasting globe artichoke accessions, as templates."
https://openalex.org/W2522978178,"In many developing countries, high levels of child undernutrition persist alongside rapid economic growth. There is considerable interest in the study of countries that have made rapid progress in child nutrition to uncover the driving forces behind these improvements. Cambodia is often cited as a success case having reduced the incidence of child stunting from 51% to 34% over the period 2000 to 2014. To what extent is this success driven by improvements in the underlying determinants of nutrition, such as wealth and education, (“covariate effects”) and to what extent by changes in the strengths of association between these determinants and nutrition outcomes (“coefficient effects”)? Using determinants derived from the widely-applied UNICEF framework for the analysis of child nutrition and data from four Demographic and Health Surveys datasets, we apply quantile regression based decomposition methods to quantify the covariate and coefficient effect contributions to this improvement in child nutrition. The method used in the study allows the covariate and coefficient effects to vary across the entire distribution of child nutrition outcomes. There are important differences in the drivers of improvements in child nutrition between severely stunted and moderately stunted children and between rural and urban areas. The translation of improvements in household endowments, characteristics and practices into improvements in child nutrition (the coefficient effects) may be influenced by macroeconomic shocks or other events such as natural calamities or civil disturbance and may vary substantially over different time periods. Our analysis also highlights the need to explicitly examine the contribution of targeted child health and nutrition interventions to improvements in child nutrition in developing countries."

In this study, we investigated whether ORMDL3 expression is associated with changes in SPT activity and to tal SL levels. Orm d l3-knockout (Ormd l3-/-) and transgenic (Ormd l3Tg/wt) micewere generated to study the effect of ORMDL3 on to tal SL levels inplasma and tissues. Cellular SPT activity was measured in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Ormd l3-/- mice, as well as in HEK293 cells in which ORMDL3 was overexpressed and silenced. Further more, we analyzed the association of the reported ORMDL3 asthma SNPs with plasma sphingoid bases in a population-based cohort of 971 individuals. Total C18-long chain bases were not significantly altered in the plasma and tissues of Ormd l3-/- mice, whereas C18-sphinganine showed a small and significant increase inplasma, lung, andliver tissues. Mouseembryonic fibroblast cells from Ormd l3-/- mice didnot show an altered SPT activity compared with Ormd l3+/2 and Ormd l3+/+ mice. Overexpression or knock down of ORMDL 3 in HEK 293 cells did not alter SPT activity; however, parallel knock down of all 3 ORMDL iso forms increased enzyme activity significantly. A significant association of the annotated ORMDL3 asthma SNPs with plasma long-chain sphingoid base levels could not be confirmed.

https://openalex.org/W2521598841,"The gene encoding phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase), pfaE, a component of the polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway, is crucial for the production of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6ω3), along with the other pfa cluster members pfaA, pfaB, pfaC and pfaD. DHA was produced in Escherichia coli by co-expressing pfaABCD from DHA-producing Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H with one of four pfaE genes from bacteria producing arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4ω6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5ω3) or DHA, respectively. Substitution of the pfaE gene from different strain source in E. coli did not influence the function of the PKS pathway producing DHA, although they led to different DHA yields and fatty acid profiles. This result suggested that the pfaE gene could be switchable between these strains for the production of DHA. The DHA production by expressing the reconstituted PKS pathway was also investigated in different E. coli strains, at different temperatures, or with the treatment of cerulenin. The highest DHA production, 2.2 mg of DHA per gram of dry cell weight or 4.1% of total fatty acids, was obtained by co-expressing pfaE(EPA) from the EPA-producing strain Shewanella baltica with pfaABCD in DH5α. Incubation at low temperature (10-15°C) resulted in higher accumulation of DHA compared to higher temperatures. The addition of cerulenin to the medium increased the proportion of DHA and saturated fatty acids, including C12:0, C14:0 and C16:0, at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids, including C16:1 and C18:1.

https://openalex.org/W2523044687,"αβT cell receptor (TCR) genetic diversity is outnumbered by the quantity of pathogenic epitopes to be recognized. To provide efficient protective anti-viral immunity, a single TCR ideally needs to cross-react with a multitude of pathogenic epitopes. However, the frequency, extent, and mechanisms of TCR cross-reactivity remain unclear, with conflicting results on anti-viral T cell cross-reactivity observed in humans. Namely, both the presence and lack of T cell cross-reactivity have been reported with HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes from the Epstein-Barr and influenza viruses (BMLF-1 and M158, respectively) or with the hepatitis C and influenza viruses (NS31073 and NA231, respectively). Given the high sequence similarity of these paired viral epitopes (56 and 88%, respectively), the ubiquitous nature of the three viruses, and the high frequency of the HLA-A*02:01 allele, we selected these epitopes to establish the extent of T cell cross-reactivity. We combined ex vivo and in vitro functional assays, single-cell αβTCR repertoire sequencing, and structural analysis of these four epitopes in complex with HLA-A*02:01 to determine whether they could lead to heterologous T cell cross-reactivity. Our data show that sequence similarity does not translate to structural mimicry of the paired epitopes in complexes with HLA-A*02:01, resulting in induction of distinct αβTCR repertoires. The differences in epitope architecture might be an obstacle for TCR recognition, explaining the lack of T cell cross-reactivity observed. In conclusion, sequence similarity does not necessarily result in structural mimicry, and despite the need for cross-reactivity, antigen-specific TCR repertoires can remain highly specific."
https://openalex.org/W2522932992,"Background Exposure to carbon dioxide (CO2) gas as a killing method is aversive and exposure to high concentrations is likely to be painful. Bradycardia during exposure to CO2 is associated with nociception and pain. However, it is unclear if bradycardia occurs before loss of consciousness as definitions of loss of consciousness vary in the literature. The objectives of this study were to explore the relationship between recumbency, loss of righting reflex (LORR) and a quiescent electromyograph as measures of loss of consciousness, and identify the onset of bradycardia in relation to these measures. Our primary hypothesis was that CO2 exposure would result in bradycardia, which would precede LORR. Methods Thirty-two adult, female Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented with a telemetry device and randomly assigned to one of four killing methods (concentrations of 100% CO2, CO2 (70%)/O2 (30%), isoflurane (5%) and intraperitoneal pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). Time to achieve recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric electrocorticograph, heart rate and apnea were recorded. Results The general order of progression was recumbency, LORR, quiescent electromyograph, isoelectric electrocorticograph and apnea. Recumbency preceded LORR in the majority of animals (CO2; 7/8, CO2/O2; 8/8, isoflurane; 5/8, pentobarbital; 4/8). Bradycardia occurred before recumbency in the CO2 (p = 0.0002) and CO2/O2 (p = 0.005) groups, with a 50% reduction in heart rate compared to baseline. The slowest (time to apnea) and least consistent killing methods were CO2/O2 (1180 ± 658.1s) and pentobarbital (875 [239 to 4680]s). Conclusion Bradycardia, and consequently nociception and pain, occurs before loss of consciousness during CO2 exposure. Pentobarbital displayed an unexpected lack of consistency, questioning its classification as an acceptable euthanasia method in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2523283113,"α-Conotoxins represent a large group of pharmacologically active peptides that antagonize nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The α3β4 nAChR, a predominant subtype in the peripheral nervous system, has been implicated in various pathophysiological conditions. As many α-conotoxins have multiple pharmacological targets, compounds specifically targeting individual nAChR subtypes are needed. In this study, we performed mutational analyses to evaluate the key structural components of human β2 and β4 nAChR subunits that determine α-conotoxin selectivity for α3β4 nAChR. α-Conotoxin RegIIA was used to evaluate the impact of non-conserved human β2 and β4 residues on peptide affinity. Two mutations, α3β2[T59K] and α3β2[S113R], strongly enhanced RegIIA affinity compared with wild-type α3β2, as seen by substantially increased inhibitory potency and slower off-rate kinetics. Opposite point mutations in α3β4 had the contrary effect, emphasizing the importance of loop D residue 59 and loop E residue 113 as determinants for RegIIA affinity. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed the side chains of β4 Lys59 and β4 Arg113 formed hydrogen bonds with RegIIA loop 2 atoms, whereas the β2 Thr59 and β2 Ser113 side chains were not long enough to form such interactions. Residue β4 Arg113 has been identified for the first time as a crucial component facilitating antagonist binding. Another α-conotoxin, AuIB, exhibited low activity at human α3β2 and α3β4 nAChRs. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated the key interactions with the β subunit are different to RegIIA. Taken together, these data elucidate the interactions with specific individual β subunit residues that critically determine affinity and pharmacological activity of α-conotoxins RegIIA and AuIB at human nAChRs."

The TIP peptide, a mimic of the lectin-like domain of TNF, activates ENaC by binding to glycosylated residues in the extracellular loop of ENaC-α, as well as to a hitherto uncharacterized internal site. Molecular docking studies suggested three residues, Val567, Glu568, and Glu571, located at the interface between the second transmembrane and C-terminal domains of ENaC-α, as a critical site for binding of the TIP peptide. We generated Ala replacement mutants in this region of ENaC-α and examined its interaction with TIP peptide (3M, V567A/E568A/E571A; 2M, V567A/E568A; and 1M, E571A). 3M and 2M ENaC-α, but not 1M ENaC-α, displayed significantly reduced binding capacity to TIP peptide and to TNF. When overexpressed in H441 cells, 3M mutant ENaC-α formed functional channels with similar gating and density characteristics as the WT subunit and efficiently associated with the β and γ subunits in the plasma membrane. We subsequently assayed for increased open probability time and membrane expression, both of which define ENaC activity, following addition of TIP peptide. TIP peptide increased open probability time in H441 cells overexpressing wild type and 1M ENaC-α channels, but not 3M or 2M ENaC-α channels. On the other hand, TIP peptide-mediated reduction in ENaC ubiquitination was similar in cells overexpressing either WT or 3M ENaC-α subunits. In summary, this study has identified a novel site in ENaC-α that is crucial for activation of the open probability of the channel, but not membrane expression, by the lectin-like domain of TNF.

https://openalex.org/W2521916664,"The thymus, an organ responsible for T cell development, is one of the more stress-sensitive tissues in the body. Stress, in the form of infections, radiation exposure, and steroids, impairs thymic epithelial cell (TEC) functions and induces the programmed cell death of immature thymocytes. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs involved in tissue repair and homeostasis, with several supporting T cell development. We report that miR-205, an epithelial-specific miR, maintains thymopoiesis following inflammatory perturbations. Thus, the activation of diverse pattern recognition receptors in mice causes a more severe thymic hypoplasia and delayed T cell recovery when miR-205 is conditionally ablated in TECs. Gene expression comparisons in the TECs with/without miR-205 revealed a significant differential regulation of chemokine/chemokine receptor pathways, antigen processing components, and changes in the Wnt signaling system. This was partly a consequence of reduced expression of the transcriptional regulator of epithelial cell function, Forkhead Box N1 (Foxn1), and its two regulated targets, stem cell factor and ccl25, following stress. miR-205 mimics supplemented into miR-205-deficient fetal thymic organ cultures restored Foxn1 expression along with ccl25 and stem cell factor. A number of putative targets of miR-205 were up-regulated in TECs lacking miR-205, consistent with an important role for this miR in supporting T cell development in response to stress."

Recently discovered quinoline-based allosteric IN inhibitors (ALLINIs) potently impair HIV-1 replication and are currently in clinical trials. ALLINIs exhibit a multimodal mechanism of action by inducing aberrant IN multimerization during virion morphogenesis and by competing with IN for binding to its cognate cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75 during early steps of HIV-1 infection. However, quinoline-based ALLINIs impose a low genetic barrier for the evolution of resistant phenotypes, which highlights a need for discovery of second-generation inhibitors. Using crystallographic screening of a library of 971 fragments against the HIV-1 IN catalytic core domain (CCD) followed by a fragment expansion approach, we have identified thiophenecarboxylic acid derivatives that bind at the CCD-CCD dimer interface at the principal lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 binding pocket. The most active derivative (5) inhibited LEDGF/p75-dependent HIV-1 IN activity in vitro with an IC50 of 72 μm and impaired HIV-1 infection of T cells at an EC50 of 36 μm. The identified lead compound, with a relatively small molecular weight (221 Da), provides an optimal building block for developing a new class of inhibitors.

However, further development of these initial fragment hits was hindered by the lack of structural data. To facilitate structure-based drug design, we have conducted X-ray crystallographic fragment screening, which has led to the identification of new chemical scaffolds that bind to the IN CCD dimer interface at the principal LEDGF/p75 binding site. The optimized derivative impaired recombinant IN activities in vitro and inhibited HIV-1 replication in cell culture. Crystallographic fragment screening was facilitated by the availability of high resolution IN CCD crystals, which diffract X-rays to 1.8 Å and can be produced within 3 h of setup using the previously described crystallization condition (36.Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R.

The majority of crystallization drops produced microcrystals with only one of 24 yielding a crystal amenable for small molecule soaking. Subsequent optimization using a combination of pre-seeding and reducing the well volume from 500 μl to 50 μl improved crystal production to approximately 3 suitable crystals per drop. High throughput fragment screening of a chemically diverse library of 971 fragments, consisting of cocktails containing 4–8 compounds each, was conducted using a previously described protocol (37.Bauman J.D. Patel D. Dharia C. Fromer M.W. Ahmed S. Frenkel Y. Vijayan R.S. Eck J.T. Ho W.C. Das K. Shatkin A.J. Arnold E. Detecting allosteric sites of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by X-ray crystallographic fragment screening.J. Med. Chem. 2013; 56: 2738-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, fragment binding for only one mixture soak was observed at the screening concentration of 20 mm (in 20% (v/v) DMSO, the solvent for solubilizing the fragments and a cryoprotectant for freezing crystals). Structure refinement revealed electron density for a fragment bound to a non-biologically relevant pocket formed by crystal contacts. Subsequent hit identification through individual soaking of the mixture components proved to be challenging. Although mixture soaking consistently showed positive electron density, individual fragment soaking at 20 mm failed to reveal fragment-specific electron density. When soaked individually at 50 mm, only one fragment, 1 (Table 1), from the selected mixture displayed binding not only to the previously identified crystal contact site but also revealed weak electron density at the CCD-CCD dimer interface at the principal LEDGF/p75 binding site (Fig. 1). The presence of strong electron density for fragment binding to both sites was confirmed by a 100 mm soak of 1 (Fig. 2, left). High concentration screening is not unusual with fragment screening because fragments, due to their small size, tend to have low affinity interactions. In addition, screening with X-ray crystallography often requires higher concentrations due to issues with solubility and occupancy to detect binding (38.Patel D. Bauman J.D. Arnold E.

Glu-170, His-171, and Thr-174, the latter of which is also in close contact with the thiophene ring. Relative to the apo structure, the Met-178 side chain rotates into the cavity to establish hydrophobic interactions with the pyrrole ring of 1. Similarly, on the monomer B, the Gln-95, Trp-132, and Leu-102 side chains rotated by ∼170°, ∼30°, and ∼90°, respectively, establish further hydrophobic interactions with the pyrrole ring. Other hydrophobic interactions mediated via monomer B involve Ala-89, Phe-99, Thr-125, Ala-128, and Ala-129. A fragment expansion approach was undertaken to probe structure-activity relationships (SAR) between the lead fragment and the IN CCD. Modification of the pyrrole ring was determined as an ideal starting point for fragment growth based on the superposition of crystal structures for the fragment hit and available ALLINIs (data not shown). With this in mind, a small series of two- and three-substituted pyrrole analogs (labeled X and Y in Table 1) were designed and synthesized. The two-substituted analogs were prepared via direct halogenation (4 and 8) or formylation (2, 3, and 5) and subsequent functionalization of the ester derivative of fragment 1, e.g. methyl 3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)thiophene-2-carboxylate (supplemental information). The preparation of 3-substituted analogs proved to be slightly more challenging due to the inherent preference of pyrroles to react with electrophiles at the 2- rather than the 3-position. To overcome this reactivity, the 3-formyl derivative 6 could be synthesized via Paal-Knorr synthesis (39.Rault S. Lancelot J.C. Prunier H. Robba M. Renard P. Delagrange P. Pfeiffer B. Caignard D.H. Guardiola-Lemaitre B. Hamon M. Novel selective and partial agonists of 5-HT3 receptors. Part 1. Synthesis and biological evaluation of piperazinopyrrolothienopyrazines.J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 2068-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) from commercially available 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydro-3-furancarbaldehyde and subsequent saponification. This approach also facilitated the preparation of amine 7. A LEDGF/p75-dependent in vitro integration assay was used for initial screening of the eight compounds (Table 1). Electron-withdrawing substituents, such as aldehyde and carboxylic acid, at the X position of the pyrrole ring slightly improved potency, whereas the substitution with an ethyl at the same position (5) led to near complete inhibition of LEDGF/p75-mediated IN enzymatic activity at the test concentration of 400 μm. Based on these results our future experiments have focused on analyzing 5. To better understand the SAR, we also examined its less potent analogs 1 and 8 in parallel experiments. To dissect the mode of action of selected compounds in vitro, we examined their ability to inhibit LEDGF/p75-dependent and -independent IN activities as well as to induce aberrant IN multimerization and interfere with IN binding with LEDGF/p75 (Fig. 3, A, B, C, and D). Consistent with the initial results in Table 1, Fig. 3, A and D, show that compound 5 was significantly more potent (IC50 of 72 μm) than 8 (IC50 >600 μm) or 1 (IC50 >800 μm) for inhibiting integration in the LEDGF/p75-dependent assay. The ligand efficiency (LE) for compound 5 was calculated to be 0.38 kcal/mol per non-hydrogen atom (40.Kuntz I.D. Chen K. Sharp K.A. Kollman P.A. The maximal affinity of ligands.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9997-10002Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 41.Hopkins A.L. Groom C.R. Alex A. Ligand efficiency: a useful metric for lead selection.Drug Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). This compares favorably to the LE of 0.31 kcal/mol per non-hydrogen atom for direct binding of a highly potent representative ALLINI, BI-D, to IN (42.Feng L. Dharmarajan V. Serrao E. Hoyte A. Larue R.C. Slaughter A. Sharma A. Plumb M.R. Kessl J.J. Fuchs J.R. Bushman F.D. Engelman A.N. Griffin P.R. Kvaratskhelia M. The competitive Interplay between allosteric HIV-1 integrase inhibitor BI/D and LEDGF/p75 during the early stage of HIV-1 replication adversely affects inhibitor potency.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11: 1313-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The inhibition of LEDGF/p75-dependent activity could be due to (i) compound-induced aberrant protein multimerization of IN resulting in inactivation, (ii) the compound competing with IN binding to LEDGF/p75, or (iii) a combination of these activities. Therefore, a FRET-based IN multimerization assay was used next to help elucidate the mechanism of action for these compounds. In Fig. 3, B and C (zoomed-in portion of Fig. 3B), the multimerization assay shows dose-dependent increases in homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) signal with the addition of 5 or 8 but not for parental compound 1. However, the extent of HTRF signal increase for these compounds was markedly smaller than that of BI-D, a relatively potent quinoline-based ALLINI (Fig. 3B). Higher HTRF counts are indicative of higher order multimerization of IN due to increasing numbers of individual subunits, which are labeled with either donor or acceptor fluorophores, gathering together within the inhibitor-promoted complex. Therefore, the results in Fig. 3B suggest that the compounds induced a limited extent of higher order IN multimerization compared with their BI-D counterpart. However, the EC50 value of ∼26 μm for 5 in the IN multimerization assay correlated well with the IC50 value of 60 μm in a LEDGF/p75-independent integration assay (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the relatively limited multimerization of IN in the presence of 5 was still sufficient to inhibit IN activity in the absence of LEDGF/p75. Finally, to examine if the derivatives could also compete with IN-LEDGF/p75 binding, direct binding assays were performed. In addition to promoting aberrant multimerization, 5 inhibited IN binding to LEDGF/p75 with an IC50 value of 241 μm (Fig. 3D). Overall these results indicate that 5 inhibits IN through a multimodal mechanism of action in vitro similar to other quinoline-based ALLINIs such as BI-D. We next examined the inhibitory activities of 5 with respect to two IN mutants, A128T and H171T, that emerge under the selective genetic pressure of archetypal ALLINI BI-1001 and its more potent analog BI-D, respectively (43.Feng L.

As shown in Fig. 3E, 5 inhibited LEDGF/p75-dependent activities of wild-type, H171T, and A128T INs with very similar IC50 values. These results indicate that these mutant INs, which were markedly resistant to their respective ALLINIs, were as susceptible to 5 as the wild-type enzyme. Collectively, our results indicate that 5 is an attractive building block for further development as a second generation ALLINI. Compound 5 was subsequently tested for antiviral activity during both early and late phases of HIV-1 replication. To determine the activities of 5 during the early phase, SupT1 T cells treated with scale doses of 5 or BI-D, respectively, were infected with a single-round luciferase reporter construct based on HIV-1NL4–3 (HIV-Luc), and 2 days later cells were harvested and processed for luciferase assays. Expectedly (24.Jurado K.A. Wang H. Slaughter A. Feng L. Kessl J.J. Koh Y. Wang W. Ballandras-Colas A. Patel P.A. Fuchs J.R. Kvaratskhelia M. Engelman A. Allosteric integrase inhibitor potency is determined through the inhibition of HIV-1 particle maturation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 8690-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the EC50 of BI-D was 1.2 μm. Rather impressively, 5 had an EC50 of 36 μm under these infection conditions (Fig. 4A). To determine activities of 5 during the late phase, HIV-Luc was produced in HEK293T cells that were treated with log-scale compound doses. Subsequent infections of SupT1 cells proceeded in the absence of any additional drug in the T cell cultures. As expected (24.Jurado K.A. Wang H. Slaughter A. Feng L. Kessl J.J. Koh Y. Wang W. Ballandras-Colas A. Patel P.A. Fuchs J.R. Kvaratskhelia M. Engelman A. Allosteric integrase inhibitor potency is determined through the inhibition of HIV-1 particle maturation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 8690-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), BI-D was significantly more potent under these conditions, yielding an EC50 of 57 nm (Fig. 4B). By contrast, 5 was a few-fold less potent (EC50 of 103 μm) as compared with T cells that were directly treated. Unlike previously characterized ALLINIs, these data show that 5 inhibits the early phase of HIV-1 infection more potently than the late phase during HIV-1 particle production. 5 was somewhat more cytotoxic to SupT1 cells than BI-D (520 μm versus 175 μm; Fig. 4C), yielding a selectivity index of 14.4 during acute HIV-1 infection (Fig. 4C). To better understand the SAR of the investigated compounds, crystal-soaking experiments were performed to determine the binding sites of 8 and 5. A 100 mm soak of 8 with apoCCD crystals showed binding to the two sites identified with 1 (crystal contact and LEDGF/p75 binding sites). Surprisingly, the binding mode of the dual ring system of fragment 8 was flipped (Fig. 5A). Compared with 1, the carboxylate of 8 is involved in a tighter hydrogen bond interaction network with CCD monomer A residues via the backbone amides of Glu-170 and His-171 and the side chains of His-171 and Thr-174. The side chain of Glu-170 formed an additional halogen bonding interaction with one of the chlorine atoms on the pyrrole ring of 8. Additionally, the aromatic ring system participated in a hydrophobic interaction network formed by residues Met-178 and Ala-169 on CCD monomer A and residues Ala-89, Gln-95, Tyr-99, Leu-102, Thr-125, Ala-128, and Ala-129 on CCD monomer B. The most potent compound, fragment 5, was not amenable to X-ray crystallography. Therefore, we used AutoDock4 (45.Morris G.M. Huey R. Lindstrom W. Sanner M.F. Belew R.K. Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. AutoDock4 and AutoDockTools4: automated docking with selective receptor flexibility.J. Comput. Chem. 2009; 30: 2785-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (13753) Google Scholar) to predict the binding mode of this fragment. Docking with the hydrated docking protocol (46.Forli S. Olson A.J. A force field with discrete displaceable waters and desolvation entropy for hydrated ligand docking.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) revealed 5 binds in a manner similar to 8. As shown in Fig. 5B, the docked binding mode of 5 was predicted to maintain the hydrogen bonds on CCD monomer A with the backbone amides of Glu-170 and His-171 and the side chain of His-171 and Thr-174. The hydrated protocol also predicted a water molecule bridging the interaction of the carboxylate group with the backbone of Gln-168 on CCD monomer A. This water matches the density of an experimental water at low σ contours present when fragments 1 (Fig. 2, right) or 8 is bound (and a similar water found in the BI-D-bound structure; PDB code 4TSX). The ethyl-substituted pyrrole ring of 5 engages a hydrophobic cavity delineated by Thr-174 on CCD monomer A and Ala-89, Tyr-99, Leu-102, and Ala-129 on CCD monomer B. The thiophene of 5 overlaps with the experimentally determined position of the thiophene of 8, resulting in identical hydrophobic interactions. To better understand the structural basis for the ability of 5 to inhibit A128T and H171T INs, which confer resistance to certain quinoline-based ALLINIs, binding free energy simulations were performed. The calculated Kd value of 309 μm for 5 binding to the wild-type CCD-CCD (Table 2) was comparable with experimentally determined IC50 values in various in vitro assays (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the binding affinity of compound 5 to A128T or H171T CCD was reduced only modestly (<2-fold, Table 2) when compared with wild type. The significantly smaller size of 5 avoids the steric and electrostatic repulsion effects seen upon binding of BI-1001 to the A128T mutant (43.Feng L. Sharma A. Slaughter A. Jena N. Koh Y. Shkriabai N. Larue R.C. Patel P.A. Mitsuya H. Kessl J.J. Engelman A. Fuchs J.R. Kvaratskhelia M.

The reason as to why H171T substitution has little effect on the binding affinity of 5 could be explained by the absence of the tert-butoxy moiety in this compound. The tert-butoxy group in BI-D hydrogen bonds with Nδ-H of the His-171 side chain and the substitution of this amino acid by Thr reduces binding affinity by ∼65-fold (44.Slaughter A. Jurado K.A.

For example, both the carboxylate of 5 (Fig. 5B) and LEDGF/p75 Asp-366 (12.Cherepanov P. Ambrosio A.L. Rahman S. Ellenberger T. Engelman A. Structural basis for the recognition between HIV-1 integrase and transcriptional coactivator p75.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17308-17313Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) hydrogen bond with backbone amides of Glu-170 and His-171 in monomer A. In addition, the docking results in Fig. 5B show that 5 interacts with both subunits of IN, which is consistent with the inhibitor-induced IN multimerization observed in vitro (Fig. 3, B and C). However, the overlay of binding sites of 5 and BI-D with the CCD-CCD dimer (Fig. 5C) reveals that the quinoline-based ALLINI establishes more extensive interactions with both subunits interacting deeper in the binding pocket, whereas the smaller compound 5 has relatively limited contacts with both IN subunits. This in turn could explain the differential extents of IN multimerization seen with these compounds (Fig. 3B). The robust, aberrant IN multimerization observed with BI-D could allow for the impairment of the proper maturation of virus particles, whereas the limited multimerization induced by 5 may not suffice to significantly alter IN function during virion morphogenesis, thus reducing its potency in the late stage of viral replication. In summary, we have conducted X-ray crystallography-based fragment screening to identify novel compounds that bind to the CCD of HIV-1 IN. From a library of 971 fragments, X-ray crystallographic screening identified only one compound, 1, which bound to a crystal contact site. Subsequent soaking of the individual mixture components at high concentrations revealed additional binding at the LEDGF/p75 binding pocket. Although 1 did not detectably inhibit HIV-1 IN activity, the availability of the crystal structure allowed the use of fragment expansion to generate chemical derivatives, including the most active compound 5, which inhibited LEDGF/p75-dependent HIV-1 integration at the IC50 of 72 μm in vitro and impaired the acute phase of HIV-1 replication with an EC50 of 36 μm. Furthermore, 5 similarly inhibited the activities of wild-type and mutant INs that confer resistance to quinoline-based ALLINIs. These findings coupled with the small size of the identified lead compound (molecular mass of 221 Da) argue strongly for the further development of 3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid derivatives as a second generation of ALLINIs."

https://openalex.org/W2522390632,"Cellular exposure to cigarette smoke leads to an array of complex responses including apoptosis, cellular senescence, telomere dysfunction, cellular aging, and neoplastic transformation. To study the cellular response to cigarette smoke, a common in vitro model exposes cultured cells to a nominal concentration (i.e. initial concentration) of soluble cigarette smoke extract (CSE). However, we report that use of the nominal concentration of CSE as the only measure of cellular exposure is inadequate. Instead, we demonstrate that cellular response to CSE exposure is dependent not only on the nominal concentration of CSE, but also on specific experimental variables, including the total cell number, and the volume of CSE solution used. As found in other similar xenobiotic assays, our work suggests that the effective dose of CSE is more accurately related to the amount of bioavailable chemicals per cell. In particular, interactions of CSE components both with cells and other physical factors limit CSE bioavailability, as demonstrated by a quantifiably reduced cellular response to CSE that is first modified by such interactions. This has broad implications for the nature of cellular response to CSE exposure, and for the design of in vitro assays using CSE."
https://openalex.org/W2522001123,"Background The ongoing need for an availability of informal carers is taking on greater relevance as the global burden of disease transitions from acute fatal diseases to long term morbidity. Growing evidence suggests that extra burden on family carers may further impact on their health and ability to provide care. Important as it is to monitor the prevalence of those conditions which influence the burden of disease, it is also important to monitor the prevalence and health profiles of those who provide the informal care. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prevalence and demographics of adult carers aged 15 and over in the state of South Australia over 20 years between 1994 and 2014. Methods Data from nine representative, cross-sectional population surveys, conducted in South Australia, Australia were used, (total N = 26,788 and n = 1,504 carers). The adjusted prevalence estimate of carers and their demographic characteristics were determined. So as to examine whether there were any generational effects on the prevalence of carers, an Age-Period Cohort (APC) analysis was undertaken. Results The prevalence estimates of carers increased during the two decades from 3.7% in 1994 to 6.7% by 2014. Large increases in the proportion of retired carers, those aged 70 years and over, those carers employed, and those with higher educational qualifications were observed. There were also larger proportions of respondents with a country of birth other than Australia, UK, Ireland and European counties. The APC analysis illustrated an increasing prevalence rate over each decade for carers aged 20–80 years, especially for those over the age of 60 years. Conclusions The results illustrate changing carer characteristics and carer prevalence estimates in South Australia as new generations of carers take on the caring role. There is a need to include questions regarding informal carers within ongoing mainstream population surveys, particularly at state levels, so as to plan for their future health care and home support."

Patterns embedded in series of sentences can be used to model the formation and evolution of languages, and to solve practical problems such as evaluating linguistic ability. In this paper, we apply de-trended fluctuation analysis to detect long-range correlations embedded in sentence series from A Story of the Stone, one of the greatest masterpieces of Chinese literature. We identified a weak long-range correlation, with a Hurst exponent of 0.575±0.002 up to a scale of 104. We used the structural stability to confirm the behavior of the long-range correlation, and found that different parts of the series had almost identical Hurst exponents. We found that noisy records can lead to false results and conclusions, even if the noise covers a limited proportion of the total records (e.g., less than 1%). Thus, the structural stability test is an essential procedure for confirming the existence of long-range correlations, which has been widely neglected in previous studies. Furthermore, a combination of de-trended fluctuation analysis and diffusion entropy analysis demonstrated that the sentence series was generated by a fractional Brownian motion."

Using a combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), size exclusion chromatography, and quantitative RT-PCR, we provide the first characterization of a high molecular weight ribonucleoprotein apparatus participating in psaA mRNA splicing. This supercomplex contains two subcomplexes (I and II) that are responsible for trans-splicing of either psaA-i1 or psaA-i2. We further demonstrate that both subcomplexes are associated with intron RNA, which is a prerequisite for the correct assembly of subcomplex I.

As such, GP63 is a potential target of eventual vaccines against these protozoa. In the current study we evaluate the polymorphism of gp63 in Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis isolated from two sets of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) cases from Corte de Pedra, Brazil, including 35 cases diagnosed between 1994 and 2001 and 6 cases diagnosed between 2008 and 2011. Parasites were obtained from lesions by needle aspiration and cultivation. Genomic DNA was extracted, and 405 bp fragments, including sequences encoding the putative macrophage interacting sites, were amplified from gp63 genes of all isolates. DNA amplicons were cloned into plasmid vectors and ten clones per L. (V.) braziliensis isolate were sequenced. Alignment of cloned sequences showed extensive polymorphism among gp63 genes within, and between parasite isolates. Overall, 45 different polymorphic alleles were detected in all samples, which could be segregated into two clusters. Cluster one included 25, and cluster two included 20 such genotypes. The predicted peptides showed overall conservation below 50%. In marked contrast, the conservation at segments with putative functional domains approached 90% (Fisher's exact test p<0.0001). These findings show that gp63 is very polymorphic even among parasites from a same endemic focus, but the functional domains interacting with the mammalian host environment are conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2523189911,"Context Patients with adrenal incidentalomas (AI) may experience detrimental consequences due to a minimal cortisol excess sustained by adrenal adenoma. SNPs of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) modulate individual sensitivity to glucocorticoids and may interfere with the clinical presentation. Objective To compare the frequency of N363S, ER22/23EK and BclI SNPs in patients with AI with the general population and to evaluate whether these SNPs are linked to consequences of cortisol excess. Setting Multicentric, retrospective analysis of patients referred from 2010 to 2014 to 4 centers (Orbassano, Milano, Messina [Italy] and Zagreb [Croatia]). Patients 411 patients with AI; 153 males and 258 females and 186 from blood donors. Main outcomes measures All patients and controls were genotyped for BclI, N363S and ER22/23EK and SNPs frequency was associated with clinical and hormonal features. Results SNP frequency was: SNP frequency was: N363S 5.4% (MAF 0.027), BclI 54.7% (MAF 0.328), ER22/23EK 4.4% (MAF 0.022), without any significant difference between patients and controls. N363S was more frequent in hypertensive patients (p = 0.03) and was associated with hypertension (p = 0.015) in patients with suppressed cortisol after the 1-mg DST. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that SNPs of the glucocorticoid receptor gene do not play a pathogenetic role for AI. The impact of any single SNP on the phenotypic expression of minimal cortisol excess is limited and their analysis does not provide additional data that may be exploited for patient management."
https://openalex.org/W2523595179,"The number of validation studies of commercially available foot pods that provide estimates of running speed is limited and these studies have been conducted under laboratory conditions. Moreover, internal data handling and algorithms used to derive speed from these pods are proprietary and thereby unclear. The present study investigates the use of foot contact time (CT) for running speed estimations, which potentially can be used in addition to the global positioning system (GPS) in situations where GPS performance is limited. CT was measured with tri axial inertial sensors attached to the feet of 14 runners, during natural over ground outdoor running, under optimized conditions for GPS. The individual relationships between running speed and CT were established during short runs at different speeds on two days. These relations were subsequently used to predict instantaneous speed during a straight line 4 km run with a single turning point halfway. Stopwatch derived speed, measured for each of 32 consecutive 125m intervals during the 4 km runs, was used as reference. Individual speed-CT relations were strong (r2 >0.96 for all trials) and consistent between days. During the 4km runs, median error (ranges) in predicted speed from CT 2.5% (5.2) was higher (P<0.05) than for GPS 1.6% (0.8). However, around the turning point and during the first and last 125m interval, error for GPS-speed increased to 5.0% (4.5) and became greater (P<0.05) than the error predicted from CT: 2.7% (4.4). Small speed fluctuations during 4km runs were adequately monitored with both methods: CT and GPS respectively explained 85% and 73% of the total speed variance during 4km runs. In conclusion, running speed estimates bases on speed-CT relations, have acceptable accuracy and could serve to backup or substitute for GPS during tarmac running on flat terrain whenever GPS performance is limited."
https://openalex.org/W2950558521,"Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for all plants, but also one of the least mobile, and consequently least available, in the soil. Plants have evolved a series of molecular, metabolic and developmental adaptations to increase the acquisition of phosphorus and to maximize the efficiency of use within the plant. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the AtPHO1 protein regulates and facilitates the distribution of phosphorus. To investigate the role of PHO1 proteins in maize (Zea mays), the B73 reference genome was searched for homologous sequences, and four genes identified that were designated ZmPho1;1, ZmPho1;2a, ZmPho1;2b and ZmPho1;3. ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b are the most similar to AtPHO1, and represent candidate co-orthologs that we hypothesize to have been retained following whole genome duplication. Evidence was obtained for the production of natural anti-sense transcripts associated with both ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b, suggesting the possibility of regulatory crosstalk between paralogs. To characterize functional divergence between ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b, a program of transposon mutagenesis was initiated using the Ac/Ds system, and, here, we report the generation of novel alleles of ZmPho1;2a and ZmPho1;2b."

However, there is no standard method for handling those images and analyzing them efficiently and conveniently. Objective To investigate the sequential changes of SIH depending on the body sites using a color patch method Methods We performed retrospective reviews of 30 patients (11 facial and 19 non-facial areas) who underwent SIH for the restoration of skin defects and captured sequential photographs with a color patch which is specially designed for automatically calculating defect and scar sizes. Results Using a novel image analysis method with a color patch, skin defects were calculated more accurately (range of error rate: -3.39% ~ + 3.05%). All patients had smaller scar size than the original defect size after SIH treatment (rates of decrease: 18.8% ~ 86.1%), and facial area showed significantly higher decrease rate compared with the non-facial area such as scalp and extremities (67.05 ± 12.48 vs. 53.29 ± 18.11, P < 0.05). From the result of estimating the date corresponding to the half of the final decrement, all of the facial area showed improvements within two weeks (8.45 ± 3.91), and non-facial area needed 14.33 ± 9.78 days. Conclusion From the results of sequential changes of skin defects, SIH can be recommended as an alternative treatment method for restoration with more careful dressing for initial two weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2521653933,"It is argued that trophy hunting of large, charismatic mammal species can have considerable conservation benefits but only if undertaken sustainably. Social-ecological theory suggests such sustainability only results from developing governance systems that balance financial and biological requirements. Here we use lion (Panthera leo) trophy hunting data from Tanzania to investigate how resource ownership patterns influence hunting revenue and offtake levels. Tanzania contains up to half of the global population of free-ranging lions and is also the main location for lion trophy hunting in Africa. However, there are concerns that current hunting levels are unsustainable. The lion hunting industry in Tanzania is run by the private sector, although the government leases each hunting block to companies, enforces hunting regulation, and allocates them a species-specific annual quota per block. The length of these leases varies and theories surrounding property rights and tenure suggest hunting levels would be less sustainable in blocks experiencing a high turnover of short-term leases. We explored this issue using lion data collected from 1996 to 2008 in the Selous Game Reserve (SGR), the most important trophy hunting destination in Tanzania. We found that blocks in SGR with the highest lion hunting offtake were also those that experienced the steepest declines in trophy offtake. In addition, we found this high hunting offtake and the resultant offtake decline tended to be in blocks under short-term tenure. In contrast, lion hunting levels in blocks under long-term tenure matched more closely the recommended sustainable offtake of 0.92 lions per 1000 km2. However, annual financial returns were higher from blocks under short-term tenure, providing $133 per km2 of government revenue as compared to $62 per km2 from long-term tenure blocks. Our results provide evidence for the importance of property rights in conservation, and support calls for an overhaul of the system in Tanzania by developing competitive market-based approaches for block allocation based on long-term tenure of ten years."
https://openalex.org/W2521966743,"Mammalian p53 is a super tumor suppressor and plays a key role in guarding genome from DNA damage. However, p53 has not been found in plants which do not bear cancer although they constantly expose to ionizing radiation of ultraviolet light. Here we introduced p53 into the model plant Arabidopsis and examined p53-conferred phenotype in plant. Most strikingly, p53 caused early senescence and fasciation. In plants, fasciation has been shown as a result of the elevated homologous DNA recombination. Consistently, a reporter with overlapping segments of the GUS gene (1445) showed that the frequency of homologous recombination was highly induced in p53-transgenic plants. In contrast to p53, SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1 INDUCIBLE 1 (SNI1), as a negative regulator of homologous recombination in plants, is not present in mammals. Comet assay and clonogenic survival assay demonstrated that SNI1 inhibited DNA damage repair caused by either ionizing radiation or hydroxyurea in human osteosarcoma U2OS cancer cells. RAD51D is a recombinase in homologous recombination and functions downstream of SNI1 in plants. Interestingly, p53 rendered the sni1 mutants madly branching of inflorescence, a phenotype of fasciation, whereas rad51d mutant fully suppressed the p53-induced phenotype, indicating that human p53 action in plant is mediated by the SNI1-RAD51D signaling pathway. The reciprocal species-swap tests of p53 and SNI1 in human and Arabidopsis manifest that these species-specific proteins play a common role in homologous recombination across kingdoms of animals and plants."

https://openalex.org/W2520343896,"The wheat production in midland China is under serious threat by frequent Dry-Hot Wind (DHW) episodes with high temperature, low moisture and specific wind as well as intensive heat transfer and evapotranspiration. The numerical simulations of these episodes are important for monitoring grain yield and estimating agricultural water demand. However, uncertainties still remain despite that enormous experiments and modeling studies have been conducted concerning this issue, due to either inaccurate synoptic situation derived from mesoscale weather models or unrealistic parameterizations of stomatal physiology in land surface models. Hereby, we investigated the synoptic characteristics of DHW with widely-used mesoscale model Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and the effects of leaf physiology on surface evapotranspiration by comparing two land surface models: The Noah land surface model, and Peking University Land Model (PKULM) with stomata processes included. Results show that the WRF model could well replicate the synoptic situations of DHW. Two types of DHW were identified: (1) prevailing heated dry wind stream forces the formation of DHW along with intense sensible heating and (2) dry adiabatic processes overflowing mountains. Under both situations, the PKULM can reasonably model the stomatal closure phenomena, which significantly decreases both evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange of canopy, while these phenomena cannot be resolved in the Noah simulations. Therefore, our findings suggest that the WRF-PKULM coupled method may be a more reliable tool to investigate and forecast DHW as well as be instructive to crop models."
https://openalex.org/W2522729815,"We report here on the relationship between ligand binding and signaling responses in the yeast pheromone response pathway, a well characterized G protein-coupled receptor system. Responses to agonist (α-factor) by cells expressing widely varying numbers of receptors depend primarily on fractional occupancy, not the absolute number of agonist-bound receptors. Furthermore, the concentration of competitive antagonist required to inhibit α-factor-dependent signaling is more than 10-fold higher than predicted based on the known ligand affinities. Thus, responses to a particular number of agonist-bound receptors can vary greatly, depending on whether there are unoccupied or antagonist-bound receptors present on the same cell surface. This behavior does not appear to be due to pre-coupling of receptors to G protein or to the Sst2p regulator of G protein signaling. The results are consistent with a signaling response that is determined by the integration of positive signals from agonist-occupied receptors and inhibitory signals from unoccupied receptors, where the inhibitory signals can be diminished by antagonist binding.

Understanding the relationship between receptor occupancy by ligands and signaling responses is of fundamental importance in predicting and modulating the behavior of signaling pathways. Modeling of receptor signaling often starts with the assumption that signaling output is a linear function of receptor occupancy by agonist or that output is mediated by direct interactions of activated receptors with downstream binding partners or enzymes. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating signaling outputs remain poorly defined. One of the best characterized classes of receptors is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; CEN, centromeric; Nle, norleucine; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl; dTA, [des-Trp1,Ala3,Nle12]α-factor; dTH, [des-Trp1,des-His2,Nle12]α-factor; au, arbitrary fluorescence unit; d-Tyr3, [d-Tyr3,Nle12]α-factor. superfamily composed of seven transmembrane helix receptors that can recognize and respond to diverse environmental stimuli. Consistent with their important physiological roles, GPCRs constitute a major class of drug targets (1.Klabunde T. Hessler G. Drug design strategies for targeting G-protein-coupled receptors.Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 928-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 2.Overington J.P. Al-Lazikani B. Hopkins A.L. How many drug targets are there?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar). Although GPCRs can act via multiple pathways, in most cases their primary mode of signal transduction involves the activation of cytoplasmic heterotrimeric G proteins, resulting in release of GDP, binding of GTP, and dissociation of the Gα subunit from the dimer of the Gβ and Gγ subunits. Either or both of the dissociated G protein components then activates various downstream effectors. A particularly well characterized GPCR signaling system is the yeast pheromone response pathway in which the peptide pheromones α-factor and a-factor bind to the cellular receptors Ste2p and Ste3p, respectively, triggering activation of a cytoplasmic heterotrimeric G protein that, in turn, activates an MAPK cascade leading to changes in transcription and cell morphology in preparation for mating. Although there is low sequence similarity between yeast receptors and mammalian receptors, the trimeric G proteins of these systems are very similar, and the systems appear to be highly homologous; in some cases, the components of the two systems exhibit interchangeable function (3.Brown A.J.

To fully understand signaling responses initiated by agonist-bound receptors, a quantitative relationship must be established between the number of occupied receptors and the magnitude of downstream signaling responses. For example, the extent of downstream signaling by β-adrenergic receptors could be modeled based on a hyperbolic relationship describing binding of agonist to receptors, direct activation of G proteins by receptors, and a second hyperbolic relationship describing the binding and activation of downstream effectors such as adenylate cyclase by activated G proteins (18.Tolkovsky A.M.

Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 7: 139-150PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling in the yeast pheromone response pathway is characterized by a remarkable proportionality between receptor occupancy and pathway activation, measured either via G protein dissociation, MAPK activation, transcriptional induction of reporter genes, or cell cycle arrest (14.Brent R. Cell signaling: what is the signal and what information does it carry?.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 4019-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20.Yi T.M. Kitano H. Simon M.I.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10764-10769Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), indicating that signal output is a direct function of the number of agonist-occupied receptors at the cell surface. In this paradigm, signaling output in response to a given sub-saturating agonist concentration would be expected to depend on the number of receptors expressed at the cell surface, such that increasing the numbers of receptors would result in enhanced numbers of occupied receptors, enhancing signaling responses to low concentrations of agonist. However, responses to pheromone in yeast have been reported to be insensitive to changes in receptor expression over a wide range of expression levels (21.Leavitt L.M. Macaluso C.R. Kim K.S.

Functional and physical interactions among Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor receptors.Eukaryot. Cell. 2012; 11: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To further explore the relationship between receptor occupancy and signaling output, we examined the effects of systematic alterations of receptor number on pheromone responses in yeast by varying receptor expression levels and by evaluating the effects of mixing varying ratios of α-factor agonists and antagonists. We are unable to describe the signaling responses that we observed in terms of models in which output is determined by absolute numbers of agonist-bound receptors. Furthermore, we find that the discrepancies in these models are not readily explained by limitations imposed by the abundances of interacting components, including trimeric G proteins and the RGS protein Sst2p. The pheromone signaling pathway appears to provide a readout of the fractional occupancy of agonist bound to receptors, rather than to the absolute number of agonist-occupied receptors, suggesting that ligand-free receptors may act to inhibit signaling by ligand-occupied receptors. To quantitatively examine the relationship between signaling output and numbers of receptors at the cell surface, we performed assays of α-factor-dependent induction of the pheromone-responsive FUS1-lacZ reporter in yeast strains expressing varying levels of full-length Ste2p receptors ranging from <0.2 times the level expressed from the normal chromosomal STE2 locus to ∼9 times this level. Transcriptional induction of the FUS1-lacZ reporter has been reported to be linearly related to pheromone responses assayed at earlier stages of the pheromone response pathway (14.Brent R. Cell signaling: what is the signal and what information does it carry?.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 4019-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20.Yi T.M. Kitano H. Simon M.I.

Reproducible quantitation of responses to pheromone was facilitated by procedures for minimizing ligand adsorption and by performing side-by-side assays of the strains being compared (see “Experimental Procedures”). Levels of receptor expression at the cell surface of different yeast strains were determined based on saturation binding of the fluorescent α-factor analog [Lys7(NBD),Nle12]α-factor (Fig. 1). The values of Kd and Bmax determined for different strains, shown in Table 1, are in approximate agreement with previous binding measurements (25.Bajaj A. Celić A. Ding F.X. Naider F. Becker J.M.

However, direct measurement of cell surface-binding sites was not feasible for strains expressing receptors under control of the repressed GAL promoter in a chromosomal ste2-Δ background, because levels of binding of fluorescent ligand were too low to be detected. Thus, an estimate of the upper limit on cell surface expression under these conditions (less than 20% of the normal chromosomally encoded Ste2p) was derived based on immunoblotting of Ste2p in whole-cell lysates from this strain (24.Gehret A.U.

Open table in a new tab Contrary to the predictions of models in which signaling responses depend on the total number of agonist-occupied receptors on a cell, yeast cells expressing large numbers of receptors exhibit similar or slightly reduced sensitivities to pheromone compared with cells expressing smaller numbers of receptors. Cells expressing very low levels of receptors from a repressed GAL1 promoter exhibit an ∼2-fold decrease in EC50 compared with cells expressing receptors from the normal chromosomal locus (Table 1 and Fig. 2A), contrary to the expectation that cells with low abundances of receptors would be insensitive to agonist. These low-expressing cells also exhibit an ∼2-fold reduction in maximal signaling levels compared with cells expressing receptors from the normal chromosomal STE2, suggesting that the number of cell surface receptors in this strain is reduced below the threshold required for maximal output at saturating occupancy.Cells expressing receptors from a CEN plasmid in a chromosomal ste2-Δ host exhibit EC50 values and maximal signaling levels that are similar to the values of these parameters in the strain expressing the chromosomal copy of STE2 alone (Table 1 and Fig. 2B).Cells expressing STE2 from a multicopy plasmid are slightly (∼2-fold) less sensitive to pheromone than cells with a single chromosomal STE2 gene (Table 1 and Fig. 2C) and exhibit maximal responses similar to those of the strain with only a chromosomal STE2 gene. The observed increase in EC50 upon increasing receptor expression is particularly notable when considering the fact that the overexpressed receptors exhibit a modest decrease in Kd for α-factor compared with receptors expressed solely from the normal chromosomal locus (Table 1). One explanation for the lack of dependence of signaling responses on receptor expression levels could be that a select sub-population of receptors is responsible for signaling, such that expression of high levels of receptors that are not part of this population would be irrelevant to responses. Because some receptors, including Ste2p (27.Blumer K.J. Thorner J. β and γ subunits of a yeast guanine nucleotide-binding protein are not essential for membrane association of the α subunit but are required for receptor coupling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2006; 13: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), a class of receptors that are pre-associated with G proteins would be a candidate for such a sub-population. Another candidate class of receptors could be those associated with the RGS protein Sst2p, which has also been reported to associate with Ste2p (30.Ballon D.R. Flanary P.L. Gladue D.P. Konopka J.B.

Because stable interactions of Ste2p with both the trimeric G protein and Sst2p are reported to occur through the C-terminal tail of the receptor (28.Dosil M. Schandel K.A. Gupta E. Jenness D.D. Konopka J.B. The C terminus of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor receptor contributes to the formation of preactivation complexes with its cognate G protein.Mol. Cell.

DEP-domain-mediated regulation of GPCR signaling responses.Cell. 2006; 126: 1079-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), one approach to examining such interactions is to test the effects of varying receptor expression levels on signaling by C-terminally truncated receptors. Such receptors retain full signaling capabilities, mediating hypersensitive responses to the α-factor that can be explained by their inabilities to undergo down-regulation via phosphorylation and internalization (22.Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. The carboxy-terminal segment of the yeast α-factor receptor is a regulatory domain.Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 31.Konopka J.B. Jenness D.D. Hartwell L.H. The C terminus of the S. cerevisiae α-pheromone receptor mediates an adaptive response to pheromone.Cell. 1988; 54: 609-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, as shown in Table 1, strains expressing C-terminally truncated receptors are characterized by EC50 values for α-factor that are ∼20-fold lower and Bmax values for binding [Lys7(NBD),Nle12]α-factor that are ∼6-fold higher compared with strains expressing similar constructs encoding full-length receptors. These differences are not due to enhanced ligand binding affinity, as the Kd values for binding of [Lys7(NBD),Nle12]α-factor to truncated receptors are 2–3-fold higher than those for similarly expressed full-length receptors. Cells expressing truncated α-factor receptors, like those expressing full-length Ste2p, exhibit pheromone responses that are not strongly dependent on levels of receptor expression (Fig. 3). The EC50 value for cells expressing truncated receptors from a multicopy plasmid is ∼1.4-fold higher than for cells expressing the truncated Ste2p from a CEN plasmid, contrary to the expectation that increased receptor expression should enhance sensitivity to agonist. This suggests that neither the C-terminal tail of the receptor nor interactions of the tail with cytoplasmic proteins such as the G protein or the RGS protein are required to render signaling independent of changes in receptor expression. The lack of a decrease in EC50 with increasing cell surface expression, together with the fact that the truncated receptors expressed from the CEN plasmid are only 2-fold more abundant than the full length, also indicates that the low EC50 values observed for truncated receptors are not due to high expression levels of these receptors. As an additional way of investigating of the role of cytoplasmic proteins in maintaining signaling independent of receptor expression levels, we examined the effects of increasing the stoichiometric ratio of G proteins to receptors on signaling responses. Overexpression of trimeric G proteins, while maintaining the relative stoichiometry between subunits as constant as possible, was accomplished by expressing all three subunits, encoded by the GPA1, STE4, and STE18 genes, under the control of their respective native promoters, from a single multicopy plasmid. An increase in expression of ∼2- or ∼6-fold (over normal chromosomal levels) was detected by immunoblotting for Gpa1p or Ste4p subunits, respectively (Fig. 4). Preservation of subunit stoichiometry of functional G proteins is indicated by the fact that no constitutive activation and only modest changes in maximal signaling responses were detected in strains expressing the subunits from a multicopy plasmid. If the number of receptors complexed with G protein was a significant limitation on the number of signaling-competent receptors, overproduction of G proteins would be expected to have the biggest effect on enhancing sensitivity to agonist in a strain that also overexpressed receptors. However, no change in EC50 was detected upon G protein overexpression in the strain that also expresses the full-length STE2 gene from a multicopy plasmid (Fig. 5 and Table 2), and only small (∼2-fold) changes in EC50 and in maximal signaling levels were observed in strains expressing Ste2p at lower levels, so the differences in EC50 and maximal signaling levels between G protein-overexpressing strains expressing different levels of Ste2p receptors were also small.FIGURE 5Signaling responses to α-factor in strains overexpressing G proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2523750225,"We recently reported that the over-expression of skin fibroblast-derived neutral endopeptidase (NEP) plays a pivotal role in impairing the three-dimensional architecture of dermal elastic fibers during the biological mechanism of ultraviolet (UV)-induced skin wrinkling. In that process, a UVB-associated epithelial-mesenchymal cytokine interaction as well as a direct UVA-induced cellular stimulation are associated with the up-regulation of NEP in human fibroblasts. In this study, we characterized the mode of action of ubiquinol10 which may abrogate the up-regulation of NEP by dermal fibroblasts, resulting in a reported in vivo anti-wrinkling action, and compared that with 3 other anti-oxidants, astaxanthin (AX), riboflavin (RF) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Post-irradiation treatment with all 4 of those anti-oxidants elicited an interrupting effect on the UVB-associated epithelial-mesenchymal cytokine interaction leading to the up-regulation of NEP in human fibroblasts but with different modes of action. While AX mainly served as an inhibitor of the secretion of wrinkle-inducing cytokines, such as interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulatory factor (GM-CSF) in UVB-exposed epidermal keratinocytes, ubiquinol10, RF and FMN predominantly interrupted the IL-1α and GM-CSF-stimulated expression of NEP in dermal fibroblasts. On the other hand, as for the UVA-associated mechanism, similar to the abrogating effects reported for AX and FMN, ubiquinol10 but not RF had the potential to abrogate the increased expression of NEP and matrix-metalloproteinase-1 in UVA-exposed human fibroblasts. Our findings strongly support the in vivo anti-wrinkling effects of ubiquinol10 and AX on human and animal skin and provide convincing proof of the UV-induced wrinkling mechanism that essentially focuses on the over-expression of NEP by dermal fibroblasts as an intrinsic causative factor."

Genes related to drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) influence drug bioavailability and treatment response. We have investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 29 ADME genes and intolerance to therapy in a case-control study including 764 individuals. Results showed that 15 SNPs were associated with intolerance to nucleoside and 11 to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), and 8 to protease inhibitors (PIs) containing regimens under alpha = 0.05. After Bonferroni adjustment, two associations remained statistically significant. SNP rs2712816, at SLCO2B1 was associated to intolerance to NRTIs (ORGA/AA = 2.37; p = 0.0001), while rs4148396, at ABCC2, conferred risk of intolerance to PIs containing regimens (ORCT/TT = 2.64; p = 0.00009). Accordingly, haplotypes carrying rs2712816A and rs4148396T alleles were also associated to risk of intolerance to NRTIs and PIs, respectively. Our data reinforce the role of drug transporters in response to HIV therapy and may contribute to a future development of personalized therapies."

The aim of the present study is to determine whether the choice of colour of overlays or PTLs is influenced by a patient's gender.Records of all patients attending a VS assessment in two optometry practices between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who reported a significant and consistent reduction in symptoms with either overlay and or PTL were included in the analysis. Overlays and PTLs were categorized as stereotypical male, female or neutral colours based on gender preferences as described in the literature. Chi-square analysis was carried out to determine whether gender (across all ages or within age groups) was associated with overlay or PTL colour choice.279 patients (133 males and 146 females, mean age 17 years) consistently showed a reduction in symptoms with an overlay and were included. Chi-square analysis revealed no significant association between the colour of overlay chosen and male or female gender (Chi-square 0.788, p = 0.674). 244 patients (120 males and 124 females, mean age 24.5 years) consistently showed a reduction in symptoms with PTLs and were included. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant association between stereotypical male/female/neutral colours of PTLs chosen and male/female gender (Chi-square 6.46, p = 0.040). More males preferred stereotypical male colour PTLs including blue and green while more females preferred stereotypical female colour PTLs including pink and purple.For some VS patients, the choice of PTL colour is influenced not only by the alleviation of symptoms but also by other non-visual factors such as gender."

Detected with ROS1 immunochemistry, 59 cases of 1165 patients had a certain degree of ROS1 expression. Among these cases, 19 cases (68%, 19/28) with 3+ and 8 cases (47%, 8/17) with 2+ staining were ROS1 rearrangement verified by real-time PCR and FISH. In the resected group, the acinar-predominant growth pattern was the most commonly observed (57%, 8/14), while in the biopsy group, solid patterns were the most frequently observed (78%, 7/13). Based on multiple logistic regression analysis, we determined that female sex, cribriform structure and the presence of psammoma body were the three most powerful indicators of ROS1 rearrangement, and we have developed a predictive model for the presence of ROS1 rearrangements in lung adenocarcinomas.Female, cribriform structure and presence of psammoma body were the three most powerful indicator of ROS1 rearrangement status, and predictive formula was helpful in screening ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, especially for ROS1 immunochemistry equivocal cases."
https://openalex.org/W2523144837,"This study continues to explore the plasticity of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) previously described in immune response during Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Here, we have shown that Ly6ChiTLR2hi monocytes were involved in TNF-α and IL-12 production, whereas Ly6CloTLR2hi monocytes were mainly committed to IL-10 and TNF-α production during T. cruzi infection independently of TLR agonist used (i.e. TLR2 or TLR9 agonists). Another difference between the monocyte populations is that the adapter Mal (encoded by TIRAP) has appeared crucial for the cytokine production by Ly6Clo but not by Ly6Chi monocytes. The protein Mal was necessary to induce cytokine synthesis by Ly6Clo monocytes after triggering TLR2 or TLR9. Finally, our data have suggested that TLR2, TLR9, and Mal/TIRAP controlled differentially the emergence of the different TLR2hi monocyte populations in the spleen. In summary, this study highlights the central role of the TLR2/Mal tandem in the distinct activity among the monocyte subsets during T. cruzi infection. Such findings provide a basis for understanding the challenge posed by the use of TLR2 agonist in immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2522039750,"Background Hypovascular nodules often occur together with hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it remains controversial whether hypovascular nodules associated with hypervascular HCC have any prognostic value. This study evaluated the prognostic impact of hypovascular nodules co-existing with hypervascular HCC as diagnosed by computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) and computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CTHA), which can sensitively capture the dynamic changes in blood flow through the portal vein and hepatic artery in patients with early stage HCC. Methods A total of 152 patients with hypervascular HCC (≤ 30 mm, ≤ 3 nodules), who underwent initial local ablation, were analyzed retrospectively. All patients received CTAP and CTHA prior to treatment. Overall survival (OS) was compared among group A (hypervascular HCC only, 107 patients) and group B (hypovascular nodules and hypervascular HCC, 45 patients). Results Among all hypovascular nodules, 81% (46 of 57) developed hypervascularization within the follow-up period. The 1- and 2-year hypervascularization rates were 17% and 51%, respectively. OS was significantly longer for group A than for group B (P < 0.001). A Cox proportional-hazards model identified the presence of hypovascular nodules concurrent with hypervascular HCC as an independent poor prognostic factor. Conclusion The prognosis of hypervascular HCC patients with hypovascular nodules detected during CTAP and CTHA is poor. Clinical HCC categories seem to be dissimilar between patients with and without hypovascular nodules."

The median time from initial operation to ILRR was 35.7 months (4.5-132.3 months). After diagnosis of ILRR, 45 (43%) patients were treated with mastectomy, 41 (39%) with excision of recurred lesion, and 18 (17%) with node dissection. During a median follow-up of 8.9 years, the 5-year overall survival was 77% and 5-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was 54%. On multivariate analysis, younger age (< 35 years), higher stage, early onset of elapse (≤ 24 months), lymph node recurrences, and subtype of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) were found to be independently associated with DMFS. Patients in the no chemotherapy group showed a longer DMFS after surgery for ILRR than those treated with chemotherapy (median 101.5 vs. 48.0 months, p = 0.072) but without statistical significance.Our analysis showed that younger age (< 35 years), higher stage, early onset of relapse (≤ 24 months), lymph node recurrence, and subtype of TNBC are the worst prognostic factors for ILRR."

Sensitivity was assessed by scoring the behavioural response of calves to stimulation of the wound or skin at time points before and after treatment. In Trial 1, DTAP calves had a greater probability of displaying more severe responses than DTAE calves at 90 and 180 min (P < 0.001). In Trial 2, at 1 h, DTAG calves had a greater probability of displaying more severe responses than CON calves. At 2 h onwards, all dehorned calves had a greater probability of displaying more severe responses than CON calves (P < 0.001). There were no differences between the responses of DCB, DTAG and DTAE calves at any time point. Topical anaesthetic formulations result in almost immediate but temporary anaesthesia of the wound following scoop dehorning in calves and may provide a practical option for pain relief on-farm."
https://openalex.org/W2523338220,"This research examines the evolution and phylogenetic distribution of a peculiar and often overlooked character seen in birds, herein called tracheal and esophageal displacement. Tracheal and esophageal displacement refers to an asymmetrically situated trachea and/or esophagus along the length of the neck. This contrasts with what would be perceived as the ""normal"" (midsagittal) placement of these organs, wherein the two organs are situated along the ventral midline of the neck with no deviation. A total of forty-two bird species were examined (thirty-six of which came from dissections whereas six came from comments from previous literature or personal observations), as well as turtles, lizards, crocodylians, and mammals. This study found that essentially all birds have a laterally displaced trachea and/or esophagus. Lizards and mammals were seen to have normal, midsagittally placed tracheae and esophagi. Crocodylians were interesting in that alligators were defined by a normally situated trachea and esophagus whereas some crocodiles were characterized by displacement. In birds, the displacement may occur gradually along the neck, or it may happen immediately upon exiting the oropharynx. Displacement of these organs in birds is the result of a heavily modified neck wherein muscles that restrict mobility of the trachea and esophagus in lizards, alligators, and mammals (e.g., m. episternocleidomastoideus, m. omohyoideus, and m. sternohyoideus) no longer substantially restrict positions of the trachea and esophagus in birds. Rather, these muscles are modified in ways which may assist with making tracheal movements. The implications of this study may provide interesting insights for future comparisons in extinct taxa."

Prior studies have implicated the cytokine IL-17A and Th17 cells in promoting the development of fibrosis. We hypothesized that loss of Th17 cells via CD4-specific deletion of mTORC1 activity would abrogate the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. However, in actuality loss of Th17 cells led to increased mortality and fibrosis in response to bleomycin. We found that in the absence of Th17 cells, there was continued production of IL-17A by γδ T cells. These IL-17A+ γδ T cells were associated with increased lung neutrophils and M2 macrophages, accelerated development of fibrosis, and increased mortality. These data elucidate the critical role of IL-17A+ γδ T cells in promoting chronic inflammation and fibrosis, and reveal a novel therapeutic target for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."

In addition, Vpr rescued virus-like particle (VLP) production in a similar manner as a lysosomal inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1 indicating that Vpr inhibits TSG101-induced Gag downregulation via lysosomal pathway. Vpr and Gag interaction is required to counteract TSG101 overexpression effect since Vpr A30F mutant which is unable to interact with Gag and incorporate into virions, reduced ability to prevent Gag accumulation and to rescue VLP production. In addition, GST pull-down assays and Biacore analysis revealed that Vpr competed with TSG101 for Gag binding. These results indicate that Vpr overcomes the effects of TSG101 overexpression to support viral production by competing with TSG101 to bind Gag."
https://openalex.org/W2521129526,"The dose of a real tumor target volume and surrounding organs at risk (OARs) under the effect of respiratory motion was calculated for a lung tumor plan, based on the target volume covering the whole tumor motion range for intensity modulated radiosurgery (IMRS). Two types of IMRS plans based on simulated respiratory motion were designed using humanoid and dynamic phantoms. Delivery quality assurance (DQA) was performed using ArcCHECK and MapCHECK2 for several moving conditions of the tumor and the real dose inside the humanoid phantom was evaluated using the 3DVH program. This evaluated dose in the tumor target and OAR using the 3DVH program was higher than the calculated dose in the plan, and a greater difference was seen for the RapidArc treatment than for the standard intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with fixed gantry angle beams. The results of this study show that for IMRS plans based on target volume, including the whole tumor motion range, tighter constraints of the OAR should be considered in the optimization process. The method devised in this study can be applied effectively to analyze the dose distribution in the real volume of tumor target and OARs in IMRT plans targeting the whole tumor motion range."

To date, the association between the number of stenotic intracranial arteries and stroke severity remains unclear.We aimed to investigate the association between the number of stenotic major intracranial arteries (NSMIA) and ischemic stroke severity, as well as the degree of stenosis and common stroke risk factors.We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with digital subtraction angiography (DSA)-confirmed ischemic stroke. Clinical stroke severity was measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The number of stenotic vessels was counted from the internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries, bilaterally.Eighty three patients were recruited from a single center and included in the study. NSMIA was significantly correlated with stroke severity (Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.485, P < 0.001), but not with the degree of stenosis (Pearson Correlation Coefficient = 0.01, P = 0.90). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that NSMIA was significantly associated with the NIHSS score after adjusting for stroke risk factors. The adjusted odds ratio (per lateral) was 2.092 (95% CI, 0.865 to 3.308, P = 0.001). The degree of stenosis was also significantly associated with the NIHSS score after adjusting for common risk factors. The odds ratio (per 10%) was 0.712 (95% CI, 0.202 to 1.223, P = 0.007).The number of stenotic intracranial major arteries is associated with the severity of ischemic stroke independent of the degree of stenosis and other stroke risk factors. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been previosuly studied in great detail using DSA. Our data highlight the importance of examining all major arteries in stroke patients."
