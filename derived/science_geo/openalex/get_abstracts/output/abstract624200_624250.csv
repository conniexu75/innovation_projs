https://openalex.org/W2904384071,"This paper presents standards and best practices for reporting genome sequences of uncultivated viruses. We present an extension of the Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) standard for reporting sequences of uncultivated virus genomes. Minimum Information about an Uncultivated Virus Genome (MIUViG) standards were developed within the Genomic Standards Consortium framework and include virus origin, genome quality, genome annotation, taxonomic classification, biogeographic distribution and in silico host prediction. Community-wide adoption of MIUViG standards, which complement the Minimum Information about a Single Amplified Genome (MISAG) and Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MIMAG) standards for uncultivated bacteria and archaea, will improve the reporting of uncultivated virus genomes in public databases. In turn, this should enable more robust comparative studies and a systematic exploration of the global virosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2904533595,"Understanding complex biological systems requires the system-wide characterization of both molecular and cellular features. Existing methods for spatial mapping of biomolecules in intact tissues suffer from information loss caused by degradation and tissue damage. We report a tissue transformation strategy named stabilization under harsh conditions via intramolecular epoxide linkages to prevent degradation (SHIELD), which uses a flexible polyepoxide to form controlled intra- and intermolecular cross-link with biomolecules. SHIELD preserves protein fluorescence and antigenicity, transcripts and tissue architecture under a wide range of harsh conditions. We applied SHIELD to interrogate system-level wiring, synaptic architecture, and molecular features of virally labeled neurons and their targets in mouse at single-cell resolution. We also demonstrated rapid three-dimensional phenotyping of core needle biopsies and human brain cells. SHIELD enables rapid, multiscale, integrated molecular phenotyping of both animal and clinical tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2904655759,"Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by hypomyelination and neuronal loss. To assess the basis for myelin loss in HD, we generated bipotential glial progenitor cells (GPCs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived from mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) embryos or normal controls and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to assess mHTT-dependent changes in gene expression. In human GPCs (hGPCs) derived from 3 mHTT hESC lines, transcription factors associated with glial differentiation and myelin synthesis were sharply downregulated relative to normal hESC GPCs; NKX2.2, OLIG2, SOX10, MYRF, and their downstream targets were all suppressed. Accordingly, when mHTT hGPCs were transplanted into hypomyelinated shiverer mice, the resultant glial chimeras were hypomyelinated; this defect could be rescued by forced expression of SOX10 and MYRF by mHTT hGPCs. The mHTT hGPCs also manifested impaired astrocytic differentiation and developed abnormal fiber architecture. White matter involution in HD is thus a product of the cell-autonomous, mHTT-dependent suppression of glial differentiation."

Peer-assisted learning may address this need, but few rigorous evaluations have been conducted in real-world settings. A pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial in 12 Ugandan districts provided facility-based, team training for prevention and management of postpartum hemorrhage and birth asphyxia at 125 facilities. Three approaches to facilitating simulation-based, peer assisted learning were compared. The primary outcome was the proportion of births with uterotonic given within one minute of birth. Outcomes were evaluated using observation of birth and supplemented by skills assessments and service delivery data. Individual and composite variables were compared across groups, using generalized linear models. Overall, 107, 195, and 199 providers were observed at three time points during 1,716 births across 44 facilities. Uterotonic coverage within one minute increased from: full group: 8% (CI 4%‒12%) to 50% (CI 42%‒59%); partial group: 19% (CI 9%‒30%) to 42% (CI 31%‒53%); and control group: 11% (5%‒7%) to 51% (40%‒61%). Observed care of mother and newborn improved in all groups. Simulated skills maintenance for postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis remained high across groups 7 to 8 months after the intervention. Simulated skills for newborn bag-and-mask ventilation remained high only in the full group. For all groups combined, incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and retained placenta declined 17% and 47%, respectively, from during the intervention period compared to the 6‒9 month period after the intervention. Fresh stillbirths and newborn deaths before discharge decreased by 34% and 62%, respectively, from baseline to after completion, and remained reduced 6‒9 months post-implementation. Significant improvements in uterotonic coverage remained across groups 6 months after the intervention. Findings suggest that while short, simulation-based training at the facility improves care and is feasible, more complex clinical skills used infrequently such as newborn resuscitation may require more practice to maintain skills. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03254628."
https://openalex.org/W2905446581,"Maternal prenatal symptoms of depression and anxiety have been suggested to impose differential effects on later offspring development, depending on their characteristics, such as timing, intensity and persistence. Paternal symptoms have been less investigated. While knowledge on these trajectory characteristics is essential for improved comprehension of prenatal stress, prospective studies including both expecting parents have been scarce. We aim at identifying and comparing the trajectories of prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms in both parents in a pregnancy cohort design. The sample included 3202 mothers and 2076 fathers who were recruited to the FinnBrain Birth Cohort study (www.finnbrain.fi). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and general anxiety by the anxiety scale of the Symptom Checklist -90 (SCL-90) repeatedly at 14, 24, and 34 gestational weeks. Five differential depressive and four anxiety symptom trajectories were identified across pregnancy both in mothers and in fathers. The trajectories of consistently low depressive or anxiety symptoms were associated with higher educational level in both parents, and with nulliparity and non-smoking during pregnancy in mothers. Parents with consistently high or increasing levels of symptoms had more often prenatal SSRI medication. The congruences between elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms at any point in pregnancy, as well as parental trajectories within families were low. However, in this population-based sample, the self-reported symptom levels of both parents were generally very low. Variance in timing and persistence of parent-reported prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms is potentially important, while symptom trajectories are very similar in mothers and fathers. These differential symptom trajectories and the significance of their correlates should be acknowledged when studying prenatal stress exposures and the related outcomes in children."
https://openalex.org/W2905346015,"Studies on the associations between phthalate exposures and respiratory outcomes are limited. We investigated the association of phthalates exposure with pulmonary function and airway inflammation in asthmatic children.Fifty-six children with asthma living in Seoul Metropolitan Area, Korea aged 6-16 years were enrolled. Their pulmonary function including forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured, and the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) as a marker of airway inflammation was examined repeatedly up to four times during the study period. Urinary levels of mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), metabolites for di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), a metabolite of di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), were also measured on the same days. The effects of phthalate metabolites on the respiratory symptoms were analyzed using linear mixed effect models with adjustment for potential cofounders.An increase in phthalate metabolites was associated with a decrease in pulmonary function and an increase in FeNO in asthmatic children. As one natural log-unit (ln-unit) levels of urinary MEHHP and MEOHP increased, FeNO levels on the same day increased by 19.47 ppb [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.28, 29.67] and 17.93 ppb (95% CI: 5.86, 30.01), respectively. An increases in the urinary level of MEHHP, MEOHP, and MnBP by one ln-unit was associated with a decrease in PEFR on the next day by 12.17 L/min (95% CI: 2.59, 21.74), 10.80 L/min (95% CI: 0.29, 21.32), and 13.65 L/min (95% CI: 5.07, 22.24), respectively.Phthalates, especially DEHP, may worsen pulmonary function and airway inflammation in asthmatic children. To control asthma symptoms, exposure to phthalates needs to be avoided."
https://openalex.org/W2952279304,"The age structure of a fish population has important implications for recruitment processes and population fluctuations, and is a key input to fisheries-assessment models. The current method of determining age structure relies on manually reading age from otoliths, and the process is labor intensive and dependent on specialist expertise. Recent advances in machine learning have provided methods that have been remarkably successful in a variety of settings, with potential to automate analysis that previously required manual curation. Machine learning models have previously been successfully applied to object recognition and similar image analysis tasks. Here we investigate whether deep learning models can also be used for estimating the age of otoliths from images. We adapt a pre-trained convolutional neural network designed for object recognition, to estimate the age of fish from otolith images. The model is trained and validated on a large collection of images of Greenland halibut otoliths. We show that the model works well, and that its precision is comparable to documented precision obtained by human experts. Automating this analysis may help to improve consistency, lower cost, and increase the extent of age estimation. Given that adequate data are available, this method could also be used to estimate age of other species using images of otoliths or fish scales."
https://openalex.org/W2904396406,"Background Accurate classification of patients with inflammatory bowel disease into the subtypes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) is still a challenge, but important for therapy and prognosis. Objectives To evaluate the diagnostic utility of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies specific for proteinase-3 (PR3-ANCA) for ulcerative colitis (UC) and the value of an antibody panel incorporating PR3-ANCA to differentiate between Crohn’s disease (CD) and UC. Study design In this cohort study, 122 pediatric and adolescent individuals were retrospectively included (61 IBD patients of two clinical centers, 61 non-IBD controls). All subjects had a comprehensive antibody profile done from stored sera taken close to time of diagnosis. By employing quasi-exhaustive logistic regression the best discriminative model for UC and CD,subjects was determined in a training cohort and confirmed in a validation cohort. Results PR3-ANCA was specifically associated with UC (odds ratio (OR), 17.6; 95% confidence interval (CI); 3.6, 87); P < .001). A four antibody-panel including PR3-ANCA had an AUC of 90.81% (95%CI; 81.93, 99.69) to distinguish between UC and CD in the training cohort. In a smaller external validation cohort, the AUC was 84.13% (95%CI; 64.21, 100) for accurate diagnosis of CD and UC. Conclusion PR3-ANCA is highly specific for UC. The differentiating capability of a panel, which contains PR3-ANCA and weighs broadly available antibodies, is superior and utilization of the panel can support accurate classification in the work-up of pediatric and adolescent patients with IBD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2904723869,"Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are >200 nucleotides long non-coding RNAs, which have been shown to be implicated in carcinogenic processes by interacting with cancer associated genes or other non-coding RNAs. However, their role in development of rare gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is barely investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to define lincRNAs deregulated in GIST and find new GIST-lincRNA associations. Next-generation sequencing data of paired GIST and adjacent tissue samples from 15 patients were subjected to a web-based lincRNA analysis. Three deregulated lincRNAs (MALAT1, H19 and FENDRR; adjusted p-value < 0.05) were selected for expression validation in a larger group of patients (n = 22) by RT-qPCR method. However, only H19 and FENDRR showed significant upregulation in the validation cohort (adjusted p < 0.05). Further, we performed correlation analyses between expression levels of deregulated lincRNAs and GIST-associated oncogenes or GIST deregulated microRNAs. We found high positive correlations between expression of H19 and known GIST related oncogene ETV1, and between H19 and miR-455-3p. These findings expand the knowledge on lincRNAs deregulated in GIST and may be an important resource for the future studies investigating lincRNAs functionally relevant to GIST carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2903974319,"C1q complement/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)—related protein (CTRP) family comprises of 15 proteins that posses important implications in energy homeostasis, infection and inflammation. However, their roles in diabetes mellitus (DM) and its vascular complications have not been completely assessed. This works aims to study the association of two CTRPs; 3 and 9, with pro-inflammatory cytokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and biochemical parameters of type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease (CAD).Methods: Biochemical markers and serum levels of CTRPs and MCP-1 were measured in 86 postmenopausal females. Subjects were divided over four groups; 13 apparent healthy subjects as control (group I), 29 patients with CAD (group II), 29 patients with T2D ≥5 years (group III) and 15 patients with CAD secondary to T2D (group IV). Serum CTRP3, CTRP9, MCP-1 and insulin were measured by ELISA.Results: Serum CTRP3 levels were found to be significantly higher in group III and IV, whereas, it was significantly lower in group II on comparing to group I. While, CTRP9 levels were significantly decreased in group II, III and IV on comparing to group I. MCP-1 levels were found to be significantly increased in groups II, III and IV on comparison with group I. Both CTRPs were significantly negatively correlated with each other. While MCP-1 was significantly correlated negatively to CTRP9.Conclusion: This study associates the possible role of CTRP3, CTRP9 and MCP-1/CCL2 in the diagnosis/prognosis of CAD complication in T2D postmenopausal females."
https://openalex.org/W2904368076,"Aims To apply methods for measuring the affordability of beer in a large cross section of countries, and to investigate trends in affordability of beer over time. Methods We use the Relative Income Price (RIP), which uses per capita GDP, to measure the affordability of beer in up to 92 countries from 1990 to 2016 (69 countries were included in 1990, however the survey has since grown to include 92 countries). In addition to affordability, we also investigate trends in the price of beer. Results While beer is, on average, similarly priced in high-income (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), it is significantly more affordable in HICs. There is significant variation in both price and affordability in HICs and in LMICs. Beer has become cheaper in real terms in 49% (18/37) of HICs and 43% (20/46) of LMICs. Beer became more affordable in most HICs (RIP: 30/37 or 81%) and LMICs (RIP: 42/44 or 95%) Conclusions The increased affordability over time of beer in most countries raises concerns about public health. Governments need to increase taxes on beer so that it becomes less affordable over time, in an effort to improve public health."
https://openalex.org/W2904291965,"Increasing the level of birth preparedness and complication readiness (BP/CR) is one of the key interventions to promote optimal utilization of skilled maternal health services. It is therefore essential to determine the women's ability to recognize the danger signs and the level of BP/CR. This information can be used to design more effective health interventions.This study was conducted to determine the knowledge in recognition of maternal complications, and the level and factors associated with BP/CR in rural Matlab, Bangladesh.A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from June- October 2015 on a randomly selected 2262 women who delivered live or stillbirth during the year 2014. A pretested and structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were used.The proportion of study participants with ""good knowledge"", measured by the ability to recognise three or more danger signs, in pregnancy and delivery were 26% and 23%, respectively. Out of four BP/CR components, about 15% women saved money, 12% women identified facility for delivery, 9.6% women planned to deliver by skilled birth attendant and 5.3% of women arranged transport. About 12% of women were ""well prepared"", measured by planning of at least two components, for skilled childbirth and emergency obstetric complications. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, asset index, antenatal care (ANC) visits and knowledge of danger signs during pregnancy and delivery were associated with BP/CR. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of ""well prepared"" was 4.09 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.45-6.82) among women with an asset index of five (richest), compared with women in the asset index of one (poorest). The odds of ""well prepared"" was six times (OR 5.98, 95% CI: 3.85-9.28) higher for women with four or more ANC visits, compared to women with none or one ANC visit. In comparison to women with ""poor knowledge"" on maternal danger signs during pregnancy and delivery, the odds ratio of ""well prepared"" among women with good knowledge during pregnancy and in delivery were 1.95 (95% CI: 1.44-2.63) and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.28-2.36), respectively.The study revealed a low level of maternal knowledge of danger signs and BP/CR among pregnant women. Further, low socioeconomic status, fewer ANC visits and poor knowledge in recognition of dangers signs on maternal health were associated with low BP/CR. More emphasis should be placed on the quality of information offered to the pregnant women during the prenatal contact and women from low socio-economic gradient should be prioritized to optimize the impact of future BP/CR interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2904676715,"Spot blotch (SB) caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana, is one of the most important diseases of wheat in the eastern part of south Asia causing considerable yield loss to the wheat crop. There is an urgent need to identify genetic loci closely associated with resistance to this pathogen for developing resistant cultivars. Hence, genomic regions responsible for SB resistance were searched using a wheat association mapping initiative (WAMI) panel involving 287 spring wheat genotypes of different origin. Genome-wide association mapping (GWAM) was performed using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from a custom 90 K wheat SNP array. A mixed linear model (MLM) was used for assessing the association of SNP markers with spot blotch resistance in three consecutive years. Three traits were measured: incubation period, lesion number and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Significant SNP markers were found linked to five, six and four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for incubation period, lesion number and AUDPC respectively. They were detected on 11 different chromosomes: 1A, 1B, 1D, 4A, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B, 6D, 7A, 7B with marker R2 range of 0.083 to 0.11. The greatest number of significant SNP-markers was found for lesion number and AUDPC on chromosome 6B and 5B, respectively, representing a better coverage of B-genome by SNPs. On the other hand, the most significant and largest SNP markers for incubation period were detected on 6A and 4A chromosomes indicating that this trait is associated with the A-genome of wheat. Although, QTLs for spot blotch resistance have been reported in wheat on these same chromosomes, the association of incubation period and lesion number with SB resistance has not been reported in previous studies. The panel exhibits considerable variation for SB resistance and also provides a good scope of marker-assisted selection using the identified SNP markers linked to resistant QTLs."
https://openalex.org/W2905255665,"With the HIV-1 epidemic in southern Africa still rising, a prophylactic vaccine against the region’s most prolific subtype (subtype C) would be a significant step forward. In this paper we report on the effect of 2 different adjuvants, AddaVax and AlhydroGel, formulated with HIV-1 subtype C gp140, on the development of binding and neutralising antibody titres in rabbits. AddaVax is a squalene-based oil-in-water nano-emulsion (similar to MF59) which can enhance both cellular and humoral immune responses, whilst AlhydroGel (aluminium hydroxide gel) mainly drives a Th2 response. The gp140 gene tested was derived from the superinfecting virus (SU) from participant CAP256 in the CAPRISA 002 Acute infection cohort. The furin cleavage site of the Env protein was replaced with a flexible linker and an I559P mutation introduced. Lectin affinity purified soluble Env protein was mainly trimeric as judged by molecular weight using BN-PAGE and contained intact broadly neutralising epitopes for the V3-glycan supersite (monoclonal antibodies PGT128 and PGT135), the CD4 binding site (VRC01) and the V2-glycan (PG9) but not for the trimer-specific monoclonal antibodies PG16, PGT145 and CAP256-VRC26_08. When this soluble Env protein was tested in rabbits, AlhydroGel significantly enhanced soluble Env and V1V2 binding antibodies when compared to AddaVax. Finally, AlhydroGel resulted in significantly higher neutralization titres for a subtype C Tier 1A virus (MW965.26) and increased neutralization breadth to Tier 1A and 1B viruses. However, no autologous Tier 2 neutralisation was observed. These data suggest that adjuvant selection is critical for developing a successful vaccine and AlhydroGel should be further investigated. Additional purification of trimeric native-like CAP256 Env and/or priming with DNA or MVA might enhance the induction of neutralizing antibodies and possible Tier 2 HIV-1 neutralisation."
https://openalex.org/W4234582559,"It is well established that repeated social defeat stress can induce negative long-term consequences such as increased anxiety-like behavior and enhances the reinforcing effect of psychostimulants in rodents. In the current study, we evaluated how the immune system may play a role in these long-term effects of stress. A total of 148 OF1 mice were divided into different experimental groups according to stress condition (exploration or social defeat) and pre-treatment (saline, 5 or 10 mg/kg of the anti-inflammatory indomethacin) before each social defeat or exploration episode. Three weeks after the last social defeat, anxiety was evaluated using an elevated plus maze paradigm. After this test, conditioned place preference (CPP) was induced by a subthreshold dose of cocaine (1 mg/kg). Biological samples were taken four hours after the first and the fourth social defeat, 3 weeks after the last defeat episode, and after the CPP procedure. Plasma and brain tissue (prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus) were used to determine the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). Results showed an increase of peripheral and brain IL-6 levels after the first and fourth social defeat that was reverted three weeks later. Intraperitoneal administration of the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin before each episode of stress prevented this enhancement of IL-6 levels and also reversed the increase in the rewarding effects of cocaine in defeated mice. Conversely, this protective effect was not observed with respect to the anxiogenic consequences of social stress. Our results confirm the hypothesis of a modulatory proinflammatory contribution to stress-induced vulnerability to drug abuse disorders and highlight anti-inflammatory interventions as a potential therapeutic tool to treat stress-related addiction disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2904476508,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a key gasotransmitter in agriculture and has been reported to increase the growth of plants in the first two weeks and to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. GYY-4137 is widely used in these studies because it slowly releases H2S, but there is disagreement as to whether it requires enzymes to release H2S. In this article we describe the release of H2S in water without enzymes and that it releases H2S faster in organic solvents than in water or when mixed in topsoil. Furthermore, we describe the long-term effect of dosing pea, radish, and lettuce plants with GYY-4137 for up to six weeks. The effect of GYY-4137 on plant growth for six weeks was either positive or negative depending on the loading of GYY-4137 and how it was applied to plants. The addition of GYY-4137 to lettuce plants via potting mix resulted in reduced growth and death of the plants. In contrast, application of GYY-4137 to the leaves of lettuce plants increased the harvest weight of the leaves by up to 86%. Our results demonstrate that GYY-4137 can have a positive, important effect on the growth of plants but that this effect is dependent on several factors."
https://openalex.org/W2905447817,"The epidemiology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) is not fully understood. In this study, we assessed putative risk factors for HEV seropositivity in various study populations in the Netherlands.Data and samples from five different study populations were analysed: (A) blood donors (n = 5,239), (B) adults reporting a vegetarian life style since the age of 12 years (n = 231), (C) residents of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with different ethnic backgrounds (n = 1,198), (D) men who have sex with men (MSM) (HIV positive and HIV negative) (n = 197), and (E) persons who use drugs (PWUD) (HIV positive and HIV negative) (n = 200). Anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing was performed using ELISA test (Wantai).HEV IgM seroprevalence was low across all study populations (<1% to 8%). The age and gender-adjusted HEV IgG seroprevalence was 24% among blood donors (reference group) and 9% among the vegetarian group (adjusted Relative Risk [aRR]:0.36, 95%CI:0.23-0.57). Among participants of different ethnic backgrounds, the adjusted HEV IgG seroprevalence was 16% among participants with a Dutch origin (aRR:0.64, 95%CI:0.40-1.02), 2% among South-Asian Surinamese (aRR:0.07, 95%CI:0.02-0.29), 3% among African Surinamese (aRR:0.11, 95%CI:0.04-0.34), 34% among Ghanaian (aRR:1.53, 95%CI:1.15-2.03), 19% among Moroccan (aRR:0.75, 95%CI:0.49-1.14), and 5% among Turkish (aRR:0.18, 95%CI:0.08-0.44) origin participants. First generation Moroccans had a higher risk for being IgG HEV seropositive compared to second generation Moroccan migrants. The statistical power to perform these analyses in the other ethnic groups was too low. In the MSM group the IgG HEV seroprevalence was 24% (aRR:0.99, 95%CI:0.76-1.29), and among PWUD it was 28% (aRR:1.19, 95%CI:0.90-1.58). The number of sexual partners in the preceding six months was not significantly associated with IgG HEV seropositivity in MSM. The association between HIV status and HEV seropositivity was significant in PWUD, yet absent in MSM. HIV viral load and CD4 cell count were not associated with HEV seropositivity in HIV positive MSM and PWUD.Vegetarians were significantly less often HEV seropositive. Ethnic origin influenced the risk for being IgG HEV seropositive. MSM and PWUD were not at higher risk for being IgG HEV seropositive than blood donors."
https://openalex.org/W2904890572,We investigated the efficacy of graph-theoretic metrics of task-related functional brain connectivity in predicting reading difficulty and explored the hypothesis that task conditions emphasizing audiovisual integration would be especially diagnostic of reading difficulty. An fMRI study was conducted in which 24 children (8 to 14 years old) who were previously diagnosed with dyslexia completed a rhyming judgment task under three presentation modality conditions. Regression analyses found that characteristic connectivity metrics of the reading network showed a presentation modality dependent relationship with reading difficulty: Children with more segregated reading networks and those that used fewer of the available connections were those with the least severe reading difficulty. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a lack of coordinated processing between the neural regions involved in phonological and orthographic processing contributes towards reading difficulty.
https://openalex.org/W2905266032,"The aim of this study was to clarify how positive and negative emotions are related to the common attitude-change effect in cognitive dissonance research. Drawing on appraisal theories of emotion, and emotion-regulation research, we predicted that negative emotions would be inversely related to attitude change, whereas positive emotions would be positively related to attitude change in the induced compliance paradigm. In two studies, participants (N = 44; N = 106) wrote a counter-attitudinal essay under the perception of high choice, and were later asked to state their emotions in relation to writing this essay, as well as to state their attitude. Results confirmed the predictions, even when controlling for baseline emotions. These findings untangled a previously unresolved issue in dissonance research, which in turn shows how important emotion theories are for the understanding of cognitive dissonance processes."
https://openalex.org/W2905501589,"The aims of this study were: i) to examine if Dual Career (DC) pathways are independent of gender, ii) to evaluate whether those athletes who followed a DC experienced less difficulty in their integration into the labor force than the athletes devoted entirely to sport regardless of gender, as well as iii) to analyze whether the type of career path chosen was related with the current labor status, and if differences exist between men and women athletes. A quantitative, cross-sectional, and descriptive study was used based on an ad hoc questionnaire. Two-hundred and twenty-eight retired Olympic athletes completed a questionnaire. The response rate was 28.3%. Athletes who followed a DC with studies had a higher educational level at retirement than those devoted solely to sport and those who followed a DC with work, (χ2(6) = 38.76; P < .001), but no differences were found between men and women (χ2(3) = 3.23; P = .358). Athletes who followed a DC path (with studies or with work) perceived the transition out of sport more positively than those who focused solely on sport (χ2(2) = 7.79; P = .020). Regarding the type of job, more women attained a part-time job (20.9%) than men (3.1%; χ2(5) = 21.83; P = .001). The athletes who followed a DC with studies achieved higher monthly incomes than the other two groups (χ2(2) = 9.08; P = .011). Men athletes achieved higher incomes than women (Z = 5.45; P < .001), but the gender wage gap was apparent for those Olympian athletes considered as the qualified group, probably due to a higher presence of part-time women workers. The findings of this study suggest that future professional opportunities and the transition to the labor market could be made easier by following a DC during the mastery stage. Regardless of career path, women experienced more difficulties in their integration into the job market and there is a wage penalty for highly-qualified women."

Fluorescence spectra from all samples have been acquired by using excitation wavelengths from 280 to 420 nm with step of 10 nm to investigate their valuable ingredients. The emission bands at 375, 525 and 673 nm that represent vitamin E/beta-carotene and chlorophyll, are present only in canola oil samples extracted by chemical and cold press methods and absolutely absent from all commercial brands. The emission band at 440 nm appearing only in the commercial oil brands, is assigned to oxidized products of isomers of vitamin E and fatty acids.

https://openalex.org/W2904125788,"Two influential theories relating to personality traits, i.e. arousal-based theory (ABT) and attentional control theory (ACT), made predictions on how neuroticism may affect task performance. ABT suggested that high neurotics perform worse than low neurotics in all difficult tasks, whereas they perform similar in easy tasks. On the other hand, ACT suggested that high neurotics perform worse than low neurotics only if the task relies on central executive functions of working memory (WM), such as switching or inhibition. However, currently it is still unclear whether neuroticism affects all difficult tasks, as proposed by ABT, or whether it is specific to certain tasks, as proposed by ACT. To test this, we used the Cambridge Neuropsychological Tasks Automated Battery (CANTAB) as our test tool and we selected three working memory tasks which tested the effect of neuroticism on both the central executive system (CES) and the WM storage system (i.e. visuospatial sketchpad) in 21 low and 24 high neurotics. Results showed that high neurotics, as compared to low neurotics, exhibited lower performance only when the working memory task is specifically associated with switching and/or inhibition, but not in a task which is associated with the visuospatial sketchpad. We conclude that the results support the ACT rather than the ABT, because high levels of neuroticism impaired behavioural performance specifically in demanding tasks associated with switching and inhibition, but not in tasks associated with the visuospatial sketchpad."
https://openalex.org/W2904627714,"Background Risk stratification of endometrial carcinomas is primarily based on surgical staging that requires extensive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. One of the most powerful predictor of lymph node involvement is the lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI). The objective of this study was to determine the potential of L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM) to predict LVSI and its association with other risk factors in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas. Materials and methods We studied 47 consecutive patients aged 37–88 (61.34±10.52). Twenty-three patients (48.9%) were submitted to complete surgical staging. Nine patients (19.1%) underwent surgical staging without para-aortic dissection. Seven (14.9%) were submitted to hysterectomy with no lymph node dissection. Eight patients (17.0%) only had the biopsy material for analysis. The 32 patients submitted to lymphadenectomy were staged according to the FIGO system and classified among the risk categories of the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO guidelines. The following histological characteristics were analyzed: tumor size (mm), depth of myometrial infiltration, presence of microcystic, elongated, and fragmented (MELF) pattern of myoinvasion, and lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI). Immunohistochemical analyses of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, p53, and L1CAM were performed in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded whole tumor tissue sections. Results LVSI was identified in 26/41 (63,4%) of the cases. L1CAM was positive in 8/47 (17%) cases, all of them positive for LVSI and within the high-risk category of ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO. L1CAM-positive cases were associated with high histological grade and p53 aberrant immunohistochemical profile. Besides, it showed a trend to larger tumors, greater depth of myometrial infiltration, and with a higher frequency of the MELF pattern of myoinvasion. LVSI was also associated with FIGO stage, tumor size, depth of myometrial infiltration, and tumor grade. Conclusions L1CAM is highly associated with LVSI and could be used as a pre-operative predictor of lymph node involvement in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2904104590,"Osteoclasts derived from hematopoietic cells are activated on bone surface. To resorb bone, osteoclasts release acid and lysosome acid hydrolase via membrane transport. Prostate transmembrane protein androgen induced 1 (Pmepa1) is a type I transmembrane protein that regulates proliferation, migration, and metastasis of cancer cells. Because recent reports showed that Pmepa1 is involved in membrane transport in cancer cells, we investigated the role of Pmepa1 in osteoclast function. Pmepa1 expression was barely detected in osteoclasts formed on plastic surfaces in vitro, but was markedly increased in activated osteoclasts formed on calcified matrix. Inhibitors of bone resorption, such as alendronate, bafilomycin A1, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, suppressed the expression of Pmepa1 in osteoclasts. Knockdown of Pmepa1 expression impaired bone resorption activity and inhibited formation of a ring-like, actin-rich podosome belt that is essential for osteoclast function. Pmepa1 protein localized to lysosomes in osteoclasts. In addition, in sites of bone destruction observed in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis, a marked high level of Pmepa1 expression was associated with the osteoclasts' resorbing bone. Our results suggest that Pmepa1 is a critical regulator of bone resorption and is a promising marker for activated osteoclasts and a potential therapeutic target in pathologic bone destruction.—Xu, X., Hirata, H., Shiraki, M., Kamohara, A., Nishioka, K., Miyamoto, H., Kukita, T., Kukita, A.

We aimed to investigate differences in proteins associated with HF hospitalizations among patients with and without CKD in the Heart and Soul Study.We measured 1068 unique plasma proteins from baseline samples of 974 participants in The Heart and Soul Study who were followed for HF hospitalization over a median of 7 years. We sequentially applied forest regression and Cox survival analyses to select prognostic proteins. Among participants with CKD, four proteins were associated with HF at Bonferroni-level significance (p<2.5x10(-4)): Angiopoietin-2 (HR[95%CI] 1.45[1.33, 1.59]), Spondin-1 (HR[95%CI] 1.13 [1.06, 1.20]), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (HR[95%CI] 0.65[0.53, 0.78]) and neurogenis locus notch homolog protein 1 (NOTCH1) (HR[95%CI] 0.67[0.55, 0.80]). These associations persisted at p<0.01 after adjustment for age, estimated glomerular filtration and history of HF. CKD was a significant interaction term in the associations of NOTCH1 and Spondin-1 with HF. Pathway analysis showed a trend for higher representation of the Cardiac Hypertrophy and Complement/Coagulation pathways among proteins prognostic of HF in the CKD sub-group.These results suggest that markers of heart failure differ between patients with and without CKD. Further research is needed to validate novel markers in cohorts of patients with CKD and adjudicated HF events."
https://openalex.org/W2904492878,"Insects represent one of the most abundant groups of herbivores, and many of them have significant impacts on the dynamics of plant populations. As insects are very sensitive to changes in climatic conditions, we hypothesize that their effects on plant population dynamics will depend on climatic conditions. Knowledge of the variation in herbivore effects on plant population dynamics is, however, still rather sparse. We studied population dynamics and herbivore damage at the individual plant level of Salvia nubicola along a wide altitudinal gradient representing a range of climatic conditions. Using integral projection models, we estimated the effect of changes in herbivore pressure on plant populations in different climates and habitat types. Since we recorded large differences in the extent of herbivore damage along the altitudinal gradient, we expected that the performance of plants from different altitudes would be affected to different degrees by herbivores. Indeed, we found that populations from low altitudes were better able to withstand increased herbivore damage, while populations from high altitudes were suppressed by herbivores. However, the pattern described above was evident only in populations from open habitats. In forest habitats, the differences in population dynamics between low and high altitudes were largely diminished. The effects of herbivores on plants from different altitudes were thus largely habitat specific. Our results indicate potential problems for plant populations from high altitudes in open habitats because of increased herbivore damage. However, forest habitats may provide refuges for the plants at these high altitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2904575409,"Tall wheatgrass [Elymus elongatus subsp. ponticus (Podp.) Melderis] is a perennial forage grass cultivated in dry, saline or alkaline environments. The morpho-physiological characteristics of four populations of tall wheatgrass from different climatic-edaphic origins were evaluated under three conditions of water stress (100%-50%-30% of field capacity). The trial was analyzed with three replicates and two-factor ANOVA in pots within the greenhouse during 35 days. Only dry matter and tiller number showed interaction between populations and water conditions. The most relevant changes in morpho-physiological parameters under strong water stress were reduced dry matter production (48–32% differing among populations), smaller leaf and tiller size (46% and 28%), together with higher water use efficiency (74%), and increased proline and protein contents (144% and 71%), smaller tiller number (30–11% differing among populations) and a slight decrease in leaf water content (3%). The populations differed in growth strategies and morpho-physiological mechanisms to survive water stress, which could be related to their habitat background. The study shows the stability in dry matter production under all levels of water stress, which can be related to the higher tiller number. Due to this plasticity, tall wheatgrass should be studied as a species with great potential to adapt to drought stress."
https://openalex.org/W2904017418,"There is evidence from longitudinal studies that being light at birth and weaning is associated with subsequent rapid weight gain in infants. This is referred to as “centile crossing”, which can lead to increased risk of lifetime obesity, glucose dysregulation and type 2 diabetes. Here, pregnant CD-1 mice were hemi-ovariectomized so that the entire litter was contained in one uterine horn to increase variability in fetal growth rate. Pregnant females were implanted on gestation day (GD) 9 with a Silastic capsule containing 6, 60 or 600 μg bisphenol A (BPA). On GD 18 the mean fetal serum unconjugated BPA concentrations were 17, 177 and 1858 pg/ml, respectively. Capsules were not removed, to avoid maternal stress, and were predicted to release BPA for at least 3 weeks. Body weight at weaning was strongly negatively correlated with post-weaning weight gain in both control and BPA-treated male mice, consistent with human data; female offspring were excluded, avoiding complications associated with postpubertal estrogens. Within each treatment group, male offspring were sorted into tertiles based on relative weight gain during the two weeks after weaning, designated as having Rapid (R), Medium (M) or Slow (S) growth rate. BPA exposure was associated with altered growth rate between weaning and postnatal week 12 (young adulthood), when a low-dose (20 mg/kg, i.p.) glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed. We found altered glucose regulation in response to all doses of BPA. However, glucose tolerance was only significantly impaired (blood glucose levels were elevated) compared to controls in males in the rapid post-weaning growth group exposed perinatally to BPA. We conclude that male mice that are light at weaning, but then experience rapid catch-up growth immediately after weaning, represent a sensitive sub-population that is vulnerable to the metabolic disrupting effects of very low pg/ml fetal serum concentrations of BPA."

The purpose of this research was to: 1) describe factors associated with disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners; and 2) determine if disclosure and/or receipt of prevention counseling are independently associated with condomless sex. We used the Florida Medical Monitoring Project to analyze data from 376 HIV positive men with more than one sexual partner. Results indicated that 55% consistently disclosed their HIV status to sexual partners, 30% inconsistently disclosed, 15% did not disclose, and 48% reported any condomless sex. The odds of having condomless sex was 3.3 (CI = 1.5, 7.3) times greater in men who disclosed to all partners. Results suggest that men who disclose are also those who are more likely to have condomless sex. More research is needed to better understand the complex nature of disclosure and sexual risk behaviors and how disclosure impacts sexual risk."

Early engagement with health systems in chronic lung disease management is critical to maintain quality of life and prevent further damage. Our study sought to understand health seeking behaviour in relation to chronic lung disease and TB in a rural district in Malawi. Methods Qualitative data was collected between March-May 2015, exploring patterns of health seeking for lung disease amongst residents of two districts in rural Malawi. Participants included those with and without lung disease, health workers and village leaders. Participants with a history of TB were included in the sample due to similarities in clinical presentation and in view of potential to cause long-term damage to lung tissue. Results Our findings are ordered around a specific model of health seeking devised by adapting previous models. The model and findings span three broad areas that were found to influence health seeking: understandings of health and disease which shaped whether, when and where to seek care; the care seeking decision which was influenced by social and structural factors; and the care seeking experience which impacted future care decisions creating ‘feedback loops’. Discussion Efforts to improve effective and accessible healthcare provision for chronic lung disease need to address all the determinants of health seeking behaviour identified. This may include: enhancing the structural and financial accessibility of health services, through the strengthening of community linkages; improving communication between formal health providers, patients and communities around symptoms, diagnosis and management of chronic lung diseases; and improving the quality of diagnostic and management services through the strengthening of health systems ‘hardware’ (equipment availability) and ‘software’ (development of trusting and respectful relationships between providers and patients)."
https://openalex.org/W2903915080,"The most important source of energy to tropical shallow water coral reefs is light, the transformation of which ultimately limits reef biomass and growth. Therefore, measurements of productivity (primary production, P) for benthic reef organisms and communities are critical to understand reef functioning. Short-term (minutes to hours) P measurements of reef photosynthesizers virtually always produce the classic hyperbolic tangent (or similar) P-E (irradiance) relationship, with P rapidly rising to a saturation point as E increases. Longer-term (days to weeks), larger-scale investigations of natural reef communities typically do not explore P-E relationships, but the few that do show no saturation of time-integrated P with high time-integrated E. In this paper we present a modeling study to reconcile this apparent contradiction. We used 52 published short-term (instantaneous) P-E curves of organisms (corals, algae) and communities (corals, mixed corals and algae) from different reefs in the Indo-Pacific and the Caribbean, each coupled with 928 diel light curves comprising a wide range of cloud cover scenarios. The diel light curves provided instantaneous E at 1-minute intervals, from which we calculated corresponding instantaneous P using the different published P-E relationships. We integrated both variables to calculate time-integrated E and P. Time-integrated E varied up to 18-fold due to changes in cloud cover and season. We found that, despite routine saturation of instantaneous P, day-scale P-E relationships were near linear in all cases, with slightly decreased linearity in cases where instantaneous light saturation occurred very early during the day. This indicates that the Functional Convergence Hypothesis (FCH) developed by terrestrial ecologists may also apply for reef photosynthesizers. The FCH states that despite short-term light saturation, plants on average do not absorb more light than they can use, since resource allocations are strictly coordinated and tailored towards an optimal use. Thus, there is no contradiction: At the growth time scale (≥ day), P should be expected to be a near linear function of E. One implication is that reef P can be estimated using rapid optical measurements, as opposed to traditional, laborious respirometry methods. The requirement going forward is to derive appropriate values for light-use efficiency, which is the rate at which the plant or community converts absorbed light into fixed carbon."

https://openalex.org/W2905139038,"Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF) is heterotopic ossification of spinal ligaments, which may cause serious thoracic spinal canal stenosis and myelopathy. However, the underlying etiology remains inadequately understood. In this study, the ossification patterns of TOLF were analyzed by micro-computer tomography (micro-CT). The expression profile of genes associated with angiogenesis was analyzed in thoracic ligamentum flavum cells at sites of different patterns of ossification using RNA sequencing. Significant differences in the expression profile of several genes were identified from Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) was significantly up-regulated in primary thoracic ligamentum flavum cells during osteogenic differentiation. To address the effect of ANGPT2 on Notch signaling and osteogenesis, ANGPT2 stimulation increased the expression of Notch2 and osteogenic markers of primary thoracic ligamentum flavum cells of immature ossification, while inhibition of ANGPT2 exhibited opposite effect on Notch pathway and osteogenesis of cells of mature ossification. These findings provide the first evidence for positive regulation of ANGPT2 on osteogenic differentiation in human thoracic ligamentum flavum cells via modulating the Notch signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2905293944,"Aims/Hypothesis GPR44 (DP2, PTGDR2, CRTh2) is the receptor for the pro-inflammatory mediator prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and it is enriched in human islets. In rodent islets, PGD2 is produced in response to glucose, suggesting that the PGD2-GPR44/DP2 axis may play a role in human islet function during hyperglycemia. Consequently, the aim of this work was to elucidate the insulinotropic role of GPR44 antagonism in vitro in human beta-cells and in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. Methods We determined the drive on PGD2 secretion by glucose and IL-1beta, as well as, the impact on insulin secretion by pharmacological GPR44/DP2 antagonism (AZD1981) in human islets and beta-cells in vitro. To test if metabolic control would be improved by antagonizing a hyperglycemia-driven increased PGD2 tone, we performed a proof-of-mechanism study in 20 T2DM patients (average 54 years, HbA1c 9.4%, BMI 31.6 kg/m2). The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study consisted of two three-day treatment periods (AZD1981 or placebo) separated by a three-day wash-out period. Mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) and intravenous graded glucose infusion (GGI) was performed at start and end of each treatment period. Assessment of AZD1981 pharmacokinetics, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and PGD2 pathway biomarkers were performed. Results We found (1) that PGD2 is produced in human islet in response to high glucose or IL-1beta, but likely by stellate cells rather than endocrine cells; (2) that PGD2 suppresses both glucose and GLP-1 induced insulin secretion in vitro; and (3) that the GPR44/DP2 antagonist (AZD1981) in human beta-cells normalizes insulin secretion. However, AZD1981 had no impact on neither glucose nor incretin dependent insulin secretion in humans (GGI AUC C-peptide 1-2h and MMTT AUC Glucose 0-4h LS mean ratios vs placebo of 0.94 (80% CI of 0.90–0.98, p = 0.12) and 0.99 (90% CI of 0.94–1.05, p = 0.45), despite reaching the expected antagonist exposure. Conclusion/Interpretation Pharmacological inhibition of the PGD2-GPR44/DP2 axis has no major impact on the modulation of acute insulin secretion in T2DM patients.

However, metal-specific immune responses in the oral mucosa have not been elucidated because a suitable animal model has not been established. In this study, we established a novel murine model of nickel-induced intraoral metal contact allergy and aimed to elucidate the immune response in terms of T-cell receptor repertoire and cytokine profiles in inflamed oral mucosa. The intraoral metal contact allergy model was induced by two sensitizations of nickel plus lipopolysaccharide solution into the postauricular skin followed by a single nickel challenge of the buccal mucosa. Cytokine expression profiles and T-cell phenotypes were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. T cells accumulated in the cervical lymph nodes and inflamed oral mucosa were characterized by analyzing their T-cell receptor α- and β-chain repertoires, and the nucleotide sequences of complementary determining region 3. Significant swelling and pathological features were histologically evident at 1 day after challenge in mice with nickel allergy. At 1 day after the challenge, CD8-positive T cells producing high levels of T helper 1 type cytokines had accumulated in the allergic oral mucosa. At 7 days after the challenge, excessive nickel allergy in the oral mucosa was suppressed by regulatory T cells. Characterization of the T-cell receptor repertoire in nickel allergic mice revealed the presence of natural killer T cells and T cells bearing Trav6-6-Traj57 at 1 day after the challenge. Our murine model of nickel-induced intraoral metal contact allergy showed that natural killer T cells and T cells bearing Trav6-6-Traj57 might be involved in the immune responses of nickel-induced intraoral metal contact allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2904460347,"Objectives Although estrogenic modulation of serum urate levels is well-known, the androgenic effect on urate homeostasis remains controversial. We investigated the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on serum urate levels. Methods We retrospectively enrolled a total of 489 prostate cancer patients with available serum urate levels at baseline and 3 and 6 months after ADT (n = 150) or prostate surgery (n = 339). We extracted the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from a data warehouse and compared the changes in urate levels between the two treatment groups and between the different ADT regimens (with versus without luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists) using generalized estimating equation (GEE). Results The baseline urate levels and the proportion of hyperuricemic subjects were comparable between the two groups. After 6 months, the urate levels were significantly decreased (by −0.66 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.81 to -0.51]) in the ADT group, whereas they did not significantly change in the surgery group in the univariate GEE analysis. The ADT group (4.7% from 18.0% at baseline) had a significantly lower proportion of hyperuricemic patients than surgery group (16.5% from 15.9% at baseline) at 6-month (p < 0.001). Regardless of whether LHRH agonists were used, the serial urate levels were lowered by the ADT. Temporal changes in the urate levels were significantly associated with the treatment group, baseline hyperuricemia, and poor functional or advanced cancer status. The ADT-related serum urate level reduction also remained significant in the multivariate GEE analysis (regression coefficient = −0.43 [−0.67 to −0.19] after 3 months and −0.37 [−0.64 to −0.10] after 6 months). Moreover, propensity-score-matched analyses yielded the same results. Conclusions Our results showed that longitudinal serum urate levels were significantly reduced in men receiving ADT. This finding suggests that androgen could have an independent role in urate homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2903654389,"Objectives Our study aimed to describe the prevalence of self-medication among the Paris adult population and to identify the factors associated with self-medication. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was based on data collected from the SIRS cohort (a French acronym for “Health, inequalities and social ruptures”) in 2005 in the Paris metropolitan area using a face-to-face administration questionnaire among a representative sample of 3,023 French-speaking adults. Structural equation models were used to investigate the factors associated with self-medication in the overall population and according to income. Results The prevalence of self-medication in the past four weeks was 53.5% in the Paris metropolitan area. Seven factors were directly associated with self-medication in the structural equation model. Self-medication was found more common among women, young people, in active employment or student, with a high income, but also among people with a health information seeking behavior, with a high daily mobility, and/or with a history of unmet healthcare needs due to economic reasons. When looking at these coefficients according to income, the association between self-medication and daily mobility appeared stronger in the bottom quartile of income whereas it was no longer significant in the rest of the survey population. Conclusion Self-medication is a frequent practice in the Paris metropolitan area. This study confirms the role of some factors found to be associated with self-medication in the literature such as age or gender and draws attention to other factors rarely explored such as daily mobility, especially among people with a low income, or health information seeking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2903889031,"Myocilin is an extracellular glycoprotein with a poorly understood biological function and typically known because of its association with glaucoma. In this study, we analyzed the expression and biological activity of human myocilin in some non-ocular tissues. Western immunoblot showed the presence of myocilin in blood plasma as well as in liver and lymphoid tissues (thymus and lymph node). Quantitative PCR confirmed the expression of MYOC in these lymphoid organs and revealed that its mRNA is also present in T-lymphocytes and leukocytes. In addition, detection of 30 kDa C-terminal myocilin fragments in thymus and liver suggested that myocilin undergoes an in vivo proteolytic processing that might regulate its biological activity. The presence of myocilin in blood was further corroborated by peptide mass fingerprinting of the HPLC-isolated protein, and gross estimation of its concentration by Western immunoblot indicated that it is a medium-abundance serum protein with an approximate concentration of 0.85 mg/ml (15.5 μM). Finally, in vitro analyses indicated that myocilin acts as an anti-adhesive protein for human circulating leukocytes incubated with endothelial cell monolayers. Altogether, these data provide insightful information on new biological properties of myocilin and suggest its putative role as a blood matricellular protein."
https://openalex.org/W2904578193,"There is a growing interest to understand financial markets as ecological systems, where the variety of trading strategies correspond to that of biological species. For this purpose, transaction data for individual traders are studied recently as empirical analyses. However, there are few empirical studies addressing how traders submit limit and market order at the level of individual traders. Since limit and market orders are key ingredients finally leading to transactions, it would be necessary to understand what kind of strategies are actually employed among traders before making transactions. Here we demonstrate the variety of limit-order and market-order strategies and show their roles in the financial markets from an ecological perspective. We find these trading strategies can be well-characterized by their response pattern to historical price changes. By applying a clustering analysis, we provide an overall picture of trading strategies as an ecological matrix, illustrating that liquidity consumers are likely to exhibit high trading performances compared with liquidity providers. Furthermore, we reveal both high-frequency traders (HFTs) and low-frequency traders (LFTs) exhibit high trading performance, despite the difference in their trading styles; HFTs attempt to maximize their trading efficiency by reducing risk, whereas LFTs make their profit by taking risk."
https://openalex.org/W2904653728,"Background Carriers of the sickle cell trait (HbAS) usually remain asymptomatic. However, under conditions of low tissue oxygenation, red blood cell sickling and vascular obstruction may develop. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can arise from conditions promoting low-oxygen in kidney tissue, which may be aggravated by the presence of the sickle cell trait. In addition, CKD can arise from other genetic traits. Aim To compare the frequency of HbAS among hemodialysis patients and the general newborn population of Salvador (Bahia-Brazil), as well as to investigate the frequencies of apolipoprotein L1 risk variants in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Methods A cross-sectional study included 306 patients with ESRD (End Stage Renal Disease) on hemodialysis for no more than three years. Hemoglobin profiles were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography. To estimate the sickle cell trait frequency in the general population of Salvador, we analyzed data collected by a local neonatal screening program between 2011 and 2016. To exclude the potential contributing effect of the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variants, we performed genotyping by PCR and DNA sequencing of 45 patients. Results The frequency of HbAS was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients (9.8%) than in the general population (4.6%): Odds Ratio = 2.32 (95% CI = 1.59–3.38). No differences in demographic, clinical or laboratory data were found among patients with or without the sickle cell trait. The frequency of patients with none, one or two APOL1 risk haplotypes (G1 and G2) for CKD were 80%, 18% and 2%, respectively. Conclusions The frequency of the sickle cell trait is higher in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis compared to the general population. APOL1 haplotypes do not seem to be the determinant of ESRD in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2905444162,"In nature, a multitude of both abiotic and biotic stressors influence organisms with regard to their overall fitness. Stress responses that finally impair normal biological functions may ultimately result in consequences for whole populations. This study focused on the metabolic response of the intertidal rock pool fish Gobius paganellus towards simulated predation risk. Individuals were exposed to a mixture of skin extracts from conspecifics and chemical alarm cues from a top predator, Octopus vulgaris. Oxygen consumption rates of single fish were measured to establish standard (SMR) and routine metabolic rates (RMR) of G. paganellus, and to address the direct response towards simulated predation risk, compared to handling and light stress. The SMR of G. paganellus (0.0301 ± 0.0081 mg O2 h-1 g-1 WW) was significantly lower than the RMR (0.0409 ± 0.0078 mg O2 h-1 g-1 WW). In contrast to increased respiration due to handling and light stress, the exposure to chemical predation cues induced a significant reduction in oxygen consumption rates (0.0297 ± 0.0077 mg O2 h-1 g-1 WW). This metabolic suppression was interpreted as a result of the stereotypic freezing behaviour as antipredator response of gobiid fish. Results underline the importance of biotic interactions in environmental stress assessments and predation as a biotic factor that will provide more realistic scenarios when addressing stress impacts in tidal rock pool organisms."

Among six lines examined, U-2OS and HOS survived chronic STLC treatment and gave rise to resistant cells with IC50s at least 10-fold higher than those of the respective parental lines. Depletion of KIF15 largely eliminated the acquired K5I resistance in both cases, consistent with the proposed notion that KIF15 is indispensable for it. In contrast to the KIF11-independent property of the cells derived from HOS, those derived from U-2OS still required KIF11 for their growth and, intriguingly, expressed a C-terminal truncated variant of KIF11 resulting from a frame shift mutation (S1017fs). All of the isolated clones harbored the same mutation, suggesting its clonal expansion in the cell population due to the growth advantage during chronic STLC treatment. Transgenic expression of KIF11S1017fs in the parental U-2OS cells, as well as in HeLa cells, conferred a moderate but reproducible STLC resistance, probably owing to STLC-resistant localization of the mutant KIF11 on mitotic spindle. Our observations indicate that both KIF15 and the C-terminal-truncated KIF11 contributes to the STLC resistance of the U-2OS derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W2905412689,"One-third of people living with HIV in China are still unaware of their status, so we sought to better understand HIV testing in the general hospital setting in China.A cross-sectional study was conducted using the electronic medical records of all patients who attended Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing, January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2016. HIV screening and detection rates and characteristics of patients diagnosed with HIV were assessed.Overall, 235,961 patients were screened, for a screening rate of 1.4%. Although most were outpatients (98.4%), screening rate was higher among inpatients (70.0% versus 0.4%), and highest in internal medicine (36.1%) and surgery (33.3%) departments. A total of 140 patients were diagnosed with HIV, for a detection rate of 5.93 per 10,000. Detection rates were highest among outpatients (9.34 per 10,000), and patients attending the dermatology and sexually transmitted infection (STI) department (153.85 per 10,000). Most diagnoses were made among males (91.4%), aged 20-39 (67.1%), who reported becoming infected through homosexual contact (70.0%).HIV screening in China's general hospitals needs to be improved. More focus should be placed on screening outpatients, especially in the dermatology and STI department, and young men."
https://openalex.org/W2903601213,"In 2010, the South African Government initiated a voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) program as a part of the country's HIV prevention strategy based on compelling evidence that VMMC reduces men's risk of becoming HIV infected by approximately 60%. A previous VMMC costing study at Government and PEPFAR-supported facilities noted that the lack of sufficient data from the private sector represented a gap in knowledge concerning the overall cost of scaling up VMMC services. This study, conducted in mid-2016, focused on surgical circumcision and aims to address this limitation.VMMC service delivery cost data were collected at 13 private facilities in three provinces in South Africa: Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and Mpumalanga. Unit costs were calculated using a bottom-up approach by cost components, and then disaggregated by facility type and urbanization level. VMMC demand creation, and higher-level management and program support costs were not collected. The unit cost of VMMC service delivery at private facilities in South Africa was calculated as a weighted average of the unit costs at the 13 facilities.At the average annual exchange rate of R10.83 = $1, the unit cost including training and cost of continuous quality improvement (CQI) to provide VMMC at private facilities was $137. The largest cost components were consumables (40%) and direct labor (35%). Eleven out of the 13 surveyed private sector facilities were fixed sites (with a unit cost of $142), while one was a fixed site with outreach services (with a unit cost of $156), and the last one provided services at a combination of fixed, outreach and mobile sites (with a unit cost per circumcision performed of $123). The unit cost was not substantially different based on the level of urbanization: $141, $129, and $143 at urban, peri-urban, and rural facilities, respectively.The private sector VMMC unit cost ($137) did not differ substantially from that at government and PEPFAR-supported facilities ($132 based on results from a similar study conducted in 2014 in South Africa at 33 sites across eight of the countries nine provinces). The two largest cost drivers, consumables and direct labor, were comparable across the two studies (75% in private facilities and 67% in public/PEPFAR-supported facilities). Results from this study provide VMMC unit cost data that had been missing and makes an important contribution to a better understanding of the costs of VMMC service delivery, enabling VMMC programs to make informed decisions regarding funding levels and scale-up strategies for VMMC in South Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2904493612,"Myocardial perfusion abnormalities are the first sign of the ischemic cascade in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). Thus, the early detection of myocardial perfusion abnormalities is significant for the prevention of CAD. Recently, a novel noninvasive method named Cardiodynamicsgram (CDG) has been proposed for early detection of CAD. This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of CDG in myocardial perfusion abnormalities for suspected ischemic heart disease. In the study, 86 suspected patients were enrolled. Standard 12-lead ECG and CDG were performed simultaneously before single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Diagnostic accuracy of CDG for myocardial perfusion abnormalities detection is assessed using SPECT MPI as the reference standard. Of these 86 suspected patients, 37 patients were positive in CDG, 49 patients were negative in CDG. Diagnostic accuracy of CDG at presentation for myocardial perfusion abnormalities was 84.9%, sensitivity 84.0%, and specificity 89.4%. Furthermore, of the 10 patients whose SPECT MPI results are reverse redistribution, 9 patients were positive in CDG. Underlying causes of false positive CDG findings included the factors that can change the stability of cardiac electrical conduction and measurement noise. Myocardial remodeling in patients with old myocardial infarction might be the major cause of false negative findings. Results show a good consistency between the CDG and SPECT MPI in evaluating myocardial perfusion abnormalities. It suggests that CDG might be used as a cost-effective tool for assessing the myocardial perfusion abnormalities in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2905126355,"This paper constructed a stacked-autoencoder neural network model (SAE model) to estimate sea state bias (SSB) based on radar altimeter data. Six cycles of the geophysical data record (GDR) from Jason-1/2 radar altimeters were used as a training dataset, and the other 2 cycles of the GDR from Jason-1/2 were used for testing. The inputs to this SAE model include the significant wave height (SWH), wind speed (U), sea surface height (SSH), backscatter coefficient (σ0) and automatic gain control (AGC), and the model outputs the SSB. The model includes one input layer, three hidden layers and one output layer. The SSBs in the GDR of Jason-1/2 were obtained from a nonparametric model based on the SWH and U as input variables; thus, the model has high accuracy but low efficiency. The SSBs in the GDR of HY-2A were computed using a four-parameter parametric model that uses the SWH and U as input variables; therefore, this model's computational speed is high but its accuracy is low. Thus, we used the HY-2A radar altimeter as an unseen validation dataset to evaluate the performance of the SAE model. Then, we analyzed the contrasting results of these methods, including the differences in the SSB, explained variance, residual error and operational efficiency. The results demonstrate not only that the accuracy of the SAE model is superior to that of the conventional parametric model but also that its operational efficiency is better than that of the nonparametric model."
https://openalex.org/W2905449125,"Group IVa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) mediates GPCR-stimulated arachidonic acid (AA) release from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) located in plasma membranes. We previously found in superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons that PLA2 activity is required for voltage-independent N-type Ca2+ (N-) current inhibition by M1 muscarinic receptors (M1Rs). These findings are at odds with an alternative model, previously observed for M-current inhibition, where PIP2 dissociation from channels and subsequent metabolism by phospholipase C suffices for current inhibition. To resolve cPLA2α's importance, we have investigated its role in mediating voltage-independent N-current inhibition (~40%) that follows application of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M). Preincubation with different cPLA2α antagonists or dialyzing cPLA2α antibodies into cells minimized N-current inhibition by Oxo-M, whereas antibodies to Ca2+-independent PLA2 had no effect. Taking a genetic approach, we found that SCG neurons from cPLA2α-/- mice exhibited little N-current inhibition by Oxo-M, confirming a role for cPLA2α. In contrast, cPLA2α antibodies or the absence of cPLA2α had no effect on voltage-dependent N-current inhibition by M2/M4Rs or on M-current inhibition by M1Rs. These findings document divergent M1R signaling mediating M-current and voltage-independent N-current inhibition. Moreover, these differences suggest that cPLA2α acts locally to metabolize PIP2 intimately associated with N- but not M-channels. To determine cPLA2α's functional importance more globally, we examined action potential firing of cPLA2α+/+ and cPLA2α-/- SCG neurons, and found decreased latency to first firing and interspike interval resulting in a doubling of firing frequency in cPLA2α-/- neurons. These unanticipated findings identify cPLA2α as a tonic regulator of neuronal membrane excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2951731165,"Memory T and B lymphocyte numbers are thought to be regulated by recent and cumulative microbial exposures. We report here that memory-phenotype lymphocyte frequencies in B, CD4 and CD8 T-cells in 3-monthly serial bleeds from healthy young adult humans were relatively stable over a 1-year period, while Plasmablast frequencies were not, suggesting that recent environmental exposures affected steady state levels of recently activated but not of memory lymphocyte subsets. Frequencies of memory B and CD4 T cells were not correlated, suggesting that variation in them was unlikely to be determined by cumulative antigenic exposures. Immunophenotyping of adult siblings showed high concordance in memory, but not of recently activated lymphocyte subsets. To explore the possibility of cell-intrinsic regulation of T cell memory, we screened effector memory-phenotype T cell (TEM) frequencies in common independent inbred mice strains. Using two pairs from these strains that differed predominantly in either CD4 TEM and/or CD8 TEM frequencies, we constructed bi-parental bone marrow chimeras in F1 recipient mice, and found that memory T cell frequencies in recipient mice were determined by donor genotypes. Together, these data suggest cell-autonomous determination of memory T niche size, and suggest mechanisms maintaining immune variability."
