Although kinetochore components that stabilize, translocate on, and affect the polymerization state of microtubules have been identified, none have proven essential for kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Here, we examined the conserved KNL-1/Mis12 complex/Ndc80 complex (KMN) network, which is essential for kinetochore-microtubule interactions in vivo. We identified two distinct microtubule-binding activities within the KMN network: one associated with the Ndc80/Nuf2 subunits of the Ndc80 complex, and a second in KNL-1. Formation of the complete KMN network, which additionally requires the Mis12 complex and the Spc24/Spc25 subunits of the Ndc80 complex, synergistically enhances microtubule-binding activity. Phosphorylation by Aurora B, which corrects improper kinetochore-microtubule connections in vivo, reduces the affinity of the Ndc80 complex for microtubules in vitro. Based on these findings, we propose that the conserved KMN network constitutes the core microtubule-binding site of the kinetochore.

In the late nineteenth century, a differentiated chromosomal region that connects to spindle fibers during mitosis was first described (reviewed in Schrader, 1953Schrader F. Mitosis: The Movement of Chromosomes in Cell Division.Second Edition. Columbia University Press, New York1953Google Scholar). Electron microscopy provided a direct view of this region, termed the kinetochore, and demonstrated that microtubule plus ends directly embed in the outer kinetochore plate (reviewed in Rieder, 1982Rieder C.L. The formation, structure, and composition of the mammalian kinetochore and kinetochore fiber.Int. Rev. Cytol. 1982; 79: 1-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, these are not static attachments, and chromosome movement is intimately coupled to changes in the polymerization dynamics of kinetochore-bound microtubules (Maddox et al., 2003Maddox P. Straight A. Coughlin P. Mitchison T.J. Salmon E.D. Direct observation of microtubule dynamics at kinetochores in Xenopus extract spindles: implications for spindle mechanics.J.

More recently, the identification of numerous kinetochore proteins and elucidation of their in vivo loss-of-function phenotypes is providing a molecular view of this structure. Despite this progress, the identity of the core microtubule-binding site of the kinetochore has remained elusive. Most significantly, components that both are essential in vivo for kinetochore-microtubule interactions and exhibit direct interactions with microtubules in vitro have not been identified. A variety of approaches in different organisms have identified kinetochore components that interact with microtubules (reviewed in Cleveland et al., 2003Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F.

DeLuca J. Salmon E.D. Earnshaw W.C. The dynamic kinetochore-microtubule interface.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5461-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These include the Dam1 ring complex, the plus end-tracking proteins CLASP, CLIP-170, and EB1, the minus end-directed microtubule motor dynein, the plus end-directed kinesin-7 (CENP-E), and the microtubule depolymerizing kinesin-13 (Kin I) and kinesin-8 (Kip3). However, while these proteins make important contributions to chromosome movement, in vivo inhibitions indicate that none of them are essential for the stable interaction of kinetochores with microtubules. Recently, the Dam1 ring complex in budding yeast has received attention as a potential kinetochore-spindle connector. Although mutational inactivation of the Dam1 complex causes severe chromosome missegregation, it does not eliminate all kinetochore-spindle interactions (Cheeseman et al., 2001Cheeseman I.M. Brew C. Wolyniak M. Desai A. Anderson S. Muster N. Yates J.R. Huffaker T.C. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Implication of a novel multiprotein Dam1p complex in outer kinetochore function.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, this complex is genetically dispensable for viability in fission yeast (Sanchez-Perez et al., 2005Sanchez-Perez I. Renwick S.J. Crawley K. Karig I. Buck V. Meadows J.C. Franco-Sanchez A. Fleig U. Toda T. Millar J.B.

In metazoans, inhibition of the two kinetochore motors (cytoplasmic dynein and CENP-E) does not significantly alter chromosome-spindle interactions for the majority of chromosomes (Howell et al., 2001Howell B.J.

Inhibition of CLASP family proteins specifically inhibits microtubule polymerization at kinetochores (Maiato et al., 2005Maiato H. Khodjakov A. Rieder C.L. Drosophila CLASP is required for the incorporation of microtubule subunits into fluxing kinetochore fibres.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) but does not prevent the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments. In total, the analysis of currently identified microtubule-binding proteins fails to account for the activity of the core microtubule-binding site of the kinetochore. We previously used a combination of biochemistry and functional genomics in C. elegans to identify a network of 10 interacting proteins that plays a central role at the kinetochore-microtubule interface (Cheeseman et al., 2004Cheeseman I.M. Niessen S. Anderson S. Hyndman F. Yates III, J.R. Oegema K. Desai A.

Phenotypic analysis by single-cell assays partitioned the components of this network into three distinct groups (see Figure 1A). Depletion of the “KNL” proteins KNL-1 (termed Spc105 in budding yeast; Nekrasov et al., 2003Nekrasov V.S. Smith M.A. Peak-Chew S. Kilmartin J.V. Interactions between centromere complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol.

Depletion of the second group, equivalent to the Mis12 complex in other organisms (De Wulf et al., 2003De Wulf P. McAinsh A.D. Sorger P.K.

Depletion of the third group, equivalent to the Ndc80 complex (DeLuca et al., 2005DeLuca J.G. Dong Y. Hergert P. Strauss J. Hickey J.M. Salmon E.D. McEwen B.F.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), resulted in kinetochores that were unable to sustain tension during interactions with spindle microtubules. Most importantly, the KNL-1/Mis12 complex/Ndc80 complex (KMN) network is conserved throughout eukaryotes and is essential for viability and kinetochore-microtubule interactions in multiple organisms (reviewed in Kline-Smith et al., 2005Kline-Smith S.L. Sandall S. Desai A. Kinetochore-spindle microtubule interactions during mitosis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, whether the KMN network plays a direct or indirect role in kinetochore-microtubule interactions remains unresolved. The importance of this network in outer kinetochore assembly has led to the general hypothesis that it makes an indirect structural contribution (see Joglekar et al., 2006Joglekar A.P. Bouck D.C. Molk J.N. Bloom K.S. Salmon E.D. Molecular architecture of a kinetochore-microtubule attachment site.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the organization and activity of the KMN network using purified components in vitro. We identify two distinct microtubule-binding activities within the network—one intrinsic to the Ndc80 and Nuf2 subunits of the Ndc80 complex, and a second intrinsic to KNL-1. Reconstitution of the entire network by combining its component parts strongly enhances the net microtubule-binding affinity. We further define the molecular connectivity of the KMN network and provide evidence that the microtubule-binding activity of the Ndc80 complex is regulated by Aurora B kinase phosphorylation of the Ndc80 subunit. Based on these findings, and in light of previous in vivo studies, we propose that the conserved KMN network constitutes the core microtubule-binding site of the kinetochore. We previously isolated a conserved network of interacting kinetochore proteins from C. elegans consisting of KNL-1, KNL-3, phenotypically defined groups of NDC proteins (NDC-80, Nuf2HIM-10, Spc25KBP-3), and MIS proteins (MIS-12, KBP-1, KBP-2), which we proposed were equivalent to the yeast and human Ndc80 and Mis12 kinetochore subcomplexes, respectively, and a nonessential protein KBP-5 (Cheeseman et al., 2004Cheeseman I.M. Niessen S. Anderson S. Hyndman F. Yates III, J.R. Oegema K. Desai A. A conserved protein network controls assembly of the outer kinetochore and its ability to sustain tension.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2255-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Consistent with the severity of their depletion phenotypes, KNL-3 is required to recruit KNL-1, which is in turn required to recruit the NDC-80 subcomplex (summarized in Figure 1A; Cheeseman et al., 2004Cheeseman I.M. Niessen S. Anderson S. Hyndman F. Yates III, J.R. Oegema K. Desai A. A conserved protein network controls assembly of the outer kinetochore and its ability to sustain tension.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2255-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Here, we will refer to this group of interacting proteins as the KMN network for KNL-1, Mis12 complex, and Ndc80 complex. To determine whether the KMN network has a direct or indirect role in forming kinetochore-microtubule attachments, we used the first steps of a tandem affinity purification scheme to enrich the endogenous KMN network (Cheeseman et al., 2004Cheeseman I.M. Niessen S. Anderson S. Hyndman F. Yates III, J.R. Oegema K. Desai A. A conserved protein network controls assembly of the outer kinetochore and its ability to sustain tension.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2255-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The partially purified network cosedimented with taxol-stabilized microtubules (Figure 1B). No pelleting was observed in the absence of microtubules, and all tested network subunits cosedimented equivalently (Figure 1B; not shown). Varying the microtubule concentration and quantifying the percent copelleted KMN network indicated that, assuming ∼60% of the input material is competent for binding, half-maximal binding occurs at ∼0.75 μM (Figure 1C). We conclude that the KMN network is closely associated with a direct microtubule-binding activity with an apparent dissociation constant (KDapp) in the submicromolar range. Partially purified KMN network sedimented with microtubules, but we could not exclude the possibility that a copurifying protein accounts for this microtubule-binding activity. Therefore, we reconstituted the network by utilizing a bacterial polycistronic expression system that facilitates coexpression of multiple open reading frames (Tan, 2001Tan S. A modular polycistronic expression system for overexpressing protein complexes in Escherichia coli.Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The reconstitution was guided by previous in vivo analysis (Cheeseman et al., 2004Cheeseman I.M. Niessen S. Anderson S. Hyndman F. Yates III, J.R. Oegema K. Desai A. A conserved protein network controls assembly of the outer kinetochore and its ability to sustain tension.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2255-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, Desai et al., 2003Desai A. Rybina S. Muller-Reichert T. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Hyman A. Oegema K. KNL-1 directs assembly of the microtubule-binding interface of the kinetochore in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2421-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), along with work in other organisms that suggested that groups of proteins within the network are likely to form discrete subcomplexes. We did not express KBP-5, which is dispensable for viability in C. elegans. A 4-subunit Ndc80 complex (Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25) exists in fungi and vertebrates (McCleland et al., 2004McCleland M.L. Kallio M.J. Barrett-Wilt G.A. Kestner C.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Gorbsky G.J. Stukenberg P.T. The vertebrate Ndc80 complex contains Spc24 and Spc25 homologs, which are required to establish and maintain kinetochore-microtubule attachment.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 131-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Wigge and Kilmartin, 2001Wigge P.A. Kilmartin J.V. The Ndc80p complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains conserved centromere components and has a function in chromosome segregation.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Sequence homology and our previous in vivo experiments identified three likely NDC-80 complex subunits in C. elegans: NDC-80, Nuf2HIM-10, and Spc25KBP-3 (Cheeseman et al., 2004Cheeseman I.M. Niessen S. Anderson S. Hyndman F. Yates III, J.R. Oegema K. Desai A. A conserved protein network controls assembly of the outer kinetochore and its ability to sustain tension.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2255-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Weak sequence similarity and in vivo analysis led us to suspect that KBP-4 is equivalent to Spc24 in other organisms. Consistent with this, KBP-4 copurified with the other subunits through multiple purification steps resulting in a nearly homogenous 4-subunit NDC-80 complex (Figure 1D). Attempts to express KNL-3 on its own were unsuccessful (Figure 1E). Since in vivo analysis indicated that the MIS proteins (MIS-12, KBP-1, and KBP-2) make an important contribution to kinetochore assembly by affecting KNL-3 recruitment (Figure 1A; Cheeseman et al., 2004Cheeseman I.M. Niessen S. Anderson S. Hyndman F. Yates III, J.R. Oegema K. Desai A. A conserved protein network controls assembly of the outer kinetochore and its ability to sustain tension.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2255-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), we tested whether coexpression with the MIS proteins facilitated KNL-3 expression. Coexpression of KBP-1, but not the unrelated protein GST, resulted in detectable KNL-3 expression (Figure 1E). This stabilization of expression was enhanced when the complete set of MIS proteins was present. We observed a strikingly similar stabilization effect for the hDsn1 subunit of the human Mis12 complex during bacterial coexpression (data not shown; Kline et al., 2006Kline S.L. Cheeseman I.M. Hori T. Fukagawa T. Desai A. The human Mis12 complex is required for kinetochore assembly and proper chromosome segregation.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which leads us to suggest that KNL-3 is the C. elegans counterpart of hDsn1. Consistent with this, KBP-1, KBP-2, and MIS-12 copurified with KNL-3-6xHis from bacteria through multiple purification steps (Figure 1F; see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online), although excess KNL-3 is present in the final purified material relative to the other subunits. KNL-3 is the functionally critical component of this complex, because its depletion abolishes kinetochore-microtubule interactions in vivo. However, for consistency with work in other organisms, we will refer to this group of four interacting proteins as the MIS-12 complex. We were also able to purify full-length KNL-1-6xHis on its own (Figure 1G). However, the large size of KNL-1 prevented robust expression and resulted in some smaller molecular weight products because of either degradation or the use of alternative start codons during translation. If KNL-1-6xHis and untagged KNL-3/MIS-12/KBP-1/KBP-2 were expressed together, all of the expressed proteins copurified (Figure 1H; Figure S1), although the stoichiometry of MIS-12 was lower in the final gel filtration step when compared to the MIS-12 complex purified with tagged KNL-3 (Figure 1F; Figure S1). This result indicates that KNL-1 directly interacts with the MIS-12 complex. We will refer to the material obtained by this copurification as KNL-1/MIS-12 complex. To determine whether the KMN network can be reconstituted from KNL-1, the MIS-12 complex, and the NDC-80 complex in the absence of additional proteins, we performed gel filtration chromatography. Individually, the NDC-80 and MIS-12 complexes have stokes radii of ∼85 Å and 48 Å, respectively (Figure 2A, gels 1 and 3), consistent with work on their counterparts in humans and budding yeast (Ciferri et al., 2005Ciferri C.

Molecular organization of the Ndc80 complex, an essential kinetochore component.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). KNL-1 fractionated near the void volume of the column, suggesting that it is oligomeric (Figure 2A, gel 2). Sucrose gradient sedimentation indicated an S value of ∼16 (not shown), supporting the existence of an oligomer of 5–10 KNL-1 molecules. Importantly, this fractionation profile of recombinant KNL-1 is similar to that of endogenous KNL-1 in the presence of both low (50 mM) and high (750 mM) salt (Figure S2). We next conducted gel filtration of equimolar mixtures to test whether the network can be reconstituted with the individual components and to define the network connectivity. For the KNL-1/MIS-12 complex mixture purified with a single tag on KNL-1 (Figure 1H), a significant pool of the MIS-12 complex cofractionated with KNL-1 (Figure 2A, gel 4), confirming the existence of a direct interaction. Mixing the NDC-80 complex with either KNL-1 (N + K) or the MIS-12 complex (N + M) did not shift the migration of either component, suggesting that they do not interact directly (Figure 2A, gels 5 and 6). However, when the NDC-80 complex was combined with KNL-1/MIS-12 complex, a significant pool of the NDC-80 complex shifted to a higher molecular weight range (Figure 2A, gel 7), resulting in an overall fractionation profile similar to that of the endogenous KMN network (Figure S2). Densitometry of Coomassie-stained gel filtration fractions indicated stoichiometric amounts of NDC-80, Nuf2HIM-10, and KNL-3 (Figure 2B; data not shown). KBP-1, KBP-2, Spc24KBP-4, and Spc25KBP-3 were also stoichiometric relative to each other in peak fractions. For KNL-1, where a series of lower molecular weight species are present, stoichiometry measurements were not possible. MIS-12 was present at a lower stoichiometry relative to the other proteins but was clearly present in the peak fractions (also see Figure S1). In total, these results define the connectivity of the KMN network and indicate that this network can be reconstituted from the components identified in our previous study in the absence of other eukaryotic proteins. Previous studies in multiple organisms have demonstrated that the Ndc80 complex is essential for robust kinetochore-microtubule interactions (reviewed in Kline-Smith et al., 2005Kline-Smith S.L. Sandall S. Desai A. Kinetochore-spindle microtubule interactions during mitosis.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear whether the Ndc80 complex binds directly to microtubules or forms an indirect connection through a binding partner. To address this question, we examined the ability of the NDC-80 complex to cosediment with GMPCPP (Figure 3A) or taxol-stabilized microtubules (not shown). The NDC-80 complex did not pellet on its own or in the presence of monomeric GDP-tubulin (Figure 3A; not shown), but it cosedimented with both stabilized microtubule substrates. Mixing limiting amounts of the NDC-80 complex (50 nM) with varying concentrations of microtubules revealed a weak apparent binding affinity (KDapp > 3 μM). At a 20-fold higher concentration of NDC-80 complex (1 μM; Figure 3A), more robust cosedimentation was observed. Further analysis revealed an anomalous behavior that precluded fitting the data points to a simple binding isotherm and suggested a more complex cooperative mechanism (see below and Figure S3). We conclude that the widely conserved Ndc80 complex, which is critical for kinetochore-spindle interactions in vivo, binds directly to microtubules in vitro, albeit with low affinity when present at limiting concentrations. Similar experiments with purified KNL-1 revealed a second microtubule-binding activity in the KMN network (Figure 3B). At ∼50 nM KNL-1, only minor cosedimentation was detected, even at high microtubule concentrations. However, increasing the concentration of KNL-1 3-fold dramatically increased the amount of cosedimenting protein (Figure 3B). No cosedimentation with microtubules was detected for the MIS-12 complex alone (Figure 3B). However, when KNL-1/MIS-12 complex was used as the input, the MIS-12 complex cosedimented with microtubules in a manner mimicking KNL-1 (Figure 3B). The percent of input complex competent to bind microtubules and the apparent affinity of the KNL-1/MIS-12 complex were higher than for KNL-1 alone, which may reflect stabilization of KNL-1 by coexpression with MIS-12 complex. In addition to binding directly to microtubules, the NDC-80 complex, KNL-1, and the KNL-1/MIS-12 complex bundled microtubules in vitro (Figure 3C; data not shown). With 1 μM microtubules, approximately 2-fold molar excess of NDC-80 was required to observe robust bundling, whereas only a ∼1:4 molar ratio of KNL-1/MIS-12 complex was necessary, possibly reflecting the oligomeric state of KNL-1. The bundling observed with both components may contribute to the concentration dependence observed in the cosedimentation analysis. Cumulatively, these results indicate that there are two independent microtubule-binding and -bundling activities in the KMN network: one in the NDC-80 complex and a second in KNL-1. Above, we demonstrated that KNL-1 and the NDC-80 complex bind to microtubules and that the KNL-1/MIS-12 complex interacts with the NDC-80 complex. We next tested the microtubule-binding activity of mixtures of the three parts of the network. For these experiments, we used limiting amounts of each component (50 nM) to maximize the sensitivity for detecting changes in the apparent microtubule-binding affinity. Consistent with the lack of an observed interaction between the NDC-80 complex and, individually, KNL-1 or the MIS-12 complex (Figure 2A), the corresponding mixtures did not exhibit changes in the microtubule-binding activity of the input components (Figure 4A; compare with Figures 3A and 3B, 50 nM panels). In contrast, mixing the KNL-1/MIS-12 complex and the NDC-80 complex, which reconstitutes the KMN network (Figure 2A), resulted in a dramatically increased apparent microtubule-binding affinity relative to the individual components (Figures 4B and 4C). Half-maximal binding occurred at ∼0.5 μM microtubules, which indicates that the apparent binding affinity at this input concentration is similar to what is observed with the partially purified endogenous KMN network (Figures 1B and 1C). Thus, the connection between the NDC-80 complex and KNL-1 within the KMN network synergizes their individual microtubule-binding activities. KNL-1, the KNL-1/MIS-12 complex, and the NDC-80 complex exhibit significant differences in microtubule binding when their input concentration is varied. To explore this behavior further, we fixed the microtubule concentration at 5 μM and varied the KMN network components between 50 nM and 500 nM. Under these conditions, microtubules are in significant excess, and the percent cosedimented complex should remain relatively constant for a simple binding interaction. The NDC-80 complex largely followed this expectation (Figures 4D and 4E). In contrast, KNL-1/MIS-12 complex exhibited steep concentration dependence, with the amount of cosedimented complex increasing from 10% to 90% (Figures 4D and 4E). The reconstituted KMN network followed a similar but less dramatic trend, although this conclusion is limited by the significant binding present at even the lowest tested concentration (Figures 4D and 4E). We suspect that this apparent cooperative binding reflects the oligomeric nature of KNL-1 and its potent bundling activity. For the NDC-80 complex, where testing a higher concentration range (1–5 μM) was feasible, the amount of cosedimented NDC-80 complex exceeded that expected from the estimated weak affinity at lower input concentrations (Figures 4D and 4E; Figure S3). This finding suggests potential cooperativity of NDC-80 complex binding at high fractional occupancy on the microtubule lattice and may also be related to the bundling observed at these concentrations. Scatchard plots confirmed the anomalous binding of both KNL-1/MIS-12 complex and the NDC-80 complex (Figure S3) and highlighted their distinction from the well-characterized microtubule-binding protein tau, which shows a reduction in apparent binding affinity with increasing concentration (Kar et al., 2003Kar S.

Previously, we showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas (Cas) in a cytoskeletal complex is involved in force-dependent activation of the small GTPase Rap1. Here, we mechanically extended bacterially expressed Cas substrate domain protein (CasSD) in vitro and found a remarkable enhancement of phosphorylation by Src family kinases with no apparent change in kinase activity. Using an antibody that recognized extended CasSD in vitro, we observed Cas extension in intact cells in the peripheral regions of spreading cells, where higher traction forces are expected and where phosphorylated Cas was detected, suggesting that the in vitro extension and phosphorylation of CasSD are relevant to physiological force transduction. Thus, we propose that Cas acts as a primary force sensor, transducing force into mechanical extension and thereby priming phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling.

Cellular responses to mechanical force underlie many critical functions, from normal morphogenesis to carcinogenesis, cardiac hypertrophy, wound healing, and bone homeostasis. Recent studies indicate that various signaling pathways are involved in force transduction, including MAP kinases, small GTPases, and tyrosine kinases/phosphatases (Geiger and Bershadsky, 2002Geiger B.

A variety of primary force-sensing mechanisms could be postulated, including mechanical extension of cytoplasmic proteins, activation of ion channels, and formation of force-stabilized receptor-ligand bonds (catch bonds) (Vogel and Sheetz, 2006Vogel V. Sheetz M. Local force and geometry sensing regulate cell functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar), which would then activate downstream signaling pathways. At a biochemical level, tyrosine phosphorylation levels appear to be linked to mechanically induced changes controlling many other cellular functions (Giannone and Sheetz, 2006Giannone G. Sheetz M.P. Substrate rigidity and force define form through tyrosine phosphatase and kinase pathways.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). One protein involved in mechanically induced phosphorylation-dependent signaling is the Src family kinase substrate Cas (Crk-associated substrate), which is involved in various cellular events such as migration, survival, transformation, and invasion (Defilippi et al., 2006Defilippi P. Di Stefano P. Cabodi S. p130Cas: A versatile scaffold in signaling networks.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Stretch-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by Src family kinases (SFKs) occurs in detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal complexes and is involved in force-dependent activation of the small GTPase Rap1 (Tamada et al., 2004Tamada M. Sheetz M.P. Sawada Y. Activation of a signaling cascade by cytoskeleton stretch.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Rap1 is activated by distinct types of guanine nucleotide exchange factors coupled with various receptors or second messengers and plays an important role in a number of signaling pathways, including integrin signaling (Hattori and Minato, 2003Hattori M. Minato N. Rap1 GTPase: Functions, regulation, and malignancy.J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The Cas substrate domain, which is located in the center of Cas, is flanked by the amino-terminal SH3 and the carboxy-terminal Src-binding domains. These amino- and carboxy-terminal domains are involved in Cas localization at focal adhesions, while the substrate domain itself is not (Nakamoto et al., 1997Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Requirements for localization of p130cas to focal adhesions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggesting that these flanking domains anchor Cas molecules to the cytoskeletal complex and that the substrate domain could be extended upon cytoskeleton stretching. Furthermore, the Cas substrate domain has 15 repeats of a tyrosine-containing motif (YxxP) (Mayer et al., 1995Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Evidence that SH2 domains promote processive phosphorylation by protein-tyrosine kinases.Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and multiple sequence repeats are found in molecules with mechanical functions such as titin (Rief et al., 1997Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M. Gaub H.E. Reversible unfolding of individual titin immunoglobulin domains by AFM.Science. 1997; 276: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). Cell stretching could increase tyrosine phosphorylation by (1) directly activating the kinase, (2) inactivating the phosphatase, (3) mechanically bringing the kinase to the substrate, or (4) enhancing the susceptibility of the substrate to phosphorylation. To test between these possibilities, we have analyzed the mechanisms of stretch-dependent enhancement of Cas phosphorylation. In intact cells, Cas phosphorylation by c-Src is significantly increased by cell stretching with no detectable change in c-Src kinase activity. Cas phosphorylation mediates physiological force transduction through stretch-dependent activation of Rap1 in intact cells. With in vitro protein extension (IPE) experiments, we find that phosphorylation of CasSD by specific kinases is increased upon extension. Further, an antibody that recognizes extended CasSD in vitro preferentially recognizes Cas molecules at the periphery of late spreading cells where higher traction forces are predicted and Cas is phosphorylated, indicating that the in vitro extension and phosphorylation of CasSD is relevant to force transduction through Cas phosphorylation in intact cells. Thus, we suggest that Cas serves as a direct mechanosensor where force induces a mechanical extension of the substrate domain that primes it for phosphorylation. We propose that such “substrate priming” is a general mechanism for force transduction. We first examined whether the phosphorylation of Cas increased upon intact cell stretching, using the cell stretching system that we developed (Sawada et al., 2001Sawada Y. Nakamura K. Doi K. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Morita K. Komuro I. De Vos K. Sheetz M. Ichijo H. Rap1 is involved in cell stretching modulation of p38 but not ERK or JNK MAP kinase.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on a stretchable substrate (collagen-coated silicone), and the substrate was stretched uniformly and biaxially (10% in each dimension) and held stretched. To analyze the primary responses to cell stretching, samples were prepared from the cells lysed shortly (1 min) after stretching. Immunoblotting using an anti-phospho-Cas antibody (pCas-165) that specifically recognizes multiple phosphorylated YxxP motifs in the substrate domain (Fonseca et al., 2004Fonseca P.M. Shin N.Y. Brabek J. Ryzhova L. Wu J. Hanks S.K. Regulation and localization of CAS substrate domain tyrosine phosphorylation.Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) revealed a stretch-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in HEK293 cells (Figure 1A). When the selective SFK inhibitor CGP77675 (Missbach et al., 1999Missbach M. Jeschke M. Feyen J. Muller K. Glatt M. Green J. Susa M. A novel inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase Src suppresses phosphorylation of its major cellular substrates and reduces bone resorption in vitro and in rodent models in vivo.Bone. 1999; 24: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Novartis Pharma AG, Switzerland) was added prior to stretching, stretch-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was inhibited (Figure 1A). Furthermore, stretch-dependent phosphorylation of Cas was greatly attenuated in SYF cells that lacked the major SFKs, c-Src, c-Yes, and Fyn (Klinghoffer et al., 1999Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. Src family kinases are required for integrin but not PDGFR signal transduction.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and was restored in SYF cells stably expressing c-Src (Figure 1B), c-Yes, or Fyn (data not shown). Thus, stretching intact cells increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by SFKs. To determine if stretch-dependent increases in Cas phosphorylation correlated with SFK activation, the levels of c-Src phosphorylation at either activating or inhibiting tyrosine residue (Y416 and Y527, respectively) were examined in SYF cells stably expressing c-Src, either stretched or left unstretched. We observed no changes in phosphorylation levels of those tyrosines (pY416 and pY527) (Figure 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Since the levels of pY416 and pY527 indicate Src kinase inhibition and activation, respectively (Thomas and Brugge, 1997Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Cellular functions regulated by Src family kinases.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar), cell stretching did not appear to affect c-Src activity, while Cas phosphorylation significantly increased. This was further confirmed by an in vitro kinase assay of immunoprecipitated c-Src (Figure 1C). Thus, stretching intact cells increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by c-Src without detectable enhancement of c-Src kinase activity. To explore the role of Cas in physiological force transduction pathways, we analyzed the involvement of Cas in the stretch-dependent activation of Rap1 in cells (Sawada et al., 2001Sawada Y. Nakamura K. Doi K. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Morita K. Komuro I. De Vos K. Sheetz M. Ichijo H. Rap1 is involved in cell stretching modulation of p38 but not ERK or JNK MAP kinase.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the level of Cas protein and phosphorylated Cas was selectively decreased by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HEK293 cells (Figure 2A, upper panel), Rap1 activity in cells, either stretched or unstretched, was significantly attenuated (Figure 2A, lower panel). Thus, Cas plays a significant role in the stretch-dependent activation of Rap1 in intact cells. However, there is likely more than one pathway for Rap1 activation, considering the fold decrease of Rap1 activity (∼50%) in Cas knockdown cells (Figure 2A) as well as the stretch-dependent Rap1 activation observed in Cas-deficient fibroblasts (data not shown). To further examine the role of phosphorylation of Cas in stretch-dependent Rap1 activation, we overexpressed Cas together with Rap1 in HEK293 cells. Upon coexpression of monomeric red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged wild-type Cas (RFP-Cas) with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rap1 (GFP-Rap1), stretch-dependent activity of GFP-Rap1 was enhanced over the cells coexpressing RFP alone or RFP-Cas15YF that had all 15 YxxP motifs in the substrate domain mutated to FxxP (Figure 2B). The fold increase of Rap1 activity by cell stretching appeared to be smaller in the case of RFP-Cas-expressing cells, probably due to the less efficient incorporation of “overexpressed” Cas into physiological signaling complexes. However, we conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is responsible for a significant fraction of the stretch-dependent Rap1 activation. Because kinase activation did not appear to be the primary mechanism regulating Cas phosphorylation in response to cell stretching (Figures 1B and 1C), we tested whether the mechanical extension of the Cas substrate domain modulated its susceptibility to phosphorylation by SFKs. To eliminate the involvement of any extraneous molecules, we performed biochemical analysis, using an IPE system. In that system, bacterially expressed Cas substrate domain protein, CasSD (Cas115–420), was biotinylated on both amino and carboxy termini (designated NC-biotinylated CasSD, Figure 3A, top) and was bound to avidin covalently immobilized on a latex substrate (Figure 3A). After stretching of the latex membrane (Figure 3A), biochemical analyses were performed. To determine if stretching of the latex membrane actually extended NC-biotinylated CasSD, we developed the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) amino-terminal swapping assay based on the interaction between the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of YFP. In this assay, CasSD extension was detected by the separation of YFP components attached to the ends of CasSD, causing the binding of an exogenous YFP component. When the two halves of a split YFP, YFP-N and YFP-C, were fused to the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends of NC-biotinylated CasSD, respectively (NY/CY-NC-biotinylated CasSD, Figure 3B), we observed yellow fluorescence in both NY/CY-NC-biotinylated CasSD-expressing bacteria and the purified protein, as expected (Hu et al., 2002Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Visualization of interactions among bZIP and Rel family proteins in living cells using bimolecular fluorescence complementation.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). When we added purified His6-YFP-N to bind to YFP-C in NY/CY-NC biotinylated CasSD (Figure 3B, top), His6-YFP-N binding was not observed without latex membrane stretching (Figure 3C, lane 1). However, we observed His6-YFP-N binding upon stretching (Figure 3C, lane 2). Furthermore, His6-YFP-N did not bind to NY/CY-C-biotinylated CasSD (the unextendable mono-biotinylated control, Figure 3B, bottom) or NC-biotinylated CasSD (extendable, but with no YFP component, Figure 3A, top) even following stretching (Figure 3C, lanes 3–6). Using His6-YFP-N together with YFP-C fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in a GST pull-down experiment, we found that YFP-N bound to YFP-C under the same buffer conditions used in the YFP amino-terminal swapping assay (data not shown). Thus, stretching of the latex membrane separated the YFP halves in NY/CY-NC-biotinylated CasSD and allowed His6-YFP-N to bind, indicating the extension of CasSD (Figure 3B, top). Since CasSD could be extended by the IPE system, we examined the effect of extension on tyrosine phosphorylation of CasSD by recombinant active c-Src. While the level of phosphorylation was low without stretching (Figure 4A, lane 1), CasSD phosphorylation increased in proportion to the magnitude of latex membrane stretching (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, and 150%) (Figure 4A, lanes 2–6). An unextendable mono-biotinylated CasSD (C-biotinylated CasSD, see Figure 3A, top) was poorly tyrosine phosphorylated either with or without stretching (Figure 4A, lanes 7 and 8). To test if c-Src kinase activity was modulated in the IPE experiments, we added acid-treated enolase to the kinase mixture at the time of kinase reaction and measured its phosphorylation. In the same reaction that gave an extension-dependent increase in CasSD phosphorylation, neither the level of enolase phosphorylation nor the phosphorylation levels of Y416 and Y527 of c-Src kinase were affected by stretching (data not shown). These results indicated that extension-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of CasSD resulted from CasSD extension and not from an increase in the kinase activity of recombinant c-Src. We also asked whether or not other kinases phosphorylated CasSD in an extension-dependent manner in IPE experiments. Neither the non-SFK tyrosine kinase Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) nor ZAP-70 phosphorylated NC-biotinylated CasSD, even after stretching (Figure 4B). However, in the same kinase reaction protocol, both Csk and ZAP-70 were able to phosphorylate their known substrates, acid-treated enolase (Bougeret et al., 1993Bougeret C. Rothhut B. Jullien P. Fischer S. Benarous R. Recombinant Csk expressed in Escherichia coli is autophosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s).Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1241-1247PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic fragment of human erythrocyte band 3 (cdb3) (Isakov et al., 1996Isakov N. Wange R.L. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. Purification and characterization of human ZAP-70 protein-tyrosine kinase from a baculovirus expression system.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15753-15761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), respectively (data not shown). On the other hand, a known Cas kinase, Abl (Mayer et al., 1995Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Evidence that SH2 domains promote processive phosphorylation by protein-tyrosine kinases.Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and another SFK, FynT, phosphorylated CasSD in an extension-dependent manner (Figure 4B). Thus, extension-dependent phosphorylation of CasSD in vitro is caused in a kinase-specific manner, and not by a nonspecific effect of the IPE system. Although neither the force needed for CasSD extension nor its effect on individual YxxP motifs in CasSD is known, the IPE experiments revealed that different extents of extension induced the phosphorylation of different regions. When we used two different anti-phospho-Cas antibodies (pCas-165 and pCas-410) that had different, though not strictly specific, binding preferences for YxxPs in the Cas substrate domain (Shin et al., 2004Shin N.Y. Dise R.S. Schneider-Mergener J. Ritchie M.D. Kilkenny D.M. Hanks S.K. Subsets of the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Crk-associated substrate (CAS) are sufficient to promote cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38331-38337Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to measure the in vitro CasSD phosphorylation, pCas-410 immunoblotting gave significantly greater fold increase than pCas-165 blots by 40% latex membrane stretching (Figure 4C, left panel). However, pCas-165 and pCas-410 blots showed a similar fold increase by 100% stretching (Figure 4C, right panel). These results suggest that the pCas-410 sites are more efficiently exposed and phosphorylated than pCas-165 sites by smaller extent of CasSD extension. In order to test if Cas was extended in regions of cell traction forces, we utilized an antibody, αCas1, which was raised against a peptide sequence in the Cas substrate domain (Sakai et al., 1994Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. A novel signaling molecule, p130, forms stable complexes in vivo with v-Crk and v-Src in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). We found that αCas1 recognized the extended NC-biotinylated CasSD and not the unextended control, C-biotinylated CasSD in the IPE system (Figure 5A). Further, αCas1 bound to SDS-denatured CasSD regardless of its phosphorylation state (Figure S1B), as well as full-length Cas in the SDS-denatured cell lysates (Figure S1C). Thus, αCas1 binding appeared to require the exposure of its epitope in the Cas substrate domain by either extension or denaturation. Using αCas1, we examined whether Cas was extended by stretching Triton cytoskeletons where tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was observed (Tamada et al., 2004Tamada M. Sheetz M.P. Sawada Y. Activation of a signaling cascade by cytoskeleton stretch.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When we stretched Triton cytoskeletons from Cas-deficient fibroblasts expressing RFP-Cas, we observed a significant increase in αCas1 binding (Figure 5B, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2). Triton cytoskeletons from Cas-deficient fibroblasts expressing RFP alone did not bind αCas1 (Figure 5B, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). Further, another anti-Cas antibody, αCas3, the epitope of which did not involve the substrate domain (Figure S1A) (Sakai et al., 1994Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. A novel signaling molecule, p130, forms stable complexes in vivo with v-Crk and v-Src in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), did not change its binding to Cas in Triton cytoskeletons upon stretching (Figure 5B, lower panel, lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that the extension of the Cas substrate domain is enhanced by cytoskeleton stretching. Cas extension was difficult to observe in intact cells, since the cell stretching system could not fit onto a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) or confocal microscope. Further, the stretchable substrate (silicone) had high background fluorescence. Therefore, we looked at αCas1 immunostaining of intact cells during the late phase of spreading on collagen-coated glass coverslips (20 min after plating), when the fast movement of actin cytoskeletons at the periphery is observed (Dubin-Thaler et al., 2004Dubin-Thaler B.J. Giannone G. Dobereiner H.G. Sheetz M.P. Nanometer analysis of cell spreading on matrix-coated surfaces reveals two distinct cell states and STEPs.Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1794-1806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the forces required for continuous spreading are generated (Giannone et al., 2004Giannone G. Dubin-Thaler B.J. Dobereiner H.G. Kieffer N. Bresnick A.R. Sheetz M.P. Periodic lamellipodial contractions correlate with rearward actin waves.Cell. 2004; 116: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In RFP-Cas-expressing Cas-deficient fibroblasts, we found that αCas1 staining primarily colocalized with RFP-Cas in the peripheral regions (Figure 5C, top). An anti-phospho-Cas antibody (pCas-165) also exhibited a peripheral staining in the late spreading cells (Figure 5C, bottom), confirming that Cas extension correlated with phosphorylation. These staining patterns did not appear to be artifacts of antibody staining, since αCas3 staining always colocalized with RFP-Cas (Figure 5C, middle). Considering the specificity of αCas1 and αCas3 in immunoblotting (Figure S1C), both αCas1 and αCas3 staining most likely represent the distribution of their Cas epitopes, and not the crossreaction with other cellular protein(s). Indeed, we observed only faint background staining in untransfected Cas-deficient fibroblasts with either αCas1 or αCas3 (data not shown). These in situ (cytoskeleton stretching) (Figure 5B) and in vivo (intact cell spreading) (Figure 5C) results, together with the observed preference of αCas1 binding for extended CasSD in vitro (Figure 5A), suggest that the in vitro extension of CasSD causes the conformational change of CasSD that is relevant to the force-dependent conformational change of Cas protein in vivo. Therefore, the extension-dependent phosphorylation of CasSD in vitro (Figure 4) appears to be relevant to the force-dependent phosphorylation of Cas in vivo (Figures 1, 2, and 5C). Cas appears to act as a force transducer in vivo, since the knockdown of Cas expression by siRNA significantly attenuated stretch-dependent Rap1 activity (Figure 2A) and overexpression of wild-type Cas, but not coexpression of the phosphorylation-defective Cas mutant (Cas15YF) enhanced stretch-dependent Rap1 activity (Figure 2B). Phosphorylation by SFK is critical since stretch-dependent Cas phosphorylation was inhibited by the SFK inhibitor CGP77675 (Figure 1A) and attenuated in SYF cells (Figures 1B and 1C). These findings conform to our previous observation of stretch-dependent Cas phosphorylation by SFK in cytoskeletal complexes (Triton cytoskeletons) (Tamada et al., 2004Tamada M. Sheetz M.P. Sawada Y. Activation of a signaling cascade by cytoskeleton stretch.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas upon cell stretching constitutes a significant pathway for stretch-dependent Rap1 activation in intact cells (Sawada et al., 2001Sawada Y. Nakamura K. Doi K. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Morita K. Komuro I. De Vos K. Sheetz M. Ichijo H. Rap1 is involved in cell stretching modulation of p38 but not ERK or JNK MAP kinase.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Src was shown to be mechanically activated using genetically engineered reporters (Wang et al., 2005Wang Y. Botvinick E.L. Zhao Y. Berns M.W. Usami S. Tsien R.Y. Chien S. Visualizing the mechanical activation of Src.Nature. 2005; 434: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), it is not clear how endogenous c-Src is activated or if it is indirectly activated by force. We observed that Src-dependent phosphorylation of Cas was significantly increased by stretching in c-Src-expressing SYF cells without causing Src kinase activation (Figures 1B and 1C). These findings suggest that activation of the kinase is not primarily responsible for stretch-dependent increase of Cas phosphorylation in vivo. Since the SFK inhibitor greatly attenuated the stretch-dependent increase of Cas phosphorylation (Figure 1A), stretch-dependent alteration of phosphatase activity is also unlikely to be the cause. Further, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate did not inhibit stretch-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in Triton cytoskeletons (Tamada et al., 2004Tamada M. Sheetz M.P. Sawada Y. Activation of a signaling cascade by cytoskeleton stretch.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that stretching causes the spatial interaction between the kinase and the substrate, considering the constraints that such a mechanism places on the geometry of the cytoskeleton (Tamada et al., 2004Tamada M. Sheetz M.P. Sawada Y. Activation of a signaling cascade by cytoskeleton stretch.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Since a mechanical modification of the substrate (Cas) was sufficient to increase Cas phosphorylation in vitro, we have focused on the analysis of that possibility. Both the amino-terminal SH3 and carboxy-terminal Src-binding domains are required for Cas localization at focal adhesions (Nakamoto et al., 1997Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Requirements for localization of p130cas to focal adhesions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), where cellular force is expected to be concentrated, and force-dependent signaling involving tyrosine phosphorylation occurs (Geiger and Bershadsky, 2002Geiger B.

Sawada Y. Activation of a signaling cascade by cytoskeleton stretch.Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Since different proteins are known to associate with SH3 and Src-binding domains of Cas (Defilippi et al., 2006Defilippi P. Di Stefano P. Cabodi S. p130Cas: A versatile scaffold in signaling networks.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), an individual Cas molecule would be anchored to the cytoskeleton-adhesion complex via two distinct sites. In addition, the SH3 domain of Cas binds to FAK (focal adhesion kinase) (Harte et al., 1996Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. p130Cas, a substrate associated with v-Src and v-Crk, localizes to focal adhesions and binds to focal adhesion kinase.J. Biol.

FAK has a FERM (erythrocyte band 4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin) domain commonly found in actin-binding proteins (Lee et al., 2004Lee H.S. Bellin R.M. Walker D.L. Patel B. Powers P. Liu H.

While folates are absorbed in the acidic milieu of the upper small intestine, the underlying absorption mechanism has not been defined. We now report the identification of a human proton-coupled, high-affinity folate transporter that recapitulates properties of folate transport and absorption in intestine and in various cell types at low pH. We demonstrate that a loss-of-function mutation in this gene is the molecular basis for hereditary folate malabsorption in a family with this disease. This transporter was previously reported to be a lower-affinity, pH-independent heme carrier protein, HCP1. However, the current study establishes that a major function of this gene product is proton-coupled folate transport required for folate homeostasis in man, and we have thus amended the name to PCFT/HCP1.

Folates are essential cofactors that are required for the provision of one-carbon moieties in key biosynthetic and epigenetic processes (Stover, 2004Stover P.J. Physiology of folate and vitamin B12 in health and disease.Nutr. Rev. 2004; 62: S3-S12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Folate deficiency is prevalent in underdeveloped countries, and even in the Western world, subtle deficiency is a public health problem that is most notable in its association with neural tube defects in the developing embryo (Eichholzer et al., 2006Eichholzer M. Tonz O. Zimmermann R. Folic acid: A public-health challenge.Lancet. 2006; 367: 1352-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Mammals cannot synthesize folates; hence, dietary sources must meet metabolic needs, necessitating an efficient intestinal absorptive mechanism. Absorption of folates occurs primarily in the duodenum and upper jejunum and involves a carrier-mediated process with a low-pH optimum that operates efficiently within the acidic microclimate of the intestinal surface in this region (Selhub and Rosenberg, 1981Selhub J.

The specificity and other properties of this process have been well established, and similar folate transport activities with a low-pH optimum have been identified in other normal tissues and in human solid tumor cell lines (Horne, 1993Horne D.W.

Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Despite the prevalence and importance of this process, a folate transport protein with a low-pH optimum has not been identified. There are two known highly specific mammalian folate transporters. Their properties were the subject of a recent review (Matherly and Goldman, 2003Matherly L.H. Goldman D.I. Membrane transport of folates.Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1) is a facilitative transporter with the characteristics of an anion exchanger. There are two GPI-linked folate receptors, high-affinity binding proteins that mediate cellular uptake by an endocytic mechanism. Folate receptor expression in small intestine is negligible. While the reduced folate carrier is expressed on the brush border membrane of intestinal cells, this transporter has a neutral pH optimum and a specificity profile that differs substantially from that observed in intestinal folate absorption and transport into intestinal cells and cells of other tissue origin at low pH (Selhub and Rosenberg, 1981Selhub J.

Further, when reduced folate carrier function is lost due to deletion, mutation, or loss of expression of the gene, the low-pH folate transport activity remains intact (Zhao et al., 2004Zhao R.

This report describes the identification of a proton-coupled, electrogenic, high-affinity folate transporter with properties that are similar to folate transport in intestinal and other cells at low pH. A database mining approach was utilized based on the conserved amino acid sequence of SLC19 family members and the screening of candidate mRNAs in cell lines developed in this laboratory in which the reduced folate carrier was deleted but the low pH activity was either retained or markedly decreased (Zhao et al., 2004Zhao R. Gao F. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D.

Antifolate resistance in a HeLa cell line associated with impaired transport independent of the reduced folate carrier.Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 10: 8735-8742Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Having identified this carrier as a candidate intestinal folate transporter, we demonstrate a loss-of-function mutation in this gene in a family with the syndrome of hereditary folate malabsorption. To identify the low-pH folate transporter, the Ensembl human peptide database was mined at low stringency as described in the Experimental Procedures. Twenty-three human genes encoding membrane proteins with unknown functions were identified, and mRNA expression levels were screened in two HeLa cell lines developed in this laboratory: (1) the HeLa-R5 (Zhao et al., 2004Zhao R. Gao F. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. A prominent low-pH methotrexate transport activity in human solid tumor cells: Contribution to the preservation of methotrexate pharmacological activity in HeLa cells lacking the reduced folate carrier.Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) cell line, which has a genomic deletion of the reduced folate carrier gene but a high level of low-pH folate transport activity and (2) the HeLa-R1 line (Zhao et al., 2005aZhao R. Chattopadhyay S. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. Antifolate resistance in a HeLa cell line associated with impaired transport independent of the reduced folate carrier.Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 10: 8735-8742Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a HeLa-R5 derivative, cloned by antifolate selective pressure, in which the low-pH activity is markedly diminished. Gene 21 (to be referred to as G21) was identified in this screen as a likely candidate based on a high mRNA level in HeLa-R5 cells versus a very low level of expression in HeLa-R1 cells (Figure 1A). G21 (GenBank accession number NP_542400) is predicted to be a membrane protein of 459 amino acids with a MW of ≈50 kDa. A BLAST search of the Swissprot database revealed that the human protein shares 91% similarity and 87% identity to both its mouse and rat counterparts (GenBank accession numbers AAH57976 and AAH89868). During the course of the studies described below, this protein was reported by another group to be a heme carrier protein (HCP1) and entered into GenBank as such (Shayeghi et al., 2005Shayeghi M. Latunde-Dada G.O. Oakhill J.S. Laftah A.H. Takeuchi K. Halliday N. Khan Y. Warley A. McCann F.E. Hider R.C. et al.Identification of an intestinal heme transporter.Cell. 2005; 122: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This protein was designated as SLC46A1 in the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Nomenclature Committee Database. Folate transport properties mediated by this carrier were assessed by injection of G21 cRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes. As indicated in Figure 1B, uptake of 2 μM [3H]folic acid and [3H]methotrexate (MTX) was increased >200-fold in G21 cRNA-injected oocytes at pH 5.5 as compared to water-injected oocytes. Similarly, uptake of these folates into HepG2 cells stably transfected with G21 cDNA (Figure 1C) and into HeLa cells transiently transfected with G21 cDNA (Figure 1D) was increased >30- and >13-fold, respectively. A western blot using a polyclonal antibody directed to the C terminus of G21 indicated a broad band in G21 cRNA-injected, but not water-injected, Xenopus oocytes and in HepG2 cells stably transfected with this cDNA, but not in mock-transfected cells (Figure 1E). Differences in migration in the two systems may be due to differences in glycosylation. When expressed in HeLa cells, G21 protein targeted to the plasma membrane in permeabilized cells as demonstrated with the polyclonal antibody (Figure 1F). Staining could not be detected in mock-transfected HeLa cells (data not shown). Transport of folates mediated by G21 was highly pH dependent, as illustrated for tritiated folic acid (Figure 2A), (6S)5-methyltetrahydrofolate [(6S)5-MTHF, Figure 2B], MTX (Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), and (6S)5-formyltetrahydrofolate [(6S)5-FTHF; Figure S1B]. Activity was highest at the lowest pH and declined as the pH was increased, although the pattern of decrease, and the extent of retention of activity at neutral pH, was different among the folates. For both (6S)5-MTHF, the major blood folate in man and rodents, and (6S)5-FTHF, there was residual activity at pH 7.5, and for all the folates there was substantial activity at pH 6.5. The dependence of G21 activity on the inward-directed electrochemical H+ gradient was further characterized by exposure of Xenopus oocytes to carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), an ionophore that collapses the transmembrane H+ gradient (Benz and McLaughlin, 1983Benz R. McLaughlin S. The molecular mechanism of action of the proton ionophore FCCP (carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone).Biophys. J. 1983; 41: 381-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2C and Figure S1C, respectively, at an extracellular pH of 5.5, [3H]folic acid and [3H]MTX uptake were markedly decreased by 10 μM FCCP. Uptake mediated by G21 conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km for [3H]folic acid uptake, which increased as pH increased, from 1.3 ± 0.1 μM at pH 5.5 to 56.2 ± 5.6 μM at pH 7.5 (Figures 2D–2H). Vmax and Km were evaluated as a function of pH using the same batch of oocytes, each injected with the same amount of G21 cRNA. As shown in Figure 2G, the Vmax for folic acid uptake decreased from 13 pmol/oocyte/hr at pH 5.5 to 5 pmol/oocyte/hr at pH 7.5. The major change (2.4-fold) occurred over the pH range of 5.5 to 6.5, with only a small decline beyond pH 6.5. The pattern of change was different for the folic acid Km measured at the same time. There was a small (2.6-fold) increase in Km as the pH was increased from 5.5 to 7.0, but there was a 18-fold increase when the pH was increased from 7.0 to 7.5. Figure 2H indicates a 2- to 3-fold higher uptake Km for MTX as compared to folic acid over this pH range, with a similar pattern of increase as the pH was increased. Figure 3A shows the inhibitory effects of a variety of compounds, at a concentration of 20 μM, on uptake of 2 μM [3H]folic acid into Xenopus oocytes injected with G21 cRNA. There was a high degree of structural specificity among the folate/antifolate compounds tested; pemetrexed was the most potent competitor. This is an antifolate inhibitor of thymidylate synthase with the highest affinity for the low-pH transporter in human tumor cell lines (Zhao et al., 2005bZhao R. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D.

Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6256-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Transport is stereospecific; the natural 6S isomer of 5-FTHF was more potent than the unnatural 6R isomer in reducing [3H]folic acid uptake. The 6S isomer of 5-MTHF had effects comparable to those of (6S)5-FTHF. MTX was a less effective competitor than folic acid, consistent with the difference in transport Kms. PT523 is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor with a high affinity for the reduced folate carrier at high and low pH but a very low affinity (Ki > 50 μM) for the low-pH folate transporter in HeLa and other cells (Zhao et al., 2005bZhao R.

Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6256-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This antifolate did not inhibit under these conditions. All the folates that inhibited [3H]folic acid uptake are transport substrates of G21. Thus, the inhibition of [3H]folic acid uptake was due to competition for transport via G21. Figure 3B compares the structures of these folate compounds. The major difference between PT523 and the other folates/antifolates is at the γ-carboxyl moiety, suggesting the importance of this group to folate binding to G21. Bromosulphopthalein, para-aminohippuric acid, taurocholic acid, cholic acid, and estrone-3-sulfate, substrates for organic anion solute carriers (SLC21 and SLC 22) (Hagenbuch and Meier, 2003Hagenbuch B.

The SLC22 drug transporter family.Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), did not inhibit [3H]folic acid influx. Hemin was a weak inhibitor. At a [3H]folic acid concentration of 2 μM, 100 μM hemin inhibited uptake by 42% ± 7% in Xenopus oocytes injected with G21 cRNA and by 30% ± 5% in HepG2 cells stably transfected with G21 cDNA. In the same experiments, 100 μM nonlabeled folic acid inhibited 2 μM [3H]folic acid uptake by 92% ± 2% and 90% ± 0.02%, respectively (based on the average of three separate experiments at pH 6.5). Electrophysiological characteristics were evaluated in two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments. In G21 cRNA-injected oocytes, folic acid, (6S)5-MTHF, and MTX induced currents of up to 80 nA at a −80 mV holding potential (Figure 4A). These folates did not induce current in water-injected oocytes. These substrate-induced currents imply that net charge translocation occurred across the cell membrane during each transport cycle. Consistent with this, substrate currents were proportional to both applied voltage and substrate concentration, increasing with more negative voltage and higher substrate concentration (Figures 4B–4D and Figure 5).Figure 5Concentration Dependence of Substrate-Induced CurrentsShow full caption(A) Currents recorded from an individual oocyte in response to (from left to right) 0.1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 120 μM MTX (pH 5.5, Vh = −80 mV).

In order to distinguish between whether folate transport was coupled to proton transport (i.e., protons are transported with the folate) or whether protons just bind to the transporter and regulate its activity, we determined the effect of changing extracellular pH from 5.5 to 7.5 on the substrate current-voltage relationship. The reversal potential of the current-voltage relationship is the voltage at which the substrate-induced current is zero (the x axis intercept in Figures 4C and 4D) and is a measure of the net driving force for substrate transport. If folate and proton transport are coupled, then the reversal potential would become more negative as the extracellular pH is raised, and the slope would decrease. In contrast, if the folate transport rate were only regulated by pH, then the slope of the current-voltage relationship would decrease, but the reversal potential would not change. As the pH increased, the reversal potential became more negative (Figures 4C and 4D). Changing the pH from 5.5 to 6.5 shifted the reversal potentials for MTX and (6S)5-MTHF by −8 mV and −6 mV, respectively, whereas increasing the pH from 6.5 to 7.5 shifted the reversal potentials by −36 mV and −30 mV, respectively. This change in the reversal potential with a change in pH provides direct evidence that the transmembrane proton gradient is coupled to folate transport. These results are consistent with the loss of net proton influx driving transport, as the extracellular pH increased to a value comparable to an intracellular pH of ∼7.3. At pH 7.5, the transmembrane proton gradient is close to zero, and folate influx is driven solely by the folate concentration gradient due to the higher extracellular folate concentration. Thus, the reversal potential is more negative at pH 7.5 than at lower pHs where the transmembrane proton gradient also contributes to the net driving force for transport. Figure 5A shows the currents recorded from an individual oocyte as the extracellular MTX concentration was increased from 0.1 to 120 μM. Current was detected at a MTX concentration as low as 0.1 μM. Figure 5B illustrates the dependence of current on the MTX concentration at pH 5.5 and 6.5. The Kms for folic acid, (6S)5-MTHF, and MTX (Figure 5C), and their pH dependence, were comparable in the electrophysiological and the tritiated substrate uptake assays (Figures 2H and 5C). The Kms at pH 6.5 for folic acid and MTX were nearly four times greater than those at pH 5.5, while the Km for (6S)5-MTHF was only minimally increased. The relative current magnitude induced by the different substrates was assessed by applying saturating concentrations of each substrate to the same oocyte at pH 5.5 (Figure 4A). When normalized to the (6S)5-MTHF-induced current magnitude, the current amplitudes were 39% ± 6% and 86% ± 11% (n = 8) larger for folic acid and MTX, respectively, despite the fact that the latter substrates had higher Kms (Figure 5C). This implies that the transport Vmax for these substrates was higher than that for (6S)5-MTHF. An attempt was made to determine if hemin transport could be detected by current flow into oocytes injected with G21 cRNA. In two separate experiments using two different batches of oocytes, three to four oocytes for each condition, folic acid produced substantial currents, while no current could be detected with 100 μM hemin either when hemin was stabilized with 0.1% bovine serum albumin or with 200 μM arginine (data not shown). If hemin were transported by G21 in an electrogenic fashion similar to the folates, then the “expected” currents from this approximately EC50 hemin concentration (reported hemin Km of 125 μM [Shayeghi et al., 2005Shayeghi M. Latunde-Dada G.O. Oakhill J.S. Laftah A.H. Takeuchi K. Halliday N. Khan Y. Warley A. McCann F.E. Hider R.C. et al.Identification of an intestinal heme transporter.Cell. 2005; 122: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar]) would be well within the detection limits of this system. Substitution of extracellular Na+ with N-methyl-glucosamine did not decrease [3H]MTX uptake into G21 cRNA-injected oocytes, excluding a sodium-dependent process. Similarly, folic acid-induced currents were unchanged when K+, Ca2+, or Mg2+ was removed from the extracellular solution or when the extracellular Cl− concentration was reduced from 95.6 mM to 5.6 mM by replacement of NaCl with Na-gluconate. Thus, folate transport was not dependent on extracellular Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, or Cl−, implying that none of these ions are involved in the folate transport cycle (data not shown). G21 mRNA levels were examined in a variety of human tissues by northern blotting (Figure 6A). After hybridization followed by high stringency washes, two G21 mRNA forms were detected with molecular sizes of ≈2.7 kb and 2.1 kb. The latter, short form was dominant, with a molecular size consistent with G21 mRNA in the NCBI database (2.096 kb; GenBank accession number NM_080669). Substantial amounts of both G21 mRNA forms were detected in kidney, liver, placenta, small intestine, and spleen, and to a lesser extent, in colon and testis. There was very low expression in brain, lung, stomach, heart, and muscle. A smaller G21 transcript (∼1 kb) was detected in brain, heart, and kidney, and an even smaller transcript was detected in liver (∼0.5 kb). Quantitative RT-PCR was employed to further quantify G21 mRNA expression in intestine along with two human tumor cell lines (Figure 6B). Expression in Caco2 cells, a colon carcinoma cell line, was >7-fold higher than that in HeLa cells. In intestine, the highest level of mRNA expression was in duodenum, with lesser expression in jejunum and lower levels in ileum, cecum, segments of the colon, and rectum. Consistent with the northern blot, there was a high level of expression in liver. As indicated above, Caco2 cells have a very high level of G21 mRNA expression. To establish the extent to which constitutive low-pH folate transport activity in Caco2 cells could be attributed to this transporter, two small hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors, targeted to two different regions of the G21 transcript, were stably cotransfected into Caco2 cells. This resulted in a 55% reduction in [3H]folic acid influx at pH 5.5 and a similar (50%) decrease in G21 mRNA as quantified by RT-PCR (Figure 6C). Wild-type Caco2 cells were subjected to transient transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex using the Amaxa system, resulting in a 60% reduction in [3H]MTX influx and a 50% decrease in G21 mRNA as compared to negative siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 6D). When the stably transfected Caco2 cells were also subjected to transient transfection with the Amaxa protocol, there was a further suppression of G21 mRNA, resulting in an 80% decrease in [3H]MTX influx at pH 5.5 and a 75% decrease in G21 mRNA as compared to vector control-transfected cells (Figure 6E). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that G21 is the major, and possibly the only, low-pH folate transporter in Caco2 cells. Hereditary folate malabsorption (OMIM 229050) is a rare recessive familial disorder characterized by signs and symptoms of folate deficiency that appear within a few months after birth. Infants exhibit low blood and cerebrospinal fluid folate levels with anemia, diarrhea, immune deficiency, infections, and neurological deficits. There is a profound defect in intestinal folate absorption (Geller et al., 2002Geller J. Kronn D. Jayabose S. Sandoval C. Hereditary folate malabsorption: Family report and review of the literature.Medicine (Baltimore). 2002; 81: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether an alteration in G21 is the molecular basis for this disorder, blood was obtained from a family with progeny manifesting this disease that were the subject of a recent report (Geller et al., 2002Geller J. Kronn D. Jayabose S. Sandoval C. Hereditary folate malabsorption: Family report and review of the literature.Medicine (Baltimore). 2002; 81: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; Figure 7A). The mother and father were both normal, one of their children died in infancy, and two of their other daughters displayed classical signs and symptoms of hereditary folate malabsorption. One daughter was diagnosed at the age of 8 months with a serum folate level of 0.2 nM (normal: 10–30 nM), and the other daughter was diagnosed at the age of 2 months with a blood folate level of less than 0.2 nM. Both children were treated with high doses of oral 5-FTHF with complete resolution of the signs and symptoms of their disease; they have developed normally and remain completely well on their folate supplement now at ages 9 and 6. G21 is composed of five exons and four introns (Figure 7B). Each of the five exons of G21 along with their flanking intron regions was sequenced from these family members. This revealed a homozygous mutation in G21 from both daughters and the same mutation in one allele of G21 from each parent (Figure 7C). This G to A mutation (position 5882; GenBank accession number DQ496103) is located in the splice acceptor of intron 2 (intron 2/exon 3 boundary). To determine the consequences of this genomic mutation on RNA splicing, the exon 3 region of G21 mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR from these family members. Two DNA fragments of 579 bp and 495 bp were detected from the parents' transformed lymphocyte cDNAs, whereas in the daughters only a single DNA fragment was detected with a size identical to the shorter fragment from the parents. In comparison, the control cDNA from normal intestine exhibited a single amplified DNA fragment that was identical in size to the longer DNA fragment from the parents (Figure 7D).

We present a multiscale mathematical model of cancer invasion, which considers cellular and microenvironmental factors simultaneously and interactively. Unexpectedly, the model simulations predict that harsh tumor microenvironment conditions (e.g., hypoxia, heterogenous extracellular matrix) exert a dramatic selective force on the tumor, which grows as an invasive mass with fingering margins, dominated by a few clones with aggressive traits. In contrast, mild microenvironment conditions (e.g., normoxia, homogeneous matrix) allow clones with similar aggressive traits to coexist with less aggressive phenotypes in a heterogeneous tumor mass with smooth, noninvasive margins. Thus, the genetic make-up of a cancer cell may realize its invasive potential through a clonal evolution process driven by definable microenvironmental selective forces. Our mathematical model provides a theoretical/experimental framework to quantitatively characterize this selective pressure for invasion and test ways to eliminate it.

Our mathematical model provides a theoretical/experimental framework to quantitatively characterize this selective pressure for invasion and test ways to eliminate it. It is widely accepted that tumors evolve by clonal selection of cell populations that proliferate in an unconstrained manner, accumulate mutations, and compete for nutrients or space (Nowell, 1976Nowell P.C. The clonal evolution of tumor cell populations.Science. 1976; 194: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). In the current paradigm, as a result of mutation in critical genes, the cancer tissue becomes increasingly aggressive, locally invasive, and ultimately metastatic (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis.Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9531) Google Scholar). While it is easy to envision the elements of selection for nutrients or space in tumor growth (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20695) Google Scholar), selective pressure for invasion and metastasis is less obvious (Liotta and Kohn, 2003Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. Cancer's deadly signature.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 10-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The prevailing view is that geno/phenotypes that meet all requirements for metastasis are a rare occurrence in a primary tumor, in agreement with the observed inefficiency of metastasis (Liotta and Kohn, 2003Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. Cancer's deadly signature.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 10-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, this view has been seriously challenged by recent data showing that metastatic tumors bear a molecular signature that also dominates in the originating primary tumor (Ramaswamy et al., 2003Ramaswamy S. Ross K.N. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. A molecular signature of metastasis in primary solid tumors.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is little understanding of the paradox that certain cancers (e.g., small cell lung cancer) metastasize early, while still small, whereas other tumors (e.g., breast adenocarcinoma) metastasize as a function of size. Thus, the mechanism of selection for invasive cancer cells remains an open fundamental question in cancer biology. It is generally agreed that cancer invasion is the outcome of a complex, multifactorial interplay between cancer cells and the host tissue microenvironment since explanations of invasion based on single factors appear to be inadequate (Liotta and Kohn, 2001Liotta L.A. Kohn E.C. The microenvironment of the tumour-host interface.Nature. 2001; 411: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar). Mathematical modeling is an ideal approach for teasing apart mechanisms of cancer invasion because it can simultaneously and quantitatively consider interactions between multiple factors (Araujo and McElwain, 2004Araujo R.P.

Avascular growth, angiogenesis and vascular growth in solid tumours: the mathematical modelling of the stages of tumour development.Math. Comput. Model. 1996; 23: 47-87Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here we report from a multiscale mathematical model of cancer invasion results that show good predictive ability and intuitive links with cancer pathology and experimentation. In our mathematical model, the behavior of cancer cells is based on a set of equations for how individual cells grow, divide, move (both random and directed motion), mutate, and interact with each other (cell-cell adhesion, crowding) and the microenvironment (including consumption of nutrients and production of enzymes) (for a complete mathematical derivation, see Anderson, 2005Anderson A.R.A. A hybrid mathematical model of solid tumour invasion: The importance of cell adhesion.Math. Med. Biol. 2005; 22: 163-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). From a mathematical point of view, some of these variables are continuous (describing densities or concentrations rather than individual entities) and some discrete (describing single entities). Therefore, our primary approach is based on a hybrid discrete-continuum (HDC) model in which both discrete stochastic and continuum deterministic variables are coupled (Anderson, 2005Anderson A.R.A. A hybrid mathematical model of solid tumour invasion: The importance of cell adhesion.Math. Med. Biol. 2005; 22: 163-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, Anderson and Chaplain, 1998Anderson A.R.A. Chaplain M.A.J.

Theoret. Med. 2000; 2: 129-154Crossref Google Scholar). Because of its hybrid nature (cells treated as discrete entities and microenvironmental parameters treated as concentrations), the model can be directly linked to experimental measurements of those cellular and microenvironmental parameters recognized by cancer biologists as important in cancer invasion. Furthermore, the fundamental unit of the model is the cell, and the complex collective behavior of the tumor emerges as a consequence of interactions between factors influencing the life cycle and movement of individual cells. Since we are interested in predicting invasion, our model produces simulations of the growth of a vascularized solid tumor (though, for simplicity, mathematical representation of vascularization is kept to a minimum at this stage). To describe cell motility in mathematical terms, cells are located on a two-dimensional lattice (Figure 1) that represents the tissue domain in which cells live, including extracellular matrix and other factors. Cells are allowed to move to free neighboring positions on the lattice according to movement probabilities defined by the equations in Figure 1. The model calculates movement probabilities by first considering cell-matrix interactions that may drive motility. However, before any movement can occur, the influence of other crucial cellular parameters such as cell-cell adhesion and proliferation is also considered. To include these parameters, each cell is given an individual life cycle flow chart that takes into account both cell phenotype and microenvironmental influences (Figure 2). Its components include both basic metabolic processes, such as proliferation and oxygen consumption rates, as well as motility-related ones, such as the propensity to undergo haptotaxis and engage in cell-cell adhesion. In addition, interactions with the microenvironment are governed by three key continuous variables: extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecule concentration (denoted by f), the concentration of the matrix-degrading enzyme (MDE) (denoted by m) secreted by the cell to break down the ECM, and oxygen concentration (denoted by c). Note that oxygen could be representative of any nutrient or nutrients in general necessary for tumor cell survival. The ECM is the macromolecular environment surrounding cells and so has distinct composition and structure depending on the location of the tumor (e.g., lung, breast, prostate, bone, etc.). The equations describing cell interactions with ECM, MDEs, and oxygen are:Figure 2Cancer Cell Life Cycle and Mutation SchemesShow full captionIn the HDC model, the cancer cell life cycle enables decisions to be made about key functions, e.g., life, death, mutations, based on the interaction between individual cell phenotypes and the local microenvironment. The first step in the cycle is examination of the local microenvironment for each cell, e.g., oxygen concentration and proximity to other cells. Then, dependent on the individual cell phenotype, cells proliferate, die, or become quiescent. Mutations to another phenotype have a small probability of occurring at the time of cell division. Mutations are represented according to two distinct strategies: (A) Linear mutation scheme. In this scheme, cell phenotypes evolve via mutation in a linear direction along four increasingly aggressive, predetermined phenotypes (types I–IV), defined by traits indicated in the boxes. Once cells have reached type IV, they cannot mutate further or revert to a less aggressive phenotype; (B) Random mutation scheme. In this scheme, cell phenotypes are randomly chosen at the time of mutation from one of 100 predetermined phenotypes (initiated at the beginning of each simulation).

The Ni,j term in each of these represents a tumor cell located at lattice position (i,j) and is either one if a cell is present or zero if it is not. Oxygen is assumed to diffuse, decay naturally, and be consumed by the tumor. To minimize the modeling of tumor vascularization, oxygen production is proportional to the ECM macromolecule (MM) density. However, it must be stressed that uncoupling oxygen production from ECM density produces similar results in the simulations (data not shown). The multiscale nature of the HDC model facilitates incorporation, at a later time, of a complex angiogenesis supply model (Anderson and Chaplain, 1998Anderson A.R.A. Chaplain M.A.J. Continuous and discrete mathematical models of tumour-induced angiogenesis.Bull. Math. Biol. 1998; 60: 857-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), more sophisticated models for cell movement, more detailed modeling of intracellular processes, or other variables. The life-cycle flow chart is the core engine of the HDC model and provides a natural link between mathematics and biological experimentation (Figure 2). This is because each cell behaves on its own, based on a phenotype determined both by genetic make-up and microenvironmental interactions. The ability to assign a phenotype to each individual cell is a fundamental property of our HDC approach. The advantage of the HDC approach with phenotypes is perhaps best illustrated by its evolution from a previous, purely continuous treatment (Anderson et al., 2000Anderson A.R.A. Chaplain M.A.J. Newman E.L. Steele R.J.C. Thompson A.M. Mathematical modelling of tumour invasion and metastasis.J. Theoret. Med. 2000; 2: 129-154Crossref Google Scholar) in which all variables, including cells, were treated mathematically as continuous and solved as partial differential equations (changing in both space and time). In this earlier version (Figure 3, upper panels), simulation of tumor cells growing in a “bumpy” ECM (see below and legends to Figures 3 and 4A) mimics the contours of the matrix itself. In this model cells are a continuous variable and are represented as an average. Therefore, individual cell processes crucial to cancer, e.g., cell-cell adhesion, cannot be captured, thus limiting the link to experimental observation or validation. In a more evolved version, discretizing cells (Figure 3, middle panels) allows for better experimental validation of the model and allows for independent behavior of individual cells, e.g., competition for space. However, the model still lacks realism because all cells are assumed to be identical, in spite of the well-known coexistence of heterogeneous cell populations within tumors. For example, in the model run as in Figure 3 (middle panels), cells are all considered as having no cell-cell adhesion and the same proliferation rate. In the present version, the advantages of discretizing cells become dramatically apparent when individual phenotypes are assigned to each of the cells (Figure 3, lower panels). The phenotypes are defined by mutating traits (Figure 2 and Table 1A) based on current views of the invasive phenotype (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20695) Google Scholar). In the life-cycle flow chart, as in reality, mutations are propagated at the time of cell division (Figure 2). The simulation with individual cell phenotypes produces a tumor fingering pattern that is reminiscent of invading cancer (Figure 3, lower panels). The fingering is a direct outcome of the way individual cells interact with ECM and with each other in terms of adhesion. Cell death is also simulated as a consequence of oxygen deprivation, resulting in a tumor core of dead cells. It should be emphasized that individual cell traits can be included or excluded from the life cycle, based on their relative importance in the invasion process, as determined by experimentation.Figure 4Effect of Extracellular Matrix Structure on Tumor Morphology and Phenotype SelectionShow full caption(A) Heterogeneous ECM induces invasive tumor morphology.

(n = 20 simulations for each condition, representative results shown). To apply the model and simulate cancer invasion, initially we adopted a linear mutation scheme (Figure 2A). In this scheme, cells mutate unidirectionally along a linear pathway of four increasingly aggressive phenotypes with predefined traits and values shown in Table 1A. Such a scheme is reminiscent of the current models of tumor progression, generally referred to as “vogelgrams” (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis.Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9531) Google Scholar). The most aggressive phenotype (type IV) is characterized by shortest lag time to proliferation, highest oxygen consumption, highest ECM-degrading enzyme production, highest haptotactic migration rate, and no cell-cell adhesion (Table 1A). We simulated tumor cell proliferation in three distinct microenvironments, characterized by initial ECM conditions referred to as homogeneous, “bumpy,” and “grainy” (Figure 4A, upper panels). Bumpy and grainy ECM represent density variations at either the macroscale or at the same scale as the cells, respectively. Figure 4A, middle panels, shows the tumor morphology after simulated growth with the linear mutation scheme for 200 generations, approximately 4.5 months. Two distinct tumor morphologies emerge in the simulations, depending on the ECM structure: a mass with smooth margins in the homogeneous matrix, as opposed to a fingering mass in the heterogeneous matrices. There is an obvious resemblance between the tumor morphology in heterogenous ECM simulations and pathological specimens of locally invasive carcinoma. However, even though the tumor morphology is distinct, segregation of phenotypes in the three simulations is the same: dead cells in the middle, and the most aggressive phenotype on the boundary. This is not entirely surprising since dominance of the most aggressive phenotype in the linear mutation scheme is essentially predetermined owing to its unidirectionality. Therefore, as the simulation proceeds in time, as soon as cells mutate into phenotype IV, the most aggressive, they tend to dominate the tumor mass. This is somewhat realistic: as mentioned above, the progressive move of tumors toward increasingly aggressive phenotypes is currently explained by “vogelgram” models of accumulation of mutations (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis.Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9531) Google Scholar, Michor et al., 2004Michor F. Iwasa Y. Rajagopalan H. Lengauer C. Nowak M.A. Linear model of colon cancer initiation.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is also a common observation that tumors are comprised of genetically heterogenous populations of cells (Fidler, 2003Fidler I.J. The pathogenesis of cancer metastasis: the ‘seed and soil’ hypothesis revisited.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar), which may undergo complex competing interactions during tumor evolution. In order to eliminate the phenotype selection bias of the linear mutation scheme, and to introduce a larger element of phenotype diversity, we then adopted a random mutation scheme (Figure 2B) in which cells are allowed to “jump” without restrictions to one of 100 predefined phenotypes. These phenotypes are generated by randomly picking trait values with the same upper and lower bounds as the linear mutation scheme (Table 1A). In simulations for the same timeframe (Figure 4A, lower panels, and see Movies S1–S3 available with this article online), the morphology of tumors growing in the random mutation regime is similar to that of the linear mutation results (Figure 4A, middle panels): smooth margins on homogeneous matrix and fingering on both types of heterogeneous matrices. In contrast to the linear mutation, however, the random mutation scheme allows determination of which cell phenotypes are dominant at various points in the simulation without preselection bias. A striking result of the random mutation scheme is that even though each of the 100 phenotypes is equally likely to be chosen (via a mutation), only a select few actually dominate (Figure 4B; Table 1B). In general, at the end of the simulations, phenotypes selected by random mutation have the following traits: (1) zero cell-cell adhesion; (2) relatively low oxygen consumption; (3) high proliferation rate; and (4) high haptotaxis coefficient (Table 1A). These characteristics are very similar to the most aggressive phenotype in the linear mutation scheme, with the exception of oxygen consumption (Table 1A). These results indicate that either scheme provides a realistic outcome, i.e., evolution of tumors toward increasingly aggressive phenotypes. In both cases, it is important to realize that the heterogeneous conditions (bumpy or grainy matrix) drive selection toward a few dominant, very aggressive clones. In contrast, the homogeneous environment with the random mutation scheme allows for coexistence of many phenotypes, more or less aggressive. This difference appears to correlate with an emergent property of the corresponding tumor mass: under heterogeneous conditions, tumor morphology is invasive (fingering margins), whereas under homogeneous conditions morphology is noninvasive (smooth margins). This correlation is intriguing, but fingering morphology in the heterogeneous ECM could merely be due to superior ability to exploit local terrain by cells with higher haptotaxis coefficients. On the other hand, it could be that heterogeneous ECM is a “harsh” environment that acts as a selective force for better-adapted phenotypes. To test this possibility, we considered a different harsh enviroment, low oxygen (Figure 5A). An advantage of oxygen is that its value can be manipulated in the course of the simulation (this may be also possible from an experimental perspective). To avoid killing the tumor population completely we grew in silico tumors in an oxygen-rich enviroment (until t = 40). We then dropped the oxygen concentration to 25% of what it was and almost immediately tumor fingers begin to emanate from the smooth circular core. Afterwards, oxygen was treated as follows: t = 201–240 (high); t = 241–350 (low). The outcome is striking: under harsh conditions, when oxygen is in short supply, the morphology of the tumor is invasive (t = 200; t = 350). In mild conditions, the morphology is noninvasive (t = 40; t = 240). Note that in these simulations the initial ECM distribution was homogenous. An important benefit of this simulation approach is that at the same time as we simulate tumor growth we also track the numbers of the different phenotypes in the population. Figure 5B shows the resulting phenotype distribution for this simulation. The difference between the numbers of phenotypes in the high and low oxygen microenvironments is obvious and clearly shows the selective ability of the harsh microenvironment. It is noteworthy that the same three aggressive phenotypes dominate during both periods of low oxygen conditions and have similar aggressive traits as those selected by heterogeneous ECM (Table 1A). In contrast, under mild conditions (high oxygen) many clones coexist, marked by different levels of aggressiveness, similar to the homogeneous ECM. These results strengthen the notion that microenvironment conditions decide the invasive outcome of a tumor and suggest a mechanism based on selection of a few dominant phenotypes out of a randomly generated mixture. Invasion appears to be an emergent property of this selection process. Cell-cell adhesion based on homotypic interactions is of special importance in tumor progression because of contact inhibition and because of the association of E-cadherin loss with metastasis and the upregulation of other homotypic cell-cell adhesion molecules. Our simulations also point to the importance of cell-cell adhesion since the phenotypes selected by the harsh microenvironment always have zero cell-cell adhesion. We therefore modified the HDC code in order to simulate more complex cell-cell adhesion interactions. The overall outcome is that even relatively minor additions to the complexity of cell-cell adhesion phenotype traits substantially affects both tumor evolution and morphology. For example, we introduced the possibility that tumor cell clones may express either of two distinct homotypic adhesion pairs (by analogy to the E- to N-cadherin switch that occurs in tumor progression; Hazan et al., 2004Hazan R.B. Qiao R. Keren R. Badano I. Suyama K. Cadherin switch in tumor progression.Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). These simulations were run under the random mutation regime, so that each of the 100 initial phenotypes is assigned an adhesion type (A or B), with a corresponding adhesion value (0–3). Cells of adhesion type A can only adhere to A, and B to B. In comparison to simulations with a single adhesion type (Figure 5), we observed the following (Figure 6): (1) Tumors with mixed adhesion types are smaller and more compact (Figures 6A and 6B); (2) At the firs"

These findings reveal a key role for the Hec1 N terminus in controlling dynamic behavior of kinetochore microtubules. The goal of mitosis is to properly segregate a replicated set of chromosomes into two daughter cells. The mitotic spindle, which is comprised of an elaborate set of microtubules (MTs) and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), is largely responsible for executing this task. Spindle MTs attach to a specialized protein region on the chromosomes called the kinetochore, and it is through this interaction that force is generated for chromosome movements during mitosis. MTs are highly dynamic polymers that switch between states of polymerization and depolymerization at their plus ends. To maintain connection with the mitotic spindle, kinetochores must hold on to MT plus ends as they exhibit this dynamic behavior. Kinetochores must also release the plus ends of MTs attached to the wrong spindle pole to ensure proper chromosome bi-orientation. Thus, two key aspects of kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) must be actively regulated: (1) attachment stability within kinetochore-binding sites and (2) plus-end assembly dynamics. We are just beginning to understand how the kinetochore accomplishes these tasks, and central to the problem is the Ndc80 complex of proteins. The Ndc80 complex is comprised of Ndc80 (Hec1 in humans for Highly Expressed in Cancer, Chen et al., 1997Chen Y. Riley D.J. Chen P.L. Lee W.H.

Hec1 has recently been localized by immunoelectron microscopy (EM) to the outer plate of the vertebrate kinetochore (DeLuca et al., 2005DeLuca J.G. Dong Y. Hergert P. Strauss J. Hickey J.M. Salmon E.D. McEwen B.F. Hec1 and Nuf2 are core components of the kinetochore outer plate essential for organizing MT attachment sites.Mol. Biol.

The mechanism by which this complex contributes to kMT attachment remains unknown. In budding yeast, the MT-binding Dam1 complex has been implicated in mediating kMT attachment (Cheeseman et al., 2001Cheeseman I.M. Brew C. Wolyniak M. Desai A. Anderson S. Muster N. Yates J.R.

The Ndc80 complex may also have a key role in preventing chromosome missegregation by releasing improperly attached MTs from kinetochores. Merotelic kinetochore attachment (in which a kinetochore is attached to MTs emanating from both spindle poles) is a major cause of anaphase lagging chromosomes and aneuploidy in mammalian tissue cells (Cimini et al., 2001Cimini D.

Aurora B kinase is a homolog of Ipl1p in vertebrate cells that is needed for proper chromosome segregation and kinetochore function. This conserved kinase likely has multiple protein targets at kinetochores (Cheeseman et al., 2002Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J. Yates 3rd, J.R. Chan C.S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G.

Strong kinase inhibition or Aurora B protein depletion results in a failure to build kinetochores capable of properly attaching to MTs and achieving bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle (reviewed in Carmena and Earnshaw, 2003Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. The cellular geography of aurora kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). We report here that the N terminus of Hec1 has key functions in regulating both plus-end attachment stability and plus-end assembly dynamics of kMTs, and these functions depend, in part, on phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase. We mapped the epitope on Hec1 recognized by 9G3, a monoclonal antibody originally raised to a large portion of recombinantly expressed human Hec1 (amino acids 56–642; Chen et al., 1997Chen Y. Riley D.J. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. HEC, a novel nuclear protein rich in leucine heptad repeats specifically involved in mitosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6049-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An overlapping peptide array covering the entire amino acid sequence of Hec1 was generated and subjected to an immuno-dot blot, using 9G3 as a probe. The antibody recognized one peptide (C-2), which corresponded to amino acids 200–215 (Figure 1A) of the N-terminal globular domain of Hec1 (Figure 1B; Wei et al., 2005Wei R.R. Sorger P.K. Harrison S.C. Molecular organization of the Ndc80 complex, an essential kinetochore component.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, Ciferri et al., 2005Ciferri C. De Luca J. Monzani S. Ferrari K.J. Ristic D. Wyman C. Stark H. Kilmartin J. Salmon E.D.

The binding of 9G3 to peptide C-2 was specific, as preincubation of the peptide with 9G3 prevented the antibody from recognizing kinetochores in immunofluorescence assays (Figure S1 available with this article online). We coimmunostained HeLa and PtK1 cells in metaphase with 9G3 and an antibody to Spc24 (McCleland et al., 2004McCleland M.L. Kallio M.J. Barrett-Wilt G.A. Kestner C.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Gorbsky G.J. Stukenberg P.T. The vertebrate Ndc80 complex contains Spc24 and Spc25 homologs, which are required to establish and maintain kinetochore-microtubule attachment.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 131-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Hec1 was always exterior to Spc24 at kinetochores of bi-oriented chromosomes (Figures 1C and 1D). Antibody 9G3 was previously used to localize Hec1 to the kinetochore outer plate by immuno-EM (DeLuca et al., 2005DeLuca J.G. Dong Y. Hergert P. Strauss J. Hickey J.M. Salmon E.D. McEwen B.F. Hec1 and Nuf2 are core components of the kinetochore outer plate essential for organizing MT attachment sites.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ndc80 complex is oriented with the N-terminal globular domains of Hec1 and Nuf2 proximal to the plus ends of kMTs within the outer plate and the Spc24 and Spc25 end of the complex closer to the inner kinetochore on bi-oriented chromosomes at metaphase. To test the function of the Hec1 N-terminal globular domain, we microinjected 9G3 into mitotic PtK1 cells. Antibody 9G3 recognized one major band at ∼75 kDa from PtK1 extracts, consistent with the predicted molecular weight of Hec1 (Chen et al., 1997Chen Y. Riley D.J. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. HEC, a novel nuclear protein rich in leucine heptad repeats specifically involved in mitosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6049-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; Figure 1E). Injected 9G3 concentrated at kinetochores, distal from the inner kinetochore proteins recognized by the CREST serum, and did not strongly label spindle MTs or spindle poles (Figure 1F). Spc24 remained localized to kinetochores (data not shown), indicating that the Ndc80 complex was intact and able to bind kinetochores after 9G3 injection. Chromosome movements of injected cells were followed by phase-contrast timelapse microscopy (Figure 2A). Prophase cells injected with 9G3 entered anaphase 52 ± 14 min after nuclear envelope breakdown (n = 35), compared to 29 ± 4 min for buffer-injected cells (n = 16). Thus, 9G3 injection resulted in a slight, but statistically significant delay in anaphase onset (t test p value < 0.001). Cells injected with 9G3 retained a functional Mad2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint, as they localized high levels of Mad2 to unattached kinetochores, lost Mad2 as chromosomes became bi-oriented, and entered anaphase with Mad2-depleted kinetochores in a manner similar to control cells (Figure S2; Howell et al., 2000Howell B.J. Hoffman D.B. Fang G. Murray A.W. Salmon E.D. Visualization of Mad2 dynamics at kinetochores, along spindle fibers, and at spindle poles in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Unlike control cells, however, 9G3-injected prophase or prometaphase cells were unable to properly align their chromosomes and experienced severe defects in anaphase chromosome segregation. Of 17 cells injected in prophase or prometaphase, all 17 entered anaphase with unaligned chromosomes (Figures 2A and 2B). In addition, 15 of 17 cells injected with 9G3 in prophase or prometaphase had at least one lagging chromosome in anaphase (Figure 2A, arrows). When injected into metaphase cells, 9G3 did not induce chromosomes to leave the metaphase plate but increased the frequency of lagging chromosomes in anaphase (Figures 2A and 2B). In contrast, no cells injected with injection buffer alone (n = 22) or a nonperturbing antibody to the kinetochore protein CENP-F (Cimini et al., 2004Cimini D. Cameron L.A. Salmon E.D. Anaphase spindle mechanics prevent mis-segregation of merotelically oriented chromosomes.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2149-2155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (n = 10) entered anaphase with unaligned chromosomes or exhibited lagging chromosomes in anaphase. Our live-cell imaging results are consistent with previously published experiments describing 9G3 injection into S phase T24 human bladder carcinoma cells, in which injected cells failed to form coherent metaphase plates and entered anaphase with unaligned chromosomes (Chen et al., 1997Chen Y. Riley D.J. Chen P.L. Lee W.H. HEC, a novel nuclear protein rich in leucine heptad repeats specifically involved in mitosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6049-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All kinetochores on chromosomes in 9G3-injected cells that had progressed to late prometaphase or further had robust kinetochore fibers (Figure 3A). These fibers persisted after a cold/calcium treatment (Brinkley and Cartwright, 1975Brinkley B.R. Cartwright Jr., J. Cold-labile and cold-stable microtubules in the mitotic spindle of mammalian cells.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1975; 253: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Weisenberg and Deery, 1981Weisenberg R.C. Deery W.J. The mechanism of calcium-induced microtubule disassembly.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), demonstrating they were bona fide kMTs (Figure 3B). The kinesin-7 protein, CENP-E, assists in recruiting MTs to the kinetochore and in spindle checkpoint inactivation (Mao et al., 2003Mao Y. Abrieu A. Cleveland D.W. Activating and silencing the mitotic checkpoint through CENP-E-dependent activation/inactivation of BubR1.Cell. 2003; 114: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Consistent with our observation that 9G3-injected cells form robust kMT attachments, CENP-E protein levels at kinetochores were not reduced from control levels (Figure S3). Analysis of 9G3-injected cells immunostained with tubulin antibodies revealed a high frequency of merotelic kinetochores (Figure 3A). Seventy-six percent of injected cells had at least one merotelically oriented kinetochore, and 56% had multiple merotelic kinetochores (n = 89 cells). In contrast, merotelic kinetochores are less frequent in control cells: 30% of control prometaphase PtK1 cells and 16.3% of control metaphase PtK1 cells exhibit one merotelically attached kinetochore (Cimini et al., 2003Cimini D. Moree B. Canman J.C. Salmon E.D. Merotelic kinetochore orientation occurs frequently during early mitosis in mammalian tissue cells and error correction is achieved by two different mechanisms.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4213-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and only 2% of control late prometaphase and metaphase PtK1 cells contain multiple merotelic attachments (Cimini et al., 2006Cimini D. Wan X. Hirel C. Salmon E.D. Aurora kinase promotes turnover of kinetochore microtubules to reduce chromosome segregation errors due to merotelic kinetochore orientation.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To determine if the robust kinetochore fibers observed in 9G3-injected cells were able to generate tension, we measured interkinetochore distances between sister kinetochores of bi-oriented chromosomes (Figure 3C). Surprisingly, the average distance in 9G3-injected cells was 1.5× greater than that for uninjected cells (Figure 3E; t test p value < 0.001). This effect was dependent on MT attachment, as the average value for interkinetochore distance in 9G3-injected prophase cells was identical to values from uninjected prophase cells (Figure 3E) and uninjected cells treated with 10 μM nocodazole to depolymerize all MTs (data not shown). The increase in centromere stretch for 9G3-injected cells suggested that kinetochores were under abnormally high tension. To further address this issue, we measured the spindle lengths in control cells and 9G3-injected cells that had a substantial number of bi-oriented chromosomes. The average metaphase spindle length for control cells was 12.8 ± 1.3 μm, while spindles in 9G3-injected cells were shorter: 9.9 μm ± 1.5 μm (Figure 3F; t test p value < 0.001). Spindle lengths were obtained by measuring the distance between the focused minus ends of the spindle MTs rather than the distance between each aster-center. This distinction is noteworthy because in many 9G3-injected cells, asters remained anchored near the cell peripheries (as in control cells), but the minus ends of the kinetochore fibers were moved away from their normal position at the edge of the centrosome (Figure 3D). This produced a large gap between the minus ends of the kinetochore fibers and each aster-center in these cells. Individual kinetochore fibers were measured and, indeed, were significantly shorter in 9G3-injected cells than in control cells (Figure 3F; t test p value < 0.001).The variation in spindle structure was likely due to individual cells' ability to remain adherent to the coverslip during mitosis. Minus ends of kMTs were displaced from aster-centers by large distances in cells that remained strongly adherent; cells that rounded up exhibited both kMT shortening and a decrease in aster-center to aster-center distance. The unexpected increase in centromere stretch and decrease in kMT length suggested that normal plus-end MT polymerization and depolymerization at the kinetochore were altered in 9G3-injected cells. We analyzed oscillations of sister kinetochore pairs, which depend on the dynamic instability of kMT plus ends (Tirnauer et al., 2002Tirnauer J.S. Canman J.C. Salmon E.D. Mitchison T.J. EB1 targets to kinetochores with attached, polymerizing microtubules.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4308-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Metaphase PtK1 cells injected with rhodamine-labeled tubulin to label MTs and a nonperturbing Alexa 488-labeled CENP-F antibody to mark kinetochores exhibited normal bi-directional kinetochore oscillations (Cimini et al., 2004Cimini D.

In contrast, cells injected with 9G3 contained no kinetochore pairs that exhibited any oscillatory movements (Movie S2; Figure 4B). Both merotelic and nonmerotelic kinetochores failed to oscillate. The MT tip-tracking protein EB1 normally localizes to the polymerizing plus ends of non-kMTs and kMTs during oscillations away from the pole (Tirnauer et al., 2002Tirnauer J.S. Canman J.C. Salmon E.D. Mitchison T.J. EB1 targets to kinetochores with attached, polymerizing microtubules.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4308-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). EB1 failed to persistently localize to kinetochores in 9G3-injected PtK1 cells (Figure 4C; Movie S3). However, EB1 localized to growing plus ends of non-kMTs in 9G3-injected cells identically to those in control cells, indicating that 9G3 specifically suppresses dynamics at the plus ends of kMTs. We next determined the effect of 9G3 injection on chromosome movements in cells with monopolar spindles, in which chromosomes are either mono-oriented (only one sister kinetochore attached to the single pole) or syntelically oriented (both sisters attached to the pole) (Kapoor et al., 2000Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. Probing spindle assembly mechanisms with monastrol, a small molecule inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin, Eg5.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), were injected with buffer alone or 9G3 and imaged by timelapse phase-contrast microscopy. Chromosomes in monopolar cells injected with buffer alone exhibited normal oscillations prior to and after injection (Figure 4E, top panel and Movie S5). In contrast, chromosomes in monopolar cells injected with 9G3 did not exhibit normal oscillations after injection. Instead, chromosomes moved poleward to an equilibrium position close to the pole (Figure 4E, middle and bottom and Movie S6). The rate of chromosome oscillations in buffer-injected cells either toward or away from the pole was 1.8 μm/min. Immediately after 9G3 injection, for ∼1 min, the rate of chromosome movement poleward was 1.2 μm/min. The remainder of the poleward movement occurred at an average rate of 0.39 μm/min, which is similar to the rate of poleward flux in PtK1 monopolar spindles, 0.45 μm/min (Cameron et al., 2006Cameron L.A. Yang G. Cimini D. Canman J.C. Kisurina-Evgenieva O. Khodjakov A. Danuser G. Salmon E.D. Kinesin 5-independent poleward flux of kinetochore microtubules in PtK1 cells.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These results argue that 9G3 binding to the Hec1 N terminus initially inhibits polymerization and subsequently inhibits depolymerization of plus ends of kMTs, resulting in kinetochores immobilized on the MT lattice. All chromosomes in 9G3-injected monopolar cells moved poleward after injection, suggesting that the MT flux machinery within the spindle remained functional after 9G3 injection and continued to produce MT depolymerization at the minus ends of kMTs. A MT motor protein that has been implicated in contributing to minus-end depolymerization activity is Kif2a, a KinI class 13 kinesin, which localizes to spindle poles (and to a lesser degree, centromeres) in tissue culture cells (Rogers et al., 2004Rogers G.C.

In 9G3-injected cells, Kif2a remained strongly localized to the minus ends of kinetochore fibers and throughout the gap that formed between the aster-centers and the spindle MT minus ends (Figure S4). These results indicate that 9G3 injection prevents plus-end MT dynamics at the kinetochore but does not inhibit minus-end depolymerization. To directly measure kMT dynamics in 9G3-injected cells, we made fluorescent marks on MTs in PtK1 cells stably expressing photoactivatable (PA) GFP-tubulin (Figure 5). This method is suitable for measuring kMT dynamics, as fluorescent marks persist on the more stable kMTs, disappear more quickly from the less-stable non-kMTs, and dissipate within seconds from cytosolic tubulin by diffusion (Mitchison, 1989Mitchison T.J.

The kinetics of fluorescence dissipation after photoactivation were fit well by a double exponential curve, A1e-k1t + A2e-k2t, where A1 represents the percentage of less-stable MTs in the population (non-kMTs), and A2 represents the more stable kMT population (Table S1). In prometaphase control spindles with mostly aligned chromosomes, 83% of the activated fluorescence dissipated with a t1/2 of 18 s, while 17% had a t1/2 of 7 min. The 18 s half-life corresponded to the turnover dynamics of non-kMTs within or surrounding the less abundant and more stable kMTs (Saxton et al., 1984Saxton W.M. Stemple D.L. Leslie R.J. Salmon E.D.

https://openalex.org/W1976739900,"The GATA family of transcription factors plays fundamental roles in cell-fate specification. However, it is unclear if these genes are necessary for the maintenance of cellular differentiation after development. We identified GATA-3 as the most highly enriched transcription factor in the mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. GATA-3 was found in the luminal cells of mammary ducts and the body cells of terminal end buds (TEBs). Upon conditional deletion of GATA-3, mice exhibited severe defects in mammary development due to failure in TEB formation during puberty. After acute GATA-3 loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase-mediated cell death in the long term. Further, FOXA1 was identified as a downstream target of GATA-3 in the mammary gland. This suggests that GATA-3 actively maintains luminal epithelial differentiation in the adult mammary gland, which raises important implications for the pathogenesis of breast cancer. The GATA family of transcription factors plays fundamental roles in cell-fate specification. However, it is unclear if these genes are necessary for the maintenance of cellular differentiation after development. We identified GATA-3 as the most highly enriched transcription factor in the mammary epithelium of pubertal mice. GATA-3 was found in the luminal cells of mammary ducts and the body cells of terminal end buds (TEBs). Upon conditional deletion of GATA-3, mice exhibited severe defects in mammary development due to failure in TEB formation during puberty. After acute GATA-3 loss, adult mice exhibited undifferentiated luminal cell expansion with basement-membrane detachment, which led to caspase-mediated cell death in the long term. Further, FOXA1 was identified as a downstream target of GATA-3 in the mammary gland. This suggests that GATA-3 actively maintains luminal epithelial differentiation in the adult mammary gland, which raises important implications for the pathogenesis of breast cancer. A fundamental aspect of development is the specification and maintenance of the differentiated cell state. The specification of cell fate is mediated in part by the establishment of hierarchical networks of transcription factors and the cis-regulatory elements that control their expression (Davidson et al., 2002Davidson E.H. Rast J.P. Oliveri P. Ransick A. Calestani C. Yuh C.H. Minokawa T. Amore G. Hinman V. Arenas-Mena C. et al.A genomic regulatory network for development.Science. 2002; 295: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, Swiers et al., 2006Swiers G. Patient R. Loose M. Genetic regulatory networks programming hematopoietic stem cells and erythroid lineage specification.Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Transcription factors are organized into structurally similar multigene families, such as the GATA and FOX families. These genes play essential roles in activating target genes of specific cell fates and also in repressing target genes of alternate cell fates (Singh et al., 2005Singh H. Medina K.L. Pongubala J.M. Contingent gene regulatory networks and B cell fate specification.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 4949-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Key mechanisms that underlie target gene activation and repression are chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation, which modulate the accessibility of transcriptional activation complexes to target gene loci. Though the roles of transcription factors in specifying cell fate have been established, it is unclear how cells maintain the differentiated state in the adult organism. That is, it is unclear whether the genetic regulatory networks that establish cell specification are necessary to maintain cell fate after development has completed. The GATA family of transcription factors is a group of six highly conserved transcription factors that play fundamental roles in cell-fate specification (Patient and McGhee, 2002Patient R.K. McGhee J.D. The GATA family (vertebrates and invertebrates).Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). GATA factors bind the DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) via a DNA binding domain containing one or two zinc-finger domains. One of the best-characterized functions of GATA factors is the essential role of GATA-1 in erythropoeisis. GATA-1 is essential for the specification of erythroid cells from myelo-erythroid progenitors, whereas the Ets family transcription factor PU.1 is essential for the specification of myeloid cells (Cantor and Orkin, 2001Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Hematopoietic development: a balancing act.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). GATA-1 and PU.1 exhibit transcriptional crossantagonism, thereby blocking the ability of a specified cell to adopt the alternate cell fate. Accordingly, the loss of GATA-1 causes a conversion of erythropoiesis to myelopoiesis, leading to a deficiency of erythroid cells and an expansion of myeloid cells (Galloway et al., 2005Galloway J.L. Wingert R.A. Thisse C. Thisse B. Zon L.I. Loss of gata1 but not gata2 converts erythropoiesis to myelopoiesis in zebrafish embryos.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 109-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon has been observed for GATA-3 in T helper(Th)2 cell-fate specification. GATA-3 and the T box family transcription factor T-bet play essential roles in the specification of naive T helper cells into Th2 and Th1 effector cells, respectively (Grogan and Locksley, 2002Grogan J.L. Locksley R.M. T helper cell differentiation: on again, off again.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). GATA-3 and T-bet also exhibit transcriptional crossantagonism to repress the alternate cell fate. Interestingly, it was recently suggested that GATA-3 expression must be sustained to maintain the differentiated Th2 cell type (Pai et al., 2004Pai S.Y. Truitt M.L. Ho I.C. GATA-3 deficiency abrogates the development and maintenance of T helper type 2 cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 1993-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The mammary gland is a ductal epithelial organ that, like the Th1/Th2 system, contains two mature epithelial cell types: the luminal epithelial cells, which line the ductal lumen and secrete milk proteins, and the myoepithelial cells, which line the basal surface of the luminal cells. These differentiated cell types arise from a multipotent progenitor population that has been recently characterized (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Generation of a functional mammary gland from a single stem cell.Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Prior to the onset of puberty, the mammary gland is a rudimentary organ consisting of a primitive network of ductal epithelium. Shortly after the onset of puberty, specialized structures known as TEBs develop at the invading epithelial tips of the mammary epithelium. TEBs contain an outer layer of cap cells, which are believed to be myoepithelial progenitors, and a multilayered inner core of body cells, which may be luminal cell progenitors (Smalley and Ashworth, 2003Smalley M. Ashworth A. Stem cells and breast cancer: A field in transit.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 832-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The TEBs proliferate, bifurcate, and invade into the fatty stroma of the mammary gland in a process known as branching morphogenesis. The process continues until 10–12 weeks of age, at which point the TEBs have invaded the entire length of the fat pad and then regress, having given rise to a mature ductal tree (Sternlicht et al., 2006Sternlicht M.D. Kouros-Mehr H. Lu P. Werb Z. Hormonal and local control of mammary branching morphogenesis.Differentiation. 2006; 74: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Little is known about the differentiation of the luminal cells, which are the principal cells implicated in breast cancer. Efforts to understand luminal cell differentiation have focused on the estrogen receptor (ERα), which is found in a subset of luminal cells that exhibit low proliferation (Cheng et al., 2004Cheng G. Weihua Z. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Estrogen receptors ER alpha and ER beta in proliferation in the rodent mammary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 3739-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ERα is found in only half of mature luminal cells and is found in fibroblasts and other stromal cells. Mice lacking ERα exhibit defects in mammary development, including an inability to form TEBs and defects in ductal invasion, though differentiation markers such as milk proteins are still expressed in its absence (Mallepell et al., 2006Mallepell S. Krust A. Chambon P. Brisken C. Paracrine signaling through the epithelial estrogen receptor alpha is required for proliferation and morphogenesis in the mammary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 2196-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this report, we carry out a genome-wide screen and identify GATA-3 as the most highly enriched transcription factor in the mammary ductal epithelium of pubertal mice. We show that GATA-3 is localized to the body cells of TEBs and to the mature luminal cells of mammary ducts. Using a loss-of-function approach, we show that GATA-3 is necessary in vivo for mammary development and for the maintenance of the differentiated luminal epithelium. We devised a microarray strategy to identify novel regulators of mammary development. β-actin-GFP reporter mice were used to visualize the mammary epithelium in vivo (Hadjantonakis et al., 1998Hadjantonakis A.K. Gertsenstein M. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Nagy A. Generating green fluorescent mice by germline transmission of green fluorescent ES cells.Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). TEBs, mature ducts, and epithelium-free stromal microenvironments were surgically microdissected from 5-week-old β-actin-GFP mice, and RNA was immediately isolated for analysis (Figure 1A). The RNA expression profiles of the TEB and mature-duct microenvironments were compared to the epithelium-free stroma by using long-oligonucleotide spotted microarrays with 19,500 features. An analysis of the most highly enriched genes in the mammary epithelium revealed that members of the keratin family (keratins 8 and 19) were the most highly enriched genes in the TEB microenvironment, whereas members of the casein family (casein κ and casein α) were the most highly enriched genes in the mature-duct microenvironment (Table 1). In this analysis, we identified GATA-3 as the most highly enriched transcription factor in both the TEB (13.9-fold change) and mature-duct (10.6-fold change) microenvironments. A full analysis of the microarray data can be found elsewhere (Kouros-Mehr and Werb, 2006Kouros-Mehr H. Werb Z. Candidate regulators of mammary branching morphogenesis identified by genome-wide transcript analysis.Dev.

Open table in a new tab We further investigated the localization of the GATA-3 protein by immunofluorescence. GATA-3 was found in all luminal cells of mature ducts, both within pubertal (5-week-old) and adult (12-week-old) virgin mice (Figures 1C and 1D). Costaining with α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) revealed that SMA-positive myoepithelial cells were GATA-3 negative, suggesting that GATA-3 was restricted to the luminal cells of the mammary gland (Figure 1D). GATA-3 was also expressed in the body cells of TEBs; however, the intensity of GATA-3 staining was lower in the distal end of the TEB (i.e., nearest to the invading front) compared to the proximal end (Figure 1B). GATA-3 was not found in the cap cells of the TEB (Figure 1B, arrowhead). We used a loss-of-function strategy to study the role of GATA-3 in the mammary gland. GATA-3 null mice display embryonic lethality between days 11 and 12 postcoitum, so we were unable to use these mice to study mammary development (Pandolfi et al., 1995Pandolfi P.P. Roth M.E. Karis A. Leonard M.W. Dzierzak E. Grosveld F.G. Engel J.D. Lindenbaum M.H. Targeted disruption of the GATA3 gene causes severe abnormalities in the nervous system and in fetal liver haematopoiesis.Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Instead, we used the Cre/loxP recombination system to generate mice that were conditionally deficient in GATA-3. Mice with a floxed GATA-3 locus were obtained, as described elsewhere (Pai et al., 2003Pai S.Y. Truitt M.L. Ting C.N. Leiden J.M. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Critical roles for transcription factor GATA-3 in thymocyte development.Immunity. 2003; 19: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the floxed construct, exons 4 and 5 of the native GATA-3 locus were replaced by a cassette containing exons 4, 5, and 6, flanked by loxP sites. The loxP sites were further flanked by a phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) promoter and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette, such that Cre-mediated recombination led to the placement of the GFP immediately downstream of the PGK promoter. We thus used GFP as a marker of Cre-mediated recombination to assess the efficiency of GATA-3 deletion. We first crossed the floxed GATA-3 mouse with the constitutively active MMTV-Cre line, where Cre expression has been reported in the mammary gland, skin, salivary glands, and other sites (Wagner et al., 2001Wagner K.U. McAllister K. Ward T. Davis B. Wiseman R. Hennighausen L. Spatial and temporal expression of the Cre gene under the control of the MMTV-LTR in different lines of transgenic mice.Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Homozygous floxed mice carrying the MMTV-Cre transgene (MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox) were born in normal Mendelian ratios compared to their littermates (data not shown). This suggested that the conditional deletion approach rescued the embryonic lethality that had been observed in GATA-3 null mice. Whereas heterozygous floxed mice expressing MMTV-Cre (MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/+) appeared in all respects normal compared to non-Cre littermate controls (Non-Tg; GATA-3flox/x), MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox exhibited severe defects in their skin and mammary glands beginning at puberty. MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mice began to lose hair shortly after puberty, and by adulthood, these mice displayed total alopecia. The mice also exhibited other major skin defects, including epidermal hyperplasia, dermal fibrosis, and hyperkeratosis (data not shown). The development of the mammary gland was severely disrupted in MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mice. Prior to puberty at day 19 postpartum, MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mice contained a rudimentary mammary gland that appeared to be similar to littermate controls by whole-mount inspection (Figures 2A and 2B). However, with the onset of puberty, the mammary glands of MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mice failed to develop TEBs (Figures 2C and 2D). As a result, by 5 weeks postpartum, the ductal epithelium failed to invade into the fatty stroma and remained in a compact and highly defective state (Figures 2E, 2F, and 2I). At 8 weeks postpartum, a few sporadic TEBs emerged in MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands, but these TEBs were incapable of filling the mammary stroma by 30 weeks postpartum, suggesting that GATA-3 played an essential role for normal TEB function (Figures 2G–2I). Moreover, the 8-week-old null outgrowths displayed gross structural defects, including irregular luminal diameters and deficiencies in side branching (Figure 2H). Histologic analysis of the MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox outgrowths further demonstrated an essential role for GATA-3 in mammary development. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed profound defects in the luminal epithelium of 8-week-old MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox outgrowths (Figure 3A). Whereas MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ ductal epithelium contained a single layer of luminal cells, the MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox ductal epithelium contained regions that lacked luminal cells and regions that contained a multilayered luminal epithelium (Figure 3B, arrowheads). Interestingly, immunostaining revealed that these defective outgrowths remained GATA-3 positive despite having undergone recombination (GFP+) (Figure 3B). The multilayered epithelium in the null outgrowths contained a basally located population of GATA-3/GFP double-positive luminal cells and a distinct population of GFP-positive, GATA-3-negative cells in the ductal lumen (Figure 3B, yellow arrowhead). A similar histologic profile was observed in 19-day-old MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox outgrowths (data not shown). To determine the mechanism for the expression of GATA-3 in the 8-week-old MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox outgrowths, we purified genomic DNA from the recombined (GFP+) cells of MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ and MMTV-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands. PCR analysis using primers specific to wild-type, floxed, and deleted GATA-3 loci revealed that the null outgrowths contained a nondeleted GATA-3 allele despite being GFP+ (Figure 3C). Thus, there was a selective pressure to retain a functional GATA-3 allele in the surviving outgrowths, which further suggested that GATA-3 is essential for mammary development. To further analyze the molecular function of GATA-3 in the mammary gland, we crossed the floxed GATA-3 mouse with the mammary-specific, doxycycline-inducible Cre line WAP-rtTA-Cre. Cre expression in the latter is both highly specific to the mammary gland and tightly regulated by doxycycline administration (Utomo et al., 1999Utomo A.R. Nikitin A.Y. Lee W.H. Temporal, spatial, and cell type-specific control of Cre-mediated DNA recombination in transgenic mice.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This enabled us to study the role of GATA-3 in the mammary gland while minimizing possible secondary effects from GATA-3 deletion in other organs. Furthermore, this approach enabled us to delete GATA-3 in the adult mammary gland after development had taken place. We administered doxycycline to 12-week-old WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox and WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ mice and analyzed GFP expression to determine the timing and efficiency of recombination. GFP was not detected in the absence of doxycycline administration, indicating that there was no leakiness of Cre expression. Although GFP was not detectable after a 3 day course of doxycycline, by 5 days of doxycycline, high levels of GFP were observed throughout the ductal epithelium of both WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox and WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ mammary glands (Figure 4A). GFP was induced in a large fraction of luminal cells but was absent in myoepithelial and stromal cells, suggesting that WAP-rtTA-Cre was highly specific to the luminal epithelium (Figure 4C). Interestingly, the WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands showed greatly reduced GFP expression after a 14 day course of doxycycline, whereas the WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ glands maintained a high level of GFP expression (Figure 4A). Both the relative intensity and the distribution of GFP along the ductal epithelium were reduced (Figure 4A), suggesting that these cells had been lost. On histologic examination, the 5 and 14 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands showed severe cellular defects in the luminal epithelium. After 5 days of doxycycline treatment, WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands developed a disorganized multilayered epithelium (Figure 4B). There appeared to be a substantial increase in cell number and heterogeneity of nuclear size and orientation. Detachment of single cells into the ductal lumen was observed, but only sporadically (see below). After 14 days of doxycycline treatment, WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands showed additional defects in the luminal epithelium, including cell detachment into the ductal lumen, disruption of the ductal architecture, and widespread cell death (Figure 4B). In some areas, individual luminal cells detached from the basement membrane, whereas in other areas, large portions of ductal epithelium detached (Figure 4B). No phenotype was observed in 5 or 14 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ mammary glands (Figure 4B). Immunostaining of WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands verified that GATA-3 was lost after doxycycline administration. In 5 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands, we identified two populations of luminal cells: a GATA-3-positive population lining the basement membrane and a GATA-3-negative population that had detached from the basement membrane (Figure 4C, white arrow). Both populations expressed similar levels of GFP, suggesting that only the subset of recombined luminal cells that lost the GATA-3 protein had detached from the basement membrane at this time point. In 14 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands, we detected a single population of GATA-3-positive, GFP-negative cells. We did not detect GFP-positive cells in histologic analysis, suggesting that recombined cells had undergone negative selection by this time point (Figure 4C). Taken together, these data suggest that GATA-3 is necessary in adult mammary glands to maintain the integrity of the luminal epithelium. To characterize the immediate consequences of GATA-3 deletion in the adult mammary gland, we further immunostained the 5 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands with structural and differentiation markers. Coimmunostaining with the luminal marker keratin 18 and the myoepithelial marker keratin 14 revealed that the multilayered epithelium in 5 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands was exclusively keratin 18 positive, suggesting that they retained luminal character and had not transdifferentiated into myoepithelial cells (Figure 5A). Despite being a luminal cell population, the 5 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox epithelium expressed significantly reduced levels of luminal differentiation markers (Figures 5B–5D). There was a substantial reduction of β-casein immunostaining in the null mammary glands compared to littermate controls (Figure 5B). There was also a reduction of E-cadherin and an absence of ERα in the null cells that exhibited detachment from the basement membrane (Figures 5C and 5D). To verify these findings, we compared the RNA expression profiles of 5 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox and WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ whole mammary glands by microarray (Figure 5E). The data confirmed that there was a relative increase in the expression levels of the luminal keratins 18, 19, and 8 and a decrease in various luminal differentiation markers (including members of the casein, cadherin, and estrogen receptor families) in the null mammary glands compared to heterozygous controls. These data suggested that the acute loss of GATA-3 led to an expansion of a luminal cell population that lacked markers of differentiation. To confirm that this phenomenon indeed represented cellular proliferation, we analyzed BrdU and PCNA staining in the 5 day doxycycline-treated mammary glands. WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands showed a significant increase of PCNA and BrdU-positive luminal cells compared to WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ controls, suggesting that the acute loss of GATA-3 led to cell-cycle progression (Figures 5F and 5G). We determined the long-term effects of GATA-3 loss by further characterizing the 14 day doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands. In contrast to the 5 day doxycycline treatment, the 14 day doxycycline treatment led to a relative reduction in the number of keratin 18-positive cells in WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands compared to controls (Figures 6A–6C). There was also a reduction of E-cadherin and ERα-positive cells after 14 days of doxycycline (Figures 6B and 6C). To determine if the reduction in cell number was due to cell death, we immunostained with the apoptosis marker M30, which recognizes a caspase-cleaved epitope of keratin 18. We observed widespread M30-positive luminal cells in 14 day, but not 5 day, doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands (Figures 6D and 6E). This suggested that cell death was not a primary event after GATA-3 loss but was rather a long-term consequence of GATA-3 loss. The lactational competence of doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mice was assessed to determine the functional consequence of GATA-3 loss. WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mice that had received a 14 day course of doxycycline were bred and sacrificed at day 10 postpartum. The mammary glands of WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mothers exhibited severe defects in lactation as a functional consequence of GATA-3 loss, including a reduction in the number and size of milk-producing alveolar units (Figures 6F and 6G). As a consequence of the lactational defect, the pups of null mothers displayed a significant reduction in weight at day 10 postpartum (Figure 6H). Doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/+ mothers showed normal lactation and exhibited a heterogeneous pattern of GFP expression, indicating mosaicism of recombination in the WAP-rtTA-Cre line (Figure 6F). In contrast, the ductal structures in doxycycline-treated WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mothers were GFP negative, which suggested there was a negative selection for recombined cells in the WAP-rtTA-Cre; GATA-3flox/flox mammary glands (Figure 6F). To identify potential downstream effectors of GATA-3 signaling, we performed bioinformatic analysis of our mammary microarray data. We identified 22 transcription factors that were highly enriched in TEBs and mature ducts of the mammary gland, a pattern that mirrors GATA-3 expression (Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). These genes included FOXA1, FOXP4, MSX2, TRPS1, ELF5, EHF, RUNX1, as well as several members of the Id, Irx, Sox, and TCFAP-2 transcription factor families. We then analyzed four independent microarray datasets to identify whether any of these genes were consistently correlated with GATA-3 expression in breast cancer samples. The transcription factor FOXA1 emerged as one of the best predictors of GATA-3 expression in these datasets. Of ∼24,000 genes, FOXA1 emerged as the most highly correlated gene with GATA-3 in two of four datasets, and it was the second and sixth most highly correlated gene in the other two datasets (Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.0001 in all datasets, Figure S1B). The strong positive correlation between GATA-3 and FOXA1 suggested a potential interaction between these transcription factors. To explore the possible relationship between GATA-3 and FOXA1, we analyzed the 50 kb promoter sequences of mouse and human FOXA1 and identified three conserved GATA binding sites lying 0.8, 1.7, and 3.6 kb upstream of the first exon (rVista 2.0). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of primary mammary epithelial cultures with a GATA-3 antibody and then PCR amplified the regions containing these GATA binding sites. The GATA binding site lying 0.8 kb upstream of the FOXA1 first exon coimmunoprecipitated with the GATA-3 antibody, suggesting that GATA-3 binds to the FOXA1 promoter in this region (Figure 6I). We show here for the first time that GATA-3 is a critical regulator of luminal cell differentiation in the mammary gland. This finding adds to the growing body of evidence that GATA factors are important mediators of cell-fate decisions in developmental systems. Examples include the essential roles of GATA-1 in erythrocyte differentiation, GATA-3 in T cell and Th2 cell differentiation, GATA-3 in sympathetic neuron differentiation, GATA-4 in gastric epithel"

https://openalex.org/W2131824470,"The crystal structure of CPSF-73, part of a complex involved in mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation is solved. CPSF-73 was purified and shown to endonucleolytically cleave mRNA, in a reaction mediated by two zinc ligands. Most eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) undergo extensive maturational processing, including cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3′-end1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Despite the characterization of many proteins that are required for the cleavage reaction, the identity of the endonuclease is not known4,9,10. Recent analyses indicated that the 73-kDa subunit of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF-73) might be the endonuclease for this and related reactions10,11,12,13,14,15, although no direct data confirmed this. Here we report the crystal structures of human CPSF-73 at 2.1 Å resolution, complexed with zinc ions and a sulphate that might mimic the phosphate group of the substrate, and the related yeast protein CPSF-100 (Ydh1) at 2.5 Å resolution. Both CPSF-73 and CPSF-100 contain two domains, a metallo-β-lactamase domain and a novel β-CASP (named for metallo-β-lactamase, CPSF, Artemis, Snm1, Pso2) domain12. The active site of CPSF-73, with two zinc ions, is located at the interface of the two domains. Purified recombinant CPSF-73 possesses RNA endonuclease activity, and mutations that disrupt zinc binding in the active site abolish this activity. Our studies provide the first direct experimental evidence that CPSF-73 is the pre-mRNA 3′-end-processing endonuclease."

Here, we describe roles for p120-catenin (p120) and p190RhoGAP that coordinate crosstalk between these systems and regulate cadherin function. Surprisingly, PDGFR-induced actin remodeling in NIH3T3 cells is blocked in the absence of p120, and the cells are partially transformed via constitutive activation of Rho. We have traced the mechanism to unexpected codependent roles for p120 and p190RhoGAP in regulating Rac-dependent antagonism of Rho. Receptor-induced Rac activity causes translocation of p190RhoGAP to adherens junctions (AJs), where it couples to the cadherin complex via interaction with p120. AJ formation is dependent on this p120-p190RhoGAP interaction and fails altogether if either of these proteins are compromised. We propose that Rac activation links diverse signaling systems to AJ assembly by controlling transient p190RhoGAP interactions with p120 and localized inhibition of Rho.

We propose that Rac activation links diverse signaling systems to AJ assembly by controlling transient p190RhoGAP interactions with p120 and localized inhibition of Rho. Cadherins are a major family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-cell adhesion and probably contact inhibition of cell growth (reviewed in Nelson and Nusse, 2004Nelson W.J. Nusse R.

Morphogenetic roles of classic cadherins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). These critical functions are disrupted in cancer and play a major role in malignancy. Cadherin intracellular domains physically associate with α-, β-, and p120-catenins, which in turn regulate cell-cell adhesion through functional but poorly understood interactions with RhoGTPases and the underlying actin cytoskeleton. Dynamic regulation of cadherin clustering underlies the formation of adherens junctions, which are frequently targeted by imbalances in oncogenic signaling during tumor progression. Cadherins also functionally interact with Rac1 (Rac) and RhoA (Rho), small Rho family GTPases that play critical roles in coupling receptor signaling to rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in Braga and Yap, 2005Braga V.M.

Rho activation stimulates focal-adhesion (FA) formation and cell contractility via assembly of mostly radial-oriented actin stress fibers (ASFs). In contrast, Rac activation enhances spreading, migration, and membrane ruffling via actin polymerization around the cell periphery. In previous work, we (and others) showed that p120 can inhibit Rho in cells when overexpressed at high levels (Anastasiadis et al., 2000Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J.

A GDI-like mechanism was proposed based on the ability of purified p120 to stabilize the GDP-bound form of Rho in vitro (reviewed in Anastasiadis and Reynolds, 2001Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. Regulation of Rho GTPases by p120-catenin.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Developmental studies confirm in vivo an important functional relationship between p120 and RhoGTPases (Fang et al., 2004Fang X. Ji H. Kim S.W. Park J.I. Vaught T.G. Anastasiadis P.Z. Ciesiolka M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but the basis for such observations at the molecular level remain unknown. We and others have demonstrated in cell lines that p120 is required for cadherin stability (Davis et al., 2003Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. A core function for p120-catenin in cadherin turnover.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, Ireton et al., 2002Ireton R. Davis M. van Hengel J. Mariner D.

Cellular levels of p120-catenin function as a set point for cadherin expression levels in microvascular endothelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The mechanism is not established but involves posttranslational alterations that are dependent on direct p120-cadherin interaction (Ireton et al., 2002Ireton R. Davis M. van Hengel J. Mariner D. Barnes K. Thoreson M. Anastasiadis P. Matrisian L. Bundy L. Sealy L. et al.A novel role for p120 catenin in E-cadherin function.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Cadherin stability is also compromised by targeted p120 ablation in mice. Epithelial p120 loss in the developing salivary gland reduces E-cadherin levels by ∼50% and is associated with severe alterations in epithelial morphology that closely resemble high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (Davis and Reynolds, 2006Davis M.A. Reynolds A.B. Blocked acinar development, E-cadherin reduction, and intraepithelial neoplasia upon ablation of p120-catenin in the mouse salivary gland.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the epidermis, morphologic alterations after p120 loss are surprisingly limited despite significantly reduced levels of both E- and P-cadherins. The condition nonetheless induces striking inflammation, apparently due to Rho activity and downstream activation of NF-κB signaling (Perez-Moreno et al., 2006Perez-Moreno M. Davis M.A. Wong E. Pasolli H.A. Reynolds A.B. Fuchs E. p120-catenin mediates inflammatory responses in the skin.Cell. 2006; 124: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Whether the cadherin-stabilizing and Rho-suppressing activities of p120 are functionally connected has not been addressed. In many cell types, Rho activity is negatively regulated by Rac via a molecularly characterized signaling pathway (hereafter, the “Bar-Sagi” pathway) (Nimnual et al., 2003Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Redox-dependent downregulation of Rho by Rac.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and the balance between these antagonistic activities is critical for coordination of cell motility with cell-cell adhesion and specification of cell morphology (Leeuwen et al., 1997Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O.W. Collard J.G. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 affects neuronal morphology; opposing roles for the small GTPases Rac and Rho.J.

Oncogenic Ras downregulates Rac activity, which leads to increased Rho activity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). According to the Bar-Sagi pathway, PDGFR or integrin stimulation activates Rac, which in turn inhibits Rho via generation of ROS, inhibition of low molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMWPTP), and tyrosine phosphorylation (activation) of p190RhoGAP (hereafter, p190) (Nimnual et al., 2003Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Redox-dependent downregulation of Rho by Rac.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Src and/or Abl family kinases have been implicated as likely mediators of p190 activation (Hernandez et al., 2004Hernandez S.E. Settleman J. Koleske A.J. Adhesion-dependent regulation of p190RhoGAP in the developing brain by the Abl-related gene tyrosine kinase.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Plattner et al., 1999Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. c-Abl is activated by growth factors and Src family kinases and has a role in the cellular response to PDGF.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In the case of PDGF signaling, the pathway mediates the rapid disassembly of ASFs and formation of striking dorsal circular ruffles (DCRs). DCRs involve dynamic remodeling of actin on the dorsal cell surface and occur in many cell types in response to growth factors such as PDGF and EGF (Chang et al., 1995Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. c-Src regulates the simultaneous rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton, p190RhoGAP, and p120RasGAP following epidermal growth factor stimulation.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). p190 activation by various means, including integrin activation, induces its translocation from the cytoplasm to membranes and/or actin cytoskeletal structures such as ruffles (Arthur and Burridge, 2001Arthur W.T. Burridge K. RhoA inactivation by p190RhoGAP regulates cell spreading and migration by promoting membrane protrusion and polarity.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, Sharma, 1998Sharma S.V. Rapid recruitment of p120RasGAP and its associated protein, p190RhoGAP, to the cytoskeleton during integrin mediated cell-substrate interaction.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas IGF stimulation in adipocytes induces p190 association with lipid rafts (Sordella et al., 2003Sordella R. Jiang W. Chen G.C. Curto M. Settleman J. Modulation of Rho GTPase signaling regulates a switch between adipogenesis and myogenesis.Cell. 2003; 113: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, p190 activation and membrane translocation are tightly linked and presumably crucial for its subsequent roles with respect to cell signaling and Rho inhibition. Both p120 and p190 are prominent Src substrates but have not otherwise been physically or functionally associated. Here, we describe roles for both p120 and p190 in coordinating intracellular crosstalk and cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Surprisingly, depletion of p120 in NIH3T3 cells by stable siRNA expression caused constitutive activation of Rho, cell transformation, loss of contact inhibition, and growth in the absence of serum. Moreover, PDGFR and integrin signaling pathways involved in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton were selectively impaired. We have traced the mechanism to obligatory roles for p120 and p190 in a pathway connecting Rac activation to inhibition of Rho. Interestingly, DA-Rac expression caused striking accumulation of p190 at AJs, which was blocked by depletion of p120. Similarly, in the absence of p190-A (p190-A−/− MEFS), DA-Rac was unable to induce AJs, and both p120 and N-cadherin were internalized. The effect is clearly dependent on p190 activity, as AJs were efficiently rescued by WT, but not functionally dead p190 mutants. Finally, p190 strongly coimmunoprecipitated with p120, but not other members of the cadherin complex. Together, these observations indicate that Rac activity induces translocation of p190 to the membrane where it transiently couples to cadherin complexes through p120. In fibroblasts, this novel mechanism couples Rac activation to localized inhibition of Rho and is essential for AJ formation. Interestingly, Rac is activated by RTKs, integrins, and cadherins, and all of these receptors can activate p190. p120 and p190 may therefore use RhoGTPases to mediate crosstalk between a wide variety of receptors in order to coordinate cadherin function with other activities that direct cell-substrate adhesion, cell motility, and proliferation. We have examined the effects of stable p120 knockdown (hereafter “p120i” cell lines) in NIH3T3 cells, a well-characterized fibroblast model for studying growth factor signaling and cell transformation. Unexpectedly, actin stress fibers (ASFs) were strongly enhanced (Figure 1A, compare top panels), and the effects of PDGF stimulation on actin remodeling were completely blocked (Figure 1A). Specifically, ASFs did not dissolve and DCRs failed to appear. Movie S1, in the Supplemental Data available with this article online, shows a time-lapse movie of the dynamic 15–30 min lifespan of PDGF-induced DCRs, as imaged by spinning disc confocal fluorescent microscopy of GFP-actin. To rule out trivial explanations, additional siRNA knockdown cell lines were generated by retroviral infection and tested in a variety of control experiments. First, retroviral siRNA constructs targeting three different sequences of the murine p120 gene were tested to ensure that the consequences of each were the same and indeed due to specific ablation of p120. Figure 1B shows efficient p120 knockdown in two separately derived p120i cell lines. Control cell lines (e.g., Figure 1B, control) were generated by retroviral infection with vectors containing a mismatched siRNA (pRs-hp120) (Davis et al., 2003Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. A core function for p120-catenin in cadherin turnover.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Control cells behaved identically in all respects to WT NIH3T3 cells, whereas p120i cell lines targeted by different siRNAs recapitulated the effects described above. Receptor activation and downstream p38 MAPK signaling in WT and p120i cells were examined to rule out the possibility that the PDGFR is somehow nonfunctional in the absence of p120. However, PDGFR activation (as evidenced by receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PDGF), in p120i and WT cells was identical (Figure 1C). Likewise, downstream signaling to p38 in response to PDGF (as evidenced by p38 phosphorylation) was also unaffected (Figure 1D). Finally, PDGF-induced actin remodeling (i.e., DCRs) and Tiam1-induced epithelialization (i.e., AJ formation) in fibroblasts depend on activation of Rac (Nimnual et al., 2003Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Redox-dependent downregulation of Rho by Rac.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, Sander et al., 1999Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Rac downregulates Rho activity: reciprocal balance between both GTPases determines cellular morphology and migratory behavior.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Thus, we used Pak assays to ask whether PDGF-induced Rac activity is impaired in the absence of p120 (Figure 1E). Interestingly, Rac levels were somewhat elevated in p120i cells because the p120-depleted cells failed to growth arrest during serum starvation (e.g., see Figure 3). However, in four separate experiments, Rac activity in the p120-depleted cells was elevated at least 4-fold by PDGF stimulation and essentially indistinguishable from the response observed in WT cells. Thus, PDGFR-induced activation of Rac in NIH3T3 cells occurs normally in the near absence of p120 and cannot explain the failure to remodel actin. Because elevated ASFs imply increased Rho activity, levels of GTP-bound (active) Rho were assayed by Rhotekin pull-down before and after exposure of cells to the Rho activator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or to PDGF, which is known to inhibit Rho through activation of Rac (Sander et al., 1999Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Rac downregulates Rho activity: reciprocal balance between both GTPases determines cellular morphology and migratory behavior.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). As expected, Rho activity was increased by LPA and decreased by PDGF (Figure 2A). Interestingly, Rho activity in p120i cells was even higher than that in WT cells treated with LPA and was unaffected by PDGF. Thus, Rho is both activated and PDGF insensitive when p120 is absent. Rho activity is also known to be associated with focal adhesion formation, cell spreading, and suppression of motility. Indeed, vinculin staining demonstrated a striking increase in the number and size of focal adhesions (Figure 2B), and cell spreading was both accelerated and ECM independent (Figure 2C). Motility was also suppressed (Figure 2D), presumably due to increased cell attachment. Thus, p120 ablation causes constitutive activation of Rho, and dysregulates RTK- and integrin-based mechanisms involved in coordinating actin remodeling. Inappropriate activation of Rho has been associated with cell transformation and loss of contact inhibition. Thus, we examined more closely the effects of p120 ablation on cell proliferation and transformation-associated phenomena such as focus formation (Figure 3). Interestingly, WT cells growth arrested normally at confluence, but p120i cells proliferated indefinitely to extremely high cell densities (Figure 3A, compare top panels). The p120i cells, in fact, never stopped growing and instead simply rolled off the plate as a single viable sheet of cells (data not shown). These data were confirmed by standard growth-curve analyses (Figure 3B). Whereas WT cells growth arrested by day 3 upon reaching confluence, p120i cells proliferated to densities over 4-fold higher (top panel) before separating from the plate. When plated in the absence of serum, control cells growth arrested and then died within 7 days (bottom panel). Remarkably, p120i cells survived and proliferated, albeit more slowly than normal. p120 ablation also induced foci in classic oncogene focus formation assays (Figures 3C–3F). The activity was completely blocked by coexpression of the Rho inhibitor C3 (Figure 3E) and suppressed (but not blocked) by coexpression of N-cadherin (Figure 3F). These data are consistent with the effects of DA-Rho and various Rho-GEF oncogenes, which also induce focus formation and loss of contact inhibition (Jaffe and Hall, 2002Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Rho GTPases in transformation and metastasis.Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells, PDGFR activation causes rapid disassembly of ASFs and striking DCRs via a pathway molecularly characterized by Bar-Sagi (Nimnual et al., 2003Nimnual A.S. Taylor L.J. Bar-Sagi D. Redox-dependent downregulation of Rho by Rac.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, Sander et al., 1999Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Rac downregulates Rho activity: reciprocal balance between both GTPases determines cellular morphology and migratory behavior.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). PDGFR activates Rac, which in turn inhibits Rho via generation of ROS, inhibition of LMWPTP, and tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 (Figure 4A). The unexpected requirement for p120, however, implies a novel link in the pathway and a possible connection to cadherin complexes. We therefore further dissected the pathway to identify the role of p120. Rho effects on ASF assembly are mediated in part through activation of ROCK. To place p120 up or downstream of ROCK, WT and p120i cells were treated with the selective ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Figure 4E). WT cells were marginally affected by Y-27632, but the enhanced ASFs observed in p120i cells were completely eliminated. Expression of the Rho inhibitor C3 had similar effects (data not shown). Thus, the effects of p120 loss occur upstream of Rho and ROCK and are largely dependent on consequences of Rho activation. In contrast, DA-Rac expression (Figure 4B) and ROS treatment (Figure 4C) disrupted ASFs in WT, but not p120i, cells. Thus, p120 is required downstream of ROS but upstream of Rho, leaving p190 as the only known component of the pathway between LMWPTP and Rho. To determine whether p120 acts upstream or downstream of p190, we monitored p190 activation by DA-Rac in the presence or absence of p120 (Figure 4D). Interestingly, p190 activation occurred normally in both WT and p120i cells, as evidenced by the nearly identical levels of Rac-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 and concomitant coimmunoprecipitation of p120RasGAP (Figure 4D). Thus, endogenous p190 can apparently be activated by DA-Rac in the absence of p120. However, the striking failure to suppress Rho under identical conditions (e.g., Figure 4B) indicates that it is nonetheless unable to couple to Rho. These observations suggest a previously unidentified functional interaction between p120 and p190 that under normal conditions is critical for Rac-induced inhibition of Rho. A possible explanation for these data is that p120 and p190 might transiently associate under conditions relevant to DCR formation or cell-cell adhesion. To test this hypothesis, colocalization and coprecipitation experiments were performed with antibodies to p120 and p190 (Figure 5). Interestingly, PDGF induced precise colocalization of p120 and p190 in DCRs, structures previously not known to involve p120. p120 is dependent on cadherin association for localization to membranes (Thoreson et al., 2000Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. Selective uncoupling of p120(ctn) from E-cadherin disrupts strong adhesion.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and indeed, N-cadherin also colocalized with p120 and p190 in DCRs (Figure 5A). Finally, the obligatory role of p120 in PDGFR signaling to Rho implies tight functional and perhaps physical interaction between PDGFR and N-cadherin complexes. Consistent with this, immunofluorescent staining revealed that activated PDGFR is also recruited to DCRs within minutes of PDGF stimulation (Figure 5B). Thus, DCRs are N-cadherin-based structures that form in response to growth factors such as PDGF (herein) or EGF (Chang et al., 1995Chang J.H. Gill S. Settleman J. Parsons S.J. c-Src regulates the simultaneous rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton, p190RhoGAP, and p120RasGAP following epidermal growth factor stimulation.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and involve transient (∼20–30 min) but quite striking colocalization of N-cadherin, p120, p190, and PDGFR. As predicted by this result, cells made N-cadherin deficient by stable siRNA expression were unable to form PDGF-induced DCRs (Figure 5C and Figure S2). Along with being necessary for DCR formation, Rac has been shown to drive “epithelialization” and the assembly of AJs in NIH3T3 cells via a pathway involving the downstream inhibition of Rho (Sander et al., 1999Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Rac downregulates Rho activity: reciprocal balance between both GTPases determines cellular morphology and migratory behavior.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). To determine whether the behavior of DCRs might also apply to adherens junctions, we directly examined the effects of Rac signaling in WT and p120i cells. First, DA-Rac was expressed in WT or p120i cells, and localization of N-cadherin and p190 was examined (Figure 5E). Figure 5D shows normal localization patterns of p190 (top panels) and N-cadherin (bottom panels) in WT and p120i cells in the absence of DA-Rac expression. Note that p190 localizes almost exclusively to the cytoplasm, whereas N-cadherin is associated with cell-cell contacts. As shown previously, N-cadherin levels were reduced in p120i cells by about 50% (data not shown) (Davis et al., 2003Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. A core function for p120-catenin in cadherin turnover.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Expression of DA-Rac in WT cells induced striking translocation of p190 to AJs where it colocalized precisely with N-cadherin (and p120) (Figure 5E). Translocation or association of p190 with AJs, however, was completely blocked in p120i cells, and AJ assembly was significantly compromised (Figure 5E). Thus, Rac activity induces striking p190 recruitment to cell-cell junctions and precise p120-dependent colocalization of p190 with N-cadherin. To determine whether p120 and p190 might interact, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with p120 and other core components of the cadherin complex (Figure 5F). p190 coimmunoprecipitated efficiently with p120, but not with β-catenin or N-cadherin. To clarify whether the interaction of p190 with p120 might somehow require association of p120 with other members of the cadherin complex, we generated a p120 mutant that interacts constitutively with membranes via a fused CAAX box but lacks an Armadillo repeat necessary for binding to cadherins (i.e., p120-1A ΔArm1-CAAX) (Figure S1). Interestingly, although this mutant p120 cannot associate with N-cadherin, it nonetheless colocalized extensively with p190 at membranes. Thus, p120 can sequester p190 at membranes independent of N-cadherin or other cadherin complex components. Together, these data strongly suggest that the growth factor and Rac-induced binding of p190 to cadherin complexes in both DCRs and AJs is mediated by association with p120. Although p190 does not normally localize to AJs (e.g., Figure 5D), the above data imply an important role for p190 in cell-cell adhesion. Therefore, we reexamined the status of p120 and N-cadherin in murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from p190-A knockout mice (Figure 6). DA-Rac was introduced as before to promote p190 translocation to AJs, and cells were immunostained with antibodies to p120 or N-cadherin (Figure 6). Interestingly, AJs were not present in the absence of p190-A, as evidenced by severe mislocalization of p120 and N-cadherin. To confirm that the defect was due to the absence of p190-A, cells were rescued by expression of WT p190-A (as indicated) and the experiment was repeated. In rescued cells, AJs were restored and all three proteins colocalized at cell-cell contacts. In contrast, expression of p190-A mutants with defects in N-terminal GTP binding (M5) or RhoGAP activity (30-1) were completely unable to rescue AJs (Figure 6A). Thus, mutations known to inactivate p190 by two different mechanisms also fail to rescue AJs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were repeated to determine whether these mutants retain the ability to interact with p120 (Figure 6C). Both WT and p190 mutants interacted normally with p120. Therefore, the failure of the mutant p190s to rescue AJs is intrinsic to defects in p190 rather than loss of the ability to interact with p120. Together, the data show that AJ stability in these cells involves transient p120-dependant recruitment of p190 to cadherin complexes followed by inhibition of Rho. Loss of either p120 or p190 disables this mechanism, resulting in elevated Rho activity and AJ failure. To clarify the relationship between elevated Rho activity and AJ failure, we used the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in DA-Rac expressing p190-defective cell lines to block contractility. Interestingly, ROCK inhibition partially rescued p190-associated defects in AJ formation, as shown qualitatively (Figure 6B) and quantified in the associated bar graph. Thus, it is likely that coordination of Rac activation and Rho inhibition by cadherin complexes (through p120 and p190) is required to"

To study how OR-instructed axonal fasciculation is controlled, we searched for genes whose expression profiles are correlated with the expressed ORs. Using the transgenic mouse in which the majority of OSNs express a particular OR, we identified such genes coding for the homophilic adhesive molecules Kirrel2/Kirrel3 and repulsive molecules ephrin-A5/EphA5. In the CNGA2 knockout mouse, where the odor-evoked cation influx is disrupted, Kirrel2 and EphA5 were downregulated, while Kirrel3 and ephrin-A5 were upregulated, indicating that these genes are transcribed in an activity-dependent manner. Mosaic analysis demonstrated that gain of function of these genes generates duplicated glomeruli. We propose that a specific set of adhesive/repulsive molecules, whose expression levels are determined by OR molecules, regulate the axonal fasciculation of OSNs during the process of glomerular map formation."

We now provide a functional rationale for this long-observed sequence diversity by demonstrating that differences among signals facilitate substrate-selective modulation of protein translocation. We find that during acute ER stress, translocation of secretory and membrane proteins is rapidly and transiently attenuated in a signal sequence-selective manner. Their cotranslational rerouting to the cytosol for degradation reduces the burden of misfolded substrates entering the ER and represents a pathway for pre-emptive quality control (pQC). Bypassing the pQC pathway for the prion protein increases its rate of aggregation in the ER lumen during prolonged stress and renders cells less capable of viable recovery. Conversely, pharmacologically augmenting pQC during ER stress proved protective. Thus, protein translocation is a physiologically regulated process that is utilized for pQC as part of the ER stress response.

Thus, protein translocation is a physiologically regulated process that is utilized for pQC as part of the ER stress response. Eukaryotic proteins destined for the extracellular environment, cell surface, or compartments of the secretory pathway are first translocated across or integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Wickner and Schekman, 2005Wickner W. Schekman R. Protein translocation across biological membranes.Science. 2005; 310: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Their initial segregation to the ER requires a signal sequence, often encoded at the N terminus, that is cotranslationally recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) (Shan and Walter, 2005Shan S.O. Walter P. Co-translational protein targeting by the signal recognition particle.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 921-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complex is subsequently targeted, via an interaction with the SRP receptor, to an ER protein translocon whose central channel is composed of the Sec61 complex (Osborne et al., 2005Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A. van den Berg B. Protein translocation by the Sec61/SecY channel.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The signal sequence is recognized again, this time by the Sec61 complex, to facilitate insertion of the nascent chain into the translocation channel and tight docking of the ribosome at the translocon (Jungnickel and Rapoport, 1995Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. A posttargeting signal sequence recognition event in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.Cell. 1995; 82: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Further protein synthesis is accompanied by Sec61-mediated translocation of the nascent chain across the ER membrane, or in the case of membrane proteins, integration into the lipid bilayer. These basic steps of substrate recognition, targeting, engagement of the translocon, and translocation are thought to be universally applicable to essentially all secretory and membrane proteins. Whether any step in this process can be modulated under certain cellular conditions to selectively regulate protein translocation remains unknown. However, a strictly constitutive system of translocation would seem unlikely since essentially every other basic cellular process (from transcription to protein synthesis to degradation) is regulated for at least some substrates at one time or another. How then might protein translocation be regulated? Given the essential role of the signal sequence in mediating both targeting and initiation of translocation, any regulatory process would presumably involve modulation of signal sequence function. Although such modulation has yet to be demonstrated, a growing number of studies are beginning to question the widely held view that signal sequences are functionally equivalent and largely interchangeable. For example, analyses of signal sequence-translocon interactions suggest an unexpectedly broad range of efficiencies in initiating translocation (Kim et al., 2002Kim S.J. Mitra D. Salerno J.R. Hegde R.S. Signal sequences control gating of the protein translocation channel in a substrate-specific manner.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, only a minority of signal sequences, such as the one from the well-studied model secretory hormone Prolactin (Prl), are highly efficient in vitro and in vivo (Kim et al., 2002Kim S.J. Mitra D. Salerno J.R. Hegde R.S. Signal sequences control gating of the protein translocation channel in a substrate-specific manner.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, Levine et al., 2005Levine C.G. Mitra D. Sharma A. Smith C.L. Hegde R.S. The efficiency of protein compartmentalization into the secretory pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These same efficient signal sequences also seem to be the only signals that do not depend substantially on accessory translocon components like TRAM (Voigt et al., 1996Voigt S. Jungnickel B. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Signal sequence-dependent function of the TRAM protein during early phases of protein transport across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the TRAP complex (Fons et al., 2003Fons R.D. Bogert B.A. Hegde R.S. Substrate-specific function of the translocon-associated protein complex during translocation across the ER membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) for translocation in vitro. If the only role for a signal sequence was to guarantee translocation across the ER, it is difficult to rationalize the existence of such diversity in sequence, efficiency, or complexity in their requirements for additional factors. Yet, these functional differences in efficiency are often evolutionarily conserved (Kim et al., 2001Kim S.J. Rahbar R. Hegde R.S.

A particularly notable example is the signal sequence from the mammalian Prion protein (PrP), which is detectably less efficient in its interaction with the translocon than the signal from Prl (Rutkowski et al., 2001Rutkowski D.T. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. Substrate-specific regulation of the ribosome- translocon junction by N-terminal signal sequences.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The efficiency of protein compartmentalization into the secretory pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In vivo, slight inefficiency of the PrP signal constantly generates a nontranslocated cytosolic form of PrP (cyPrP) that is degraded by the proteasome (Drisaldi et al., 2003Drisaldi B. Stewart R.S. Adles C. Stewart L.R. Quaglio E. Biasini E. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. Mutant PrP is delayed in its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum, but neither wild-type nor mutant PrP undergoes retrotranslocation prior to proteasomal degradation.J. Biol.

Although cyPrP represents a very low abundance form of PrP under normal conditions, it rapidly accumulates and aggregates upon inhibition of the proteasome (Ma and Lindquist, 2002Ma J. Lindquist S.

CyPrP and the aggregates formed from it can be cytotoxic in cultured cells (Ma et al., 2002Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S.

Neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration when PrP accumulates in the cytosol.Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Similarly, slight inefficiency of the PrP signal sequence also permits the generation of CtmPrP (Kim and Hegde, 2002Kim S.J. Hegde R.S. Cotranslational partitioning of nascent prion protein into multiple populations at the translocation channel.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a transmembrane form of PrP whose slight overrepresentation can lead to neurodegeneration in mice and humans (Hegde et al., 1998aHegde R.S.

Remarkably, the generation of both cyPrP and CtmPrP can be markedly reduced or even eliminated simply by replacing the PrP signal sequence with the more efficient signal from Prl (Rutkowski et al., 2001Rutkowski D.T. Lingappa V.R. Hegde R.S. Substrate-specific regulation of the ribosome- translocon junction by N-terminal signal sequences.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 7823-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2002Kim S.J. Mitra D. Salerno J.R. Hegde R.S.

Protection from cytosolic prion protein toxicity by modulation of protein translocation.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4550-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Even CtmPrP-favoring mutations in the mature domain of PrP that ordinarily cause neurodegeneration can be reversed by increasing signal sequence efficiency (Kim and Hegde, 2002Kim S.J. Hegde R.S. Cotranslational partitioning of nascent prion protein into multiple populations at the translocation channel.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it is puzzling that the signal sequence of PrP has not evolved a few amino acid changes that increase its hydrophobicity to improve its functional efficiency. Yet, comparisons across multiple species have revealed that, although several polymorphic changes have occurred in the PrP signal (Schatzl et al., 1995Schatzl H.M. Da Costa M. Taylor L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Prion protein gene variation among primates.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), its slight but measurable inefficiency is precisely maintained for unknown reasons (Kim et al., 2001Kim S.J. Rahbar R. Hegde R.S. Combinatorial control of prion protein biogenesis by the signal sequence and transmembrane domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26132-26140Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To resolve this apparent paradox, we hypothesized that differences between signal sequences among substrates might allow translocation to be modulated selectively under certain cellular conditions. Hence, there may exist situations when a seemingly imperfect signal sequence (such as from PrP), although potentially detrimental under some conditions, has additional (and beneficial) functionality that is not available with a “constitutive” and maximally efficient signal sequence (such as from Prl). In exploring this concept for PrP, we have now discovered a stress-induced pathway of translocational attenuation that acts to minimize PrP entry into and misfolding within the ER lumen. Remarkably, this pathway appears to be broadly utilized by the cell for many substrates in a signal sequence-dependent manner. Thus, the long-observed diversity in signal sequences (von Heijne, 1985von Heijne G. Signal sequences. The limits of variation.J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) appears to encode regulatory information that permits the cell to selectively modulate translocation in a substrate-specific manner. These findings not only reveal protein translocation as a regulated rather than constitutive process but also identify a previously unappreciated protective response to ER stress. To look for potential examples of translocational regulation, we sought to identify conditions when the translocation of PrP is differentially modulated relative to Prl. A logical situation is during ER stress (Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2004Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. A trip to the ER: coping with stress.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar), when entry into the ER of certain misfolding-prone proteins such as PrP may be disadvantageous to the cell. We therefore analyzed biosynthesis of PrP, Prl, and GFP (a cytosolic control) in pulse-labeled cultured cells acutely treated with two qualitatively different ER stressors: DTT, a reducing agent that induces ER stress by preventing productive folding of many secretory and membrane proteins, and thapsigargin (Tg), which depletes ER Ca2+ and influences chaperone function. Relative to untreated cells, Tg- and DTT-treated cells showed translational attenuation (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). This general translational inhibition was quantitatively mirrored by GFP and Prl (Figure 1A). Furthermore, all of the Prl synthesized under stressed and nonstressed conditions was processed by signal peptidase (Figure 1A; see also Figure 1D) and found by fractionation to be noncytosolic (data not shown). Although total PrP synthesis during Tg and DTT stress was attenuated to approximately the same levels as Prl and GFP, the amount of fully glycosylated PrP was preferentially reduced. The loss of glycosylated PrP was accompanied by a corresponding relative increase in the unglycosylated forms (asterisk, Figure 1A), at least some of which appeared to still contain an uncleaved signal sequence (S.-W.K. and R.S.H., unpublished data; Orsi et al., 2006Orsi A. Fioriti L. Chiesa R. Sitia R. Conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress favor the accumulation of cytosolic prion protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 13: 2067-2078Google Scholar; see Supplemental Data, Note 1). Among the various possible reasons for this observation (see Supplemental Data, Note 2), the explanation proved to be a selective decrease in PrP translocation (but not Prl) during ER stress. This could be shown by domain swap experiments in which signal sequences were exchanged between PrP and Prl. Fusion of the Prl signal to PrP (Prl-PrP) now allowed Prl-PrP to be glycosylated with comparable efficiency in both untreated and DTT-stressed cells, with the decrease in fully glycosylated Prl-PrP during the stress paralleling the degree of translational attenuation (Figure 1B). A similar effect was also observed (albeit to a lesser extent) with another efficient signal sequence (from the protein Osteopontin [Opn]). Comparable results were also seen with Tg stress and validated further by cell fractionation experiments (Figure S3). Conversely, PrP-Prl biosynthesis was decreased below that attributable to general translational attenuation during acute ER stress (Figure 1C), with detection of a nontranslocated precursor when the proteasome is inhibited (Figure 1D). Stress-dependent attenuation of PrP translocation was initiated almost immediately upon addition of the stressor (within ∼5 min; data not shown). Furthermore, reversal of translocational attenutation occurred within minutes of removing the stress, even faster than recovery from translational attenuation (Figure 1E). Similar effects were observed in a variety of cell types (albeit to different extents) with both DTT and Tg (data not shown). Notably, other (non-ER) cellular stressors that also cause translational attenuation (such as serum starvation or amino acid deprivation) did not influence PrP translocation (data not shown). Based on these results, we conclude that during acute ER stress, a significant amount of nascent PrP is rerouted in a signal sequence-selective manner from its normal fate of being translocated into the ER to a pathway of proteasome-mediated degradation. We have termed this process “pre-emptive” quality control (pQC) to denote a pathway by which proteins are cotranslationally triaged for degradation at a step in their biosynthesis before they engage the conventional quality control systems in the ER lumen. The machinery utilized for degradation of translocationally aborted proteins during pQC remains to be identified but could potentially involve the recruitment of chaperones to the translocon by p58IPK (Oyadomari et al., 2006Oyadomari S. Yun C. Fisher E.A. Kreglinger N. Kreibich G. Oyadomari M. Harding H.P. Goodman A.G. Harant H. Garrison J.L. et al.Cotranslocational degradation protects the stressed endoplasmic reticulum from protein overload.Cell. 2006; 126: 727-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Given that the functional properties of the PrP signal sequence appear to be evolutionarily conserved (Kim et al., 2001Kim S.J. Rahbar R. Hegde R.S. Combinatorial control of prion protein biogenesis by the signal sequence and transmembrane domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26132-26140Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2002Kim S.J. Mitra D. Salerno J.R. Hegde R.S. Signal sequences control gating of the protein translocation channel in a substrate-specific manner.Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that stress-dependent translocational attenuation of PrP may provide some benefit to the cell. One possibility is that translocational attenuation serves to avoid an adverse consequence of continued translocation during ongoing ER stress. Indeed, PrP translocated into the ER during DTT-induced stress was more prone to aggregation (as judged by decreased solubility in detergent solution) than newly synthesized PrP made in unstressed cells (Figure 2A). This effect was rapidly reversed (within minutes) upon removal of the stressor, at which point the PrP entering the ER lumen was again made in a soluble form. Pulse-chase experiments showed that PrP translocated into the ER during stress was prevented from subsequent exit to post-ER compartments (Figure S4A), further supporting the conclusion that it was misfolded. Misfolded PrP in the ER was capable of being refolded and trafficked out of the ER, provided the stressor was removed promptly (within ∼15 min; Figure 2B). However, continuing the stress an extra 30–360 min caused progressively larger proportions of the ER-lumenal PrP to become terminally misfolded, being retained in the ER in a largely insoluble state for prolonged times (Figures 2B and 2C and Figure S4B). Western blotting of total lysates from these same cells demonstrated that, after 6 hr of stress, the ER form of PrP had accumulated to ∼30%–50% of total PrP (bottom panels, Figure 2C). This misfolded PrP persisted for the ensuing 20 hr despite ER function returning to normal (as judged by replenishment of fully mature PrP [the “post-ER” form] on the cell surface). Importantly, artificially retaining PrP in the ER lumen using brefeldin A (BFA) did not cause it to become insoluble (N.S.R. and R.S.H., unpublished data) or incapable of subsequent trafficking upon BFA removal (Figures S4C and S4D). Thus, the results in Figure 2 illustrate that PrP entering the ER during acute ER stress is prone to terminal misfolding and aggregation, after which it is neither refolded nor degraded efficiently, even if the stressor is subsequently alleviated. This terminal misfolding occurs over time scales of under an hour (e.g., Figure 2B and Figure S4B), well before the transcriptional responses to ER stress have had an opportunity to upregulate the ER biosynthetic and folding machinery (Yoshida et al., 2003Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. A time-dependent phase shift in the mammalian unfolded protein response.Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The relative ease with which PrP becomes irrevocably misfolded in the ER lumen combined with its comparatively rapid degradation in the cytosolic environment suggest that stress-dependent translocational attenuation (i.e., access to the pQC pathway) may be a protective response to ER stress. To investigate this hypothesis, we determined the consequences of denying PrP access to the pQC pathway. We therefore generated stable cell lines that overexpress either PrP (which is subject to pQC) or Opn-PrP (which is largely refractory to pQC). The cell lines were analyzed by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and glycosidase digestion to confirm comparable expression, localization, and trafficking of PrP (Figures S5A–S5C). When these same cells were subjected to DTT stress, Opn-PrP progressively accumulated the glycosylated ER form at a noticeably higher rate than PrP over the course of 8 hr (Figure 3A). Importantly, simply preventing ER-to-Golgi transport with BFA (which does not acutely induce ER stress and does not mediate translocational attenuation; data not shown) caused the accumulation of the ER form at comparable rates for both PrP and Opn-PrP (Figure S5D). Thus, the rate of entry into the ER is very similar for PrP and Opn-PrP in the absence of ER stress but differs sufficiently during stress to influence the accumulation of misfolded ER-lumenal PrP. Remarkably, the increased rate of misfolded ER-lumenal Opn-PrP accumulation led to a diminished capacity to recover from the ER stress, as measured using a cell replating viability assay (Figures 3B and 3E). Similar effects on viability were also seen with other ER stressors (Figure 3E). By contrast, partial inhibition of the proteasome in these same cells caused a nonglycosylated form of PrP (but not Opn-PrP) to accumulate in the cytosol (Figure 3C). Replating viability assays showed the PrP cells to be less viable than Opn-PrP cells after chronic proteasome inhibition (Figures 3D and 3E). We conclude from Figure 3 that inefficiencies in PrP translocation necessitate constant proteasomal degradation of nontranslocated material that can be highly aggregation prone and cytotoxic if left undegraded. Although the more-efficient Opn signal sequence minimizes these problems, it becomes a liability when the ER environment is compromised. Under these conditions, constitutively high translocation efficiency of Opn-PrP results in a higher rate of accumulation of misfolded PrP in the ER lumen and decreased recovery from the stressor when compared to PrP. Thus, bypassing stress-mediated translocational attenuation of PrP sensitizes cells to ER stress. This result suggests that, for PrP, the pQC pathway is a physiologically important facet of the cellular response to an altered folding environment in the ER. The basis of this effect correlated directly with the minimization of protein misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation in the ER lumen. The increased sensitivity of Opn-PrP-expressing cells to ER stress suggests that constitutive translocation under these conditions is more detrimental than rerouting PrP directly to the cytosol. Although a reduction in PrP translocation might have seemed problematic given previous results identifying cytosolic PrP as highly cytotoxic (Ma et al., 2002Ma J. Wollmann R. Lindquist S. Neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration when PrP accumulates in the cytosol.Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and aggregation prone (Ma and Lindquist, 2002Ma J.

Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1456-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), this proved not to be the case. Pharmacologic inhibition of PrP translocation in vivo with cotransin (CT; see Figures S3B and S5E) for up to 24 hr did not lead to the accumulation of PrP aggregates in the cytosol or obvious cell death (Figures 4A and 4D). Instead, total PrP simply decreased over time due to turnover of pre-existing PrP from the cell surface and rapid degradation of nontranslocated PrP (which could be visualized by proteasome inhibition; Figure 4A). Upon removal of CT, cell surface PrP was readily replenished, with no accumulation of cytosolic PrP even over the course of 72 hr (Figures 4B and 4C). This contrasted sharply with proteasome inhibition, where aggregates of nontranslocated PrP appeared within a few hours (Figure 3C) and persisted long after alleviation of proteasome inhibition (Figure 4C). Furthermore, once initiated, PrP aggregates continue to accumulate (by a poorly understood “self-propagation” process that amplifies even trace amounts of PrP aggregates; Ma and Lindquist, 2002Ma J. Lindquist S. Conversion of PrP to a self-perpetuating PrPSc-like conformation in the cytosol.Science. 2002; 298: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), eventually leading to decreased cell viability (Figure 3D). The consequences of proteasome inhibition on PrP accumulation and cell viability were worsened by simultaneous inhibition with CT (Figure 4D) or DTT (Figure S6A), both of which result in increased delivery of PrP to the cytosol. Since even a complete block in PrP translocation is not inherently cytotoxic, we could ask whether accentuating translocational attenuation of PrP could be protective from the consequences of prolonged ER stress. Indeed, simultaneous treatment with CT during chronic DTT stress was able to partially improve viability for PrP-expressing cells (Figure 4E). This effect was due at least in part to the effect of CT"

Yet, recent studies have shown that EPA and DHA supplementation reduced urinary F2-isoprotane levels, a marker for oxidative stress, as well as enhanced cellular antioxidant defense systems (21Sarsilmaz M.

Although a reduction of F2-isoprostane levels can be attributed, in part, to a decrease in membrane AA content (20Gao L. Yin H. Milne G.L. Porter N.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Calviello G. Palozza P. Franceschelli P. Frattucci A. Piccioni E. Tessitore L. Bartoli G.M. Nutr. Cancer. 1999; 34: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the relationship between EPA/DHA oxidation versus EPA/DHA-mediated induction of antioxidant responses is not well understood. Non-enzymatic free-radical peroxidation of AA results in the formation of multiple stereoisomers of prostaglandin H2-like bicyclic endoperoxides that can undergo thiol-mediated reduction to form prostaglandin-like compounds termed F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) or rearrangement and reduction to form E2-IsoPs, D2-IsoPs, and isothromboxanes. E2/D2-IsoPs can then dehydrate to highly reactive A2/J2-isoprostanes containing cyclopentenone rings. These compounds readily adduct thiol groups on proteins and have been shown to induce Nrf2/ARE-directed gene expression (26Levonen A.L. Landar A. Ramachandran A. Ceaser E.K. Dickinson D.A. Zanoni G. Morrow J.D. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). NF-E2-related factor 2, Nrf2, is a master transcription factor shown to regulate expression of more than 200 genes, including those involved in Phase II detoxification and antioxidant gene expression (27Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8135-8145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Regulation of Nrf2 activity represents a critical step in initiating a cellular antioxidant response to reactive oxygen species. Nrf2-dependent gene expression is regulated by a cis-element located in the proximal promoter region and is termed an antioxidant response element (ARE) (28Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nrf2 binds to AREs as a heterodimer and regulates ARE-directed gene expression (29Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is negatively regulated by association with the ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein Keap1 (30McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Binding of Keap1 to Nrf2 directs the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of Nrf2. Inhibition of Nrf2 ubiquitination results in Nrf2 accumulation, increased ARE-directed gene expression, and an enhanced ability to respond to oxidant stress (31Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Non-enzymatic free-radical peroxidation of n-3 fatty acids are predicted to generate reactive species analogous to those formed from AA. It would be of significant interest to identify those analogous species and elucidate their bioactivity. We report here on novel studies that demonstrate the formation of cyclopentenone-containing J-ring isoprostanes following oxidation of n-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, these studies show that J3-IsoPs stabilize Nrf2 levels and induce Nrf2-directed gene expression. Whereas, AA-derived 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 was hypothesized to activate Nrf2-directed gene expression via dissociation of Nrf2 from adducted Keap1 (26Levonen A.L. Landar A. Ramachandran A.

Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (34Lo S.C. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cardiac tissue was obtained as described in a previous study (35Zhang R. Khoo M.S. Wu Y. Yang Y. Grueter C.E. Ni G. Price Jr., E.E. Thiel W. Guatimosim S. Song L.S. Madu E.C. Shah A.N.

Nuclei were pelleted following centrifugation at 12,000 × g, washed twice in nuclear isolation buffer, and then solubilized in 5× Laemmli buffer. Preparation for Flow Cytometric Assay—Washed, trypsinized HepG2 ARE-GFP reporter cells were assayed using a BDLS RII by the Vanderbilt Institutional flow cytometry core. Transfection—COS-7 cells, inoculated in T25 flasks, were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing human Keap1 (2 μg/flask) and of a plasmid expressing human V5-tagged Cul3 (2 μg/flask) using DMRIE-C (Invitrogen). The Keap1 vector has been described previously (36Sekhar K.R. Crooks P.A. Sonar V.N. Friedman D.B. Chan J.Y. Meredith M.J. Starnes J.H. Kelton K.R. Summar S.R. Sasi S. Freeman M.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5636-5645PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA expressing human Cul3 was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E Consortium (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) cDNA Clones and subcloned into pcDNA6/V5-His (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were exposed to 50 μm EPAox. Purification of Active Component in Oxidized EPA—EPA was oxidized by AAPH, and the oxidation mixture was extracted using a C-18 cartridge. The eluate was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was resuspended in isopropanol and purified by normal phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Phenomenex Luna 10μ (10 mm × 25 cm) Silica semi-preparation column with a mobile phase of hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid (100/3/0.1, v/v) at 9 ml/min flow rate. The fraction was collected every minute. HepG2 cells were exposed to the HPLC fractions, and nuclear Nrf2 was measured by immunoblotting. The HPLC fraction that maximally induced nuclear Nrf2 accumulation was further analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Purification and Analyses of A3/J3-IsoPs from Tissue—Liver tissues were collected from mice fed with 6% fish oil (Dyets, Inc.) for 8 weeks. Phospholipids in the livers were extracted by Folch solution and hydrolyzed by phospholipase A2 to release free A3/J3-IsoPs. The A3/J3-IsoPs in the samples were then analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Structural Characterization Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The in vitro and in vivo samples were analyzed using a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum 1.0 SR 1 mass spectrometer in negative ion mode. For tandem MS experiments, collision energies were optimized between 10 and 30 eV under 1.5 millitorr of argon. Spectra that are shown were obtained at 15eV. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Xcaliber software, version 1.3. For electrospray ionization-MS, the capillary temperature was 300 °C. The vaporizer temperature is 350 °C. The sheath and aux gas pressure were 31 and 17 p.s.i. The spray voltage was 3.0 kV, and the tube lens voltage was -102 V. Samples were introduced by reversed-phase HPLC with a Phenomenex Luna® ODS 5μ (2.1 mm × 25 cm) column. The mobile phase was a gradient starting with 80% solvent A (2 mm NH4Ac:CH3CN/MEOH(95/5) = 95:5) and 20% solvent B (MeOH:CH3CN = 5:95), holding for 1 min and increasing to 50% B in 18 min and holding for 2 min. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min. Gas chromatography (GC)/negative ion chemical ionization MS was performed using an Agilent technologies 6890N network GC system. Methane was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Ion source temperature was 250 °C, electron energy was 70 eV, and filament current was 0.25 mA. For analysis, samples were dissolved in 20 μl of undecane. Reactivity of Keap1 Sulfhydryls—The reactivity of sulfhydryl groups in Keap1 was determined in a competition reaction occurring between oxidized EPA and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). Recombinant Keap1 (0.2 mg/ml) was reacted at 30 °C with 100 μm DTNB in argon-saturated 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with either carrier control solvent or 100 μm oxidized EPA. The initial relative absorbance of the two reactions was set to zero and then monitored simultaneously at A412 using a dual-beam Varian DMS 80 spectrophotometer. Competition between oxidized EPA and DTNB for Keap1 sulfhydryls was recorded as a decrease in absorbance at A412, as a function of time relative to the absorbance produced in the reference cell by reaction of DTNB and Keap1 in the absence of oxidized EPA. Control experiments demonstrated that oxidized EPA did not react with DTNB. DTNB reactivity with Keap1, measured as an increase in absorbance at A412 demonstrated that all 27 His6-Keap1 cysteine residues were available for titration. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier-controlled temperature block using a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette. The data were collected at 1-nm increments from 200 to 260 nm using a response time of 2 s and a scan speed of 10 nm/min. Spectra represent an average 2 scans with the background corrected against a buffer blank or a buffer treatment compound. Data are reported as mean residue ellipticity, [θ](deg × cm2 × dmol-1), which was calculated as [θ] = 100 (signal)/(C × n × l), where deg represents degrees; signal represents raw output in millidegrees; C represents protein concentration in millimolar; n represents number of amino acid residues; and l represents cell path length in centimeters. hKeap1 was dissolved at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0). For the CD measurements, hKeapl was incubated with 10 μm 15-J2-IsoP or 100 μm oxidized EPA at 37 °C for 1 h. Percentage of secondary structure was calculated using the K2d program (37Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Structural changes in α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil were expressed as the increase/decrease of the percentage of structure for 15-J2-IsoP or oxidized EPA-treated hKeap1 compared with non-treated hKeap1. Oxidation of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is required for induction of ARE-directed GFP reporter gene expression. HepG2 cells stably transfected with a plasmid that expressed GFP under control of the murine Gsta1 ARE (38Zhu M. Fahl W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were used to determine if n-3 fatty acids were capable of inducing Nrf2-directed gene expression. The data presented in Fig. 1 (A and B) show that a well characterized Nrf2 activator such as sulforaphane (31Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) produced a statistically significant increase in ARE-reporter directed GFP fluorescence (p < 0.05, analysis of variance). However, exposure to DHA or EPA free acids, did not affect GFP fluorescence compared with control (p > 0.05, analysis of variance). Because EPA and DHA readily undergo auto-oxidation in vivo (39Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine if oxidized n-3 fatty acids exhibited the ability to induce Nrf2-regulated activity. Thus, EPA and DHA were oxidized in vitro by free radical initiation (see “Experimental Procedures”). HepG2 cells were exposed to the EPA or DHA oxidation products. A dose-dependent increase in ARE-reporter-directed GFP fluorescence was observed (Fig. 1, A and 1B,p < 0.05, analysis of variance). These data demonstrate that EPA and DHA oxidation products induce ARE-directed reporter gene activity. Oxidized n-3 fatty acids stabilize Nrf2 and increase the endogenous expression of Nrf2-regulated genes. Nrf2 is a short-lived protein due to its association with Keap1, which directs the ubiquitination of Nrf2 and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation (40Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. O'Connor T. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, very little Nrf2 accumulates in the nucleus (30McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21592-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Agents that activate Nrf2 function do so by inhibiting Keap1-directed ubiquitination of Nrf2, allowing Nrf2-regulated gene expression to increase. Inhibition of ubiquitination and stabilization of Nrf2 can be followed by measuring nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 (31Zhang D.D. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8137-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were exposed to oxidized DHA (DHAox) for up to 30 h, and nuclear protein was isolated and immunoblotted for the presence of Nrf2 (Fig. 1C). Nuclear Nrf2 levels increased within 2 h of exposure to DHAox. Similarly, HepG2 cells exposed to oxidized EPA (EPAox) showed significant increases in nuclear Nrf2 levels within 4 h, although the free acid form of EPA did not stabilize Nrf2 (Fig. 1D). Moreover, stabilization of Nrf2 was followed by the increased expression of two well characterized endogenous Nrf2-regulated genes, heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) (41Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and Gclc (42Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and E). These results are consistent with the data presented in Fig. 1 (A and B) and suggest that oxidation products of DHA and EPA result in Nrf2 stabilization, allowing increased Nrf2-regulated gene expression. A siRNA approach was used to determine if oxidized n-3 fatty acid-mediated expression of HO1 was dependent upon Nrf2. NMuMG cells were transiently transfected with either control siRNA or siRNA directed against Nrf2. 48 h after transfection, cells were exposed to DHAox for 4 h, and then nuclear extracts were prepared for immunoblotting. The immunoblot was probed with antibodies directed against Nrf2, HO1, and actin (Fig. 2A). Exposure to DHAox produced a robust increase in Nrf2 expression in cells transfected with control siRNA. Gene silencing with siRNA directed against Nrf2 suppressed DHAox-mediated expression of Nrf2 by 50% (Fig. 2B). In cells transfected with control siRNA, DHAox also produced a robust increase in the HO1 expression. The intensity of the HO1 immunoreactive band was measured and expressed relative to the expression of actin (Fig. 2B). Transfection of siRNA directed against Nrf2 suppressed DHAox-mediated expression of HO1 by 50% (Fig. 2, A and B). These experiments demonstrate a direct correlation between Nrf2 and HO1 expression and support the contention that oxidized n-3 fatty acids-mediated expression of HO1 is Nrf2-dependent. Oxidized n-3 Fatty Acids React with Keap1 Sulfhydryls, Altering Keap1 Secondary Structure That Is Followed by a Loss of Association between Keap1 and Cullin3—It was previously concluded that adduction of Keap1 by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2-initiated release of Nrf2, allowing for the latter's stabilization (26Levonen A.L. Landar A. Ramachandran A. Ceaser E.K. Dickinson D.A. Zanoni G. Morrow J.D. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To determine if a similar mechanism prevailed for n-3 omega fatty acids, experiments were undertaken to determine if EPAox could reacted directly with Keap1 cysteine residues. The reaction of cyclopentenone isoprostanes with protein sulfhydryls can be monitored using DTNB titration (43Shibata T. Yamada T. Ishii T. Kumazawa S. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Yodoi J. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26046-26054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This assay was modified to increase sensitivity such that we could monitor the reactivity of a small number of sulfhydryls. The ability of EPAox to compete with DTNB for reaction with recombinant Keap1 sulfhydryls was monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the data are presented in Fig. 3A. The decrease in absorbance measured at A412 can be attributed to EPAox modification of 4 Keap1 thiol groups, rendering them unavailable for titration with DTNB. Taken together, the LC-MS-MS (see below) and DTNB titration data are consistent with the model proposed by (44Wakabayashi N. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Kang M.I. Kobayashi A. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2040-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) in which an inducer transiently reacts with Keap1 cysteine residues that ultimately undergo disulfide bond formation. CD was used to probe for secondary structural changes produced by EPAox interaction with Keap1 residues (Fig. 3B). Based on work described below, we also interrogated secondary structural changes in Keap1 following reaction with 15-J2-IsoP. The analysis indicated that Keap1 underwent an isoprostane-mediated loss of α-helix content; coincident with an increase in β-sheet content and random coil structure. The EPAox-mediated loss in α-helix conformation may be consequence of a change in the BTB domain α-helix region (45Li X. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Ninan N. Weiner E.J. Rauscher F.J. Marmorstein 3rd, R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2056277685,"Dietary saturated fats have often been implicated in the promotion of obesity and related disorders. It has been shown recently that saturated fats act through the transcription factor SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c) and its requisite coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1β (PGC-1β), to exert their pro-lipogenic effects. We show here that a diet high in the saturated fat stearate induces lipogenic genes in wild-type mice, with the induction of the <i>Scd1</i> (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1) gene preceding that of other lipogenic genes. However, in <i>Scd1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, stearate does not induce lipogenesis, and <i>Srebp-1c</i> and <i>Pgc-1</i>β levels are markedly reduced. Instead, genes of fatty acid oxidation such as <i>Cpt-1</i> (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1) as well as <i>Pgc-1</i>α are induced. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is increased, and white adipose tissue and hepatic glycogen stores are depleted in stearate-fed <i>Scd1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Furthermore, AMP-activated protein kinase is also induced by stearate feeding in <i>Scd1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. These results indicate that the desaturation of saturated fats such as stearate by SCD is an essential step mediating their induction of lipogenesis. In the absence of SCD1, stearate promotes oxidation, leading to protection from saturated fat-induced obesity. SCD1 thus serves as a molecular switch in the promotion or prevention of lipid-induced disorders brought on by consumption of excess saturated fat."

Exposure to myostatin induces G1 phase cell cycle arrest. In this study, we demonstrated that myostatin down-regulates Cdk4 activity via promotion of cyclin D1 degradation. Overexpression of cyclin D1 significantly blocked myostatin-induced proliferation inhibition. We further showed that phosphorylation at threonine 286 by GSK-3β was required for myostatin-stimulated cyclin D1 nuclear export and degradation. This process is dependent upon the activin receptor IIB and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway but not Smad3. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) treatment or Akt activation attenuated the myostatin-stimulated cyclin D1 degradation as well as the associated cell proliferation repression. In contrast, attenuation of IGF-1 signaling caused C2C12 cells to undergo apoptosis in response to myostatin treatment. The observation that IGF-1 treatment increases myostatin expression through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway suggests a possible feedback regulation between IGF-1 and myostatin.

Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar). Unlike most TGF-β/GDF family members, which are expressed nonspecifically in many tissue types, myostatin is highly expressed in developing and adult skeletal muscle cells, where it plays an essential role in limiting skeletal muscle growth (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar, 2Gonzalez-Cadavid N.F. Taylor W.E. Yarasheski K. Sinha-Hikim I. Ma K. Ezzat S. Shen R. Lalani R. Asa S.

In addition, as low levels of myostatin expression have been observed in cardiac muscle, mammary gland, adipose, and preadipose tissues, it may also serve a broader biological function (3Morissette M.R.

Indeed, myostatin null mice exhibited a phenotype that was characterized by a marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia of skeletal muscle and loss of fat mass (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar). Similarly, enlarged skeletal muscle mass is evident in naturally occurring mutations of myostatin in humans and cattle (6Schuelke M. Wagner K.R. Stolz L.E. Hubner C. Riebel T. Komen W. Braun T.

Menissier F. Massabanda J. Fries R. Hanset R. Georges M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that myostatin expression and activity may be involved in the development of metabolic disorders, such as muscular dystrophy, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus (8Gonzalez-Cadavid N.F. Bhasin S. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2004; 7: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). With the aim of utilizing the inhibitory effects of myostatin upon multiple physiological processes and ultimately achieving an improved quality of life for obese and diabetic patients, various strategies for manipulating the biological activities of myostatin are under development (9Lee S.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 61-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar).Cell fate determination and proliferation of myogenic cells are critical processes in skeletal muscle formation during early embryo development. Studies have demonstrated that myostatin can inhibit the proliferation of myoblasts, satellite cells, and rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Myostatin treatment prevented myoblast progression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle by up-regulating expression of the Cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor p21Waf1, Cip1 and decreasing the levels and activity of Cdk2. Also, the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein was found to be present predominantly in the hypophosphorylated form in myostatin-stimulated myoblasts (10Thomas M. Langley B. Berry C. Sharma M. Kirk S. Bass J. Kambadur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40235-40243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Myostatin has also been implicated in the regulation of satellite cell activation, proliferation, and self-renewal that accompanies the up-regulation of p21Waf1, Cip1 (11McCroskery S. Thomas M. Maxwell L. Sharma M. Kambadur R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, work by Langley et al. (12Langley B. Thomas M. McFarlane C. Gilmour S. Sharma M. Kambadur R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that myostatin treatment inhibited rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation through an Rb-independent mechanism. Therefore, the antiproliferative effects of myostatin could be achieved by utilization of multisignal pathways.Experiments in vitro and in vivo have implicated activin receptor IIB, TGF-β receptor I (ALK5), and activin receptor IB (ALK4) as receptors in the mediation of myostatin signals (13Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). The binding of myostatin to heteromeric receptor complexes typically induces phosphorylation and activation of the associated intracellular signal transducers (Smad2/3), which then translocate into the nucleus and together with co-Smad (Smad4) regulate the expression of target genes (14Rebbapragada A. Benchabane H. Wrana J.L. Celeste A.J. Attisano L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7230-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that p38 and Akt pathways involved in myostatin signal transduction (3Morissette M.R. Cook S.A. Foo S. McKoy G. Ashida N. Novikov M. Scherrer-Crosbie M. Li L. Matsui T. Brooks G. Rosenzweig A. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Philip B. Lu Z. Gao Y. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, we have also found that the Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway participated in the regulation of muscle cell growth and differentiation by myostatin (16Yang W. Chen Y. Zhang Y. Wang X. Yang N. Zhu D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1320-1326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cyclins are essential components of the cell cycle machinery; each binds and activates specific Cdk partner proteins. Normal progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle requires both D- and E-type cyclins. The cyclin-Cdk complexes formed during G1 phase initiate phosphorylation of the Rb family of tumor suppressor proteins (pRb, p107, and p130) and thereby abrogate their inhibitory activity (17Pei X.H. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2787-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The D-type cyclins primarily activate Cdk4 and -6, whereas cyclin E activates Cdk2. Given the crucial role that D-type cyclins play in the progression through G1 of the cell cycle, it is not surprising that their expression is frequently down-regulated in cells stimulated with anti-proliferative cytokines, such as TGF-β family members. This down-regulation generally manifests both at the level of mRNA transcription and protein stabilization. Diehl et al. (18Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar) showed that the cyclin D1 proteolysis was accelerated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/GSK-3β pathway. GSK-3β phosphorylates cyclin D1 at threonine 286, which triggers its nuclear export, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation. In contrast, mitogens, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), inhibit GSK-3β kinase activity and stabilize the cyclin D1 protein by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway (19von Wichert G. Haeussler U. Greten F.R. Kliche S. Dralle H. Bohm B.O. Adler G. Seufferlein T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1284-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Although different models have been proposed to explain how myostatin causes cell cycle arrest, most studies are based on correlative results or overexpression. The mechanism underlying the function of myostatin remains unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that myostatin augments cyclin D1 protein degradation. The PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling cascade participates in myostatin-regulated cyclin D1 degradation and cell proliferation inhibition through a proteasome-dependent pathway. We report biochemical and cellular evidence indicating that these effects of myostatin on cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation can be blocked by treatment with IGF-1, a survival and proliferation promotion factor. Most significantly, we found that blocking the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt survival pathway caused C2C12 cells to undergo apoptosis in response to myostatin. Finally, our data indicate that myostatin expression in C2C12 cells is induced by IGF-1 treatment through the PI3K/Akt pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The following antibodies and reagents were used in this study: anti-cyclin D1, anti-cyclin E, anti-Cdk2, anti-p27, anti-p21, anti-Cdk4, anti-β-actin, anti-tubulin, anti-c-Myc, and anti-hemagglutinin antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The wild type and T286A mutant cyclin D1 were constructed by using pHIT-Myc3 retroviral vector with the following primers (5′-CGG AAT TCA TGG AAC ACC AGC TCC TGT G-3′ (upper) and 5′-CCC AAG CTT TCA GAT GTC CAC GTC CCG CAC GTC GGT GGG TGT GCA AGC-3′ (lower) for the wild type; 5′-CGG AAT TCA TGG AAC ACC AGC TCC TGT G-3′ (upper) and 5′-CCC AAG CTT TCA GAT GTC CAC GTC CCG CAC GTC GGT GGG TGC GCA AGC-3′ (lower) for the T286A mutant).Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse C2C12 cells were from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 4 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Primary fibroblasts isolated from Smad3 knock-out or wild type mice were provided by Dr. Xiao Yang. The inducible Akt overexpression C2C12 cell line was generously provided by Dr. Zhenguo Wu. During exponential growth, cells were treated with myostatin at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml for the indicated time, and cells used as control were treated with the same amount of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For electroporation transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS and trypsinized with 1 ml of trypsin/EDTA buffer for 1–2 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in a 600-μl culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and incubated with plasmid DNA for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell suspension was then transferred into a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette and electroporated at 350 V, 16 ms, 1 pulse using a Bio-Rad electroporator.Retrovirus Production and Infection—The retrovirus was produced by transient transfection of retroviral constructs into the Phoenix helper-free retrovirus producer cell line (a gift from Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford University) using the calcium phosphate method according to the standard protocol. For the infection of C2C12 myoblasts, the retroviral supernatant (48 h after transfection) was filtered and added into each C2C12 plate, with the addition of 3 μg/ml polybrene, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C for infection.Immunoblotting—For cell lysate preparation, monolayer cells on 100-mm plates were lysed with 1.2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was clarified by centrifuging at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Boiled samples with 2× SDS loading buffer were loaded onto a 10–12% polyacrylamide gel, and, after electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PALL, East Hills, NY). The resulting blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for phosphoprotein antibodies and 10% milk for nonphosphoprotein antibodies for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody used in the immunoblot was a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-IgG. The ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the substrate for detection, and the membrane was exposed to an x-ray film for visualization.Immunoprecipitation-coupled Western Blot—C2C12 cells with various treatments were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and protease inhibitors. This was followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with either the anti-Cdk4 antibody or the anti-β-actin antibody as negative control. Protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added and washed with the lysis buffer. Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-cyclin D1, anti-p27, and anti-Cdk4 antibodies.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The target sequences of double-stranded nucleotides used for siRNA knockdown are GGC TCA GCT CAT GAA CGA C for ActRIIb (Ambion, Austin, TX), GAA CCG AGA GCT CCA GAT C for GSK-3β (number 1) (RIBOBIO, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China), GTA ACC CCC CTC TGG CCA C for GSK-3β (number 2) (RIBOBIO), GGA CAT TGG AGG AGA AGC C for IGF-1 receptor (number 1) (RIBOBIO), TCT CAT CTT AGG AGA GGA G for IGF-1 receptor (number 2) (RIBOBIO), and ATCCAATGGCACCGTCAAG for GAPDH (RIBOBIO). Cells cultured in a 6-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with 70 μm siRNA with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with myostatin or PBS for 2 h. The total protein extracts from the cells were used for Western blot analysis.Proliferation Assay—About 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and maintained in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium for retrovirus infection and myostatin stimulation. During the last 12 h of each treatment, 5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to the culture medium. The cells were washed three times with PBS and trypsinized for radioactivity measurement in scintillation vials. The assay was performed in three replicates and repeated three times for statistic analysis.In Vitro Kinase Assay—C2C12 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Antibodies against Cdk4 and β-actin (negative control) were used for immunoprecipitations. The kinase assay was carried out for 1 h in a 30-μl reaction containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol), and affinity-purified GST-Rb-(773–928) as substrates at 30 °C. The reaction mixtures were then separated in a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins phosphorylated by the immunoprecipitant were visualized by autoradiography.Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed according to standard protocol to measure the expression of p110 with the primers p110-U (5′-CCC CCA CGA ATC CTA GTG GAA TGT TTA C-3′) and p110-L (5′-TGA AAA AGC CGA AGG TCA CAA AGT CGT C-3′).Immunofluorescence—The cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times with a permeabilization buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min each time, and then blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) in PBS. The samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either the anti-GSK-3β (1:100) antibody or the anti-cyclin D1 antibody and for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Finally, the cells were washed with PBS and mounted onto microscope glass slides. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was performed simultaneously to show the position of the nuclei.RESULTSMyostatin Promotes Proteasome-dependent Cyclin D1 Degradation—Myostatin has been known as an inhibitor of skeletal muscle cell proliferation. To examine the possible mechanism of myostatin-induced cell cycle arrest during the G1 phase, the level of G1 regulators was assessed in C2C12 myoblasts exposed to myostatin (Fig. 1a). The results revealed that myostatin stimulation significantly reduced the steady level of cyclin D1 protein in a time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the level of cyclin E was slightly down-regulated by myostatin. Consistent with previous reports, myostatin also increased the level of p21 in this study. However, the expression patterns of Cdk2 and Cdk4 were not significantly altered by myostatin treatment. The rapid decrease of cyclin D1 protein suggests that the protein stability may be regulated by myostatin. Blockade of the protein degradation pathway with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 almost completely inhibited the cyclin D1 protein degradation induced by myostatin (Fig. 1b). These results suggest that the proteasome-dependent pathway mediates myostatin-stimulated cyclin D1 degradation and that the down-regulation of cyclin D1 may play a very important role during myostatin-induced proliferation suppression.Myostatin Inhibits Cdk4 Activity and Rb Phosphorylation through Down-regulation of Cyclin D1—To test whether myostatin-induced cyclin D1 protein degradation alters Cdk4 function, we assayed Cdk4 kinase activity in immunoprecipitates from C2C12 cells in the presence or absence of myostatin. Specifically, phosphorylation of exogenous GST-Rb-(773–928) was measured, and the immunoprecipitate from a nonrelated IgG was used as a negative control. Cdk4 kinase activity was readily detected in PBS-treated cells, whereas only negligible Cdk4 kinase activity was detected in myostatin-treated cells (Fig. 1c). The myostatin-induced loss of Cdk4 kinase activity due to the accelerated cyclin D1 protein degradation was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation-coupled Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1d, cyclin D1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Cdk4 from the extracts of PBS-treated cells. However, in myostatin-stimulated C2C12 cells, no association of Cdk4/cyclin D1 could be detected. To verify the expression of these CDK4 and cyclin D1 proteins, input control of total cell lysate was blotted with antibodies against CDK4 and cyclin D1, respectively (Fig. 1d). These findings provide experimental evidence indicating that myostatin inhibits myoblast proliferation by inhibiting Cdk4 kinase activity via promotion of proteasomedependent cyclin D1 degradation.Attenuation of Myostatin-induced Growth Inhibition by Overexpression of Cyclin D1—To directly test whether cyclin D1 down-regulation is a determining factor in myostatin-induced cell proliferation inhibition, cyclin D1 was overexpressed in proliferating C2C12 cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. A virus carrying an empty vector was used as a control. Results in Fig. 2a indicated that the levels of cyclin D1 were much higher in C2C12 cells overexpressing this gene than in the cells carrying the vector control, although myostatin still had effects on the down-regulation of overexpressed cyclin D1. The virus-transduced cells were also used in a proliferation assay employing the [3H]thymidine incorporation method. Consistent with the immunoblotting data, the cells overexpressing cyclin D1 not only grew faster than control cells transfected with the vector alone but also showed more resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of myostatin (Fig. 2b). These data provide direct evidence indicating that cyclin D1 is a crucial target for the growth-inhibitory effects of myostatin in myoblasts.FIGURE 2Attenuation of myostatin-induced growth inhibition by overexpression of cyclin D1. Immunoblots (a) and [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (b) were carried out in C2C12 cells infected with retroviruses carrying a mock vector or cyclin D1 gene to measure the effects of myostatin on cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GSK-3β Is Required for Myostatin-induced Cyclin D1 Degradation—To examine the possibility that GSK-3β may be involved in myostatin-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, GSK-3β activity in C2C12 cells was inhibited with the chemical inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl) in the presence or absence of myostatin. Inhibition of GSK-3β kinase activity by LiCl attenuated myostatin-induced cell proliferation suppression (Fig. 3, a and b). We then tested whether myostatin-mediated cyclin D1 degradation is also regulated by GSK-3β with the use of LiCl and synthetic siRNAs. Pretreatment of C2C12 cells with LiCl suppressed the myostatin-induced cyclin D1 degradation (Fig. 3c). A similar effect was achieved when cells were transfected with synthetic siRNAs before myostatin treatment (Fig. 3d). Compared with the GAPDH siRNA control, myostatin failed to promote cyclin D1 protein degradation in the absence of endogenous GSK-3β (Fig. 3d).FIGURE 3GSK-3β kinase activation is required for myostatin-induced cyclin D1 degradation and proliferation suppression. a, proliferating C2C12 cells were treated with PBS or 500 ng/ml myostatin for 24 h in the presence or absence of 5 mm LiCl. b, cell proliferation in various treatment conditions described in a was quantified by cell number counts. c, C2C12 cells were pretreated with 20 mm LiCl for 30 min and then treated with 500 ng/ml myostatin for 3 h. Cyclin D1 levels were then measured by Western blots. d, five siRNA oligonucleotides for GSK-3β knock-down were designed, and the most efficient two siRNAs were chosen for the experiments. The siRNA-targeting GAPDH housekeeping gene was used as the control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the C2C12 cells were treated with myostatin or the same volume of vehicle solution (PBS) for 4 h. Protein levels of cyclin D1 and GSK-3β were assessed by Western blots. Tubulin protein served as the sample loading control. e, c-Myc-tagged wild type or T286A mutant cyclin D1 was expressed in proliferating C2C12 cells via a retroviral delivery system. The cells were then treated with 500 ng/ml myostatin or the same volume of vehicle solution (PBS) for another 3 h. The stability of wild type and T286A mutant cyclin D1 was measured by Western blots probed with anti-c-Myc antibody. f and g, C2C12 cells were plated on coverslips and incubated with myostatin (500 ng/ml) or PBS for 6 h. Immunofluorescent labeling was performed with anti-GSK-3β and anti-cyclin D1 antibodies, linked to fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC, respectively. Parallel experiments lacking the primary antibodies were used as negative controls. Nuclei were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine 286 by GSK-3β is required for its degradation (18Diehl J.A.

Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao. 2003; 35: 1016-1022PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm the requirement of GSK-3β in cyclin D1 degradation induced by myostatin, either the Myc-tagged wild type or T286A mutant cyclin D1 was introduced into C2C12 cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. We found that down-regulation of cyclin D1 induced by myostatin was threonine 286-dependent (Fig. 3e); these data provide direct biochemical evidence that GSK-3β plays a functional role in myostatin-mediated cyclin D1 protein degradation.GSK-3β has been shown to remain in the cytoplasm in an inactivated form. However, once activated, it is translocated into the nucleus to phosphorylate cyclin D1 at threonine 286, and then the phosphorylated cyclin D1 is in turn translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the phosphorylated cyclin D1 is degraded through a proteasome-mediated pathway (18Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). We assayed the intracellular translocation of GSK-3β and cyclin D1 proteins with immunofluorescent labeling of C2C12 cells treated with myostatin. As shown in Fig. 3f, GSK-3β was most abundant in the cytoplasm of PBS-treated control C2C12 cells but was then translocated into the nucleus after myostatin treatment. In contrast, cyclin D1 could hardly be detected in myostatin-treated C2C12 cells, presumably due to its reduced stability. Blockade of the proteasome-mediated degradation pathway with MG132 revealed that myostatin induced cyclin D1 translocation from the nuclei to the cytoplasm in C2C12 cells (Fig. 3g). By using fluorescence intensity quantification software, we assessed that over 90% of cyclin D1 exists in the nucleus in PBS treatment control. However, almost 95% of cyclin D1 was exported from nucleus to cytosol in the presence of myostatin plus MG132. Altogether, these findings provide biochemical and cellular evidence showing that GSK-3β is required for myostatin-induced cyclin D1 degradation.Myostatin Activates GSK-3β by Inhibiting the PI3K/Akt Pathway—Ser9 of GSK-3β can be phosphorylated by multiple kinases, principally from the PI3K/Akt pathway (22Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar). Therefore, to elucidate the involvement of GSK-3β upstream molecules in myostatin-regulated cyclin D1 degradation, we assessed the phosphorylation status of Akt and GSK-3β following myostatin treatment and"

To investigate its physiological significance, we generated mice with null and floxed alleles of the DDB1 gene. Here we report that null mutation of DDB1 caused early embryonic lethality, while conditional inactivation of the gene in brain and lens led to neuronal and lens degeneration, brain hemorrhages, and neonatal death. These defects stemmed from a selective elimination of nearly all proliferating neuronal progenitor cells and lens epithelial cells by apoptosis. The cell death was preceded by aberrant accumulation of cell cycle regulators and increased genomic instability and could be partially rescued by removal of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Our results indicate that DDB1 plays an essential role in maintaining viability and genomic integrity of dividing cells.

Our results indicate that DDB1 plays an essential role in maintaining viability and genomic integrity of dividing cells. The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway recognizes and removes a wide variety of helix-distorting DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet (UV) light, chemical carcinogens, or oxidative stress (Bootsma et al., 2002Bootsma D. Kreamer K.H. Cleaver J.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Nucleotide excision repair syndromes: xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy.in: Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 564-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Defects in the NER pathway account for the rare autosomal recessive human disorders xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS), with hallmarks in sunlight-induced skin defects and/or neurological abnormalities (Bootsma et al., 2002Bootsma D. Kreamer K.H. Cleaver J.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Nucleotide excision repair syndromes: xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy.in: Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer, Second Edition. McGraw-Hill, New York2002: 211-237Google Scholar). Two subpathways of NER exist: a rapid transcription-coupled repair (TCR) for damage on the transcribed strand of active genes and a slow global genomic repair (GGR) for damage elsewhere in the genome. The large subunit of the UV-damaged DNA binding (DDB) complex, DDB1, is involved in both GGR and TCR. DDB1 is present in an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing Cullin 4A (Cul4A) and either DDB2 or CS-group A (CSA) (Groisman et al., 2003Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y.

Once bound to a damaged DNA lesion during GGR, the DDB1-Cul4A ligase is activated and ubiquitinates DDB2 and XP-group C (XPC), resulting in degradation of DDB2 and stable association of XPC with the damage site (Sugasawa et al., 2005Sugasawa K. Okuda Y. Saijo M. Nishi R. Matsuda N. Chu G. Mori T. Iwai S. Tanaka K.

CSA-mediated proteosomal degradation of CSB by DDB1-Cul4A was recently shown to allow for post-TCR recovery of transcription (Groisman et al., 2006Groisman R. Kuraoka I. Chevallier O. Gaye N. Magnaldo T. Tanaka K. Kisselev A.F. Harel-Bellan A. Nakatani Y. CSA-dependent degradation of CSB by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway establishes a link between complementation factors of the Cockayne syndrome.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1429-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). DDB1 also targets several other proteins for polyubiquitination and degradation. Cdt1, a DNA replication licensing factor, is targeted for proteolysis in response to DNA damage and during the cell cycle (Higa et al., 2003Higa L.A. Mihaylov I.S. Banks D.P. Zheng J. Zhang H.

DDB1-Cul4A is directed to mediate the destruction of Cdt1 only when bound with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Arias and Walter, 2006Arias E.E. Walter J.C. PCNA functions as a molecular platform to trigger Cdt1 destruction and prevent re-replication.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), underscoring the tight regulation of DDB1-Cul4A in controlling cell cycle progression and the DNA damage response in mitotic cells. c-Jun and STAT proteins are recruited for degradation to DDB1-Cul4A via additional adaptor proteins hDet1-Cop1 and paramyxovirus V proteins, respectively (Precious et al., 2005Precious B. Childs K. Fitzpatrick-Swallow V. Goodbourn S. Randall R.E. Simian virus 5 V protein acts as an adaptor, linking DDB1 to STAT2, to facilitate the ubiquitination of STAT1.J.

Cell. 2006; 22: 383-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), were recently found to be modified by DDB1-Cul4A-mediated ubiquitination, connecting histone ubiquitination with DNA damage repair. The growing list of substrates for DDB1-Cul4A may also include p27Kip1 (Bondar et al., 2006Bondar T. Kalinina A. Khair L. Kopanja D. Nag A. Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Cul4A and DDB1 associate with Skp2 to target p27Kip1 for proteolysis involving the COP9 signalosome.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2531-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a known target for the Skp1-Cul1 E3 ligase. A crystal structure of DDB1 alone or in complex with a paramyxovirus V protein has recently been resolved, revealing a double propeller pocket on one side of the molecule, into which the V protein inserts, and a third propeller on the opposite side, which makes contact with Cul4A (Li et al., 2006Li T. Chen X. Garbutt K.C. Zhou P. Zheng N.

DDB1 has been highly conserved during evolution. Deletion of the DDB1 gene in fission yeast leads to an increased spontaneous mutation rate and failed progression into meiosis, partially due to failed degradation of the replication inhibitor Spd1 (Bondar et al., 2004Bondar T. Ponomarev A. Raychaudhuri P. Ddb1 is required for the proteolysis of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication inhibitor Spd1 during S phase and after DNA damage.J. Biol.

Ddb1 controls genome stability and meiosis in fission yeast.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Loss of DDB1 in fruit flies causes lethality early in development (Takata et al., 2004Takata K. Yoshida H. Yamaguchi M. Sakaguchi K. Drosophila damaged DNA-binding protein 1 is an essential factor for development.Genetics. 2004; 168: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inactivation of Cul4 in worms leads to both failure to degrade Cdt1 during S phase of the cell cycle and massive DNA re-replication (Zhong et al., 2003Zhong W. Feng H. Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T. CUL-4 ubiquitin ligase maintains genome stability by restraining DNA-replication licensing.Nature. 2003; 423: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and deletion of Cul4A in mice, despite its intact homolog Cul4B that shares 87% sequence similarity, causes lethality by embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) (Li et al., 2002Li B. Ruiz J.C. Chun K.T. CUL-4A is critical for early embryonic development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4997-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we describe generation of lines of mice carrying null or floxed DDB1 alleles. Consistent with its critical role in development in other organisms, a null mutation of DDB1 led to early embryonic lethality. To examine the role of DDB1 in the central nervous system (CNS), we crossed the floxed DDB1 mice to a transgenic line that expresses the Cre recombinase under the control of a rat nestin promoter and enhancer (Tronche et al., 1999Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schutz G. Disruption of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in the nervous system results in reduced anxiety.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). We found that DDB1 was deleted in the brain as well as the lens of mutant embryos, leading to genomic instability and apoptosis of proliferating cells. Finally, removal of p53 suppressed many of the phenotypes of these mice, rescued many mitotic cells from death, and allowed their survival and aberrant proliferation. DDB1 is ubiquitously expressed in all mouse tissues including brain (see Figures S1A and S1B in the Supplemental Data). A DDB1 transcript is highly abundant in early embryos, progressively decreasing during the course of embryonic development (Figure S1B). To investigate the developmental role of DDB1, we used Cre/lox technology to introduce conditional mutations of DDB1 in mice. LoxP sites were inserted into the intronic sequences flanking exon 5 of the DDB1 gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cell lines (Figure 1A). Upon Cre-mediated recombination, excision of the 5th exon would fully inactivate the gene, creating a null DDB1 allele (DDB1Δ). Splicing the primary transcript to join the 4th exon to the 6th exon, if it occurred, would only encode the first 183 amino acids of DDB1, which would not retain any of the functional structural domains defined in the crystal structure of DDB1 (Li et al., 2006Li T. Chen X. Garbutt K.C. Zhou P. Zheng N. Structure of DDB1 in complex with a paramyxovirus V protein: viral hijack of a propeller cluster in ubiquitin ligase.Cell. 2006; 124: 105-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Four independently targeted ES cells, after undergoing removal of the neomycin resistance marker in vitro (Figure 1A and Figure S1C), were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and transferred to pseudopregnant females. Chimeric males from two ES cells gave germline transmission of the floxed DDB1 gene (DDB1F). Mice homozygous for DDB1F appeared healthy and phenotypically indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. DDB1F mice were first crossed with mice carrying a Cre transgene under the control of the adenovirus EIIa promoter that targets expression of Cre recombinase to the early mouse embryo (Lakso et al., 1996Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Efficient in vivo manipulation of mouse genomic sequences at the zygote stage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the DDB1Δ allele in the germline were recovered among offspring of the EIIa-Cre mice. Genotypes of mice with combinations of different DDB1 alleles (wild-type, DDB1F, DDB1Δ) were scored by Southern blotting (Figure 1B) and PCR analysis (Figure 1C) of tail DNA from adult mice. No gross phenotype was observed for DDB1Δ/+ heterozygous mutant mice within the first one year of life. However, intercrossing heterozygous DDB1Δ/+ mice generated no viable homozygous mutant pups on or after E12.5 (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data, top panel). Extensively degenerated embryos were often observed at E12.5, suggesting that the complete inactivation of DDB1 causes early embryonic death. To bypass the early lethality of null DDB1 embryos and to achieve CNS-specific inactivation of the gene, DDB1F homozygous mice were crossed with Nestin-Cre transgenic mice. DDB1F/F Nes-Cre mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, but all died within 24 hr after birth (Table S1, bottom panel). Genomic DNA from multiple tissues dissected from DDB1F/F Nes-Cre or control newborn mice were analyzed by Southern blotting (Figure 1D) or PCR (Figure S1D), confirming efficient recombination within the floxed DDB1 allele specifically in the brain. Furthermore, western blotting of whole-brain extracts prepared from the mutants showed nearly complete loss of the DDB1 protein (Figure 1E). The trace amount of DDB1 detected in the mutant extracts probably reflects the protein present in Cre-negative cells such as endothelial cells of blood vessels and meninges in dissected neural tissues (inset in Figure S4F). Taken together, these results show that Cre-mediated deletion of exon 5 of the DDB1 gene led to DDB1 deficiency in the CNS and neonatal death. All DDB1F/F Nes-Cre newborn mice were readily identified by the appearance of massive hemorrhages within their cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum (data not shown). Brains dissected from DDB1F/F Nes-Cre newborns were overall smaller than those from DDB1F/F, DDB1F/+, DDB1F/+ Nes-Cre, or wild-type littermates, and, strikingly, exhibited severe internal bleeding, largely restricted to the forebrain. The Aqueduct of Sylvius (AQ) and the IV ventricle (IVV) were open to the brain surface and filled with blood (Figures 2A and 2B). Histological analyses of mutant brains revealed that the lateral ventricles were dramatically enlarged, with a nearly complete loss of cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ), as shown in sagittal brain sections (Figures 2C–2F). The neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are the major population of cells in the VZ and SVZ, actively undergo mitosis to produce new neurons that become postmitotic after migrating to the outer layers of the cortex. Immunostaining with Ki-67, a nuclear antigen expressed in all proliferating cells except those in G0 or early G1, identified NPCs in the VZ and SVZ of control brains (Figure 2K), but rarely identified any proliferating cells in mutant brains (Figure 2L). The expression of a postmitotic neuronal marker, neuronal nuclei (NeuN), was complementary to that of Ki-67 and readily detected in the mutants (Figures 2M and 2N). Like the VZ and SVZ of the lateral ventricle, the external granular layer (EGL) of the cerebellum, another proliferative zone in the newborn brain, was almost completely missing in the mutant cerebellum, which was also much smaller than that of the control (Figures 2G–2J). Also missing were the VZ and SVZ in the olfactory bulb of the mutants (data not shown). The missing tissues exposing the AQ and IVV in the mutants were those normally generated by the VZ and SVZ surrounding the corresponding ventricles during embryonic brain development. All these data suggest that loss of DDB1 resulted in either massive death or premature differentiation of the NPCs residing in the proliferative zones of the CNS. The remaining laminated layers of the cerebral cortex, though grossly preserved, had significantly fewer cells and many red blood cells apparently released from ruptured and abnormally dilated cerebrovascular vessels (data not shown). The vascular defects were further exemplified by immunodetection of laminin, a marker for the basement membrane of blood vessels (Figures 2O and 2P). Mutant brains had a dramatic reduction in the total number of blood vessels. Most regions in the dorsolateral cortex were completely devoid of any vasculature, and the few remaining vessels were dramatically dilated in diameter as compared with those in the same region of the control cortex (compare insets in Figures 2O and 2P). Likewise, many blood vessels were dilated in the cerebellum of the mutant brain, but severe hemorrhage was not found except in the rostrolateral tip. Other parts of the nervous system, including the brain stem and spinal cord, were grossly normal. In the CNS of Nes-Cre mice, Cre recombinase is active in NPCs by E10.5 and induces nearly complete recombination in all CNS cells after E12.5 (Graus-Porta et al., 2001Graus-Porta D. Blaess S. Senften M. Littlewood-Evans A. Damsky C. Huang Z. Orban P. Klein R. Schittny J.C. Muller U. Beta1-class integrins regulate the development of laminae and folia in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex.Neuron. 2001; 31: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Brains dissected from DDB1F/F Nes-Cre embryos did not show any significant abnormality until E14.5, when the NPCs in the VZ and SVZ underwent massive apoptotic death, indicated by pyknotic nuclei that were numerous in the ganglionic eminence (Figures 3A–3D) and less severe in the neocortex (Figures 3E and 3F). These pyknotic nuclei often formed in clusters (Figure 3F). Apoptosis peaked at E15.5 as judged by counting pyknotic nuclei in tissue sections (data not shown), and this was verified by terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Figures S3A and S3B). At E16.5, cavitations resulting from hypocellularity became obvious in the VZ and SVZ while the remaining cells in these proliferative zones continued to die (Figures 3G–3J). By P0, apoptosis essentially came to an end, leaving behind hollow lateral ventricles lined without apparent VZ or SVZ and with a much thinner cortex (compare Figure 2D with Figure 2C and Figure 7B with Figure 7A). Intracerebral hemorrhages started to appear in the caudate-putamen at E16.5, with decreasing severity from the rostral to caudal direction (Figures 3G and 3H). Some blood vessels were apparently dilated, as judged by examination of sections after laminin staining, in regions where cells were lacking (data not shown). The total number of blood vessels in the mutant brain was comparable to that in the control brain at E16.5. However, while blood vessels continued to grow and branch out in control brains, there were dramatically fewer blood vessels in the mutant newborn brain than those in either the control newborn or the E16.5 mutant brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex. There were approximately 12-fold fewer vessels by count of laminin-stained sections in the mutant as compared with control newborns (Figures 2O and 2P). This suggests that regression or degeneration of blood vessels after E16.5 accounts for the significant reduction of the vessels in the mutant newborn brain. Apoptosis accounted for the loss of other proliferative zones in the developing mutant brain. The dentate gyrus, which was anatomically normal at E16.5, exhibited many apoptotic cells in the subhilar zone (arrows in Figures 3K and 3L). Pyknotic nuclei were found in the VZ surrounding the AQ (Figures S2A–S2D), the EGL and VZ of the cerebellum (Figures S2E–S2H), and the SVZ surrounding the IVV (Figures S2I–S2J) at E14.5. Massive apoptosis resulted in obvious hypocellularity in all the corresponding areas at E16.5 (Figures S2K–S2T), and proceeded to nearly complete cell depletion that either exposed the AQ and IVV or removed the EGL from the diminished cerebellum at P0 (compare Figure 2H with Figure 2J). In summary, loss of DDB1 selectively eliminated nearly all dividing NPCs during embryonic brain development. Unexpectedly, histological analysis of eyes revealed severely degenerated lenses in the mutant (Figures 4C and 4D). Whereas the control lens contained well-ordered arrays of cells, the mutant lens showed significantly fewer cells, which were abnormally shaped and poorly organized (Figures 4E and 4F). As a result of these cellular changes, the mutant lens was much less transparent than the control lens (Figures 4A and 4B). Like the CNS, the DDB1F/F Nes-Cre lens developed normally until E14.5, when a few pyknotic nuclei were identified in the anterior part of the equatorial region (Figures 4G and 4H). This is the major proliferative region in the lens, where epithelial cells, exiting from the central nondividing epithelium, actively divide to populate the posterior region (Bhat, 2001Bhat S.P. The ocular lens epithelium.Biosci. Rep. 2001; 21: 537-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At E15.5, numerous progenitor epithelial cells of the mutant lens were positive in TUNEL analysis (Figures S3C and S3D). At E16.5, though the overall lens morphology was maintained by the differentiated fiber cells, significantly fewer epithelial cells were present in either the central pool or the equatorial region, while pyknotic nuclei were identified in the whole epithelium layer (Figures 4I–4L). To our knowledge, no published report has addressed the Cre recombinase activity in the lens from Nes-Cre mice, though endogenous nestin transcript and protein can be detected in lens epithelium by E12.5 and in lens fibers after E14.5 (Yang et al., 2000Yang J. Bian W. Gao X. Chen L. Jing N. Nestin expression during mouse eye and lens development.Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By immunostaining for DDB1, we found that DDB1 was ubiquitously expressed in all wild-type lens epithelial and fiber cells at E14.5. We detected no DDB1 protein in the lens epithelial cells and newly differentiated lens fiber cells of the E14.5 DDB1F/F Nes-Cre embryos (Figures S4G and S4H), suggesting that Cre recombinase had targeted DDB1. These results indicate that ablation of DDB1 in lens lead to apoptotic death of the dividing epithelium first, followed by complete lens degeneration due to failure to replenish fibers at the time of birth. No gross defect was found in DDB1F/F Nes-Cre retina. Expression of DDB1 in the mutant retina was not different from that in the control, suggesting that the nestin promoter is not active in retina and likely explaining the lack of defect in retinal development. DDB1 protein was broadly expressed, mainly in the nucleus, in all cell types in the wild-type CNS throughout embryonic development, as shown by immunostaining for DDB1 (Figures S4A, S4C, and S4E). In the CNS of Nes-Cre mice, Cre recombinase induces nearly complete excision of a reporter gene after E12.5 (Graus-Porta et al., 2001Graus-Porta D. Blaess S. Senften M. Littlewood-Evans A. Damsky C. Huang Z. Orban P. Klein R. Schittny J.C. Muller U. Beta1-class integrins regulate the development of laminae and folia in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex.Neuron. 2001; 31: 367-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Consistently, in DDB1F/F Nes-Cre brain at E12.5, DDB1 was detected in only a few sporadic NPCs (Figures S4A and S4B), but was retained in meningeal cells and blood vessels (arrow in Figure S4B inset), where Cre is not active. From E14.5 to postnatal day P0, DDB1-positive cells were very rare in either the VZ/SVZ or postmitotic laminated layers (Figures S4C–S4F), and the majority of DDB1 staining was confined to blood vessels (insets in Figures S4D and S4F). Therefore, from E14.5 to birth, apoptotic death predominantly affected the mitotic NPCs, but rarely affected the postmitotic neurons, despite the fact that all of these cells of the mutant mice had lost DDB1 expression. Differentiated lens fibers did not die in the absence of DDB1, while all progenitor epithelial cells underwent apoptosis. These data suggest that DDB1 is essential for survival of proliferating cells but not required for survival of cells that have exited the cell cycle, at least for a substantial time span. DDB1 participates in the NER of damaged DNA in mammalian cells (Tang and Chu, 2002Tang J. Chu G. Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E and UV-damaged DNA-binding protein.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and deletion of DDB1 in fission yeast leads to accumulation of spontaneous mutations (Holmberg et al., 2005Holmberg C. Fleck O. Hansen H.A. Liu C. Slaaby R. Carr A.M. Nielsen O. Ddb1 controls genome stability and meiosis in fission yeast.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To assess whether DDB1 deletion in the mouse brain interferes with genomic integrity, we first immunostained brain tissues from E14.5 embryos for histone H2AX phosphorylated at serine 139 (γ-H2AX), a DNA damage marker induced by a wide array of insults. γ-H2AX was broadly detected in NPCs of the VZ in the mutant brain (Figures 5B and 5D) and in the proliferative epithelial cells of the equatorial region in the mutant lens (Figure 5F). Control brain sections (Figures 5A and 5C) or lens sections (Figure 5E) exhibited very few or no γ-H2AX-positive cells. In addition to the strong staining of apoptotic nuclei, many more morphologically normal NPCs showed positive staining in the subnuclear foci (insets in Figures 5C and 5D). To further identify the specific types of damage lesions, the E14.5 brain sections were immunostained with an antibody against 8-hydroxy-dexoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a principal component of oxidatively damaged DNA (Klein et al., 2002Klein J.A. Longo-Guess C.M. Rossmann M.P. Seburn K.L. Hurd R.E. Frankel W.N. Bronson R.T. Ackerman S.L. The harlequin mouse mutation downregulates apoptosis-inducing factor.Nature. 2002; 419: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In the mutant brain, perinuclear staining was prominent in the clustered apoptotic cells, but many other cells within the VZ also exhibited lighter staining (Figures 5J and 5L). No positive staining was identified in the postmitotic layers of the mutant (Figure 5J) or in any regions of the control brain (Figures 5I and 5K). Examination of sections stained with antibody against the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1 showed an approximately 4-fold increase in the number of positive cells and an increase in stain intensity, specifically in the SVZ, but not the VZ or postmitotic layers (Figures 5M–5P). These immunohistochemical results indicate that DDB1 deficiency led to abnormal accumulation of Cdt1 and DNA damage, such as oxidative damage, in the proliferating cells in the brain and lens. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from DDB1F/F embryos at E13.5 and infected with either a Cre-expressing or an empty adenoviral vector. Four to five days after infection, DDB1 protein was barely detectable in the Cre-expressed MEF extracts (Figure 6A, top). Consistent with the known affinity of the DDB complex for damaged DNA, these DDB1-deficient MEF (DDB1−/−) extracts were deficient in UV-DDB activity as judged by a gel mobility shift assay using a UV-damaged DNA as the probe (Figure 6B). We then measured the steady-state levels of various known DDB1-Cul4A substrates and cell cycle regulators by immunoblotting of the infected MEF lysates (Figure 6A). The levels of Cdt1, p27Kip1, and c-Jun were all increased in DDB1−/− MEFs as compared with control DDB1F/F MEFs, while the levels of cyclin E, cyclin A, and Serine-5 phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Pol II) did not exhibit obvious changes. After UV irradiation, Cdt1 was completely degraded in DDB1F/F MEFs, but dramatically increased in the absence of DDB1. This result is consistent with the recent finding that DDB1-Cul4A is the major E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the degradation of Cdt1 in response to UV damage (Nishitani et al., 2006Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K.

https://openalex.org/W1964170234,"A recent genome-wide bioinformatic analysis indicated that 54% of human genes undergo alternative polyadenylation. Although it is clear that differential selection of poly(A) sites can alter gene expression, resulting in significant biological consequences, the mechanisms that regulate polyadenylation are poorly understood. Here we report that the neuron-specific members of a family of RNA-binding proteins, Hu proteins, known to regulate mRNA stability and translation in the cytoplasm, play an important role in polyadenylation regulation. Hu proteins are homologs of the Drosophila embryonic lethal abnormal visual protein and contain three RNA recognition motifs. Using an in vitro polyadenylation assay with HeLa cell nuclear extract and recombinant Hu proteins, we have shown that Hu proteins selectively block both cleavage and poly(A) addition at sites containing U-rich sequences. Hu proteins have no effect on poly(A) sites that do not contain U-rich sequences or sites in which the U-rich sequences are mutated. All three RNA recognition motifs of Hu proteins are required for this activity. Overexpression of HuR in HeLa cells also blocks polyadenylation at a poly(A) signal that contains U-rich sequences. Hu proteins block the interaction between the polyadenylation cleavage stimulation factor 64-kDa subunit and RNA most likely through direct interaction with poly(A) cleavage stimulation factor 64-kDa subunit and cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 160-kDa subunit. These studies identify a novel group of mammalian polyadenylation regulators. Furthermore, they define a previously unknown nuclear function of Hu proteins.

These studies identify a novel group of mammalian polyadenylation regulators. Furthermore, they define a previously unknown nuclear function of Hu proteins. Polyadenylation, a process through which a poly(A) tail of 150–250 adenosines is added to the 3′-end of a newly synthesized mammalian pre-mRNA, plays an essential regulatory role in almost every aspect of gene expression including transcription termination, splicing, mRNA transport, mRNA stability, and protein translation (1Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent genome-wide bioinformatic analysis indicated that a significant number of human and mouse genes undergo alternative polyadenylation (54 and 32%, respectively) (2Tian B. Hu J. Zhang H. Lutz C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Of the human genes with multiple polyadenylation sites, 41% have polyadenylation sites located on different exons, indicating an important role for polyadenylation in gene regulation. A well characterized example of this type of regulation is the human calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) 3The abbreviations used are: CGRP, calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide; ELAV, embryonic lethal abnormal visual; USE, upstream sequence element; CPSF, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor; CstF, cleavage stimulation factor; CF, cleavage factor; RT, reverse transcription; hGH, human growth hormone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SVL, SV40 late; TIAR, T-cell internal antigen-related protein; RRM, RNA recognition motif. 3The abbreviations used are: CGRP, calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide; ELAV, embryonic lethal abnormal visual; USE, upstream sequence element; CPSF, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor; CstF, cleavage stimulation factor; CF, cleavage factor; RT, reverse transcription; hGH, human growth hormone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SVL, SV40 late; TIAR, T-cell internal antigen-related protein; RRM, RNA recognition motif. gene, which has two alternative 3′-terminal exons that are selectively included in two different tissues to produce two functionally distinct polypeptides (3Amara S.G. Jonas V. Rosenfeld M.G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 1982; 298: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Polyadenylation of eukaryotic pre-mRNA is a two-step reaction including cleavage and addition of the poly(A) tail to the newly generated 3′-end (1Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Edmonds M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 285-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, two major cis-acting elements define a poly(A) site, a highly conserved AAUAAA hexanucleotide located 10–30 nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site and a G/U- or U-rich downstream element located 20–40 downstream of the cleavage site. Some poly(A) sites also contain one or more U-rich upstream sequence elements (USEs) surrounding the AAUAAA. Trans-acting factors are required to assemble on a poly(A) site to carry out the polyadenylation reaction. The multiprotein cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex binds at the AAUAAA sequence through the CPSF160 subunit. The heterotrimeric complex cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) binds at the downstream element sequence through the CstF64 subunit. In addition to these two complexes, poly(A) polymerase, and cleavage factors I and II (CFI, CFII), the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and nuclear poly(A)-binding protein I are also involved in polyadenylation (1Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Edmonds M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 285-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although nearly all of the components of the basal polyadenylation machinery have been identified and reconstituted in vitro, regulation of polyadenylation is not well understood. The factors that have been shown to regulate polyadenylation include two basal polyadenylation factors, CFIm68 and CstF64 (5Takagaki Y. Seipelt R.L. Peterson M.L. Manley J.L.

Although a testis-specific basal polyadenylation factor, CstF64 protein, was proposed to change the preference of the machinery as a whole to favor poly(A) sites containing non-canonical hexanucleotides (13Wallace A.M. Dass B. Ravnik S.E. Tonk V. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. MacDonald C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14MacDonald C.C. Redondo J.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), factors that regulate transcript-specific events in a tissue-specific manner have not been identified in mammalian cells. Interestingly, this type of factor has been demonstrated in flies. The embryonic lethal abnormal visual (ELAV) protein was recently shown to inhibit the non-neuronal 3′-end processing, thereby promoting the neural splicing of the erect wing (ewg) pre-mRNA (15Lisbin M.J. Qiu J. White K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2546-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Soller M. White K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2526-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mammalian Hu proteins are a group of RNA-binding proteins closely related to the Drosophila ELAV protein. The three neuron-specific members of the Hu family, HuB (HelN1 in human), HuC, and HuD, were cloned as autoimmune antigens of a paraneoplastic neurodegenerative disorder called Hu syndrome (17Szabo A. Dalmau J. Manley G. Rosenfeld M. Wong E. Henson J. Posner J.B. Furneaux H.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 325-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). All members of the Hu protein family have been shown to interact with AU-rich elements and regulate mRNA stability; the human HuB protein HelN1 has also been shown to modulate translation (18Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3024-3037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated a nuclear function of Hu proteins as regulators of alternative RNA processing (19Zhu H. Hasman R.A. Barron V.A. Luo G. Lou H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; Google Scholar), although the underlying mechanism remains to be determined. Given that ELAV and Hu proteins belong to a well conserved protein family, we have investigated the possibility that Hu proteins regulate polyadenylation in mammalian cells. In this report, we have provided evidence for a novel function of the neuron-specific Hu proteins as polyadenylation regulators. Using an in vitro polyadenylation assay with HeLa cell nuclear extract and recombinant Hu proteins, we have shown that both cleavage and poly(A) addition at two of the four tested poly(A) sites (SV40 late (SVL) and the non-neuronal alternative 3′-terminal exon 4 of the calcitonin/CGRP pre-mRNA) are blocked by Hu proteins. We have demonstrated that the polyadenylation inhibition is specific to poly(A) sites that contain a U-rich sequence near cleavage sites and depends on binding of Hu proteins to the U-rich sequences. Furthermore, we have shown that the third RRM on Hu proteins, which is dispensable for RNA binding, is required to block polyadenylation. We have also discovered interactions between Hu proteins and two poly(A) factors, CstF64 and CPSF160, and shown that Hu proteins block binding of CstF64 to the U-rich sequence-containing poly(A) site. These studies identify a novel nuclear function of Hu proteins as polyadenylation regulators. They also suggest a novel mechanism of regulated alternative RNA processing by Hu proteins in neurons. Plasmids—To generate cDNA sequences of the mouse HuB and HuC, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out using RNA isolated from the mouse F9 cells and mHuB- or mHuC-specific oligonucleotides. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Biosciences). The HuA/HuR cDNA in pTet.Myc.HuR (a gift from Dr. Ann-Bin Shyu, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX) was digested with EcoRV and subcloned into pcDNA3.1HisB. Human growth hormone (hGH) plasmids were PCR-cloned from HeLa cell genomic DNA. The reporters used in the cell transfections contain the human metallothionein 2A exon 1 and 170 nucleotides of intron 1 fused with 90 nucleotides of intron 2 and 120 nucleotides of exon 3 as well as either 200 nucleotides of the SVL poly(A) site or 265 nucleotides of the hGH poly(A) site. The reporters were generated by PCR-directed cloning. Recombinant Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were prepared using the B-PER GST spin purification kit (Pierce). Nuclear Extract—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells and the mouse brain as previously described (20Lou H. Neugebauer K.M. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4977-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1997; 3: 996-1015Google Scholar). In Vitro Assays—Polyadenylation cleavage, poly(A) addition, UV cross-linking reactions, and gel mobility shift assay were carried out as described previously (22Lou H. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5959-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cross-linked polypeptides were immunoprecipitated using Hu patient sera (a gift from Dr. Jerome Posner, NY) or anti-CstF64 antibody 3A7. In Vitro Translation, GST/His Pulldown, and Co-immunoprecipitation—In vitro translation was performed with the TnT-coupled transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega). GST/His pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described previously (23Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). RNase A was included in the pulldown assays. HeLa Cell Transfection—Transfection, RNA isolation, RT-PCR analysis, protein isolation, and Western blot analysis were carried out as previously described (23Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). One microgram of reporter, 1 μg of LacZ plasmid, and 0.4 μg of HuR or pcDNA3.1HisB plasmid were used in the transfections. Radioactivity in RT-PCR products was measured by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. RT-PCR products of the pre-mRNA and mRNA were excised from a gel and sequenced to confirm their identity. Hu Proteins Block Polyadenylation at Sites Containing U-rich Sequences—A subset of mammalian cellular and viral poly(A) sites contain U-rich USE sequences that function to promote efficient polyadenylation at these sites (23Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The fact that Hu proteins specifically bind to the AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated regions of a number of mammalian mRNAs to regulate mRNA stability prompted us to examine whether Hu proteins might also play a role in regulating polyadenylation. To address this question, we carried out in vitro polyadenylation assays using HeLa cell nuclear extract and recombinant Hu proteins. Both cleavage and poly(A) addition were assayed. We chose poly(A) sites derived from four pre-mRNAs based on U content in the vicinity of the poly(A) sites. Of the four sites, the SVL poly(A) site and the human calcitonin/CGRP exon 4 poly(A) site contained more than one U-run that contained three or more Us, whereas the hamster adenine phosphoribosyl transferase and hGH poly(A) sites did not (Fig. 1A). The SVL poly(A) site had several U-runs both upstream and downstream of the cleavage site, whereas the calcitonin exon 4 poly(A) site had one long U-run between the hexanucleotide and cleavage site and another one upstream of the hexanucleotide. The sizes of the cleavage and precleaved poly(A) addition substrates for all four poly(A) sites are shown in Fig. 1B. All but the growth hormone poly(A) site have been previously documented in similar polyadenylation cleavage assays (22Lou H. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In establishing the poly(A) addition assay, we initially confirmed that, under our assay conditions, poly(A) addition at the calcitonin exon 4 poly(A) site is dependent on the AAUAAA hexanucleotide (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the addition of GST-mHuB blocked polyadenylation of the SVL and calcitonin exon 4 poly(A) sites at both the cleavage and poly(A) addition steps but had no effect on adenine phosphoribosyl transferase and growth hormone poly(A) sites. Addition of the GST protein had no effect on any of the poly(A) sites. Note that the low cleavage activity of the calcitonin exon 4 poly(A) site made it somewhat difficult to assess the effect of Hu proteins on polyadenylation cleavage of this site. However, the reproducible reduction of the cleavage activity coupled with a significant reduction of the poly(A) addition activity (Fig. 2B) and the CstF64 binding activity (see Fig. 5A) in the presence of the Hu proteins clearly indicates that Hu proteins affect polyadenylation at this site. We tested all of the Hu proteins (HuR, mHuB, mHuC, and hHuD) in polyadenylation cleavage assays on the SVL poly(A) site and found no difference in their ability to block polyadenylation (supplemental Fig. S1A). Results with only GST-mHuB are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The ability of the Hu proteins to block polyadenylation does not correlate with the strength of the poly(A) sites, because SVL and calcitonin exon 4 represent the two extremes, the former being a very strong site and the latter a weak site (Fig. 2, A and B, compare the product to the precursor ratio in lane 1 of the SVL and calcitonin exon 4 panels).FIGURE 5Hu proteins interact with poly(A) factors.

We suspected that Hu proteins bind to the U-rich sequences located close to the AAUAAA hexanucleotide in the SVL and calcitonin exon poly(A) sites, which is the binding site of the 160-kDa subunit of cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factors (CPSF160) required for both steps of polyadenylation. To determine whether Hu proteins bind to any of the four poly(A) sites, UV cross-linking/immunoprecipitation assays were carried out using HeLa cell nuclear extract supplemented with the recombinant GST-mHuB protein. Anti-Hu sera derived from patients who suffer from the Hu syndrome that can detect all three neuron-specific Hu proteins (HuB, HuC, and HuD) (but not the ubiquitously expressed HuA (HuR)) were used to immunoprecipitate the cross-linked proteins. Precleaved substrates that contained only the sequences upstream of the cleavage site were used in this assay. Interestingly, strong binding of mHuB to both the SVL and calcitonin exon 4 poly(A) sites (but not to the adenine phosphoribosyl transferase and growth hormone sites) was detected (Fig. 2C). A gel mobility shift assay using the same RNA substrate was also carried out, the result of which is consistent with the cross-linking/immunoprecipitation assay (supplemental Fig. S2). These results imply that Hu proteins preferentially block poly(A) sites containing U-rich sequences. The stronger binding of mHuB at the SVL site than at the calcitonin exon 4 site was most likely a reflection of the existence of multiple U-runs at the SVL site (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the cleavage assay, all of the Hu protein members were capable of binding at the SVL poly(A) site (supplemental Fig. S1). Because Hu proteins showed a robust inhibition in the poly(A) addition assay and the calcitonin exon 4 poly(A) site had only one significant U-run between the hexanucleotide and cleavage site, we next used this specific assay to further test the specificity of the Hu effect in polyadenylation. We generated three mutant RNA substrates that contained different point mutations in the U-rich region (Fig. 3A). When we examined these mutant substrates for binding to Hu proteins and poly(A) addition activity, we observed a strong inverse correlation between the two activities. A U-rich sequence mutant (Fig. 3A, mut 1) that completely abolished Hu protein binding also lost its ability to be regulated by Hu proteins in the poly(A) addition assay (Fig. 3B, compare lane 2 to 1, and 3C, compare lane 5 to 2). A milder mutant (Fig. 3A, mut 3) that showed reduced but still detectable Hu binding activity was partially blocked by an Hu protein in the poly(A) addition assay (Fig. 3B, compare lane 4 to 1, and 3C, compare lane 11 to 2). Finally, in mutant 2, where the C-rich (but not the U-rich) sequence was disrupted, Hu protein binding was not affected nor was poly(A) addition (Fig. 3B, compare lane 3 to 1, and 3C, compare lane 8 to 2). These experiments establish a strong correlation between binding of Hu proteins and their ability to regulate polyadenylation. All of the Three RRMs on Hu Proteins Are Required to Block Polyadenylation—It is possible that Hu proteins block polyadenylation by binding to the U-rich sequences close to a poly(A) site and simply block the access of poly(A) factors to the polyadenylation signals. We carried out two sets of experiments to address this issue. First, because U-rich sequences can also be bound by other proteins such as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein and TIAR, we tested whether these proteins would block polyadenylation of the SVL poly(A) site. Both proteins were similar to Hu proteins in size. The addition of GST-TIAR did not affect poly(A) cleavage at this site, even though it can bind to the SVL RNA with comparable affinity as GST-mHuB (Fig. 4, A and C). Addition of GST-polypyrimidine tract-binding protein did not affect polyadenylation at this site either (data not shown). These results indicate that the polyadenylation-inhibitory effect is specific to the Hu proteins. Second, specific RNA binding was demonstrated previously for the RRM1 and RRM2 domains of HuD and the RRM3 domain for HuB (Hel-N1/HelN2) (26Levine T.D. Gao F. King P.H. Andrews L.G. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 27Gao F.B. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 579-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To test which RRMs are required to block polyadenylation, we generated two truncation mutants of mHuB, one containing RRMs 1 and 2 and the other RRM3 (Fig. 4B). Neither of these two mutants blocked SVL polyadenylation cleavage (Fig. 4B). However, RRM12 (but not the RRM3 mutant) showed strong binding to RNA (Fig. 4C). The exact same result was observed with the hHuD full-length and RRM12 mutant (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that binding to RNA by itself is not sufficient for Hu proteins to block polyadenylation. It is likely that Hu proteins interact with polyadenylation factors to block their polyadenylation activity. Hu Proteins Block Binding of CstF64 to Poly(A) Sites and Interact with Two Polyadenylation Factors—To probe the mechanism whereby Hu proteins inhibit polyadenylation of SVL and calcitonin exon 4, we first tested whether the addition of Hu proteins to HeLa cell nuclear extract blocks CstF64 binding to the GU/U-rich sequence downstream of the cleavage sites. As shown in Fig. 4A, via UV cross-linking/immunoprecipitation analysis using the cleavage substrate (Fig. 1B) and anti-CstF64 antibody, binding of CstF64 to the calcitonin exon 4 poly(A) sites is significantly reduced in the presence of increasing amounts of GST-mHuB protein but not the control GST protein (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, a protein with a higher mobility was also detected in this assay. A similar result was observed with the SVL substrate (data not shown) (27Gao F.B. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 579-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identified this protein as GST-mHuB based on its size, intensity, and the fact that, when His-hHuD was used instead of GST-mHuB in this assay, an extra band with the expected molecular weight of the His-hHuD protein was detected (data not shown). This result is interesting in light of the observation that the Drosophila ELAV protein is co-immunoprecipitated with dCstF64 when added to the non-neuronal nuclear extract to examine binding of dCstF64 to the non-neuronal poly(A) site of the ewg pre-mRNA. However, in that case, binding of dCstF64 to the poly(A) site was not reduced by the ELAV protein (16Soller M. White K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2526-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The CstF64 binding result indicates that Hu proteins block polyadenylation of SVL and the calcitonin exon 4 by interfering with the interaction of poly(A) factors to the poly(A) sites and also suggests that CstF64 interacts with Hu proteins. To test this hypothesis, we examined the potential interaction between Hu proteins and poly(A) factors by a GST/His pulldown assay using recombinant Hu proteins (GST-mHuB, GST-mHuC, and His-hHuD) and 35S-labeled CstF64, CPSF160, or CFIm68. RNase was included to ensure that any interaction detected was not mediated by RNA. The result of this experiment demonstrates that Hu proteins interact with CstF64 and CSPF160 but not CFIm68 (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Thus, Hu proteins block polyadenylation by interacting, mostly likely directly, with CstF and CPSF, which are required for both cleavage and poly(A) addition steps. To test whether the interaction between Hu proteins and poly(A) factors occurs in vivo in cells where Hu proteins are naturally expressed, we carried out a co-immunoprecipitation assay using nuclear extract isolated from the mouse brains. CstF64 was detected in the complex immunoprecipitated with the anti-Hu sera, whereas the control proteins TIA-1/TIAR were not detected (Fig. 5C). HuR Blocks Polyadenylation of the SVL Poly(A) Site in Cultured Cells—To demonstrate the biological relevance of our findings in vitro, we tested whether the results could be duplicated in a cell transfection experiment. We made two reporter constructs that were identical, except for the poly(A) sites; one contained the SVL poly(A) site and the other the hGH poly(A) site (Fig. 6A). The two reporters were individually transfected with either a vector control or the HuR expression plasmid in HeLa cells. A third plasmid, LacZ expression vector, was included as an internal control. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out using total RNA isolated from the transfected cells and two sets of primers. One set of primers was used to detect the precursor transcript and the other set, including an oligo(dT) primer, to detect the polyadenylated mRNA. As shown in Fig. 6B, the level of the SVL poly(A) site-containing mRNA was decreased when HuR was overexpressed. Importantly, this change in the mRNA level was accompanied by an increase in the pre-mRNA level, suggesting that the HuR effect was not the result of a change in mRNA turnover. No significant change of either the mRNA or the pre-mRNA level was observed with the reporter containing the hGH poly(A) site in the absence or presence of overexpressed HuR. Interestingly, we observed reduced splicing when the transcript containing the SVL poly(A) site was blocked at polyadenylation. This result is consistent with the previously demonstrated coupling of polyadenylation and splicing during RNA processing (Refs. 29Cooke C. Hans H. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Cooke C. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4579-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Kyburz A. Friedlein A.

Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). It has been documented that mutations of polyadenylation signal AAUAAA or downstream sequences decreases not only polyadenylation but also splicing efficiency. In this report, we have demonstrated that the mammalian Hu proteins regulate polyadenylation by blocking poly(A) sites containing U-rich sequences. Our studies expand the very short list of polyadenylation regulators in mammals. Given that >50% of human pre-mRNAs undergo alternative polyadenylation and alternative poly(A) sites are frequently associated with AU-rich sequences within 100 nucleotides from the cleavage site on both sides (2Tian B. Hu J. Zhang H. Lutz C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 33Hu J. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J. Tian B. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2005; 11: 1485-1493Google Scholar), understanding how Hu proteins regulate alternative polyadenylation is of great importance. The polyadenylation-regulating activity of Hu proteins correlates with their binding to the U-rich sequences upstream of the cleavage site. These U-rich sequences are similar to the previously characterized USEs present in some of the cellular and viral poly(A) sites and necessary for efficient polyadenylation at those sites harboring them (23Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the case of the calcitonin exon 4 poly(A) site, mutation of the U-rich sequence did not reduce the polyadenylation efficiency (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). Thus, whether the U-rich sequence functions as a classical USE in this poly(A) site remains to be further determined. Recently, Kaufmann et al. (23Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a newly discovered human CPSF subunit, Fip1, binds to the L3 U-rich USEs surrounding AAUAAA and stimulates poly(A) polymerase. Interestingly, in this study, Fip1 was also found to bind to the SVL poly(A) site, the same site that can be blocked by Hu proteins (23Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In a more recent study by Zhao et al. (34Zhao X. Oberg D. Rush M. Fay J. Lambkin H. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4270-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a 57-nucleotide USE was identified in human papillomavirus 16 that interacts with several nuclear factors including Fip1. Taken together, these studies suggest an intriguing potential mechanism in which Hu proteins compete with and/or prevent Fip1 from binding to the U-rich sequences. In light of another recent discovery (7Venkataraman K. Brown K.M. Gilmartin G.M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) that CFIm68 binds to a number of USE sequences containing UGUAN repeats and promotes polyadenylation and that the SVL poly(A) site contains such repeats, it remains a formal possibility that Hu proteins and CFIm may modulate the polyadenylation activity of sites that contain binding sites for both proteins through their competing activities. Given that USEs have been identified in an increasing number of cellular poly(A) sites (23Kaufmann I. Martin G. Friedlein A. Langen H. Keller W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 35Hall-Pogar T. Zhang H. Tian B. Lutz C.S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2660-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it will be of particular interest to further investigate the role of Hu proteins in USE-mediated polyadenylation regulation. How do Hu proteins regulate polyadenylation? We demonstrate that all three of the RRMs of Hu proteins are required for the polyadenylation-blocking activity of these proteins, suggesting that RNA-binding activity alone is not sufficient. Presumably, RRM3 and the hinge region are involved in interacting with the poly(A) factors. We favor a model in which Hu proteins bind to RNA and poly(A) factors simultaneously. Such interactions may modulate the structure of the poly(A) complex formed on the U-rich sequence-containing sites in a way that renders the complex non-functional. Presumably, neither RNA binding nor interaction with poly(A) factors alone can induce such a rearrangement. Given that three of the Hu proteins are neuron-specific and interact with CstF64 in brain nuclear extract (Fig. 5C), our studies also suggest an appealing mechanism for neuron-specific alternative RNA-processing regulation. Calcitonin/CGRP pre-mRNA is differentially processed in neurons, where the non-neuronal calcitonin exon 4 is skipped and the exons 5 and 6 are included to produce CGRP (3Amara S.G. Jonas V. Rosenfeld M.G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 1982; 298: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). It was previously demonstrated that inclusion of exon 4 is promoted by a number of factors bound at an intronic element in non-neuronal cells (20Lou H. Neugebauer K.M. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4977-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Zhu H. Hasman R.A. Young K.M. Kedersha N.L. Lou H. Mol. Cell.

Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Of these factors, U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein and SRp20 were shown to promote polyadenylation of this exon (20Lou H. Neugebauer K.M. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4977-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Lou H. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that Hu, as well as Fox-1/Fox-2 proteins promote the neuron-specific skipping of the calcitonin exon 4 (19Zhu H. Hasman R.A. Barron V.A. Luo G. Lou H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; Google Scholar, 43Zhou H.L. Baraniak A.P. Lou H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). It is highly likely that, in neurons, Hu proteins block polyadenylation of exon 4, thereby promoting the neuron-specific pathway. This mechanism may function in conjunction with other neuronal factors, such as Fox-1/Fox-2, to regulate the neuron-specific skipping of exon 4. A similar example is the Drosophila ewg pre-mRNA. ELAV protein, the Drosophila homolog of Hu proteins, inhibits 3′-end processing within the non-neuronal exon of the ewg pre-mRNA to promote neural splicing (16Soller M. White K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2526-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although both Hu proteins and ELAV block polyadenylation, major differences exist between the functions of these proteins. ELAV binds to several runs of AU-rich sequence downstream of the cleavage site of the non-neuronal 3′-terminal exon close to where CstF64 binds, whereas Hu proteins bind at sequences adjacent to the AAUAAA hexanucleotide, the CPSF160 binding site. However, it is possible that Hu proteins function through binding at the downstream U-rich sequences of those sites, such as SVL, that contain such sequences (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the addition of ELAV to nuclear extract isolated from non-neuronal cells did not block interaction of dCstF64 and RNA in contrast to what we observed for the Hu proteins (Fig. 5) (16Soller M. White K. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2526-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results suggest potential distinct or different variations of mechanisms for these two putative orthologous proteins in regulating polyadenylation.

Bacterial nitrate reductases are molybdoenzymes that catalyze the two-electron reduction of nitrate to nitrite.

Periplasmic nitrate reductases (Nap) are also linked to quinol oxidation in respiratory electron transport chains, but do not conserve the free energy of the QH2-nitrate couple. Nitrate reduction via Nap can be coupled to energy conservation if the primary quinone reductase, for example NADH dehydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase, generates a proton electrochemical gradient. Thus Nap systems have a range of physiological functions that include the disposal of reducing equivalents during aerobic growth on reduced carbon substrates and anaerobic nitrate respiration as part of bacterial ammonification or denitrification pathways (2Richardson D.J.

In Nap systems electrons from quinol are generally, but not always, passed through one or two cytochrome c-containing proteins (NapC and NapB) to the catalytic subunit, NapA, that contains a bis-Mo-MGD cofactor and a [4Fe-4S] cluster (7Breton J.

For example, in the periplasmic enzymes, cysteine provides a thiol ligand to the molybdenum ion, whereas aspartate provides one or two oxygen ligands to the molybdenum ion in the membrane-bound enzymes (3Jormakka M.

In evolutionary terms the periplasmic and cytoplasmic assimilatory enzymes are most closely related, and this is reflected in similar spectroscopic properties between the two enzymes, although the redox properties of the molybdenum centers have become tuned for their different metabolic functions (2Richardson D.J.

Bioinformatic analyses reveal that the periplasmic nitrate reductase is phylogenetically widespread in proteobacteria (2Richardson D.J. Berks B.C. Russell D.A. Spiro S. Taylor C.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), but detailed biochemical and spectroscopic studies have been restricted to enzymes from relatively few species. The catalytic subunit (NapA) from periplasmic nitrate reductases from the α-proteobacteria Paracoccus denitrificans and Rhodobacter sphaeroides forms a very tight complex with a di-c-heme subunit (NapB). This heterodimeric complex resists separation by a range of chromatographic methods that disrupt weak protein-protein interactions (10Arnoux P. Sabaty M. Alric J. Frangioni B. Guigliarelli B. Adriano J.M. Pignol D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Richardson D.J. McEwan A.G. Page M.D. Jackson J.B. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and a KD of 0.5 nm has been experimentally determined for the reduced NapAB complex of the R. sphaeroides (10Arnoux P. Sabaty M. Alric J. Frangioni B. Guigliarelli B. Adriano J.M. Pignol D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A 3.2-Ä resolution structure of this enzyme suggests that tight complex formation is contributed to by two loops at the N- and C-terminal extremities of NapB that adopt an extended conformation and embrace the NapA subunit (10Arnoux P. Sabaty M. Alric J. Frangioni B. Guigliarelli B. Adriano J.M. Pignol D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, another structure of NapA, the 1.9 Ä resolution structure from the δ-proteobacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, is that of a monomer, and there is currently no evidence that this enzyme ever forms a heterodimer with a NapB subunit (9Dias J.M.

Sabaty M. Alric J. Frangioni B. Guigliarelli B. Adriano J.M. Pignol D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has recently been shown that there is no napB gene in the D. desulfuricans nap operon (17Marietou A. Richardson D.J. Cole J.A. Mohan S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 248: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In E. coli NapA is part of a periplasmic electron transfer system that, together with a nitrite reductase (NrfA), can reduce nitrate to ammonium (so-called ammonification). This process can be coupled to energy-conserving electron transport with, for example, formate as electron donor (18Potter L. Angove H. Richardson D.J. Cole J.A. Adv. Microbiol. 2001; 45: 52-102Google Scholar). The E. coli NrfA protein, which catalyzes reduction of nitrite to ammonium, has been the recent subject of detailed structural and spectropotentiometric analysis (19Bamford V. Angrove H. Seward H.

By contrast the Nap enzyme, which catalyzes the first stage of ammonification, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, has never been purified from E. coli.

Cultures of strain LCB2048 (pJG460) were grown in glycerol and nitrate (GN) minimal salts medium containing 0.4% glycerol and 20 mm potassium nitrate (19Bamford V. Angrove H. Seward H. Butt J.N.

For scaleup, initial GN medium cultures (250 ml) were inoculated with 0.5 ml of overnight cultures grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani broth medium. The 250-ml GN cultures were transferred to 2-liter batches of fresh GN medium and grown overnight at 37 °C. Purification of NapA and NapB—Periplasmic proteins were extracted from the harvested cells as described previously (19Bamford V. Angrove H. Seward H. Butt J.N. Cole J.A. Thomson A.J. Hemmings A.H.

The column was developed using a wash buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 30 mm KCl, and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 30 to 200 mm KCl. The eluted NapA fractions were applied to a butyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 m NaCl, and 2% glycerol. The column was developed using a 3 to 0 m NaCl gradient over 20 column volumes, and NapA eluted at the end of the gradient. NapA was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex-200 column (0.9 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2% glycerol. The fractions containing NapB after DEAE-cellulose chromatography were applied to a butyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4.5 m NaCl, and 2% glycerol. The column was developed using a 4.5 to 0 m NaCl gradient over 20 column volumes and NapB eluted at the end of the gradient. NapB was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex-75 column (0.9 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard (27Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Crystal Structure Determination of NapA—E. coli NapA was concentrated to 10 mg ml-1 (∼90 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Crystals of typical dimensions, 200 × 50 × 10 μm3, were obtained from vapor diffusion experiments using 20% (w/v) PEG 4000 and 10% (v/v) 2-propanol in 100 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.6. The crystals could be cryoprotected by transferring them to the same crystallization solution but in addition containing 25% (v/v) glycerol. The crystals belong to space group P21 with cell parameters a = 69.5 Ä, b = 95.0 Ä, and c = 131.2 Ä with β = 96° (Table 1) and contain two molecules of NapA in the asymmetric unit. X-ray data were collected on station ID14.2 at the ESRF, Grenoble, France, using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector and processed to 2.5 Ä resolution using MOSFLM (28Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). The structure of E. coli NapA was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the homologous enzyme from D. desulfuricans (PDB accession code 2NAP) as the search model. The program MOLREP from the CCP4 program suite (29Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) gave a clear solution for the two molecules with a correlation coefficient of 0.46 and an Rcryst of 49.7% for data in the resolution range 15.0 to 4.0 Ä. Following rigid body refinement, the Rcryst for this model (residues 4–257, 258–506, and 515–723 from the D. desulfuricans NapA structure) using all data to 2.5 Ä had converged to 46.1%.TABLE 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsData collection Space groupP21 Cell parametersa (Ä)69.51b (Ä)94.96c (Ä)131.18β (Ä)95.99 ResolutionaNumbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution bin (Ä)40-2.5 (2.57-2.50) Rsym (%)9.3 (27.1) Completeness (%)97.9 (98.8) Unique reflections57,564 (4042) I/σ(I)11.2 (3.0)Refinement Rcryst18.7 (25.6) Rfree24.7 (35.1) No. of nonhydrogen atomsProtein6240Cofactor103Solvent488 Standard deviation from ideal geometryBond lengths (Ä)0.014Bond angles (°)1.61 Average temperature factorsAll atoms29.6a Numbers in parentheses refer to the highest resolution bin Open table in a new tab Model building was carried out using the program O (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). For refinement, 5% of reflections was set aside for the calculation of Rfree. Inspection of difference Fourier maps at this stage allowed the manual rebuilding of 71 residues. Residues that differed significantly in position between the D. desulfuricans and E. coli structures were removed from the model. A single round of simulated annealing refinement followed by three rounds of conjugate gradient minimization interspersed with manual rebuilding enabled a complete amino acid model to be built for each monomer, including all cofactors. This process converged to give an Rcryst of 24.1% and an Rfree of 28.0%. After the addition of water molecules into significant residual electron density, the structure was refined to give a final Rcryst of 18.0% and Rfree of 23.6%. The final model consists of residues 1–791, one [4Fe-4S] cluster, one molybdenum and two molybdopterin guanidine dinucleotide molecules for each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit plus 488 water molecules.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), the final structure has all residues in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot except Ala-2, Glu-159, Trp-492, His-690, and Ala-704. Structural comparisons were carried out using the program DALI (33Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). Representations of molecular electrostatic potential surfaces were prepared using GRASP (34Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors for the E. coli NapA have been deposited in the PDB with the accession code 2NYA. Potentiometric Titrations—Poising of samples for EPR analyses were performed with the sample stirred in a glass cell housed in an anaerobic chamber and thermostated at 4 °C with a platinum wire and saturated calomel reference electrode. Potassium ferricyanide was used to fully oxidize the protein to +400 mV, and dithionite was used as the reductant in the potential range of +50 to -550 mV. Titrations were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl. Electrode-solution mediation was facilitated by the following mediators at a 10 μm concentration: neutral red, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, safranin T, phenosafranin, and benzyl viologen. After equilibration at each potential, a 300-μl sample was removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the EPR spectrum recorded. Mediated UV-visible spectrophotometric redox potentiometry was undertaken on NapB using methodology described by Dobbin et al. (35Dobbin P.S. Butt J.N. Powell A.K. Reid G.A. Richardson D.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Titrations with dithionite on 0.2 μm NapB protein were performed in a cuvette placed in the spectrophotometer that contained a platinum wire and calomel combination glass electrode. The cuvette was maintained under an argon atmosphere at 20 °C in 20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5. Mediators (duroquinone, phenazine ethosulfate, phenazine methosulfate, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid, menadione, and benzyl viologen) were used at a concentration of 10 μm. Spectra were acquired in situ at the desired potentials. For the redox titration of NapB in the NapAB complex, the concentration of protein needed to ensure complex formation was so high (100 μm) that the absorbance was too great for in situ collection of spectra. Thus these titrations were carried out in an anaerobic glove box as described for the EPR analyses. 50-μl samples were withdrawn at the desired potentials and placed into 1-mm light path cuvettes in the glove box, which were sealed and removed from the glove box, whereas the UV-visible spectra were recorded. Reduction potentials are referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode. Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX system X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat and a dual mode EPR cavity. Spin quantification of the EPR signals was estimated by double integration and comparison with a 2 mm Cu2+-EDTA standard, all measured under nonsaturating conditions. Conditions of measurement are as described in the appropriate figure legends. UV-visible absorption spectra of purified NapA and NapB were obtained on a Hitachi U4001 UV-visible spectrometer. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments were performed using a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. The partial specific volume of NapA and NapB was calculated from the amino acid sequence using the program SEDNTERP (36Philo J.M. Biophys J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and had a value of 0.734 and 0.726 ml g-1, respectively. An equimolar mixture of NapA and NapB was dialyzed and diluted to appropriate concentrations with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were undertaken at 20 °C, 8,500 and 9,500 rpm. The concentration profiles of the NapA and NapB mixture in the AUC were measured at 410, 420, and 530 nm for 5 μm NapAB, and 440, 470, and 530 nm for 20 μm NapAB. Scans were recorded every 4 h to determine when the mixture had reached equilibrium in the centrifuge. After equilibrium had been achieved, five scans were recorded for each sample. For reduced NapAB experiments, 1 μl of a 1 m sodium dithionite solution was added to the ultracentrifuge cells in an anaerobic cabinet to give a final concentration of 10 mm. After reduction, the concentration profiles of the 5 μm sample were measured at 420, 440, and 550 nm, and 440, 450, and 530 for the 20 μm sample. The absorbance at 420 and 550 nm was carefully measured before and after the experiment to ensure that NapA and NapB remained reduced over the time required to achieve equilibrium. The program ULTRASCAN was used to fit the obtained sedimentation equilibrium profiles to two different possible systems, either a single component system or a system involving a two-component heterologous complex. To obtain a dissociation constant for the NapAB complex, molecular masses for NapA and NapB of 90 and 17 kDa were used. The absorbance coefficients of NapA and NapB at each wavelength measured were determined from their absorbance spectra. Purification of NapA and NapB from E. coli—Soluble extracts were prepared from anaerobically grown E. coli LCB2048 (pJG460) and chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose anion exchange column. Analysis of column eluates by a combination of nitrate reductase assays, nitrite reductase assays, absorption at 410 nm (characteristic of cytochromes), and heme-stained SDS-PAGE allowed the different Nrf and Nap components of the enzymes involved in periplasmic reduction of nitrate to ammonium to be resolved. These are the NrfA nitrite reductase and penta-heme electron donor NrfB, and the NapA nitrate reductase and di-heme electron donor NapB. This revealed that NapA did not co-elute with the NapB (Fig. 1A). Following separation by anion exchange, NapA and NapB were further purified separately to yield protein of >95% purity (Fig. 1, B and C). The NapA preparation was stained for nitrate reductase activity on native PAGE (Fig. 1B; note that NapA migrates differently on SDS and native PAGE), and the NapB preparation was stained for heme-dependent peroxidase activity on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). The final yields of NapA and NapB were routinely 20–50 μg/liter of starting culture. The chromatographic separation of E. coli NapA and NapB distinguishes them from the well characterized periplasmic nitrate reductases of the α-proteobacteria R. sphaeroides and Paracoccus pantotrophus, in which NapA forms a tight complex with NapB such that a heterodimeric NapAB complex co-elutes through a range of chromatographic matrices, including anion exchange (10Arnoux P.

Formation of the NapAB Complex—To explore further the strength of the interaction between E. coli NapA and NapB, the dissociation constant of the air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced NapA-NapB complex was measured using sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. Equimolar mixtures of NapA and NapB at 5 and 20 μm were studied. Equilibration was performed at two centrifugation speeds of 8,500 and 9,500 rpm and monitored through the absorbance of NapA and NapB at different wave-lengths (410, 420, and 530 nm) that were selected from different points of the NapA and NapB UV-visible absorption spectra. Each experiment was performed five times giving a total of 45 equilibration gradients that were then analyzed using ULTRASCAN. Some representative data sets are shown in Fig. 1D that were collected at 8,500 rpm. The relative absorbance domains of the sedimentation curves at"

However, it is unclear whether nutlins increase or decrease the side effects of these drugs in normal non-malignant cells or tissues. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapy drug, which has a major side effect of kidney injury. Here we show that Nutlin-3 protected kidney cells against cisplatin-induced apoptosis. The cytoprotective effects of Nutlin-3 were not related to its regulation of p53 or consequent gene expression during cisplatin treatment. Moreover, the protective effects were shown in MDM2-, MDM4-, or p53-deficient cells. On the other hand, Nutlin-3 suppressed mitochondrial events of apoptosis during cisplatin incubation, including Bax activation and cytochrome c release. Nutlin-3 attenuated cisplatin-induced oligomerization of Bax and Bak but not their interactions with Bcl-XL. In isolated mitochondria, Nutlin-3 inhibited cytochrome c release induced by Ca2+, Bim peptide, and recombinant tBid. Importantly, it blocked both Bax and Bak oligomerization under these conditions. Together, the results have uncovered a new pharmacological function of nutlins, i.e. suppression of Bax and Bak, two critical mediators of apoptosis. Nutlins, the newly developed small molecule antagonists of MDM2, activate p53 and induce apoptosis in cancer cells, offering a novel strategy of chemotherapy.

Nutlins are cis-imidazoline compounds, which were recently identified to be the first potent and selective small molecule antagonists of MDM2 2The abbreviations used are: MDM2, murine double minute 2; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: MDM2, murine double minute 2; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; AFC, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI, propidium iodide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

This leads to the inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation via the proteasomal pathway, resulting in p53 accumulation and activation. The unique targeting ability of nutlins suggests the potential use of these compounds in chemotherapy for cancers with wild-type p53 (2Fischer P.M. Lane D.P. Trends Pharmacol.

Nutlins induce p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells and suppress the growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice. Importantly, there is evidence that nutlins, while being toxic to cancer cells, do not induce cell death or apoptosis in normal non-malignant cells and tissues (1Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B.

Due to their unique targeting of p53-MDM2 interaction, nutlins have been tested recently for their synergistic effects with existing therapies. It has been shown that nutlins are synergistic with antimitotic agents, genotoxic drugs, and radiation in cancer therapy (4Cao C. Shinohara E.T. Subhawong T.K. Geng L. Kim K.Woon Albert J.M.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1918-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These preclinical studies have further supported the potential use of nutlins in combinational therapy with existing drugs or treatments. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether nutlins may increase or decrease the side effects of the therapies in normal tissues or organs. In this area, a recent study has suggested the possibility of using nutlins to activate temporary cell cycle arrest in normal tissues to protect against the side effects during chemotherapy with mitotic inhibitors such as paclitaxel (14Carvajal D. Tovar C. Yang H. Vu B.T. Heimbrook D.C. Vassilev L.T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1918-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Major side effects of chemotherapy are frequently shown in the kidneys and renal tissues, which are the sites for filtration, concentration, and excretion of the drugs. For example, cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapy drug (15Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 16Jordan P. Carmo-Fonseca M. Cell. Mol.

Nephrol. 2005; 148: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism underlying cisplatin nephrotoxicity remains unclear, we and others have recently suggested the involvement of p53 signaling (21Cummings B.S. Schnellmann R.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 22Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J. Du C. Yu J. Zhang L. Dong Z.

Moreover, inhibition of p53 with the pharmacological inhibitor pifithrin-α or a dominant-negative p53 mutant attenuates kidney cell apoptosis during cisplatin treatment (23Jiang M. Yi X. Hsu S. Wang C.Y. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1140-F1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). p53 may induce apoptosis in these cells by up-regulation of apoptotic genes, including PUMA-α (22Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J. Du C. Yu J. Zhang L. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This study sought to: 1) determine the regulation of p53 signaling by nutlins in kidney tubular cells; 2) determine whether nutlins ameliorate or aggravate cisplatin-induced toxicity or apoptosis in these cells; and 3) examine the mechanism underlying the effects of nutlins. We show that Nutlin-3 induced p53 but not PUMA-α and did not induce apoptosis in kidney cells. Importantly, Nutlin-3 suppressed kidney cell apoptosis during cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, the cytoprotective effects of Nutlin-3 were dissociated from its regulation of MDM-p53 signaling. Nutlin-3 blocked Bax and Bak activation and cytochrome c release in kidney cells and also in isolated mitochondria. The results suggest a new pharmacological function of nutlins, i.e. inhibition of Bax and Bak. By this function, nutlins may protect normal cells and tissues during cancer therapy. Materials—The rat kidney proximal tubular cell line was from by Dr. U. Hopfer (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) and maintained for experiments as described (22Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J.

The MDM2 or MDM4-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were from Dr. G. Lozano (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) (26Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 27Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). HCT116 cells were obtained from Dr. B. Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD). Antibodies used in this study were from the following sources: rabbit polyclonal anti-p53 and anti-phospho-p53 (Ser-15) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); monoclonal anti-MDM2 (SMP14) and monoclonal anti-p21 (F-5) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal anti-Bcl-XL (2H12) and monoclonal anti-Bax (1D1) from NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA); polyclonal anti-Bak (NT) and polyclonal anti-Bax (NT) from Upstate Biotechnology; monoclonal anti-cytochrome c from BD Pharmingen; polyclonal anti-PUMA from Dr. J. Yu (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA); all secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Nutlin-3 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The Bim peptide with a sequence of DNRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNAYYAR was commercially synthesized by GenScript Corp. (Scotch Plains, NJ). Chemical cross-linker bismaleimidohexane was from Pierce. Carbobenzoxy-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (DEVD-AFC) and AFC were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit was from BD Pharmingen. Other reagents, including cisplatin, were from Sigma. Cisplatin Treatment—Cisplatin treatment of cultured cells was conducted as described in our recent publications (22Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J. Du C. Yu J. Zhang L. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 23Jiang M. Yi X. Hsu S. Wang C.Y. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1140-F1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cisplatin was used at 20 μm for kidney cells, 50 μm for HCT116 cells, 100 μm for p53-deficeint baby mouse kidney, MDM2-deficient MEF, and MDM4-deficient MEF cells. Nutlin-3 dissolved in Me2SO was added alone or together with cisplatin at indicated concentrations. One group of cells was added Me2SO as a solvent control. At the end of incubation, cells were monitored morphologically or harvested to collect cell lysates for biochemical analyses. For cell lysis, both floating and adherent cells were collected. Morphological Examination of Apoptosis—Apoptotic cells were identified by their morphology as described in our previous studies (23Jiang M. Yi X. Hsu S. Wang C.Y. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1140-F1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Dong Z. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9215-9221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by exposure to 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 2–5 min to stain the nuclei. Cellular and nuclear morphology was examined by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was characterized by cellular shrinkage, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Four fields with ∼200 cells per field were examined in each condition to estimate the apoptosis percentage. Images of representative fields were also recorded. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Apoptosis—Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, cells were detached by trypsinization and harvested along with the floating cells by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Following washes in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin, the cells were resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) at a final cell density of 1–2 × 106 cells/ml. Single cell suspension of 100 μl (1–2 × 105 cells) was incubated with 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of PI for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After adding 400 μlof binding buffer, the samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For each sample, 10,000 events were counted. Measurement of Caspase Activity—Caspase activity was measured enzymatically using the fluorogenic peptide substrate DEVD-AFC (23Jiang M. Yi X. Hsu S. Wang C.Y. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F1140-F1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Dong Z. Wang J. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted with 1% Triton X-100. The lysates of 25 μg of protein were incubated with enzymatic reactions containing 50 μm DEVD-AFC at 37 °C for 60 min. Fluorescence at excitation 360 nm/emission 530 nm was then monitored by a GENios plate-reader (Tecan US Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC). A standard curve was constructed using free AFC for each measurement. Based on the standard curve, the fluorescence reading from each enzymatic reaction was converted into a nanomolar amount of liberated AFC per milligram of protein to indicate caspase activity. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane for reducing gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were then electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were sequentially incubated with blocking buffer, primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antigens on the blots were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) from Pierce. Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation was conducted according to our recent work (22Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J. Du C. Yu J. Zhang L. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Dong Z. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9215-9221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates were collected with a buffer containing 2% CHAPS. The lysates of 500 μg of protein were precipitated with 20 μlof agarose protein A/G and 1 μg of anti-Bax or anti-Bcl-XL. The resultant immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 2% SDS buffer for electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis to detect the presence of Bax and Bcl-XL. Dual Immunofluorescence of Cytochrome c and Active Bax— Cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips. After experiments, the cells were fixed with a modified Zamboni fixative containing picric acid and 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% SDS, followed by blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% milk, and 2% normal goat serum. The cells were subsequently exposed to a mixture of primary antibodies (rabbit anti-active Bax and mouse anti-cytochrome c), followed by incubation with a mixture of FITC-labeled goat-anti-rabbit and Cy3-labeled goat-anti-mouse secondary antibodies. After extensive washes, signals were examined by confocal microscopy under Cy3 and FITC channels. Cellular Fractionation—Cells were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane-bound organellar fractions by using digitonin, which at low concentrations selectively permeabilizes the plasma membrane without solubilizing mitochondria (22Jiang M. Wei Q. Wang J. Du C. Yu J. Zhang L. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4056-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Dong Z. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9215-9221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.05% digitonin in an isotonic buffer (in mm: 250 sucrose, 10 Hepes, 10 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2,1 EDTA, and 1 EGTA (pH 7.1)) for 2 min at room temperature. The soluble extract was collected as cytosolic fraction. The digitonin-insoluble part was washed with isotonic sucrose buffer and further dissolved in 2% SDS buffer as membrane-bound organellar fraction enriched with mitochondria. These two fractions were analyzed for Bax and cytochrome c by immunoblotting. Isolation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (30Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39474-39481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping gently. The cells were then homogenized with a 1 ml of Wheaton homogenizer in buffer A (in mm: 250 sucrose, 10 HEPES-NaOH, 10 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, and 0.5 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.2)). The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The resultant supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to sediment the heavy membrane fractions containing mitochondria. All procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C. The mitochondrial preparation was kept on ice in buffer B (in mm: 250 sucrose, 10 HEPES-NaOH, 10 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 5 sodium succinate, and 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.4)) and used for experiments within 1 h of isolation. Cytochrome c Release from Isolated Mitochondria—This assay was modified from our previous work (30Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39474-39481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria of ∼15 μg of protein were preincubated in 60 μlof buffer B (see above for compositions) at 30 °C for 15 min with Nutlin-3 or vehicle solution, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The preincubated mitochondria were then gently resuspended in 60 μl of buffer B and treated for 20 min at 30 °C with various reagents (1.2 mm CaCl2,25 μm Bim peptide, 10 ng of wild-type tBid, or mutant tBid) in the absence or presence of Nutlin-3. To analyze cytochrome c release, the incubation mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet and supernatant were analyzed for cytochrome c by immunoblotting. Bax and Bak Oligomerization— Bax and Bak oligomerization in cells and isolated mitochondria was analyzed by a method modified from our previous work (28Dong Z. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9215-9221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Yi X. Yin X.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16992-16999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated mitochondria or the digitonin-insoluble membrane fraction of the cells were incubated with 5 mm bismaleimidohexane for 30 min of cross-linking at room temperature under constant mixing. The cross-linked samples were then subjected to immunoblot analysis of Bax and Bak. Statistics—Data were expressed as means ± S.D. (n ≥ 3). Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism software. Statistical differences in multiple groups were determined by multiple comparisons with Tukey's post-tests following analysis of variance. Statistical differences between two groups were determined by two-tailed unpaired Student t test. p < 0.05 was considered significantly different. Apoptotic Effects of Nutlin-3 in Kidney Tubular Cells—Recent studies have shown that nutlins activate p53 by interfering with p53-MDM2 interaction, leading to apoptosis and growth inhibition in cancer cells. Notably, at these concentrations (10–20 μm), nutlins were not toxic to normal cells or tissues (1Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the basal level of spontaneous apoptosis in these cells was ∼4%, and Nutlin-3 at 1–20 μm did not induce further apoptosis. At 30 μm, Nutlin-3 increased apoptosis to ∼10%. Apoptosis induced by 30 μm of Nutlin-3 showed typical apoptotic morphology with cellular and nuclear condensation and fragmentation (not shown). The morphological examination was consistent with the measurements of caspase activity. As shown in Fig. 1B, Nutlin-3 at 20 μm and lower concentrations did not activate caspases, whereas marginal caspase activation was induced by 30 μm Nutlin-3. Regulation of p53 Signaling by Nutlin-3—We then determined whether p53 and related signaling were regulated by Nutlin-3 in renal tubular cells. To this end, we treated kidney tubular cells with 20 μm Nutlin-3 for 0–24 h, and collected cell lysates for immunoblot analysis. Representative blots and results of densitometric analysis are shown in Fig. 2. Nutlin-3 treatment for 4 h induced a modest p53 accumulation, which increased markedly at 8 h and was maintained thereafter. p53 was phosphorylated after 4 h of Nutlin-3 treatment, and interestingly the phosphorylation decreased during subsequent incubation. Nutlin-3 also induced a drastic increase of MDM2, and similar to p53 phosphorylation, MDM2 decreased toward basal levels after 16–24 h of Nutlin-3 treatment. For gene expression downstream of p53, we detected p21 induction after 4–8 h of Nutlin-3 treatment, and again the induction decreased thereafter. Interestingly, despite its effects on p53 and p21, Nutlin-3 did not induce PUMA-α at any time points (Fig. 2). The absence of apoptotic gene (e.g. PUMA-α) induction may account for the lack of toxicity of Nutlin-3 in kidney cells.

We tested the ability of two Bacillus subtilis flavodoxins (YkuN and YkuP) to support catalysis by purified B. subtilis NOS (bsNOS). When an NADPH-utilizing bacterial flavodoxin reductase (FLDR) was added to reduce YkuP or YkuN, both supported NO synthesis from either l-arginine or N-hydroxyarginine and supported a linear nitrite accumulation over a 30-min reaction period. Rates of nitrite production were directly dependent on the ratio of YkuN or YkuP to bsNOS. However, the V/Km value for YkuN (5.2 × 105) was about 20 times greater than that of YkuP (2.6 × 104), indicating YkuN is more efficient in supporting bsNOS catalysis. YkuN that was either photo-reduced or prereduced by FLDR transferred an electron to the bsNOS ferric heme at rates similar to those measured for heme reduction in the animal NOSs. YkuN supported a similar NO synthesis activity by a different bacterial NOS (Deinococcus radiodurans) but not by any of the three mammalian NOS oxygenase domains nor by an insect NOS oxygenase domain. Our results establish YkuN as a kinetically competent redox partner for bsNOS and suggest that FLDR/flavodoxin proteins could function physiologically to support catalysis by bacterial NOSs.

The NOSs catalyze an NADPH- and O2-dependent oxidation of Arg to generate NO and citrulline, with formation of N-hydroxyarginine (NOHA) as an intermediate (Fig. 1). Each NOS is only active as a homodimer, and their subunits are comprised of an N-terminal oxygenase domain, a C-terminal flavoprotein domain, and a central calmodulin binding motif. After calmodulin binds to NOS, the flavoprotein domain provides electrons to the heme in the NOS oxygenase domain, which enables the heme to bind O2 and catalyze two cycles of oxygen activation as required for NO synthesis from Arg (8Wei C.C.

From a structural perspective, bacterial NOS enzymes preserve most of the key elements of mammalian NOS oxygenase domains, including the extensive dimer interface and the heme and substrate binding sites. However, bacterial NOSs lack N-terminal hook structures that are involved in binding a structural Zn2+ atom and the side chain of the 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor (H4B) in mammalian NOSs (15Sudhamsu J.

They also lack an associated C-terminal flavoprotein domain and central calmodulin binding motif that are present in the mammalian NOSs. Despite these differences, the catalytic properties of bacterial NOSs are similar to those of mammalian NOS oxygenase domains, with the exception that the bacterial NOSs have a slower rate of NO dissociation from their ferric heme (15Sudhamsu J. Crane B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9623-9632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16167-16171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which may limit the release and detection of their synthesized NO. Because bacterial NOSs have no attached flavoprotein domains, distinct proteins must provide the electrons needed for their O2 activation. Like many prokaryotic P450s, the physiological electron donors are still unknown (22Degtyarenko K.N. Kulikova T.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 139-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous results revealed that bsNOS is capable of accepting electrons from a mammalian NOS flavoprotein domain (NOSred) to produce nitrite in a NADPH-dependent manner (18Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16167-16171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the observed activity and electron transfer rate is far below the normal range found in intact full-length NOS enzymes, suggesting that the native redox partner of bsNOS probably differs significantly from NOSred. Indeed, bacterial P450 enzymes can be active in a three-protein system in which a small iron-sulfur-containing ferredoxin transfers electrons from an FAD-containing NAD(P)H ferredoxin reductase to the P450 enzyme (22Degtyarenko K.N.

The availability of the B. subtilis genome has made it possible to identify potential redox partners for bsNOS. There are several candidate electron transfer proteins present in the genome, including NADPH cytochrome P450 reductases (CPR), flavodoxins (FLD), an NADPH:adrenodoxin reductase (ADR), putidaredoxin reductases (PdR), sulfite reductases (SiR), a cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R), and ferredoxins (11Kunst F.

Among these, the FLDs are small FMN-binding proteins whose molecular mass typically ranges from 14 to 23 kDa (25Lawson R.J. von W.C. Haq I. Perkins J. Munro A.W.

Perkins J. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12390-12409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). FLD enzymes are found in a wide range of microbes and in some lower eukaryotes (28Mayhew S.G. Tollin G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 389-426Google Scholar) and act as electron carriers between other redox proteins. The two FLD in B. subtilis, (YkuN and YkuP) have recently been cloned, characterized, and shown to support lipid hydroxylation by B. subtilis cytochrome P450 BioI in the presence of Escherichia coli NADPH-flavodoxin reductase (FLDR) (25Lawson R.J. von W.C. Haq I. Perkins J. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12390-12409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the two FLD enzymes from B. subtilis and found that YkuN was particularly good at supporting electron transfer and catalysis by bsNOS. Our findings suggest that the FLDR/YkuN enzyme system could be a physiologic electron donor for NO synthesis in B. subtilis.

Protein Expression and Purification—bsNOS DNA cloned into pET15b vector was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Enzymes were purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate affinity chromatography as reported previously (18Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16167-16171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Concentrations of NOS enzymes were determined from the 444 nm absorbance of the ferrous-CO complex, using an extinction coefficient 76 mm–1 cm–1 (32Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis flavodoxins (YkuN and YkuP) and E. coli flavodoxin NADP+ oxidoreductase (FLDR) were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (25Lawson R.J. von W.C.

Their concentrations were measured using an extinction coefficient of 7.1 mm–1 cm–1 (FLDR) and 10 mm–1 cm–1 (FLD), respectively. Nitrite and Nitrate Production—Reactions were run in a 96-well microplate and generally contained 30 μm FLDR, 3 μm FLD, 0.3 μm bsNOS, 40 mm EPPS, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 200 μm H4B, and 500 μm NOHA. This solution was preincubated on ice for 45 min before NADPH was added to initiate the reaction and then was run for 15, 30, or 90 min at 37 °C. Any remaining NADPH was consumed by adding 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 10 mm sodium pyruvate immediately at the end of the reaction period. Nitrite was detected by adding Griess reagent to each well and was quantitated from the absorbance difference at 550 and 650 nm based on standard nitrite solutions. In most cases superoxide dismutase (SOD) was added to the reactions as noted. In certain cases nitrite reductase was used to measure the total amount of nitrite plus nitrate produced in the reactions. Briefly, reactions that had run for the indicated times at 37 °C were then boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatants were distributed into 96-well plates. Nitrate reductase (0.1 unit/ml) and NADPH were added, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before addition of lactate dehydrogenase and sodium pyruvate. NO Synthesis and NADPH Oxidation Rates—NO production in the three-component reactions was determined by the spectrophotometric oxyhemoglobin assay using a difference extinction coefficient of 38 mm–1 cm–1 at 401 nm (29Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Santolini J. Panda K. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4676-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Reaction solutions contained 40 mm EPPS, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 200 μm H4B, 0.6 mm DTT, 400 μm NOHA (or 1 mm Arg), 150 units/ml SOD, 6 μm oxyhemoglobin, 0.7 μm NOS, and 0.7 or 2.1 μm YkuN and FLDR. bsNOS was omitted in the reference cuvette. Reactions were run at room temperature and were initiated by adding 200 or 300 μm NADPH to both reference and sample cuvettes. For NADPH oxidation rate measurements, the reactions contained 0.2 μm NOS, 10 μm YkuN, and 4.9 μm FLDR, and an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm–1 cm–1 at 340 nm was used to measure the rate. Heme Reduction by Photo-reduced FLD—Solutions of 6–32 μm FLD protein in 40 mm EPPS buffer (pH 7.6) containing 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm EDTA were placed in an anaerobic cuvette and underwent repeated cycles of vacuum and N2 purging. A trace of 5-deazariboflavin was then added to the solution followed by several cycles of vacuum and N2 purging. Protein samples were illuminated gradually for several seconds using a commercial slide projector bulb until fully reduced flavodoxin was obtained (33Konas D.W. Zhu K. Sharma M. Aulak K.S. Brudvig G.W. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35412-35425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The photo-reduced flavodoxin solution was then mixed with an anaerobic solution containing 2 μm bsNOS, 400 μm H4B, 5 mm Arg, 1.2 mm DTT, and a half-saturating concentration of CO at 10 °C in a Hi-Tech (SF-61) stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped for anaerobic work and coupled to a Hi-Tech MG-6000 diode array detector. Heme reduction was followed by the absorbance increase at 444 nm due to formation of the ferrous-CO complex. Observed rates of heme reduction were determined by fitting the absorbance traces to a single or double exponential function. Data from 6 to 10 mixing experiments were averaged, and the observed heme reduction rates were plotted against the FLD concentration. The data were fit to a linear function to obtain the second order rate constant for bsNOS heme reduction by the FLD. Single Catalytic Turnover Reactions—NOHA oxidation reactions were carried out in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer at 10 °C. A solution containing 40 μm FLDR, 40 mm EPPS (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol was made anaerobic and then an anaerobic NADPH solution was added gradually to reduce FLDR. An anaerobic solution of YkuN (40 μm) was then added, and the solution was transferred to the stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Reactions were initiated by mixing this solution with an aerobic solution containing 40 mm EPPS, 4 μm bsNOS, 800 μm H4B, 2 mm NOHA, and 2.4 mm DTT. Ninety-six spectral scans were obtained after each mixing. The rate of heme-NO complex formation was determined from the absorbance increase at 437 nm. Eight to ten scans were analyzed and then averaged to obtain the final trace and rate. In some cases, the reactions utilized a solution of anaerobic, photoreduced YkuN (5 μm) in place of the FLDR/YkuN mixture described above. Flavoproteins in the B. subtilis Genome—The B. subtilis genome codes for 12 proteins that contain FAD and/or FMN (22Degtyarenko K.N. Kulikova T.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 139-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1). Three genes code for proteins that contain binding sites for FAD, FMN, and NADPH and share 20–25% amino acid identity and 30–40% similarity with the mammalian NOS flavoprotein domains (data not shown). These are YvgR, a sulfite reductase flavoprotein (SiR), and two flavin-containing cytochrome P450s (YrhJ and YetO). However, all three of these flavoproteins have hemeprotein redox partners that are either attached as domains or associate in an oligomeric complex. This argues against their being redox partners for bsNOS. 4We found that flavoproteins derived from YvgR or YrhJ supported comparatively little nitrite production by bsNOS and supported extremely slow heme reduction rates (data not shown). In comparison, the two FLD proteins present in the B. subtilis genome (YkuN and YkuP) contain FMN binding sites and are not expected to have exclusive redox partners. We therefore examined their abilities to support bsNOS in detail.TABLE 1Flavin-containing gene products present in the B. subtilis genomeTypeGene products numberCofactorProtein nameFLD(2)FMNYkuN, YkuPCPR(2)FAD/FMNYrhJ, YetOSiR(1)FAD, FMNYvgRb5R(1)FADPdR(5)FADAdR(1)FAD Open table in a new tab Catalytic Activity in a Three-component Reaction System—Catalytic activity was measured as NADPH-dependent nitrite formation from Arg or NOHA in a three-component system containing FLDR, FLD, and bsNOS. In this system, we expected that NADPH-derived electrons would pass from FLDR to FLD and then to bsNOS, and FLDR would be unable to pass electrons directly to bsNOS. In addition, we expected that NOHA would enable about twice as much product formation from bsNOS as does Arg, because a 2:1 product ratio between the two substrates is typically seen in mammalian NOS reactions (34Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Reactions that ran for 90 min and contained 300 nm bsNOS, 3 μm FLDR, and 3 μm YkuN generated 71 ± 1 μm nitrite from Arg and 157 ± 4 μm nitrite from NOHA (n = 6). This shows that the three-component system could convert Arg or NOHA to nitrite and did so in the expected Arg versus NOHA product ratio as noted above. In subsequent reactions we typically used NOHA as the substrate to maximize product formation and simplify comparisons (NOHA oxidation to NO requires that only one electron be transferred to bsNOS, while Arg oxidation to NO requires that three electrons be transferred). In a 30-min reaction, almost 10 nitrite per min was generated from NOHA in a three-component reaction that contained FLDR and YkuN (Table 2). Nitrite production in the reaction was linear for at least 30 min (Fig. 2). Reactions that contained bsNOS, FLD, or FLDR alone, or containing any two of these three protein components, generated only minor amounts of nitrite (Table 2). This confirms that FLDR cannot directly support catalysis by bsNOS and that an FLD protein needs to be present. For comparison, an identical three-component reaction that contained YkuP in place of YkuN produced about half the amount of nitrite in 30 min (4.6 nitrite per min, data not shown). This suggests that YkuN is a somewhat better electron transfer partner for bsNOS than YkuP.TABLE 2Nitrite production and NADPH oxidation rates by bsNOS in the presence or absence of FLDR and YkuNFLDRFLD (YkuN)bsNOSNitrite productionNADPH oxidationmin-1min-1++-0.16 ± 0.01129 ± 5+-+0.27 ± 0.0138 ± 2-++0.11 ± 0.010--+0.15 ± 0.010+++9.9 ± 0.3124 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Adding SOD to the three-component reactions did not diminish nitrite formation in any case, even at SOD concentrations as high as 167 units/ml (data not shown). This argues that the nitrite resulted from oxidation of NOHA by bsNOS and not from a superoxide-based reaction that may occur with NOHA if there is superoxide generated from uncoupled O2 reduction by a heme protein (37Mansuy D. Boucher J.L. Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We utilized nitrate reductase to determine the total amounts of nitrite plus nitrate produced from NOHA in the three-component reactions. We found that the nitrate and nitrite concentrations were approximately equivalent in 30-min reactions that were run at two different protein component ratios (FLDR:FLD:bsNOS = 30:30:1 and 50:50:1; data not shown). Thus, total nitrite plus nitrate could be estimated to be approximately twice the measured nitrite values. This gives an estimated catalytic turnover number for the YkuN-supported bsNOS reaction of 20 min–1, which approaches the range of turnover numbers that are typically observed for the three mammalian NOS enzymes at similar temperature (10–110 min–1) (35Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23246-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Nishida C.R. de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20116-20124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This is remarkable, because in the current system bsNOS catalysis is supported by a physically separate FLD protein and is independent of the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin, which is otherwise essential in the mammalian NOS reactions. The rate of NADPH consumption was also measured in separate three-component reactions (Table 2). The values indicate that FLDR and FLD, when combined, catalyze significant NADPH oxidation independent of bsNOS. Thus, when bsNOS is present, only a minor portion of the total NADPH consumption in the three-component system is coupled to nitrite plus nitrate production, while the rest is oxidized by FLDR/FLD in an uncoupled manner. The uncoupled NADPH oxidation is likely due to flavin autooxidation, which is significant because the FLD and FLDR concentrations in our reactions are 10 times greater than the bsNOS concentration. Fig. 3, A and B, plot the rates of nitrite production observed in three-component reactions that contained different concentrations of YkuN or YkuP and a constant concentration of bsNOS. The nitrite production rate was proportional to the FLD:bsNOS ratio and reached or neared a maximum in both cases. This is consistent with the FLD acting as an intermediate in the electron transfer process and probably participating in a rate-limiting step such as bsNOS heme reduction (6Stuehr D.J. Santolini J. Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Adak S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36167-36170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Apparent Vmax and Km values calculated from data in Fig. 3, A and B, are noted in Table 3. The V/Km values confirm a better catalytic efficiency for YkuN over YkuP regarding bsNOS catalysis. In general, the FLD/bsNOS reactions have catalytic efficiencies that are within the range of many other enzyme systems. This includes the YkuN- or YkuP-driven oxidation reactions of B. subtilis cytochrome P450, whose V/Km values range from 0.4 to 2.3 × 105 (25Lawson R.J. von W.C. Haq I. Perkins J. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12390-12409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our data imply that YkuN (and to a lesser extent, YkuP) would be capable of interacting with bsNOS at low micromolar concentrations in the intact bacterium to drive catalysis.TABLE 3Apparent Vmax and Km values for nitrite production by bsNOS in the presence NADPH, FLDR, and two flavodoxins (YkuN and YkuP)FlavodoxinVmaxKmVmax/Kmmin-1μm× 105 m-1 s-1YkuN50 ± 41.6 ± 0.55.2 ± 1.6YkuP34 ± 322 ± 30.26 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab NO Production by bsNOS—Given the ability of FLDR/YkuN to support bsNOS catalysis, we went on to test for NO release using the oxyhemoglobin spectroscopic assay. Fig. 4 contains a representative trace that indicates NO production from NOHA in a reaction containing FLDR, YkuN, and bsNOS. We observed a prolonged burst phase of NO release (about 60 s at 1.9 NO min–1), followed by an extended period of slower NO release (∼0.12 NO min–1). Other traces that detail the initial phase of NO synthesis from Arg or NOHA are shown in the inset of Fig. 4 and gave initial rates of 2.5 ± 0.2 and 5.7 ± 0.2 min–1 (n = 4), respectively. These rates indicate that NO represents a significant fraction of the N-oxide product(s) being released from bsNOS. Additional experiments suggested that the slower NO release in the later stage of the reactions was associated with buildup of a bsNOS ferrous heme-NO complex (data not shown). Together, our results establish that sustained NO synthesis from Arg or NOHA is possible in a reaction containing FLDR, YkuN, and bsNOS and likely takes place according to the model drawn in Fig. 5.FIGURE 5Model for electron transfer and catalysis in the three-component reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reduction of bsNOS Heme by Photo-reduced FLD—To investigate the kinetics of bsNOS heme reduction we first needed to generate photo-reduced FLD.

These disulfide bonds are generally “intrasubunit or intramolecular disulfide bonds.” When these cysteines are adjacent, the redox change most effectively turns the redox switch on and off (9Park C. Raines R.T. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As an exceptional case, hetero-oligomer ATP synthase is inhibited via the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond between the bc′ and γ subunits because of a mechanical standstill of the molecular motor (10Suzuki T. Suzuki J. Mitome N. Ueno H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37902-37906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This redox switch directly regulates enzymatic activity and can therefore be categorized as a direct and mechanical function. In the cases in which protein function is facilitated via a conformational change caused by cleavage of a disulfide bond, the redox switch is categorized as an indirect function. Rat 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) (EC 2.8.1.2) is a 32.8-kDa simple protein enzyme (11Nagahara N. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27395-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MST catalyzes the degradation of cysteine, detoxifies cyanide (12Nagahara N. Ito T. Minami M. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1277-1286PubMed Google Scholar), and serves as anti-oxidant protein (13Nagahara N. Katayama A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34569-34576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). When oxidative stress builds up in the cells, a sulfur atom of the catalytic site Cys247 donates an electron to the oxidants, and the cysteine is transiently converted to a sulfenate, resulting in the inhibition of MST. Furthermore, as the sulfenate is at a low redox potential, Trx and DTT reduce it to restore its activity, but reduced glutathione does not affect the activity (13Nagahara N. Katayama A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34569-34576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Under oxidizing conditions, the cysteine pool is increased because of post-translational inhibition of methionine synthase (14Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 15Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19246-19249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MST conserves cysteine and contributes to increase the cysteine pool. An increase in the cysteine content in the cell results in an increase in the content of cellular reductants such as Trx and glutathione. Thus, MST contributes to maintain redox homeostasis. In a preliminary study, Escherichia coli reduced Trx activated rat recombinant MST after treatment with DTT, but DTT did not activate MST after treatment with reduced Trx. These findings suggested that reduced Trx reacted with cysteines other than Cys247. It is also possible that Trx reacted with Cys154 and Cys263 on the surface of MST. MST exhibits monomer-dimer equilibrium (17Nagahara N. Sawada N. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The estimated tertiary structure of rat MST (18Nagahara N. Okazaki T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16230-16235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using QUANTA/CHARMm (Molecular Simulations Inc., Tokyo, Japan), based on the x-ray structure of bovine rhodanese (19Ploegman J.H.

Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), suggests that Cys154 and Cys263 in the hydrophobic patch are too far from each other (32 Å) to form an intrasubunit disulfide bond. The dimer is therefore formed via intersubunit disulfide bonds, and reduced Trx would react with the disulfide bond or turn on “a redox switch.” Rat Trx has two redox-active cysteine residues (Cys31 and Cys34) and four structural cysteine residues (Cys45, Cys61, Cys68, and Cys72) (20Wang Y. De Keulenaer G.W. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26496-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which are identical to those of human Trx except Cys45 (21Wollman E.E. d'Auriol L. Rimsky L. Shaw A.

Cys72 is easily oxidized to form an intermolecular disulfide bond (22Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and to undergo glutathionylation (23Casagrande S. Bonetto V. Fratellim M. Gianazza E. Eberini I. Massignan T. Salmona M. Chang G. Holmgren A. Ghezzi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9745-9749Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they modify the Trx reaction with a target protein, which makes a quantitative analysis of change in the target protein function complicated. On the other hand, exposed cysteines are only two redox-active cysteines (Cys32 and Cys35) in E. coli Trx (24Musso R. Di Lauro R. Rosenberg M. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, E. coli Trx has been used to probe a Trx-dependent modification of mammalian protein function (25Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Park E.M. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm that E. coli thioredoxin acts on rat MST. The results provide evidence that reduced Trx also regulates MST at the enzyme level via a redox regulation of intersubunit disulfide bonds. Rat wild type, C64S (in which Cys64 is replaced with serine), C154S, C254S, and C263S MST cDNAs were prepared according to a procedure described previously (13Nagahara N. Katayama A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34569-34576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A cDNA coding a mutant MST, C154S/C263S (in which Cys154 and Cys263 are replaced with serine), was synthesized. A C154S MST cDNA inserted into a pET28a vector (Novagen, San Diego) between the NcoI/XhoI sites was used as a template for the mutagenesis. The primers, rC263S-s, GGGGCCTTCCTCTCTGGCAAACCCGATG, and rC263S-A, CATCGGGTTTGCCAGAGAGGAAGGCCCC, were used to replace of Cys263 with serine. The mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene La Jolla, CA). The parameters for the PCR were as follows: for the first segment, one cycle of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s; for the second segment, 13 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 8.6 min. The PCR product was digested with DpnI and introduced into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue using standard protocols except for preculture in Luria Bertani medium without antibiotics at 37 °C for 1 h before plating. Sequencing was performed to select each mutagenized cDNA using the synthesized antisense primer, AGGATGGTTCGGTGTCAC, to examine the replacement of Cys263 with serine. The mutant cDNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each pET28a vector containing cDNA of the wild type or mutant MST was introduced into E. coli, BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with a pSTV vector containing GroEL and GroES cDNAs. Each enzyme was overexpressed and purified according to the methods described previously (11Nagahara N. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27395-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). E. coli thioredoxin reductase (TRD), wild type (Trx 1), C32S, and C35S Trx cDNAs, rat wild type, and C34S Trx cDNAs were prepared according to the procedure of Abe et al. 3Y. Abe, T. Matsumura, K. Okamoto, S. Iwahara, H. Hori, Y. Takahashi, and T. Nishino, submitted for publication. These proteins were then overexpressed and purified accordingly. 3Y. Abe, T. Matsumura, K. Okamoto, S. Iwahara, H. Hori, Y. Takahashi, and T. Nishino, submitted for publication. Rat TRD was purchased from Sigma. The Trxs (2 mg) were incubated with 10 mm DTT on ice for 12 h in 100 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After gel filtration with a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 20 cm; GE Healthcare), Trx-containing fractions were collected and concentrated with a Microcon YM-3 filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Rat redox Trx would be easily oxidized to form a dimer via an intermolecular disulfide bond, after DTT is removed. Thus, the rat Trx, in which redox-active cysteines are reduced, is referred as a rat reduced Trx. In the Trx-TRD-NADPH system, after incubation of 12 μm wild type MST with NADPH (0, 12, 60, 120, and 300 μm), E. coli or rat Trx (0, 12, 24, 48, 60, and 120 μm), and E. coli or rat TRD (0, 12, 1.2, 0.6, 0.24, and 0.12 μm) in 10 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min, a 5-μl aliquot of the mixture was used for the rhodanese activity assay. In the E. coli or rat reduced Trx system, after incubation of 12 μm wild type MST with E. coli or rat reduced Trx (0, 12, 24, 48, 60, and 120 μm) in 10 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min, a 5-μl aliquot of the mixture was used for the rhodanese activity assay. Additionally the rat reduced Trx system with 1.2 mm DTT was also examined. Time-dependent activation of MST (12 μm) in the E. coli or rat reduced Trx system ([MST]:[reduced Trx] = 5:1) or the Trx-TRD-NADPH system ([MST]:[E. coli Trx]:[E. coli TRD]:[NADPH] = 1:5:0.02:12.5 or [MST]:[rat Trx]:[rat TRD]:[NADPH] = 1:1:0.05: 12.5) was examined in 5 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, and the mixture was used for the rhodanese activity assay. Furthermore, the rat reduced Trx system with 1.2 mm DTT and the Trx-TRD-NADPH system with 1.2 mm DTT were also examined. To remove an outer sulfur of some persulfurated MST, MST was incubated with a 100-fold molar dose of potassium cyanide (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 40 min, and cyanide was removed using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare). Enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated with a VIVASPIN (10,000 molecular weight cutoff; Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). In an activation system using DTT, or E. coli or rat reduced Trx, after incubation of wild type MST with a 100-fold molar dose of DTT or a 5-fold molar dose of reduced Trx in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min, DTT was removed using a PD10 column, and enzyme-containing fractions were collected and concentrated with a VIVASPIN. When MST was activated in the Trx-TRD-NADPH system, wild type MST was incubated in a mixture ([MST]:[E. coli Trx]:[E. coli TRD]:[NADPH] = 1:5:0.02:12.5 or [MST]:[rat Trx]:[rat TRD]: [NADPH] = 1:1:0.05:12.5) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min. After each single or serially combined MST treatment, rhodanese activity was measured, and the ratio of the specific activity of one experimental result to another was calculated. To investigate the mechanism of MST activation by reduced Trx, kinetic studies of untreated and activated wild type, C64S, C254S, and C154/236S MSTs by reduced Trx were performed. As the double-reciprocal plots of velocity versus potassium cyanide concentration were not linear when rhodanese activities were measured with MSTs (18Nagahara N. Okazaki T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16230-16235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), apparent Km and kcat values for thiosulfate were determined with a constant concentration of potassium cyanide at 60 mm. After incubation of 6 μm of mutant MSTs with 0 or 30 μm (5-fold molar dose), reduced Trx in 10 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 20 min, rhodanese activity was measured using an assay mixture containing 60 mm potassium cyanide and 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 mm thiosulfate. For the study of wild type MST, after 6 μm of MST was incubated with 0, 3, 6, 12, or 30 μm reduced Trx or 0.6 mm DTT, rhodanese activity was measured using an assay mixture containing 60 mm potassium cyanide, and 12.5, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 mm thiosulfate. For titration of the enzymes under reducing conditions, oxygen in the solvent was removed using a glass apparatus by sequential evacuation and re-equilibration with oxygen-free argon. Oxygen-free argon was prepared by passing commercially obtained pure argon through a column of a Chromatopack Gas-Clean Oxygen Filter CP17970 (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). After incubation of 300 μm wild type, C154S, C263S, and C153S/C236S MSTs with 5 mm DTT in 30 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice overnight under anaerobic conditions, DTT was removed from each sample with a NAP 5 column before analysis. Each enzyme (20 μm) was incubated with 0.5 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 25 °C for 60 min, and the change in absorbance at 412 nm (ϵ412 = 13,600 m–1) was measured. The ratio of free SH groups of each enzyme under air-saturated conditions to that under reducing conditions was calculated. HPLC Analysis during Trx Activation of MSTs—Wild type, C154S, C263S, and C154S/C263S MSTs (0.3 nmol) were incubated with E. coli reduced wild type, E. coli C32S, or E. coli C35S Trx (1.5 nmol) in 20 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, on ice for 20 min. Untreated and C35S Trx-treated wild type MST were incubated with 1.5 mm DTT in 20 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, on ice for 20 min and 12 h. All samples were analyzed using an HPLC system (PU-2080Plus and UV2075Plus, JUSCO, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with two TSK gel filtration columns (G3000SWXL, 7.8 mm × 30 cm and G2000SWXL, 7.8 mm × 30 cm, TOSOH Corp., Tokyo, Japan), which were connected in series. The mobile phase was composed of 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and detection was made at 280 nm. For the calibration curve, a gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine gamma globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), and equine myoglobin (17 kDa) was used. Trx Attack Mode—After wild type MST (12 μm) was incubated with E. coli reduced C32S Trx (0, 36, 60, or 120 μm) or reduced C35S Trx (0, 36, 60, 120, or 360 μm) in 10 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, on ice for 30 min, a 10-μl aliquot of the mixture was assayed for the rhodanese activity. Another 5-μl aliquot was further incubated with DTT (1.2 mm) on ice for 30 min and then assayed for rhodanese activity. A procedure to measure rhodanese activity by catalyzing the trans-sulfuration from mercaptopyruvate to β-mercaptoethanol would not be appropriate for this experiment, because β-mercaptoethanol reduces disulfide bonds formed between subunits during incubation in the assay mixture. MST possesses rhodanese activity, which catalyzes trans-sulfuration from thiosulfate to cyanide (11Nagahara N. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27395-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Nagahara N. Okazaki T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16230-16235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); therefore, it was this rhodanese activity of MST that was measured. The protein concentrations were determined with a Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce) with crystalline bovine serum albumin (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA) as the standard. Time and Dose Dependence of Enzymatic Activity of MST by Reduced Trx and Trx-TRD-NADPH Systems—MST was activated in a time-dependent manner by the E. coli or rat reduced Trx system, and also by the E. coli or rat reduced Trx-TRD-NADPH system (Fig. 1A). MST activation quickly proceeded with increasing concentrations of reagents in each reducing system (Fig. 1, B–E). These findings suggest that, similar to rat Trx, E. coli Trx reacts with rat MST. In the E. coli Trx-TRD-NADPH system, MST activity increased to 4.5-fold that of the control with 48 μm E. coli Trx and 0.24 μm E. coli TRD (Fig. 1, C and D). In the rat Trx-TRD-NADPH system, MST activity increased to 3-fold that of the control with 12 μm rat Trx and 0.6 μm rat TRD (Fig. 1, C and D). In the E. coli reduced Trx system, MST activity increased to 4.5-fold that of the control with 48 μm E. coli Trx (Fig. 1E). In the rat reduced Trx system, MST activity increased to 3.0-fold that of the control with 60 μm rat Trx (Fig. 1E). It is noteworthy that additional treatment with DTT (1.2 mm) increased MST activity to 5-fold that of the control, implying that DTT acted on rat Trx to modify its function and/or directly activated MST (Fig. 1E). For the Trx-TRD-NADPH system in this study, we determined that the ratio of [MST] to [E. coli reduced Trx], [E. coli TRD], and [NADPH] was 1 to 5, 0.02, and 12.5, respectively, and the ratio of [MST] to [rat reduced Trx], [rat TRD], and [NADPH] was 1 to 1, 0.05, and 12.5, respectively. For the reduced Trx system, we determined that the ratio of [MST] to [reduced Trx] was 1 to 5. MST Activation by DTT, Reduced Trx, and Trx-TRD-NADPH System—E. coli reduced Trx, the E. coli Trx-TRD-NADPH system, and DTT activated wild type, C64S, C154S, C254S, and C263S MSTs under air-saturated conditions (Table 1). The effect of E. coli reduced Trx on the activation of each MST was similar to that of the E. coli Trx-TRD-NADPH system. Wild type, C64S, and C254S MSTs responded well to the reducing systems, and for C154S/C263S MST little responded. C154S and C263S MSTs were low responsive to the reducing systems, and their activities were increased to 1.9- and 3.1-fold that of each control group, respectively.TABLE 1MST activation by the Trx-TRD-NADPH system, reduced Trx (RedTrx), and DTTEnzymeTrx + TRD/untreatedaSpecific activity of a group in which 12 μm MST was treated with 60 μm E. coli Trx combined with 0.24 μm TRD and 150 μm NADPH.,bSpecific activity of an untreated control group.RedTrx/untreatedcSpecific activity of a group in which MST was treated with 60 μm E. coli reduced (Red) Trx.DTT/untreateddSpecific activity of a group in which DTT was removed on a PD10 column after treatment of MST with 1.2 mm DTT.RedTrx (DTT-)/DTTeSpecific activity of a group in which DTT was removed on a PD10 column after treatment of MST with 1.2 mm DTT, and the DTT-treated MST was incubated by 60 μm E. coli reduced Trx.DTT (RedTrx+)/RedTrxfSpecific activity of a group in which 1.2 mm DTT was added after MST was treated by 60 μm E. coli reduced Trx.

Open table in a new tab DTT also activated MSTs to between 1.1- and 2.4-fold the activity of each control. Furthermore, we previously revealed that reduced Trx quickly restored hydrogen peroxide-inhibited MST, in which oxidants formed a sulfenate at a catalytic Cys247, and DTT equivalently or more efficiently restored the activity (13Nagahara N. Katayama A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34569-34576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This finding and the results of this study indicate that Cys154 and Cys263, other than the catalytic Cys247, are sites of action for Trx and DTT, and DTT acts mainly on a sulfenyl Cys247. To minimize the action of Trx on a sulfenyl Cys247, after the MSTs were treated with DTT and the DTT was removed, MSTs were treated with E. coli reduced Trx. Wild type, C64S, and C254S MSTs were activated to 2.3-, 2.2-, 2.8-fold that of each DTT-treated MSTs, respectively. On the other hand, after MSTs were treated with E. coli reduced Trx, MSTs were then treated with DTT. Their activities ranged between 1.0- and 1.2-fold that of each Trx-treated MST. The results confirm that E. coli reduced Trx acts on Cys154 and Cys263 other than Cys247 in the activation of MST. The results of a comparative study using rat Trx and rat TRD are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The rat Trx-TRD-NADPH system and rat reduced Trx activated wild type MST to 3.1- and 3.0-fold that of the control, respectively. It is noteworthy that, although DTT co-existed in the reducing systems using rat Trx, these activities further increased to 4.8- and 5.0-fold that of the control, respectively (Fig. 1E and Table 1). These findings are similar to those of experiments using E. coli Trx and E. coli TRD. It is strongly suggested that DTT modifies rat Trx function to further activate MST probably because of reduction of an intersubunit disulfide bond at Cys72 in a rat Trx dimer, which dissolved oxygen would easily form. The reducing system using rat Trx is not suitable for a quantitative study of Trx function on a protein. Kinetic Studies of the Enzymatic Activation—As the action of E. coli wild type Trx on Cys154, Cys263, and Cys247 of MSTs cannot be clearly discriminated, the results of the overall activation kinetics were compared. Lineweaver-Burk plots and kinetic parameters for wild type, C64S, C154S, C254S, C263S, and C154S/C263S MSTs are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. In wild type MST, Lineweaver-Burk plots for 1/[thiosulfate] versus 1/[velocity] showed that the activation followed pseudo-first order Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, all of the lines did not intersect at a single point, suggesting that the activation process with various concentrations of reduced Trx involved an increase in kcat(app) and a decrease in Km(app). The activation proceeded via “cleavage of the covalent intermediate of a single enzyme molecule with Trx” (see also under “Attack Mode of Trx to MST”) and resulted from possible conformational changes.TABLE 2Change in kinetic parameters for rhodanese activity of MST in enzymatic activationEnzymeUntreatedaAn untreated control group is indicated.Thioredoxin-treatedeA group in which MST was treated by E. coli reduced Trx is shown.Km(app)bKm(app) value for thiosulfate (TS) as a substrate used a constant concentration of KCN at 60 mm.kcat(app)ckcat(app) value is for rhodanese activity.kcat/KmdRatio of mean value for kcat(app) for rhodanese activity to that for Km(app) for thiosulfate is shown.Km(app)bKm(app) value for thiosulfate (TS) as a substrate used a constant concentration of KCN at 60 mm.kcat(app)ckcat(app) value is for"

However, this textbook view of E2Fs is increasingly under challenge. Here we discuss an alternative model for how E2Fs may work. Activation of E2F transcription factors is thought to drive the expression of genes essential for the transition of cells from G1 to S phase and for the initiation of DNA replication. However, this textbook view of E2Fs is increasingly under challenge. Here we discuss an alternative model for how E2Fs may work. The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway is frequently deregulated in cancer. Characterizing its downstream effectors could provide insight into the mechanisms driving the proliferation of cancer cells. The identification of E2F transcription factors as downstream effectors of the RB protein has ignited research efforts resulting in more than 3000 publications to date (according to PubMed). Target genes of E2Fs were initially implicated in the regulation of the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle and in DNA replication. More recently, microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have shown that genes involved in differentiation, apoptosis, and DNA-damage signaling pathways are also targets of E2F activity. Despite the wealth of data about E2Fs, there is still debate as to the actual role of these transcription factors: Do E2Fs drive the cell cycle or do they inhibit it, and is this action due to E2F-mediated transcriptional activation or repression? So far, eight mammalian E2F family members have been identified. The expression of various E2Fs is differentially regulated throughout the cell cycle, and some E2Fs are expressed in a cell type-specific manner. Five E2F family members have the ability to interact with the RB family of proteins (pRB, p107, and p130, also known as pocket proteins). These E2Fs harbor both transactivation domains and repression domains (see Figure 1A). When bound to pocket proteins, E2Fs mediate transcriptional repression; when released by pocket proteins, these E2Fs can act as transactivators, and target genes are expressed. For transcriptional activation, E2Fs form complexes with histone acetyl transferases (HATs) such as p300, CBP, P/CAF, and Tip60. For transcriptional repression, E2F forms complexes (via pocket proteins) with histone deacetylases (HDACs), chromatin-remodeling proteins such as BRG-1, and histone methyl transferases like SUV39H1. To bind to DNA, E2Fs (1 through 6) need to form heterodimers with a dimerization partner (DP-1 or DP-2) protein. E2Fs 1 to 5 all contain both activation and repression domains, yet E2Fs 1, 2, and 3 are frequently classified as E2F activators, whereas E2Fs 4, 5, and 6 are classified as repressors. Recently identified members, E2F7 and E2F8, are atypical in that they can bind to DNA without having to form dimers with DP-1 or DP-2. These new E2F members appear to be transcriptional repressors that act in a growth-inhibitory manner. There are clear structural differences between the two better-characterized subgroups: E2Fs 1 to 3 contain their own nuclear localization signals, whereas E2Fs 4 and 5 carry nuclear export signals (see Figure 1A). E2Fs 4 and 5 are localized primarily in the nucleus when bound to pocket proteins and function in repressor complexes; when “free” (that is, not bound to pocket proteins), they are excluded efficiently from the nucleus (Attwooll et al., 2004Attwooll C. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Frolov and Dyson, 2004Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The view of E2Fs 1, 2, and 3 as activators is an oversimplification because these E2Fs also have the potential to form complexes with RB, allowing transcriptional repression to occur. In fact, E2F1 was originally identified because of its ability to associate with RB. In addition, unbound E2Fs 1, 2, and 3 are not necessarily always found in complexes with HAT proteins. So, even though the division of E2Fs into activators and repressors has a molecular basis, we should not be too dogmatic about this classification. What is the available data supporting the view that E2Fs are transactivators required for asynchronous cell-cycle progression? Researchers have generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that lack one or more members of the E2F family (E2f1 to E2f6 individually, or both E2f1 and 2, or E2fs 1, 2, and 3, or E2f4 and 5). With the exception of the loss of E2f3, lack of any other E2F does not result in impairment of cell proliferation (Attwooll et al., 2004Attwooll C. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). MEFs lacking E2f3 display a slow growth phenotype (Humbert et al., 2000Humbert P.O. Verona R. Trimarchi J.M. Rogers C. Dandapani S. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 690-703PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that E2F3 is required to activate target genes and drive progression through the cell cycle. The most compelling data in support of this notion comes from the conditional ablation of E2f3 in mice lacking E2f1 and E2f2, which results in MEFs that are unable to proliferate at all (Wu et al., 2001Wu L. Timmers C. Maiti B. Saavedra H.I. Sang L. Chong G.T. Nuckolls F. Giangrande P. Wright F.A. Field S.J. et al.Nature. 2001; 414: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). E2Fs can also be inactivated by targeting their dimerization partner, DP-1. One study used a dominant-negative mutant of DP-1, which retains its dimerization domain but lacks a DNA-binding domain (Wu et al., 1996Wu C.L. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3698-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (see Figure 1B). This mutant sequesters DP-dependent E2Fs (E2F1 to 6) so that they cannot bind to E2F sites in the DNA. This mutant DP-1 induces G1 cell-cycle arrest. Likewise, in another study, depletion of DP-1 using small hairpin RNAs induced cell-cycle arrest (Maehara et al., 2005Maehara K. Yamakoshi K. Ohtani N. Kubo Y. Takahashi A. Arase S. Jones N. Hara E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These data suggest that E2Fs must bind to DNA in order to stimulate cellular proliferation. Based on these findings, it seems that E2F-mediated transactivation is crucial for the expression of target genes, which drive cell-cycle progression (see Figure 2A). This activation model has become the textbook view of how E2Fs contribute to cell-cycle regulation. These data, however, are in contrast to data from other studies where E2Fs are inactivated in different ways. Such studies use a mutant E2F (called E2F-DB) that lacks a carboxyl terminus, resulting in a dominant-negative E2F that is neither an activator nor a repressor but still retains its DNA binding domain (see Figure 1B). This mutant binds to DNA, displacing both activator and repressor E2Fs from E2F-responsive promoters. Most of these studies use an E2F1 mutant (Gonzalo et al., 2005Gonzalo S. Garcia-Cao M. Fraga M.F.

Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but one study uses an E2F2 mutant (Bargou et al., 1996Bargou R.C. Wagener C. Bommert K. Arnold W. Daniel P.T. Mapara M.Y. Grinstein E. Royer H.D. Dorken B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). If the activation model is correct, E2F-DB should inhibit the expression of target genes resulting in cell-cycle arrest. However, the exact opposite is observed: E2F-DB stimulates cellular proliferation, transforms cells, and makes them refractory to antiproliferative signaling by the p16INK4a-pRB, TGFβ, and p19ARF-p53 tumor-suppressor pathways. In addition, the expression of E2F target genes is not inhibited by E2F-DB but in most cases is switched on (Bargou et al., 1996Bargou R.C. Wagener C. Bommert K. Arnold W. Daniel P.T. Mapara M.Y.

Cell. 1999; 97: 53-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these data support a model where E2F-mediated transactivation is not required for cell-cycle progression, and E2Fs regulate their target genes at the level of repression. How can we reconcile these opposing conclusions? Are the data actually in conflict or is there an alternative model that incorporates all of these data? Although E2F1, 2, and 3 can be activators of transcription, they do not necessarily always act this way. It is equally possible that these E2Fs function primarily as “antirepressors”: that is, they could occupy E2F sites on promoters to prevent the binding of repressor E2Fs (see Figure 2A). Recent data show that the proliferation defect observed in E2f3-deficient MEFs is dependent on p19ARF and that E2F3 is not strictly required for proliferation. Apparently, E2F3 represses p19ARF, such that loss of E2f3 in MEFs that lack p19ARF no longer results in a proliferation defect (Aslanian et al., 2004Aslanian A. Iaquinta P.J. Verona R. Lees J.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, the proliferation defect exhibited by E2f3-deficient MEFs is not a function of loss of target gene activation but rather reflects a loss of target gene repression. This corresponds with the earlier observation that the dominant-negative mutant E2F-DB induces expression of p19ARF. Together, these data demonstrate that p19ARF is indeed a target for repression by E2Fs. Illustrating the complexity of interactions among E2F target genes, E2F-mediated transcriptional repression is also required downstream of p19ARF. Indeed, inactivation of E2Fs with E2F-DB allows MEFs to proliferate even as p19ARF levels increase (Rowland et al., 2002Rowland B.D. Denissov S.G. Douma S. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. Peeper D.S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown which E2Fs are critical players downstream of p19ARF in signaling pathways that block cellular proliferation. What about the more pronounced proliferation defect seen in MEFs that lack E2fs 1, 2, and 3? Are these cells defective in proliferation due to the absence of E2F-mediated transactivation? Or do the remaining E2Fs 4 through 8 repress promoters regulated by E2Fs in the absence of competing E2Fs 1, 2, and 3? We argue in favor of the latter model—that is, the remaining E2Fs that normally repress transcription in a regulated manner replace the absent E2Fs 1, 2, and 3 at sites in target gene promoters (see Figure 2A). The biological effect would be similar in both cases—cell-cycle arrest due to loss of expression of E2F target genes—but the underlying mechanism would be different. Consider the opposing results obtained with the E2F-DB mutant protein (which promotes proliferation) and inactivation of E2Fs by targeting DP-1 (which inhibits proliferation). One explanation could be that either approach may have nonspecific side effects. A more appealing explanation is that DP-1 ablation prevents E2Fs 1 through 6 from binding to DNA (binding is DP dependent) but does not prevent E2Fs 7 and 8 (atypical members that act as repressors and cause cell-cycle arrest) from binding to DNA (binding is not DP dependent). It seems feasible that in the absence of DNA binding of E2Fs 1 to 6, the antiproliferative effects of the remaining two E2Fs become dominant. This would then resemble the model for proliferation deficiency in MEFs lacking E2fs1, 2, and 3 (see Figure 2A). In both cases, removal of a subset of E2Fs leaves the target gene promoter sites free for repression by the remaining E2Fs. Mammalian cells have at least eight different E2Fs, five of which can regulate both transcriptional activation and repression. In contrast, the fruit fly Drosophila has only two E2Fs with clear-cut opposing effects: dE2F1 is strictly an activator, whereas dE2F2 is strictly a repressor. When Drosophila de2f1 was deleted, E2F target genes were expressed at much lower levels resulting in serious proliferation defects (Duronio et al., 1995Duronio R.J. O'Farrell P.H. Xie J.E. Brook A. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1445-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The logical conclusion was that dE2F1 is required to activate expression of its target genes. Without E2F-driven expression of these target genes, proliferation cannot take place. The defect imposed by loss of activating de2f1, however, could be restored by the simultaneous loss of repressing de2f2, resulting in proliferation in the absence of E2Fs altogether (Frolov et al., 2001Frolov M.V. Huen D.S. Stevaux O. Dimova D. Balczarek-Strang K. Elsdon M. Dyson N.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These results indicate that in Drosophila the activating and repressing E2Fs act antagonistically and suggest that in the absence of the activating E2F, the repressing E2F can exert its function in a dominant manner resulting in cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, fly E2Fs apparently control the expression of E2F target genes but are not essential for proliferation per se. In support of this view, expression of a fly dE2F1 mutant called dE2Fi2 (which is the Drosophila version of mammalian E2F-DB) rescues the proliferation defect in fly larvae lacking de2f1 (Royzman et al., 1999Royzman I. Austin R.J. Bosco G. Bell S.P. Orr-Weaver T.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 827-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This again suggests that the key function of dE2F1 is not related to transactivation and that dE2F1 may be required to prevent the recruitment of dE2F2 to E2F sites on target gene promoters. Extrapolating these results to mammalian cells, this would argue in favor of a model where loss of activating E2Fs (through deletion of E2fs1, 2, and 3 or inactivation of DP) may be compensated by loss of repressing E2Fs. If so, complete loss of all E2Fs may result in deregulation of the cell cycle-controlled expression of E2F target genes, yielding cells that proliferate proficiently but are refractory to pocket protein-mediated growth-inhibitory signals. By inference, loss of E2Fs should have the same effect as loss of pocket proteins. This is the case in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans where loss of the E2F homolog efl1 results in the same developmental defect as loss of the pRB worm homolog lin-35 (Ceol and Horvitz, 2001Ceol C.J. Horvitz H.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 461-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Similarly, loss of all three pocket proteins in mammalian cells yields the same phenotype as expression of E2F-DB, that is, immortalization (Dannenberg et al., 2000Dannenberg J.H. van Rossum A. Schuijff L. te Riele H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, Rowland et al., 2002Rowland B.D. Denissov S.G. Douma S. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. Peeper D.S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Notably, although fly larvae lacking both de2f1 and de2f2 develop relatively normally, they cannot mature to become viable flies (Frolov et al., 2001Frolov M.V. Huen D.S. Stevaux O. Dimova D. Balczarek-Strang K. Elsdon M. Dyson N.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Likewise, many of the knockout mice lacking one or more members of the E2F family exhibit impaired embryonic development (Attwooll et al., 2004Attwooll C. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It is possible that in these developmental settings, where there are periods of quiescence during embryonic development, E2F-mediated transactivation is required (see below). However, equally, these developmental phenotypes may be a mere consequence of dysregulated transcriptional repression. Why do E2Fs 1 to 5 all have transactivation domains? Surely, this domain must have a function? And where did the activation model come from in the first place? In fact, the activation model was derived primarily from studies on cell-cycle re-entry, rather than studies on asynchronous proliferation of cells. Most of the work on endogenous E2F transactivation and associated HATs has been performed in cells that were synchronized by serum starvation and then analyzed during serum re-stimulation. Recently, ChIP experiments have shown that during cell-cycle re-entry, E2F4/p130 complexes and HDACs are replaced on E2F-responsive promoters by E2Fs 1 to 3 and HATs. The timing of this change corresponds with the increase in acetylation of histones and the expression of E2F target genes (Frolov and Dyson, 2004Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a transactivation-deficient E2F mutant blocks cell-cycle re-entry in response to serum re-stimulation (Rowland et al., 2002Rowland B.D. Denissov S.G. Douma S. Stunnenberg H.G. Bernards R. Peeper D.S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that for this function E2Fs do need their transactivation domain. Correspondingly, upon overexpression, multiple E2F family members have the potential to drive immortal cells from quiescence into the cell cycle (DeGregori et al., 1997DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, Lukas et al., 1996Lukas J. Petersen B.O. Holm K. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), for which ectopic E2F requires its transactivation domain (Johnson et al., 1993Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, Lukas et al., 1996Lukas J. Petersen B.O. Holm K. Bartek J. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, although asynchronously proliferating cells may not require E2F-mediated transactivation, cells that are exiting quiescence and re-entering the cell cycle do require the transactivation domain. Cell-cycle re-entry appears to be a specific circumstance in which E2F-mediated transactivation is required. We propose that cell-cycle progression is not driven by E2F transcription factors, but rather that E2Fs impose a level of regulation on key components of the cell cycle. In this way, E2Fs establish a link between the cell cycle and either cell-extrinsic or cell-intrinsic factors involved in cell-cycle regulation that may be either pro- or antimitogenic. Quiescent cells are driven into the cell cycle by mitogens in an E2F transactivation-dependent manner. In contrast, proliferating cells can be arrested in an E2F repression-dependent manner by various signaling pathways including those of p16INK4a/pRB, TGFβ, and p19ARF/p53 (see Figure 2B)."

Here, we demonstrate that ZNF217 is a transcriptional repressor protein and report the purification and characterization of a ZNF217 complex. The purified ZNF217 complex consists of approximately six proteins and contains the transcriptional co-repressors CoREST, BHC110/LSD1, histone deacetylase (HDAC) 2 and C-terminal binding protein (CtBP1). The purified ZNF217 complex possesses deacetylase activity as well as lysine 4 histone H3-specific demethylase activity that is most likely mediated by the BHC110/LSD1 component. To determine if ZNF217 is a sequence-specific binding protein, we have made use of cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CAST) assay and identify for the first time a ZNF217 DNA consensus recognition sequence (CRS) that is highly conserved in the human E-cadherin promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments demonstrate that ZNF217, as well as the other components of the ZNF217 complex, are found on the region of the proximal E-cadherin promoter that contains the identified ZNF217 CRS in vivo. Using a combination of transient transfections and small interfering RNA, we demonstrate that ZNF217 represses the E-cadherin promoter. Collectively, our results implicate ZNF217 and its associated proteins in a novel pathway that may have profound effects on cancer progression."

At present, antibodies represent the best established class of binding molecules that can be rapidly isolated with high affinity and specificity to virtually any target. It is therefore not surprising that antibodies are routinely used in biomedical research for analytical and separation purposes, are essential ingredients in many diagnostic procedures, and represent the fastest growing sector of pharmaceutical biotechnology. However, some applications of antibody technology present certain drawbacks such as the requirement for mammalian cell production systems and dependence on disulfide bonds for stability. In addition, some antibody fragments tend to aggregate and display limited solubility. Therefore, several research groups have recently focused on the development of small globular proteins as scaffolds for the generation of a novel class of versatile binding proteins. Typically, portions of the surface (e.g. loops) of a protein framework with suitable biophysical properties are combinatorially mutated to produce a protein library, which can then be screened for binding specificities of interest (1Nygren P.A. Uhlen M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Binz H.K. Pluckthun A. Curr. Opin.

Until now, more than 40 scaffolds have been used for the generation of protein binders (5Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Pluckthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Being mainly a topic of academic interest at first, the development and use of non-antibody classes of proteins are now being pursued by small and medium size biotechnology companies. Kunitz-type domain mutants are currently being studied in phase II clinical trials for hereditary angioedema, open heart surgery, and cystic fibrosis indications (6Hey T. Fiedler E. Rudolph R. Fiedler M. Trends Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 514-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The small size of globular domain-binding proteins typically leads to rapid clearance from circulation, which can be prevented either by chemical modification with polymers or by fusion to an albumin-binding polypeptide (7Dennis M.S.

However, it is likely that the most crucial determinant for the success or failure of this novel class of biotherapeutics may be related to their in vivo immunogenicity profile. Because it has been reported that even fully human proteins can induce neutralizing antibodies in the patients after repeated administration (8Mirick G.R. Bradt B.M. Denardo S.J. Denardo G.L. Q J Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging. 2004; 48: 251-257PubMed Google Scholar), similar problems could arise with globular proteins, particularly if they are of non-human origin. In previous works, the Src homology 3 (SH3) 2The abbreviations used are: SH3, Src homology 3; EDB, extra-domain B; WT, wild type; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; IgG, immunoglobulin G; % ID/g, percent of injected dose per gram of tissue. domains of Hck and Abl kinase have been used for the generation of binding proteins (9Hiipakka M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21666-21674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are ∼60-residue protein modules found in proteins generally involved in the regulation of dynamic processes occurring at the plasma membrane, such as the organization of the cytoskeleton, the transduction of extracellular signals, and the internalization of membrane receptors (11Musacchio A. Wilmanns M. Saraste M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 61: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Musacchio A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 211-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Typically, SH3 domains bind to proline-rich peptides, containing a PXXP core-binding motif (13Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), but examples of unconventional SH3 binding sites have also been described (14Karkkainen S.

So far, SH3-derived proteins have been used only for the generation of binders against known SH3 ligands, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef protein (9Hiipakka M. Poikonen K. Saksela K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or synthetic peptides (10Panni S. Dente L. Cesareni G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21666-21674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fyn is a 59-kDa member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (15Cooke M.P. Perlmutter R.M. New Biol. 1989; 1: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar, 16Resh M.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1159-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Fyn SH3 domain comprises 63 residues (amino acids 83–145 of the sequence reported by Refs. 17Semba K. Nishizawa M. Miyajima N. Yoshida M.C. Sukegawa J. Yamanashi Y. Sasaki M. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5459-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and 18Kawakami T. Pennington C.Y. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4195-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and its amino acid sequence is fully conserved among man, mouse, rat, and monkey (gibbon). Fyn SH3 domains from chicken and Xenopus laevis differ from their human counterpart at one and two amino acid positions, respectively. Fyn SH3 is composed of two antiparallel β-sheets and contains two flexible loops (called RT and n-Src loops) to interact with other proteins (Fig. 1a). In the present article we describe the design, construction, and characterization of a human Fyn SH3 phage library containing more than 1 billion individual clones as well as the isolation and in vitro characterization of proteins binding to a pharmaceutically relevant target protein, the extra-domain B (EDB) of fibronectin, a marker of angiogenesis (19Castellani P.

Fibronectin is a large glycoprotein that is present in large amounts in plasma and body tissues. EDB is a 91-amino acid type III homology domain that becomes inserted into the fibronectin molecule by a mechanism of alternative splicing at the level of the primary transcript (20Zardi L.

EDB is essentially undetectable in healthy adult individuals but is abundant in many aggressive solid tumors and displays either predominantly vascular or diffusal stromal patterns of expression, depending on the tumor type (19Castellani P.

The resulting DNA fragment was cloned in the vector pQE-12 (Qiagen) using the restriction sites BamHI and BglII (New England Biolabs). The correct insertion was verified by DNA sequencing (BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit; ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer; Applied Biosystems). Library cloning strategy is depicted in Fig. 1b. Using Fyn SH3 WT as a template, three independent PCRs were performed. The first was done with the primer EDB His ba (5′-GAA AAG TGC CAC CTG ACG TCT AA-3′) and the partially degenerate primer Fyn SH3 LOOPRT fo (5′-TTC TCC TTT GTG AAA ACT CAG GTC MNN MNN MNN MNN MNN MNN ATA GTC ATA AAG GGC CAC AAA GAG-3′), the second with the primer Fyn SH3 LOOPRT ba (5′-GAC CTG AGT TTT CAC AAA GGA GAA-3′) and the partially degenerate primer Fyn SH3 LOOP2ND fo (5′-GGA GCG GGC TTC CCA CCA ATC TCC MNN MNN MNN MNN MNN MNN CAA TAT TTG AAA TTT TTC TCC TTT-3′), whereas the third was done with the primer Fyn SH3 LOOP2ND ba (5′-GGAGATTGGTGGGAAGCCCGCT-3′) and EDB His fo (5′-CGGTCTGGTTATAGGTACA TTGAGC-3′). Full-length Fyn SH3 mutants were assembled by PCR, and the DNA library was further amplified using SH3 (NcoI) ba (5′-CAT GCC ATG GGC GGA GTG ACA CTC TTT GTG GCC CTT TAT-3′) and SH3 (NotI) fo (5′-TTT TCC TTT TGC GGC CGC CTG GAT AGA GTC AAC TGG AGC CAC ATA-3′). The randomized insert was double-digested with NcoI/NotI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into NcoI/NotI-digested pHEN1 phagemid vector (33Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Johnson K.S. Chiswell D.J.

The resulting ligation product was electroporated into electrocompetent Escherichia coli TG1 cells according to Viti et al. (32Viti F. Nilsson F. Demartis S. Huber A. Neri D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 480-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby obtaining a library of 1.2 × 109 Fyn SH3 mutant clones. The library was stored as glycerol stocks, rescued, and used for phage production according to standard protocols (32Viti F. Nilsson F. Demartis S. Huber A. Neri D. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 480-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Library Characterization—A total of 30 clones were tested by PCR using the primers LMB3long ba (5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG ACC ATG ATT AC-3′) and FDseqlong fo (5′-GAC GTT AGT AAA TGA ATT TTC TGT ATG AGG-3′) to verify the correct size of the insert. 16 clones were selected at random and sequenced to check for the absence of frameshifts and pervasive contamination. The percentage of clones expressing soluble Fyn SH3 mutants was determined by dot blot analysis of bacterial supernatants (ELIFA system; Perbio) using anti-Myc HRP antibody conjugate (Roche) as a detecting agent. Peroxidase activity was detected using the ECL plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Phage Display Selections and ELISA Screening—The EDB of fibronectin (23Carnemolla B. Neri D. Castellani P. Leprini A. Neri G. Pini A. Winter G. Zardi L. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was expressed and purified as described previously. EDB was biotinylated using EZ-link™ sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Perbio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The biotinylated EDB (final concentration 10-6 m) was captured on avidin- (first and third round) or streptavidin-coated (second round) Maxisorp wells (Nunc). After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS, 1 ml containing 1012 transforming units of Fyn SH3 phage library in 1% bovine serum albumin was added to the wells (aliquoted in 8 wells) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature on a shaker. The wells were rinsed 10 times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma), and 10 times with PBS. Bound phage was eluted by incubation with 100 mm triethylamine (Fluka) for 5 min. The eluted phage was used to infect exponentially growing E. coli TG1. Phage production was performed according to standard protocols (32Viti F. Nilsson F. Demartis S. Huber A. Neri D.

Individual colonies from the plates of phage-infected TG1 were inoculated into 200 μl of 2xYT-, 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Applichem), 1% glucose (Sigma) (2xYT-AMP-GLU) into 96-well plates (Nunclon™ surface, Nunc). The plate was incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a shaker incubator. After removing 40 μl of each well for a glycerol stock, 40 μl of 2xYT-AMP-GLU containing 4 × 109 transforming units of helper phage was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After spinning the plate at 1800 × g for 10 min and aspirating the supernatants off, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 2xYT, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 33.3 μg/ml kanamycin (Applichem) and grown overnight at 30 °C. After spinning, phage supernatants were used for ELISA screening; biotinylated EDB (10-6 m) was captured on streptavidin-coated wells (Strepta Wells, High Bind, Roche), and after blocking with PBS, 2% milk (Rapilait, Migros, Switzerland), 20 μl of PBS, 10% milk, and 80 μl of phage supernatants were applied. After incubating for 1 h and washing, detection was made with anti-M13-HRP antibody conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). Peroxidase activity was detected by adding BM blue POD substrate (Roche), and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 m H2SO4. The DNA of positive clones was sequenced as described above. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of D3 Monomer and Dimer; Expression and Purification of Fyn SH3 WT—For expression of one binding clone, called D3, its sequence was subcloned into the pQE-12 vector (Qiagen). Of the glycerol stock described above, a single colony was picked for the PCR amplification of the D3 sequence using the primers LMB3long ba and FDseqlong fo, resulting in the PCR product a. For the monomer, the PCR product a was used for another PCR using the primers hFyn SH3 domain ba and Fyn SH3 cloning into pQE-12 fo (5′-ATC CCA AGC TTA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG ACC CTG GAT AGA GTC AAC TGG AGC CAC-3′), introducing BamHI/HindIII restrictions sites and a hexa-His tag. For the dimer, PCR product a was used for two independent PCRs. In the first one, the primers 52.ba (5′-GAC TAA CGA GAT CGC GGA TCC GGA GTG ACA CTC TTT GTG GCC CTT TAT-3′) and 47.fo (5′-TCC GCC ACC GCC AGA GCC ACC TCC GCC TGA ACC GCC TCC ACC CTG GAT AGA GTC AAC TGG AGC CAC-3′) and in the second PCR, the primers 48.ba (5′-GGT GGA GGC GGT TCA GGC GGA GGT GGC TCT GGC GGT GGC GGA GGA GTG ACA CTC TTT GTG GCC CTT TAT-3′) and 51.fo (5′-ATC CCA AGC TTA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG CAG ATC CTC TTC TGA GAT GAG TTT TTG TTC ACC CTG GAT AGA GTC AAC TGG AGC CAC-3′) were used. The two fragments were PCR assembled, yielding a D3 dimer with BamHI/HindIII restriction sites with a 14 amino acid linker (GGGGSGGGGSGGGG) between the two domains and a Myc and hexa-His tag at the C-terminal-end of the protein. Sequencing revealed an additional insertion of an amino acid in the linker region occurred during the PCRs, leading to the following sequence, GGGGSGGGGSGGGGG. Both, D3 monomer and dimer, were BamHI/HindIII (New England Biolabs) double-digested and ligated into BamHI/HindIII double-digested pQE-12 vector. After transformation of TG1 cells, colonies of the constructs were inoculated in 100 ml of 2xYT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.1% (w/v) glucose and grown at 37 °C in a rotary shaker at 200 rpm at A600 of 0.6; protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Applichem). After 16 h at 30 °C in a rotary shaker (200 rpm), the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). 1 mg/ml lysozyme was added, and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min. After cell lysis by sonication, the lysates were centrifuged for 25 min at 11,000 rpm. 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA slurry (Qiagen) was added to the cleared lysate to capture the His6-tagged proteins (incubation at 4 °C for 1 h while shaking on a rotary shaker). The resin was washed two times with 5 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and the protein was eluted with 2 ml of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). After elution, proteins were dialyzed against PBS. SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) analysis was performed with 20 μl of protein solution. Specificity ELISA—The biotinylated target proteins EDB (23Carnemolla B.

Mouse serum albumin was purchased from Sigma and biotinylated using EZ-link™ sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Perbio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Target proteins were added to streptavidin-coated wells (Strepta Wells, High Bind, Roche) and after blocking with PBS, 2% milk (Rapilait, Migros, Switzerland), 50 μl of PBS, 4% milk, and 50 μl of purified D3 dimer (3 μm) were added. After incubating for 1 h and washing, detection was made with anti-Myc HRP antibody conjugate (Roche). Peroxidase activity was detected by adding BM blue POD substrate (Roche), and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 m H2SO4. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—SEC of purified Fyn SH3 WT, D3 monomer, and D3 dimer was performed on an ÄKTA FPLC system using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—Affinity measurements were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore). For the interaction analysis between biotinylated EDB and D3 monomer and D3 dimer, a streptavidin SA chip (Biacore) was used with 600 RU biotinylated EDB (23Carnemolla B. Neri D. Castellani P. Leprini A. Neri G. Pini A. Winter G. Zardi L. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) immobilized. The running buffer was PBS, 0.1% NaN3, and surfactant P20 (Biacore). The interactions were measured at a flow of 20 μl/min and injections of different concentrations of D3 monomer and dimer. For the interaction analysis between D3 monomer and 7B89, a fibronectin fragment containing the EDB (36Carnemolla B. Leprini A. Allemanni G. Saginati M. Zardi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24689-24692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Philogen, Italy), a CM5 chip (Biacore), was used with 3300 RU D3 monomer immobilized. The running buffer was HBS-EP (Biacore). The interactions were measured at a flow of 20 μl/min and injections of different concentrations of 7B89. All kinetic data of the interaction (separate kon/koff) were evaluated using BIA evaluation 3.2RC1. Immunohistofluorescence—Female Sv129 mice (Charles River) received subcutaneous injection of 3 × 106 F9 teratocarcinoma cells in the right flank. After excising, the tumors were embedded in cryoembedding compound (Microm), frozen in chilled isopentane, and stored at -80 °C. Then, 10-μm sections were cut, fixed with ice-cold acetone, and double fluorescence staining for EDB and CD31 was performed. D3 monomer and rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Pharmingen) were used as primary binding reagents. As secondary detection antibodies, we used for EDB anti-His Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Qiagen) and for CD31 donkey anti-rat Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted with Glycergel mounting medium (Dako) and analyzed with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 mot plus. Radioiodination of Fyn SH3 WT, D3 Monomer, and D3 Dimer—125–200 μg of protein was combined with 200 μCi of 125I (Amersham Biosciences) and with filtered chloramine T (Sigma) solution (5 mg/ml; 0.25 μg of chloramine T per μg of protein was used) for 2 min followed by separation from unincorporated iodine using a PD-10 disposable gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). The binding activity after labeling was evaluated by loading an aliquot of radiolabeled sample onto 500 μl of EDB-Sepharose resin (37Neri D. Carnemolla B. Nissim A. Leprini A. Querze G. Balza E. Pini A. Tarli L. Halin C. Neri P. Zardi L. Winter G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) on a pasteur pipette followed by radioactive counting of the flow-through, wash, and eluate fractions. Binding reactivity, defined as the ratio between the counts of the eluted protein and the sum of the counts (flow through, wash, eluate, and column), was 87% for the D3 monomer and between 58 and 68% for the dimer (36% for the non binding Fyn SH3 WT). Biodistributions of Tumor-bearing Mice Injected with Radiolabeled Fyn SH3 WT, D3 Monomer, and D3 Dimer—Biodistribution studies were performed as licensed 3Tumor Targeting, Bewilligung 198/2005, issued to D.

Mice were sacrificed at 4 and 24 h (Fyn SH3 WT only 24 h), and organs were weighed and radioactivity was counted. Three animals were used for each time point (except Fyn SH3 WT for 24 h and D3 monomer for 4 h; four animals). Targeting results of representative organs are expressed as % ID of protein/g of tissue (±S.E.), and tumor:organ ratios were determined. Immunogenicity of Fyn SH3 WT, D3, and a scFv Antibody Fragment—Sv129 mice were injected four times (every third day) with 20 μg of Fyn SH3 WT or D3, respectively (5 mice per group). One day after the fourth injection, blood samples were taken for examining the presence or absence of murine anti-Fyn SH3 WT and anti-Fyn SH3 D3 antibodies (75–150 μl of blood/mice diluted in 50-μl of Heparin (Bichsel)). As a positive control, four mice were injected at equal time points and equal molar dosages (60 μg) with the human scFv antibody fragment clone E1 (anti-human α2-macroglobulin, expression and purification as described in (38Ettorre A. Rosli C. Silacci M. Brack S. McCombie G. Knochenmuss R. Elia G. Neri D. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 4496-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). However, because mice became sick after the third injection of scFv fragments, they were sacrificed, and blood samples were taken after the third injection. Blood samples were analyzed in ELISA; Maxisorp wells (Nunc) were coated overnight with 100 μl of antigen solution (Fyn SH3 WT, 20 μg/ml; D3, 20 μg/ml; or scFv, 60 μg/ml in PBS). After washing and blocking, 50 μl of PBS, 4% milk, and 50 μl of blood samples (1:4, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100 diluted in PBS) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the presence of murine antibodies in the blood samples was detected by adding anti-mouse IgG HRP antibody conjugate (Sigma). As controls for the coating efficiency of the antigens, anti-His HRP antibody conjugate (Sigma) (Fyn SH3 WT and D3) or anti-Myc HRP antibody conjugate (Roche) was added. The negative controls were performed using the anti-mouse IgG HRP antibody conjugate without adding any blood samples. Peroxidase activity was detected by adding BM blue POD substrate (Roche), and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 m H2SO4. Absorbance was measured using the VersaMax microplate reader (A450 - A650).

In addition to this, multiple secondary functions have been reported for EF-Tu. EF-Tu is an essential host-donated subunit of the replicative complex of Qβ phage, and it may interact with the transcriptional apparatus as a positive regulator of RNA synthesis (1Travers A.A. Kamen R.I. Schleif R.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Higher eukaryotes, such as Arabidopsis, sense microbes via bacterial EF-Tu. EF-Tu activates a signaling event and defense responses in plants (2Zipfel C. Kunze G. Chinchilla D. Caniard A. Jones J.D. Boller T. Felix G. Cell. 2006; 125: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The association of eEF1A with the actin cytoskeleton has been reported in Dictyostelium amoebae, yeast, and mammals (3Yang F. Demma M. Warren V. Dharmawardhane S. Condeelis J. Nature. 1990; 347: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 4Munshi R. Kandl K.A. Carr-Schmid A. Whitacre J.L. Adams A.E. Kinzy T.G.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The ribonucleoprotein complex containing eEF1A and a non-coding RNA called HSR1 regulates the activation of heat-shock transcription factor 1 in response to heat shock in mammalian cells (7Shamovsky I. Ivannikov M. Kandel E.S. Gershon D. Nudler E. Nature. 2006; 440: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). eEF1A-2, an eEF1A isoform that is specifically expressed in neurons, cardiomyocytes, and myotubes, interacts with peroxiredoxin I to protect cells against apoptotic death induced by oxidative stress (8Chang R. Wang E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that EF-Tu displays properties of a chaperone. EF-Tu from Escherichia coli and maize chloroplasts is able to suppress the thermal aggregation of proteins in vitro (9Caldas T.D. Yaagoubi A.E. Richarme G. J. Biol.

EF-Tu from E. coli and Thermus thermophilus, as well as rabbit eEF1A, are able to promote protein refolding in vitro (9Caldas T.D. Yaagoubi A.E. Richarme G. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte eEF1A binds to the ribosome nascent-chain complex during translation. Moreover, eEF1A can bind to unfolded polypeptides that are no longer associated with the ribosome (12Hotokezaka Y. Tobben U. Hotokezaka H. Van Leyen K. Beatrix B. Smith D.H. Nakamura T. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18545-18551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the chaperone activity of eEF1A has been linked to in vivo functions, as demonstrated by yeast genetic screening of the suppressor of the rad23Δrpn10Δ strain (14Chuang S.M. Chen L. Lambertson D. Anand M. Kinzy T.G. Madura K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Rad23 and Rpn10 play synergistic roles in the recognition of ubiquitinated proteins, and the loss of both proteins causes growth and proteolytic defects. eEF1A interacts with the ubiquitinated nascent peptide on the ribosome, as well as with the proteasome subunit Rpt1. Therefore, eEF1A suppresses the rad23Δrpn10Δ mutation by mediating the proteasome degradation of co-translationally damaged proteins in place of Rad23 and Rpn10 (14Chuang S.M. Chen L. Lambertson D. Anand M. Kinzy T.G. Madura K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). eEF1A is also involved in the quality surveillance of newly synthesized proteins in yeast. Accumulating evidence points to an important role for mitochondrial (mt) protein quality control in the pathogenesis of human diseases, such as neurological disorders, aging, cancer, and various neuromuscular syndromes (15Turner C. Schapira A.H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 487: 229-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 17Schon E.A. Manfredi G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Indeed, disease-causing mutations in components of the mt protein control system have been identified, including a membrane-bound ATP-dependent AAA protease and the mt chaperonin heat-shock protein (HSP) 60 (18Bross P. Rugarli E.I. Casari G. Langer T. Köhler C. Bauer M.F. Mitochondrial Function and Biogenetics. 8. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany2004: 97-121Google Scholar, 19Rugarli E.I. Langer T. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 262-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Functional impairment of these proteins causes hereditary spastic paraplegia, a genetic disorder that is characterized by axonal degeneration in humans. It is noteworthy that the ATP-dependent m-AAA protease regulates mt ribosome assembly and translation by controlling the proteolytic maturation of L32, an essential mt ribosomal protein (20Nolden M. Ehses S. Koppen M. Bernacchia A. Rugarli E.I. Langer T. Cell. 2005; 123: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This suggests that the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as hereditary spastic paraplegia, is related to a defect in mt protein synthesis, as well as to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the mitochondria. In the present work, we have studied the chaperone function of mammalian mt EF-Tu (EF-Tumt). We demonstrate that mammalian EF-Tumt displays chaperone activity in vitro, in a GTP-independent manner. We have investigated the interaction between EF-Tumt and the newly synthesized peptides from mt ribosomes under stress conditions. Localization of EF-Tumt in mitochondria has also been analyzed. Based on these observations, we discuss the possible role of EF-Tumt chaperone activity in the quality control of misfolded newly synthe-sized polypeptides in mitochondria. Cells and Culture Conditions—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen) in the presence of penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Cells were routinely passed twice a week and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 293T derivatives that stably overexpressed human EF-Tumt (hEF-Tumt) were maintained as above, but in the presence of Zeocin (0.3 mg/ml). 293T/mock, 293T/hEF-Tumt[WT], and 293T/hEF-Tumt[D156N] were established by transfection of 293T cells with the plasmids pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+), hEF-Tumt[WT]-pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+), and hEF-Tumt[D156N]-pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+), respectively. Plasmids—BMtu/pET24c, the E. coli expression vector for C-terminal histidine-tagged bovine mt EF-Tu (bEF-Tumt), was a gift from Prof. Linda Spremulli, University of North Carolina. hEF-Tumt[WT]-pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+), the mammalian expression vector for C-terminal 3× FLAG-tagged hEF-Tumt, was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment carrying the coding sequence for hEF-Tumt (GenBank™ accession number BC001633) was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR, using poly(A) RNA from HeLa cells and primers containing the 3× FLAG sequence and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). hEF-Tumt[D156N]-pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) was constructed with a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using the primers 5′-GTATGTGAACAAGGCTAACGCTGTCCAGGACTC-3′ and 5′-GAGTCCTGGACAGCGTTAGCCTTGTTCACATAC-3′. In Vitro Chaperone Assay—Recombinant bEF-Tumt for the in vitro chaperone assay was expressed using BMtu/pET24c in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described (21Woriax V.L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), in the presence of GDP to yield the GDP form. Recombinant E. coli EF-Tu was expressed and purified as described previously (22Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase (CS) and l-malate dehydrogenase were purchased from Roche Applied Science. In the text and figures, the concentrations of CS refer to the 98-kDa homodimer. Recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) and rhodanese were expressed and purified as described previously in Refs. 23Makino Y. Amada K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

The thermal aggregation of CS was tested as described (25Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In separate trials, CS (0.2 μm) was mixed with various amounts of purified recombinant bEF-Tumt in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (7 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 15 μm GDP, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5) in a total volume of 1.5 ml in covered quartz cuvettes. The three controls were CS alone, CS mixed with BSA, and CS mixed with ovalbumin. Samples were incubated at 43 °C for the indicated times, and CS stability was estimated by monitoring light scattering during incubation at 320 nm by spectrofluorometry (JASCO Corp., FP-6500). The refolding of GFP was performed as described (26Enoki S. Saeki K. Maki K. Kuwajima K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14238-14248Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GFP (100 μm) was denatured with an equal volume of 0.2 n HCl for 2 min at 25 °C. Spontaneous and EF-Tu-assisted refolding was initiated by diluting 3 μl of the denatured protein to a final volume of 1.5 ml in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. GTP or GDP was added where indicated. The final concentration of GFP in the refolding reaction was 100 nm. The refolding reaction was carried out for 15 min at 18 °C. Refolding of GFP was monitored by GFP fluorescence spectrofluorometry with excitation at 400 nm and emission at 510 nm. The relative fluorescence of GFP was plotted. For the rhodanese refolding assay, recombinant rhodanese (final concentration, 33 μm) was denatured in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 8 m urea for 45 min at 25 °C. Spontaneous and EF-Tu-assisted refolding was initiated by diluting the indicated amount of denatured enzyme into a final volume of 160 μlina solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. In addition, 1 mm GTP or GDP was added where indicated. The final concentration of rhodanese in the refolding reaction was 100-300 nm. The refolding reaction was carried out for 30 min at 20 °C. Enzyme activity was used as a measure of the successful refolding of rhodanese into its native conformation. Enzyme activity was measured by colorimetry of the complex formed between ferric ions and one of the reaction products, thiocyanate at 460 nm, as described (27Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8529-8534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze EF-Tu·GDP -and EF-Tu·GTP-dependent stimulation of rhodanese refolding, EF-Tu·GDP and EF-Tu·GTP were prepared as follows. EF-Tu·GTP was formed by incubating EF-Tu (final concentration, 10 μm) in the presence of 20 μm GTP, 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 10 μg of pyruvate kinase in 50 μl of PK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol) at 30 °C for 15 min. EF-Tu·GDP was similarly prepared but in the absence of GTP and pyruvate kinase. After incubation, aliquots of samples were directly used for rhodanese refolding. Samples without EF-Tu were used in the refolding assay to assess EF-Tu-dependent refolding of rhodanese. GDP, GTP, and phosphoenolpyruvate had no effect on substrate-protein renaturation. Isolation of Mitochondria from Human Cells—Mitochondria were isolated according to a previously published procedure (28Gottlieb R.A. Adachi S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in MSED buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), before homogenization by nitrogen cavitation (200 p.s.i. for 15 min) in a cell disruption bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 3,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting intact mt-enriched pellet was washed twice with MSED buffer. Mitoplasts were obtained using a phosphate swelling-shrinking method as described previously (29Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Purified mitochondria were swollen by the addition of swelling buffer (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 500 μg of mt protein/ml and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing. An equal volume of shrinking buffer (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 32% (w/v) sucrose, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2) was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 20 min at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, yielding a pellet composed of mitoplasts. The mitoplasts were washed three times in MSED buffer and resuspended in MSED buffer at a protein concentration of ∼30 μg/μl. The mitoplast suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. In Organello Translation, Co-immunoprecipitation, and the Stability of Mitochondrial Gene Products—In vitro labeling of mitochondrial translation products was performed in isolated mitoplasts, as previously described (30Herrmann J.M. Foelsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Briefly, mitoplasts were resuspended to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in translation buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 150 mm KCl, 15 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 12.7 mm MgSO4, 0.3% (w/v) BSA, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 1.13 mg/ml α-ketoglutarate, 2.33 mg/ml phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml of each amino acid except methionine, 26.6 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, pH 7.5). After 5 min of incubation at 25 °C, [35S]methionine (2 GBq/ml, 50 mCi/mmol, Institute of Isotopes Co., Ltd., Hungary) was added (final concentration, 1.8 mCi/mmol), and the incubation was continued for an additional 60 min. Translation was stopped by the addition of unlabeled methionine (100 mm) and puromycin (50 μg/ml). Mitoplasts were washed three times with washing buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm methionine). The mitoplasts were suspended in LiDS sample buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, 2% (w/v) LiDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 350 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), subjected to 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE (0.1% (w/v) bisacrylamide), and visualized on a BAS5000 bio-imaging analyzer using an Imaging Plate (Fujifilm). To analyze the interaction of in organello translated proteins with FLAG-tagged EF-Tumt, co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed as follows. After in organello translation, the washed mitoplasts were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with FLAG-specific antibodies. Antibodies against F1-ATP synthetase β subunit (F1-ATPase-β) were used to test for the nonspecific binding of in organello translated proteins to non-EF-Tumt protein. To analyze the stability of newly synthesized mitochondrial translation products within the mitochondria, pulse-chase analysis was performed as described (31Kambacheld M. Augustin S. Tatsuta T. Muller S. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20132-20139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, after in organello translation, incorporation of radioactivity into newly translated polypeptides was stopped by the addition of cold methionine. Mitochondria were isolated and washed three times with ice-cold washing buffer. To assess the stability of the newly synthesized polypeptides, mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in translation buffer and samples were further incubated at the indicated temperature. Aliquots were withdrawn at various time points, dissolved into LiDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by BAS5000 using an Imaging Plate (Fujifilm). Subfractionation of Mitochondria—For subfractionation of mitochondria (29Hovius R. Lambrechts H. Nicolay K. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), mitoplasts were sonicated in MSED buffer at 10 watts for 20 s in total. KCl, urea, and RNase A were included in the MSED buffer where indicated. Samples were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were saved as the matrix fractions. The inner-membrane (IM) pellets were washed once in MSED buffer and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The IM pellets were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and protease inhibitors (complete mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science)). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). The presence of mitochondrial ribosomes was determined as described previously (32Liu M. Spremulli L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29400-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Northern blotting for mitochondrial 16 S ribosomal RNA was carried out with the oligomer 5′-GGAATGCTGGAGGTGATGTT-3′. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies to human HSP60 (clone LK1) and FLAG M2 antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyclonal antibodies to the bovine mitochondrial EF-Tu·Ts complex were the kind gift of Prof. Linda Spremulli, University of North Carolina. Polyclonal antibodies to the recombinant bEF-Tumt were raised in our laboratory. Monoclonal antibodies against human cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII), cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COIV), and F1-ATPase-β were purchased from Molecular Probes. Recombinant Bovine EF-Tumt Exhibits Chaperone Properties in Vitro—We first examined whether bEF-Tumt protects proteins from thermal aggregation. The substrate protein CS was incubated at 43 °C, and its thermal aggregation was monitored by light scattering. In the absence of EF-Tumt, aggregate formation was observed (Fig. 1A, green line). Thermal aggregation of CS was suppressed in the presence of EF-Tumt in a dose-dependent manner. Near-complete inhibition of aggregate formation was observed at a ∼3× molar excess of EF-Tumt over CS. The light-scattering trace did not reach horizontal in the presence of adequate EF-Tumt, due to the aggregation of a small fraction of the recombinant EF-Tumt (data not shown). The chaperone-like activity was not observed with the control proteins BSA or ovalbumin (Fig. 1B). We next examined whether bEF-Tumt promotes the refolding of denatured proteins in vitro. Acid-denatured recombinant GFP was diluted in neutral reaction buffer, and its refolding was monitored by GFP fluorescence. In the absence of EF-Tumt, only ∼40% of the GFP refolded spontaneously, whereas ∼80% refolded in the presence of EF-Tumt (Fig. 2, blue lines). This effect was not observed with BSA (Fig. 2, green line). This indicated that the spontaneous refolding of GFP was promoted in the presence of EF-Tumt, because EF-Tumt prevented the aggregation of GFP during its refolding. The chaperone activity of EF-Tumt was not restricted to a specific substrate. Thermal aggregation of l-malate dehydrogenase was also suppressed (data not shown), and the refolding of urea-denatured rhodanese was promoted in the presence of bEF-Tumt (see Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, recombinant bEF-Tumt displays chaperone properties in vitro, as reported for EF-Tu from other organisms.FIGURE 4Influence of EF-Tu·GDP and EF-Tu·GTP on the refolding of rhodanese. Denatured rhodanese (final concentration, 0.3 μm) was incubated at 20 °C in the presence of 1 μm EF-Tu·GDP (black circle, EF-Tu GDP) or 1 μm EF-Tu·GTP (open circle, EF-Tu GTP). The activity of the refolded enzyme was measured at the indicated time points and the results are expressed as the EF-Tu-dependent stimulation of rhodanese renaturation. EF-Tu·GDP and EF-Tu·GTP were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, EF-Tumt; B, E. coli EF-Tu. C, the effect of pyruvate kinase on rhodanese refolding. Denatured rhodanese (final concentration, 0.3 μm) was incubated at 20 °C in the presence of pyruvate kinase alone (open circle, PK), pyrivate kinase plus kirromycin (black circle, PK+kirromycin), or pyrivate kinase plus Me2SO (cross, PK+DMSO). The activity of the refolded enzyme was measured at the indicated time points, and the results are expressed as the pyruvate kinase-dependent stimulation of rhodanese renaturation. The amount of pyruvate kinase used was the same as in the assay mixture with EF-Tu·GTP in A and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chaperone Activity of EF-Tumt Is GTP-independent—The molecular mechanism of EF-Tu chaperone activity has been unclear. A large conformational difference is observed between EF-Tu complexed with GDP and EF-Tu complexed with GTP. EF-Tu·GTP has a relatively closed conformation, whereas the EF-Tu·GDP complex, formed upon GTP hydrolysis or after binding of GDP, has an open conformation (33Abel K. Jurnak F. Structure. 1996; 4: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It remains controversial as to which form interacts with unfolded proteins and whether the conformational change accompanying GTP hydrolysis is required for chaperone activity. Kudlicki et al. (11Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32206-32210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) proposed that the flexing of EF-Tu between the EF-Tu·GDP (open) form and the EF-Tu·GTP (closed) form is a major factor in its chaperone-like refolding activity. They observed that the T. thermophilus EF-Tu is less active in rhodanese refolding in the presence of 1 mm GDP than in the presence of 1 mm GTP (11Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32206-32210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). They interpreted this to mean that the conformational change of EF-Tu accompanying GTP hydrolysis is important for its chaperone activity. Consistently, they observed that the renaturation activity of the T. thermophilus EF-Tu is reduced in the presence of kirromycin and pulvomycin, antibiotics that specifically bind to EF-Tu and stabilize it in its closed and open conformations, respectively (11Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32206-32210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, Caldas et al. (9Caldas T.D. Yaagoubi A.E. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11478-11482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) proposed that EF-Tu·GTP is less active than EF-Tu·GDP. In their experiments, E. coli EF-Tu·GTP was prepared by treating EF-Tu·GDP with pyruvate kinase, as described in (34Weissbach H. Miller D.L. Hachmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the EF-Tu·GDP form was found to be significantly more active than the EF-Tu·GTP form for CS and α-glucosidase refolding (9Caldas T.D. Yaagoubi A.E. Richarme G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11478-11482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism of EF-Tu chaperone activity, we carried out the same experiments as Kudlicki et al. and Caldas et al. using EF-Tumt, as well as E. coli EF-Tu. First, the guanine nucleotide-dependent EF-Tu activity in in vitro refolding of denatured rhodanese was analyzed, according to the method of Kudlicki et al. Denatured rhodanese was incubated with EF-Tumt at 20 °C in the absence or presence of 1 mm GDP or 1 mm GTP. The activity of the refolded enzyme was measured at the indicated time points. Given the Kd of EF-Tu for guanine nucleotides, 1 mm GDP or GTP is sufficient to form EF-Tu·GDP or EF-Tu·GTP, respectively (35Cai Y.C. Bullard J.M. Thompson N.L. Spremulli L.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1791-1800PubMed Google Scholar, 36Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 141: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide itself has little effect on rhodanese refolding. In contrast to the observation of Kudlicki et al. that T. thermophilus EF-Tu is less active in the presence of 1 mm GDP than in the presence of the 1 mm GTP (11Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32206-32210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), refolding of rhodanese was promoted by EF-Tumt irrespective of the guanine nucleotide present in the reaction (Fig. 3A). A similar result was obtained with E. coli EF-Tu (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we observed that the refolding of GFP by EF-Tumt (Fig. 2) is independent"
https://openalex.org/W1993147686,"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G is an integral member of the translation initiation machinery. The molecule serves as a scaffold for several other initiation factors, including eIF4E, eIF4AI, the eIF3 complex, and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Previous work indicates that complexes between these proteins exhibit enhanced mRNA cap-binding and RNA helicase activities relative to the respective individual proteins, eIF4E and eIF4A. The eIF4G-PABP interaction has been implicated in enhancing the formation of 48 S and 80 S initiation complexes and ribosome recycling through mRNA circularization. The eIF3-eIF4GI interaction is believed to forge the link between the 40 S subunit and the mRNA. Here we have investigated the behavior in vitro and in intact cells of eIF4GIf molecules lacking either the PABP-binding site, the eIF3-binding site, the middle domain eIF4A-binding site, or the C-terminal segment that includes the second eIF4A-binding site. Although in some cases the mutant forms were recruited more slowly, all of these eIF4G variants could form complexes with eIF4E, enter 48 S complexes and polysomes in vivo and in vitro, and partially rescue translation in cells targeted with eIF4GI short interfering RNA. In the reticulocyte lysate, eIF4G unable to interact directly with PABP showed little impairment in its ability to support translation, whereas loss of either of the eIF4A-binding sites or the eIF3-binding site resulted in a marked decrease in activity. We conclude that there is considerable redundancy in the mechanisms forming initiation complexes in mammalian cells, such that many individual interactions have regulatory rather than essential roles.

It serves as a scaffold protein, allowing multiple other initiation factors to assemble at the 5′ cap of an mRNA molecule and promote its recruitment by the small ribosomal subunit. Its binding partners include the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), the eIF4E kinase, Mnk, and eIF3, which in turn interacts with the 40 S ribosomal subunit (for review see Ref. 1Prevot D.

The shortest isoform (designated eIF4GIa, also the first cloned (10Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, recent work has suggested the possibility of an interaction between eIF3 and cap-bound eIF4E that is independent of eIF4G (16Holz M.K. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Cell. 2005; 123: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Two binding sites for eIF4AI have been identified on mammalian eIF4GI, one in the middle domain and a second in the C-terminal domain (11Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

The middle domain is thought to be primarily responsible for the enhancement of the helicase activity of eIF4AI, whereas the C-terminal domain (which is lacking in the yeast homologs) appears to have a more regulatory role (17Morino S.

Although PABP is not considered a core member of the eIF4F complex, the PABP-eIF4GI interaction has been reported to show a significant stimulatory effect on translation. This effect is thought to be due to the circularization of the mRNA by linking the m7Gppp cap (via eIF4E) with the poly(A) tail via PABP (19Sachs A.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 447-465Google Scholar). However, the PABP-eIF4GI interaction is not essential for cap-dependent translation, as eIF4G variants or fragments lacking the PABP-binding site are able to support this process, albeit with lower efficiency (17Morino S. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Ali I.K. McKendrick L. Morley S.J. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4233-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A synergistic stimulation of mRNA translation occurs when mRNA is both capped and polyadenylated (21Gallie D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), although recent work suggests that the poly(A) tail is not always required for optimal mRNA translation in vivo (22Peng J. Schoenberg D.R. RNA. 2005; 11: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to elucidate the importance of the PABP-eIF4GIf, eIF4AI-eIF4GIf, and eIF3-eIF4GIf interactions in translation initiation by removing the ability of the eIF4GIf to bind to each of these proteins. Our data show that the loss of the PABP-binding site in eIF4GIf had no substantial effect on a number of its characterized properties. These included a lack of effect on the ability of eIF4GIf to promote mRNA translation, to interact with eIF4E, to incorporate into 48 S complexes, or to be associated with polysomes in vitro or in cultured cells. Similarly, mutation of the middle domain eIF4AI-binding site had no effect on any of these interactions in vivo. In contrast, however, the loss of either of the two eIF4AI-binding sites resulted in a decreased ability of eIF4GIf to support the initiation of translation in the reticulocyte lysate. Interestingly, the eIF3-binding site mutation reduced the ability of the molecule to bind to eIF4E, despite being present in polysome fractions. Taken together, our results suggest a functional redundancy between the interactions between the initiation factors responsible for the recruitment of mRNA for translation. Construction of Plasmids—Plasmids encoding the different variants of eIF4G (Fig. 1) were constructed using standard molecular biology methods, with slight modifications. pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-4A1 and pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-3 were constructed by site-directed PCR mutagenesis of pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf (23Coldwell M.J. Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Hinton T.M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-PABP was constructed by complete digestion of pT7.4Gmut (24Wakiyama M. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf with BamHI and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas, UK). pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-PABP-4A and pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-PABP-4A-3 were generated from pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-PABP by site-directed PCR mutagenesis. In all cases, mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Enzymes were from New England Biolabs unless otherwise specified. pcDNA3.1-mycNMf-WT was as described previously (23Coldwell M.J. Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Hinton T.M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Labtech International) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Antibodies—Anti-Myc4A6 mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Upstate Biologicals; total eIF2α antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling; M2 anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma, and rabbit polyclonal antisera recognizing eIF4GI, eIF4A, PABP, and eIF4E were made in-house using the peptide sequences described previously (23Coldwell M.J.

Norbury (Oxford, UK). m7GTP-Sepharose Affinity Isolation of eIF4E and Associated Factors—For the isolation of eIF4E and associated proteins, cell extracts of equal protein concentration were subjected to m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), and the resin was washed twice in buffer (20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm GTP, and 0.25% (v/v) Igepal), with recovered protein eluted directly into sample buffer (27McKendrick L. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Jagus R. Joshi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Baculovirus Expression and Protein Purification—To create FLAG-tagged fusion proteins, pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf, pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-4A1, pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-PABP, and pcDNA3.1-myc4GIf-3 were digested with HindIII and XhoI, and the inserts were ligated into similarly digested pcDNA3.1 containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDHDG). These constructs were then subjected to PCR amplification to insert a NotI site for cloning into the pFASTBAC HTc vector (Invitrogen). The PCR products were then digested with NotI and XbaI and ligated into similarly digested pFASTBAC HTc vector. Recombinant baculoviruses allowing expression of the eIF4GIf variants were then produced as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were maintained in SF900 II serum-free media (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. [35S]Methionine was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. To produce purified [35S]methionine-labeled proteins, Sf9 cells were infected with the baculoviruses expressing the FLAG-tagged eIF4GIf proteins. The cells were grown for 48 h, and the culture medium was then substituted with methionine-free SF900 media, in the presence of [35S]methionine (10 μCi per 10-cm plate) for 24 h. Cells were harvested as described (13Fraser C.S. Lee J.Y. Mayeur G.L. Bushell M. Doudna J.A. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8946-8956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and expressed proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using M2 anti-FLAG-agarose, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Unlabeled proteins were isolated from cells infected for the same total time but in the absence of added radioactive methionine. Association of Expressed eIF4G Variants with Isolated Initiation Factors in Vitro—Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses for 72 h, and cells were harvested, and the expressed proteins were captured with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose, as described above. Beads associated with ∼5 μg of tagged eIF4GIf variants were washed and then blocked with 10 mg/ml cytochrome c for 30 min on ice. Purified baculovirus-expressed eIF4A or PABP (4 μg) or 10 μg of cell-purified eIF3 complex were added to the beads and incubated for 30 min on ice, and the beads were then washed with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted using SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Leader Protease Treatment of Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (RRL)—Briefly, nuclease-treated RRL (Promega) was treated with ∼0.03 μg/ml recombinant foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) Leader (L) protease for 20 min at 30 °C, and the L protease was subsequently inactivated by addition of 200 μm elastatinal. Preliminary titration studies were carried out to optimize the enzyme concentration. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting to confirm the complete cleavage of eIF4GI, and the lysate was frozen in aliquots in liquid N2. Reconstitution of L Protease-treated RRL—eIF4GIf proteins expressed and purified from the baculovirus-infected insect cell system were added to the L protease-treated RRL under conditions indicated in the individual figure legends. Translation assays were performed under the conditions and using the reagents supplied by the manufacturer. Translation of exogenous luciferase mRNAs was assayed over 90 min, unless otherwise specified. Capped/poly(A)+ luciferase mRNAs with or without a stable hairpin element in the 5′-untranslated region were generated by in vitro transcription (Ambion mMessage-Machine) from plasmids supplied by Dr. Dan Gallie (University of California Riverside (28Niepel M. Ling J. Gallie D.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (27McKendrick L. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Jagus R. Joshi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interaction of Recombinant eIF4GIf Proteins with Other Initiation Factors—Specified concentrations of either unlabeled or [35S]methionine-labeled recombinant, purified eIF4GIf variants were added to 20 μl of RRL under full translational conditions for the times indicated. eIF4E and associated proteins were isolated by m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (27McKendrick L. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Jagus R. Joshi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and recovered proteins were visualized by immunoblotting using the antisera indicated. Incorporation of Baculovirus-expressed eIF4GIf Variants into 48 S Initiation Complexes in RRL—Specified concentrations of the purified, 35S-labeled eIF4GIf proteins were added to RRL in the presence of the normal mixture of reagents required for translation (see above). To sequester endogenous globin mRNA in pre-existing polysomes, the elongation inhibitor emetine was added to a final concentration of 1 × 10–3 m. In addition the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GMPPNP (3 mm), was added (together with 3 mm additional magnesium acetate) to prevent utilization of 48 S complexes formed in the assay. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 min; exogenous mRNA (20 μg/ml) was then added, and the reactions were incubated for a further 2 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold Gradient Buffer (20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate) containing 1% (v/v) formaldehyde and incubated for a further 15 min on ice. The formaldehyde was then quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The short mRNA used for these experiments, 5′-site B-small ORF-3′ (BSEF, also known as WTs (see Ref. 29Gebauer F. Grskovic M. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1397-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), which encoded a small FLAG-tagged peptide, was specially designed to ensure that the untranslated mRNP formed in cell extracts sedimented more slowly than 40 S ribosomal subunits (29Gebauer F. Grskovic M. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1397-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); the plasmid encoding this mRNA was kindly supplied by Drs. M. Grskovic and M. Hentze (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). Reactions were layered onto 7–40% sucrose gradients and centrifuged for 1 h, 25 min at 167,000 × gav at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. Gradients were fractionated by upward displacement using an ISCO UA-5 density gradient fractionator, with concomitant and continuous measurement of absorbance at 254 nm. Selected fractions were pooled, and ribosomes and associated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 320,000 × gav in a Beckman TL100.2 rotor for 1 h at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE, as described previously (27McKendrick L. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Jagus R. Joshi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recovered proteins were detected by PhosphorImager analysis of 35S radioactivity or by immunoblotting with appropriate antisera, with visualization by ECL. Incorporation of Baculovirus-expressed eIF4G Variants into 48 S Complexes Associated with Polysomes—Specified concentrations of the purified, 35S-labeled eIF4GIf proteins were added to RRL under full translational conditions for 30 °C for 3 min under conditions allowing translation of endogenous globin mRNA. GMPPNP (3 mm together with 3 mm additional magnesium acetate) was then added and the reaction incubated for a further 3 min; the reactions were terminated by the addition of Gradient Buffer containing 1% (v/v) formaldehyde and incubated for a further 15 min on ice. The formaldehyde was then quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and reactions were layered onto 15–45% sucrose gradients and centrifuged for 1 h, 25 min at 167,000 × gav at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. Samples were then processed as described above. siRNA Knockdown of Endogenous eIF4GI and Recovery with siRNA-resistant eIF4GI cDNA—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding siRNA31, which targets all endogenous eIF4GI mRNAs (30Coldwell M.J. Morley S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8448-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In some cases, expression of individual eIF4G variants in the knockdown background was achieved by co-transfection of cells with plasmids encoding appropriate siRNA31-resistant cDNAs. To measure rates of translation at the time of cell harvesting, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, scraped into 0.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 mm β-glycerophosphate and 2 mm benzamidine, and isolated by centrifugation in a cooled microcentrifuge for 1 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold Buffer A (20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm benzamidine, complete protease inhibitor mix (–EDTA (Roche Applied Science)) and lysed by vortexing following the addition of 0.5% (v/v) Igepal and 0.5% (v/v) deoxycholate. Postnuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifugation in a cooled microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C and frozen in liquid N2. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis, and the incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting (27McKendrick L. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Jagus R. Joshi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection of NIH 3T3 or HeLa Cells and Preparation of Cell Lysates—For transient expression of the eIF4GIf variants, NIH 3T3 cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA in 17.5 μl of FuGENE 6, as per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). After 36 h, cells were then subjected to hypertonic shock by addition of an extra 150 mm NaCl to the culture medium, followed by incubation for 1 h, as described previously (31Morley S.J. Naegele S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32855-32859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Naegele S. Morley S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46023-46034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The high salt medium was then replaced with normal media and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum for various times, as indicated. Cells to be analyzed for the incorporation of expressed eIF4GIf into 48 S complexes associated with polysomes were further treated with 0.25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 5 min to trap 48 S complexes on polysomes (“half-mers”). Following treatment, cells were harvested and extracts analyzed as described above. Characterization of Proteins Used in This Study—The aim of this work was to examine the effect on the function of eIF4GI of inactivating individual binding sites for some of its key interacting proteins. Two binding sites have been identified in eIF4GI for eIF4AI; one is located in the middle domain and the second is in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). Several mutations have been identified previously in eIF4GI fragments and in the eIF4GIa isoform that disrupt the interaction of eIF4GI with eIF4AI (17Morino S. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One of these mutations, an F978A substitution that disrupted the binding of eIF4AI, but not that of eIF3, was chosen for this study. A pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing the full-length eIF4GIf cDNA with a 5′-Myc tag (23Coldwell M.J. Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Hinton T.M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), here referred to as eIF4GIf, was subjected to site-directed PCR mutagenesis to generate the F978A mutation, and is referred to as eIF4GIf-4A1 (Fig. 1). To test the effectiveness of this point mutation in inactivating the binding of eIF4A to the middle domain, it was necessary to eliminate the second binding domain in the C terminus. For this purpose we used a truncated fragment of eIF4GI- (amino acids 1–1176) that corresponds to a cleavage product generated by caspase 3 during apoptosis (26Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This fragment, here termed NMf, was inserted into pcDNAmyc to produce NMf-WT (23Coldwell M.J. Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Hinton T.M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2545-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The chosen middle domain eIF4AI-binding site mutation was also inserted into this fragment to produce NMf-4A. A mutation in eIF4GI disrupting the PABP-eIF4GI interaction has also been characterized previously (24Wakiyama M. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The PABP-binding site mutation was incorporated into pcDNA4GIf by site-directed PCR mutagenesis and is referred to as eIF4GIf-PABP (Fig. 1). The eIF3-binding site in eIF4GI has been located to a region at the C-terminal end of the middle domain (34Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41369-41376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A series of point mutations within this region that inactivates eIF3 binding has been identified, 5N. Sonenberg, personal communication. but the physiological behavior of the mutant protein has not been reported. This mutation was introduced into pcDNA4GIf by site-directed PCR mutagenesis producing eIF4GIf-3 (Fig. 1). In addition, both the wild-type and individual mutants and mutant variants of eIF4GIf lacking multiple interaction sites were subcloned into the pFastBac Htc vector for generation of recombinant baculoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged versions (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). To evaluate the effectiveness of the mutations in abolishing binding activity, each of the recombinant, baculovirus-expressed and purified eIF4GIf proteins was bound to M2-anti FLAG-agarose. Recombinant PABP (Fig. 2A), eIF4A (Fig. 2B), or the eIF3 complex purified from HeLa cells (provided by Dr. Chris Fraser, University of California Berkeley; Fig. 2C) was incubated with the immobilized proteins, and the ability of the eIF4GI variant"
https://openalex.org/W1992650100,"Cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are required in development and postnatal repair. Important classes of ligands for HS include growth factors and extracellular matrix macromolecules. For example, the focal adhesion component syndecan-4 interacts with the III12-14 region of fibronectin (HepII domain) through its HS chains. The fine structure of HS is critical to growth factor responses, and whether this extends to matrix ligands is unknown but is suggested from in vitro experiments. Cell attachment to HepII showed that heparin oligosaccharides of ≥14 sugar residues were required for optimal inhibition. The presence of N-sulfated glucosamine in the HS was essential, whereas 2-O-sulfation of uronic acid or 6-O-sulfation of glucosamine had marginal effects. In the more complex response of focal adhesion formation through syndecan-4, N-sulfates were again required and also glucosamine 6-O-sulfate. The significance of polymer N-sulfation and sulfated domains in HS was confirmed by studies with mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells where heparan sulfation was compromised. Finally, focal adhesion formation was absent in fibroblasts synthesizing short HS chains resulting from a gene trap mutation in one of the two major glucosaminoglycan polymerases (EXT1). Several separate, specific properties of cell surface HS are therefore required in cell adhesion responses to the fibronectin HepII domain.

Several separate, specific properties of cell surface HS are therefore required in cell adhesion responses to the fibronectin HepII domain. Interactions involving both the integrin- and heparin-binding domains of fibronectin contribute to a complete adhesion response in normal fibroblasts (1Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and in melanoma (2McCarthy J.B. Hagen S.T. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and neuroblastoma cells (3Haugen P.K. Letourneau P.C. Drake S.L. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2597-2608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary receptor for adhesion to fibronectin commonly involves the RGD motif of repeat III10 through integrins such as α5β1 (4Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1985; 40: 191-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), but this integrin-ligand interaction is only sufficient for attachment and spreading. Additional signaling through the cell surface proteoglycan syndecan-4 is required for focal adhesion formation and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton into bundled stress fibers (5Woods A. Couchman J.R. Johansson S. Höök M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 6Bloom L. Ingham K.C. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1521-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are stable points of contacts that occur between cells and the extracellular matrix. Signaling from focal adhesions contributes not only to cell adhesion but to dynamic changes in gene expression, apoptosis regulation, and control of the cell cycle (7Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).

Heparan sulfate binding occurs primarily via the HepII domain (containing the FN type III repeats 12-14) in the C-terminal region of fibronectin.

Molecular modeling studies with mutational analysis of III13 suggested the existence of a cluster of six positively charged residues that form a “cationic cradle” binding site for heparin (17Busby T.F.

Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, NMR studies have shown that the dominant binding site of heparin in HepII is within the first 29 residues of the III13 module (19Sachchidanand Lequin O. Staunton D. Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Yoshida K. Campbell I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50629-50635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate, unlike its structural analogue heparin, displays a high degree of structural heterogeneity. The HS polysaccharide has alternating hexuronic acid (d-glucuronic acid or l-iduronic acid) and d-N-acetylglucosamine residues. The two major heparan sulfate polymerases (EXT1 and -2) combine together to synthesize the heparan sulfate polysaccharide (20Busse M. Kusche-Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41333-41337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is subsequently modified by sulfation and uronic acid epimerization. The first modification is mediated by N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases but in a block pattern and not to completion so that there are regions of N-sulfate groups (NSO3) inter-spersed with those rich in N-acetyl groups (NAc). Disaccharides can be further O-sulfated at the C-6 and/or C-3 positions of the d-glucosamine and at the C-2 position of the iduronic acid (21Stringer S.E. Kandola B.S. Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but predominantly in N-sulfated regions. The HS domain structure then results in sulfate-rich regions (S-domains) interspersed with relatively unsulfated N-acetyl-rich sequences (NAc-domains); transition zones of intermediate sulfation lie at the interface of the S- and NAc-domains (22Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The length of the S-domains in HS and its pattern of sulfation are critical for optimum binding to protein ligands and their subsequent biological functions (23Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For example, an octasaccharide library subjected to affinity chromatography for interactions with various fibroblast growth factors suggested that FGF-10 required 6-O-sulfate but not 2-O-sulfate groups (25Ashikari-Hada S. Habuchi H. Kariya Y. Itoh N. Reddi A.H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12346-12354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Another study reported with x-ray scattering using regioselectively desulfated heparin samples that high affinity FGF-2 interactions required 2-O sulfation (26Yuguchi Y. Kominato R. Ban T. Urakawa H. Kajiwara K. Takano R. Kamei K. Hara S. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2005; 35: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A previous in vitro study demonstrated that the interaction between fibroblast-derived HS and the HepII region of fibronectin occurred within the S-domains and that the smallest S-domain length with measurable affinity at physiological ionic strength was an octasaccharide (27Walker A. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since then, a further cell-free study of the structural features of HS in this interaction indicated that there was a prominent role for N-sulfate groups, but the presence of 6-O-sulfate groups enhanced affinity as did increasing the oligosaccharide length to a tetradecasaccharide (28Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, cell adhesion experiments examining the specificity of sulfation in interactions with the HepII domain have been lacking. The hypothesis here was that cell attachment and focal adhesion formation in response to the fibronectin HepII domain depend on specificity of sulfation and that the two cellular events may not be equivalent in their requirements. It is now shown that although N-sulfation of glucosamine residues is essential for both responses, focal adhesion formation has an additional glucosamine 6-O sulfation requirement. Furthermore, there are minimal oligosaccharide length requirements for cell adhesion, and focal adhesion formation also depends on a substantial chain length, indicative of complex specific and multiple interactions with the HepII domain of fibronectin. Materials and Antibodies—For cell adhesion assays, heparin (Sigma), heparan sulfate (Seikaguku, Tokyo), chondroitin sulfate C (Seikaguku), and variously desulfated heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharides (see below for production methods) were used as competitors. Alexa Fluor 586-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) and anti-vinculin (clone hVIN1; Sigma) antibody, together with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were used for focal adhesion assembly assays. Gelatin-agarose (Sigma), Ultrogel-4% agarose (Sigma), DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences), and heparin-agarose (Sigma) were used for the purification of fibronectin and derivation of the 110-kDa cell-binding fragment. For purification of the recombinant HepII fragment of fibronectin, TALON beads (BD Biosciences) were used. Total RNA was extracted using RNAzol™ B (AMS Biotechnology, Abingdon, UK). The polyclonal chicken anti-syndecan-4 antibody (Harlan Sera-Lab, UK) was raised against 20 amino acids of the N-terminal human syndecan-4 ectodomain sequence, and antibodies were affinity-purified from plasma using standard procedures. This antibody together with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY (Invitrogen) was used for FACS analysis. Cell Culture—Rat embryo fibroblasts (29Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Cambrex, Wokingham, UK) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Biowest, Ringmer, UK) and 1% glutamine (Invitrogen). Wild type and syndecan-4 knock-out mouse embryo fibroblasts (30Ishiguro K. Kadomatsu K. Kojima T. Muramatsu H. Tsuzuki S. Nakamura E. Kusugami K. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5249-5252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) were also cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium but with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine. CHO-K1, CHO-761 (31LeBaron R.G. Esko J.D. Woods A. Johansson S. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and CHO-606 (32Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine. Wild type and exon-1 gene trap (EXT1) mouse embryo fibroblasts (kindly donated by Dr. Marion Kusche-Gullberg (33Yamada S. Busse M. Ueno M. Kelly O.G. Skarnes W.C. Sugahara K. Kusche-Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32134-32141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing high glucose and glutamine) with 10% fetal calf serum. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma and were negative. Preparation of Selectively Desulfated Heparin/HS Species—Chemically desulfated heparin oligosaccharides and heparan sulfate polymers were essentially prepared as described previously (34Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, these oligosaccharides and polymers were prepared from low molecular weight heparin (Innohep) or heparan sulfate produced by partial heparinase cleavage. The saccharides were then separated by high resolution gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-10 and subjected to the various chemical desulfations. The selectively desulfated heparan sulfates (desulfated at the N-, 2-O, and 6-O positions) were prepared as described previously (28Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Based on disaccharide compositions, the de-N-sulfated HS lost 93% of its N-sulfates; the de-2-O sulfated lost 84% of its 2-O-sulfates, and 55% of the 6-O-sulfates were lost from the 6-O-desulfated material. There was negligible unspecific loss of sulfates in these preparations. Preparation of Fibronectin and 110-kDa Fragment—Fibronectin was purified by adapting the protocol of Meikka et al. (35Miekka S.I. Ingham K.C. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh human plasma was treated with citrate and 0.1 m ϵ-aminocaproic acid to inactivate plasminogen. Tandem columns of Ultrogel and Ultrogel-gelatin agarose were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 20 mm sodium citrate, 2 mm EDTA (Buffer A). After spinning at 14,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, plasma supernatant was loaded onto the first column and directly onto the affinity matrix. The gelatin column was washed with 1 m NaCl in Buffer A and then eluted with 3 m urea in Buffer A. The 110-kDa fragment of fibronectin, representing repeats III3-III11, was isolated as described previously (36Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1557-1561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified human fibronectin was digested with α-chymotrypsin, and fragments were passed through gelatin and heparin-agarose columns in tandem. Columns were previously equilibrated with column buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Pass through fractions were collected and passed over a DEAE ion exchange column equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The 110-kDa polypeptide was eluted with increasing concentrations of NaCl. Purification of Recombinant HepII Domain—The recombinant His-tagged HepII (FN repeats III12-15) domain in plasmid pQE30 (a kind gift from Dr. J. Schwarzbauer, Princeton University) was expressed in Escherichia coli SURE and purified with TALON resin (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purity of the protein was confirmed by separation on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Blue staining. Cell Adhesion Assay—24-Well plates (Fisher) were coated overnight with fibronectin (10 μg/ml), HepII (10 μg/ml), or 5% BSA at room temperature. Thereafter, wells were blocked with BSA and in some cases treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0-1000 ng/ml heparin, 0-1000 μg/ml heparan sulfate, 1-100 μg/ml chondroitin sulfate, or size-defined heparin oligomers serially diluted in serum-free medium. Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA, then trypsin-inactivated with soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in serum-free medium with 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and seeded on substrates for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were then washed with PBS and incubated with 15 μm of the fluorescent dye calcein (Invitrogen) diluted in serum-free medium for 30-45 min at 37 °C. After washing, cell-bound fluorescence (indicating relative cell number) was measured in a Fluostar Galaxy plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Aylesbury, UK) at 485 nm excitation and 520 nm emission. Focal Adhesion Assembly Assays—Substrates were coated and blocked as for cell adhesion assays. For fibronectin-coated coverslips, cells were detached as above and seeded for 2 h in the presence or absence of heparin or heparin oligomers. In other experiments, coverslips were coated with the 110-kDa integrin-binding domain of fibronectin (10 μg/ml), and cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h. Then the HepII fragment of fibronectin preincubated ± heparin or heparin oligomers (for 15 min) was added for a further 30 min. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS. The cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated phalloidin (1:200) and vinculin (1:200), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000). Cells were visualized on an Olympus AX70 epifluorescence microscope at ×60 magnification (PlanApo 60×/1.40 oil). The images were captured using the Spot Advanced software and processed in Photoshop 7.0. A minimum of 50 treated and nontreated cells were analyzed for focal adhesions. Cells containing more than five distinct focal adhesions were deemed positive. Flow Cytometry Analyses—Cells were detached from flasks with Hanks'-based, enzyme-free, cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), washed, resuspended in 1 × 106 cells/ml of FACS buffer (PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.5% BSA), and incubated with 14 μg/ml chicken anti-syndecan-4 polyclonal antibody for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing with FACS buffer, the cells were stained with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgY (1:1000). Cells were also incubated with secondary antibody only as negative controls. The cells were then analyzed on FACSCalibur, and the CellQuest software (both from BD Biosciences) was used for acquisition and analysis of the data. Fibroblast Adhesion to HepII Domain of Fibronectin Is Mediated by Heparan Sulfate—Previously it was shown in cross-linking experiments that the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-4 bound to the HepII domain of fibronectin (1Woods A. Longley R.L. Tumova S. Couchman J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To examine whether the HepII fragment could support cell attachment only through heparan sulfate in these cells, adhesion assays using HepII-coated surfaces were carried out in the presence of competing heparin, heparan sulfate, or chondroitin sulfate. Fibronectin- and BSA-coated substrates served as positive and negative controls, respectively (Fig. 1). Heparin (Fig. 1A) and heparan sulfate (Fig. 1B) reduced adhesion to the HepII domain in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 levels of 0.16 and 60 μg/ml, respectively (Table 1). This suggests that heparin, with its higher overall sulfation levels, was the more efficient inhibitor. In contrast, exogenous chondroitin sulfate was unable to block fibroblast adhesion to HepII-coated substrates (Fig. 1C). Moreover, whereas the HepII domain has a binding site for α4β1 integrin (37Mould A.P. Wheldon L.A. Komoriya A. Wayner E.A. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4020-4024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this was not a factor in these assays because the primary fibroblasts lack this receptor (not shown). This is consistent with the high sensitivity of cell attachment to HepII in the presence of heparin alone.TABLE 1Summary table of IC50 values for competitors of REF attachment to HepII and percentage of REFs containing focal adhesions on either FN or the integrin-binding domain with HepII treatment, in the presence of these competitors (heparin, 10 μg/ml; all others, 30 μg/ml)CompetitorAverage molecular massIC50 valuesFN, focal adhesionIBD + HepII, focal adhesionkDaμg/ml%%Heparin150.161410Heparin 14-mer oligosaccharide4.212512CompDes heparin oligosaccharide2.8>109578DNS heparin oligosaccharide3.5>109272DNRAc heparin oligosaccharide3.82.57462DE6S heparin oligosaccharide3.50.657555DE2S heparin oligosaccharide3.50.235710Heparin 12-mer oligosaccharide3.62.5HS polymeric chains2560DNS HS polymeric chains25>1000DNRAc HS polymeric chains251040DE6S HS polymeric chains25850DE2S HS polymeric chains2530Chondroitin sulfate C30>100 Open table in a new tab Optimal Inhibition of Fibroblast Adhesion to HepII Requires a Minimal Heparan Sulfate 14-mer—Previous affinity chromatography data suggested that a minimal heparin octamer was required for binding to the HepII domain but that increased size of oligosaccharide resulted in concomitantly higher affinity (28Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate whether these data could be extrapolated to cell adhesion, heparin oligosaccharides of increasing size were used as competitors in fibroblast adhesion to HepII. Detectable inhibition was seen with a hexamer, but this was strongly increased by longer oligosaccharides to yield complete inhibition (Fig. 2A). When 12-mers and 14-mers were more closely compared in dose-response experiments (Fig. 2B), the 14-mer was a more efficient competitor. This is also reflected in the IC50 values where a 50% reduction in adhesion required 2.5 μg/ml of 12-mers but only 1 μg/ml of 14-mers (Table 1). Also because 14-mer S-domains rich in N- and 6-O-sulfates are much rarer in heparan sulfate, this would partly explain why higher concentrations of heparan sulfate chains are required in competition assays, compared with heparin, which is almost a continuous S-domain. In any case, the previous cell-free experiments correlate well with fibroblast attachment to the HepII domain and suggest that this fibronectin domain can have an extensive interaction site(s) with cell surface heparan sulfate. Cell Adhesion to the HepII Domain Requires Heparan N-Sulfation—Sulfation of glucosamine and uronate residues in heparan sulfate is not random but is regulated in a complex manner (38Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Binding studies with HS and heparin have shown that the pattern of sulfation in turn can determine the affinity of interactions with fibronectin and its isolated HepII domain. To determine whether sulfation position also regulates cell surface heparan sulfate-HepII interactions, we examined a range of mono-desulfated 14-mer heparin oligomers deficient in N-sulfates (DNS and a reacetylated derivative DNRAc), the 6-O-sulfates of the glucosamine residue (DE6S), or 2-O-sulfate groups of the iduronic acid residue (DE2S) (see “Experimental Procedures”). In addition a fully desulfated oligomer (CompDes) was also used. As expected, this CompDes heparin oligomer was unable to compete with the fibroblast HS chains for adhesion to the HepII domain (Fig. 3A). In comparison to normal heparin 14-mers (Fig. 2B), the DE2S and DE6S heparin oligomers also decreased cell adhesion to the HepII substrate in a similar dose-dependent manner and with similar IC50 values (Table 1). This suggests that 2-O- and 6-O-sulfates were not critical for inhibition of cell attachment to HepII. However, the DNRAc heparin oligomer was a significantly weaker inhibitor than either the DE2S or DE6S species, and in the absence of reacetylation, the N-desulfated oligomer (DNS) containing N-unsubstituted amines was unable to compete with cell surface HS for attachment to HepII (Fig. 3A and Table 1). These inhibition studies indicate that the N-sulfates are the key functional groups for recognition of the HepII substrate by adherent cells, and they are consistent with previous affinity chromatographic data showing that N-sulfates play a predominant role in heparin interaction with the HepII domain of fibronectin (28Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether desulfated heparan sulfate polymers would give similar results to the desulfated heparin oligomers, further competition assays were conducted (Fig. 3B). In common with the de-N-sulfated heparin 14-mers, de-N-sulfated HS was a very poor competitor for cell adhesion to the HepII domain. Unsurprisingly, given the lower overall sulfation in heparan sulfate compared with heparin, higher concentrations were required in these assays to obtain similar levels of cell adhesion inhibition. However, DE2S heparan sulfate polymer was a more effective competitor than DE6S heparan sulfate polymer (IC50 values of 30 and 850 μg/ml respectively; see Table 1), implying that in contrast to heparin there is a greater reliance on 6-O sulfation in HS for efficient cell attachment to the HepII substrate. As with heparin, the DE2S HS form competed about as effectively as native HS, suggesting a hierarchy of importance with the N-sulfates being the most important, followed by 6-O- and 2-O-sulfate groups. Heparan N- and 6-O-Sulfation Are Required for Focal Adhesion Formation—It is well documented that focal adhesion formation in primary fibroblasts in response to fibronectin requires both integrin and syndecan-4 heparan sulfate proteoglycan (1Woods A.

A strong melanocortin agonist, NDP-MSH, also stimulated FAO in primary culture muscle cells and C2C12 cells.

Obesity is a major health problem in humans; it is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Impaired cellular metabolism in target tissues that regulate fuel homeostasis is one of the pathogenic factors associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes (1Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle plays a major role in determining whole body energy expenditure. In humans, skeletal muscle accounts for >70% of the body's total glucose disposal (2Ferrannini E. Endocrinol. Rev. 1998; 19: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Recent studies utilizing computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have demonstrated that adipose tissue located beneath the fascia lata is metabolically important in obesity and type 2 diabetes (3Pagliassotti M.J.

The central melanocortin system is important in the control of food intake and body weight. Proopiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamus mediate leptin-induced catabolic effects (7Mizuno T.M.

Recent experiments in MC3R knock-out mice indicate that inactivation of MC3R results in increased fat mass and reduced body mass, despite the fact that the animals were hypophagic and maintained normal metabolic rates (11Butler A.A.

However, the peripheral effects of melanocortins have not been extensively studied, even though α-MSH has been shown to have direct effects on several peripheral organ systems (13Yaswen L. Diehl N. Brennan M.B. Hochgeschwender U. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1066-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 15Zemel M.B. Shi H. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Among the five subtypes of MCRs, MC5R is the predominant subtype expressed in skeletal muscle (16Labbe O. Desarnaud F. Eggerickx D. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4543-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct peripheral action for melanocortins in this tissue. Recently, the role of melanocortins and MCRs in adipocytes has been studied (17Forbes S. Bui S. Robinson B.R. Hochgeschwender U. Brennan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4233-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Hoggard N. Hunter L. Duncan J.S. Rayner D.V. J. Mol.

Cell Endocrinol. 2003; 200: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the effects of melanocortins on skeletal muscle are not well understood. It has been postulated that fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in skeletal muscle is regulated in part by malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA is an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), which controls the transfer of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules into the mitochondria for oxidation (20Saggerson D. Ghadiminejad I. Awan M. Adv. Enzyme. Regul. 1992; 32: 285-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Winder W.W. Arogyasami J. Elayan I.M. Cartmill D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E266-E271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA is synthesized from cytosolic acetyl-CoA through a reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Meanwhile, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fuel-sensing enzyme present in most mammalian tissues (22Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Elayan I.M. Cartmill D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). In exercising skeletal muscle, activation of AMPK increased glucose transport (23Hayashi T. HIrshman M.F. Fujii N. Habinowski S.A. Witters L.A. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) and FAO (22Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Elayan I.M. Cartmill D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through the inhibition of ACC and activation of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase by phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in the concentration of malonyl-CoA and an increase in CPT-1 activity (25Park H. Kaushik V. Constant S. Prentki M. Przybytkowski E. Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32571-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It has been reported that leptin stimulates FAO and glucose uptake and prevents the accumulation of lipids through AMPK activation and ACC inhibition (26Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peronl O.D. Lee G.K. Corinna F. Muller D.C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). However, whether melanocortins stimulate the oxidation of fatty acid in nonadipose tissues has not yet been determined. To assess the peripheral regulation of melanocortins on fuel homeostasis in skeletal muscle, we studied 1) the effect of α-MSH analogues on FAO, 2) which MCRs play major roles in mediating FAO, 3) downstream signals after MCR activation, and 4) the role of AMPK in skeletal muscle FAO. Here, we showed that α-MSH regulates FAO through the activation of the MCR-mediated protein kinase A (PKA)-AMPK signal transduction pathway in skeletal muscle. Materials—α-MSH, NDP-MSH, and [Glu6]α-MSH-ND peptides were synthesized at Peptron (Daejon, Korea). l-[methyl-14C]Carnitine and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. SHU9119, JKC-363, dibutyryl-cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, Rp-8-Br-cAMP, and H89 were obtained from Sigma. Anti-phospho-acetyl-CoA polyclonal antibody and Anti-acetyl-CoA polyclonal antibody were obtained from Upstate Co. (Bedford, MA). Animals—Eight-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Daehan Biolink Co., Seoul, Korea). Animals were maintained under a 12-h light-dark cycle at 23 °C according to institutional guidelines for the humane treatment of laboratory animals. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Yonsei, College of Medicine (Seoul, Korea). Mice were housed with free access to food and water and were removed from the cages from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. during the experiments. Myocyte Cell Cultures—A monolayer of mouse C2C12 myoblasts cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 90%/10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C containing 5% CO2. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes, sub-cultured at 60–80% confluence, and split at a ratio of 1:10 using trypsin-EDTA. Cells grown to 60% confluence were sub-cultured at a ratio of 1:15 into 6-well dishes. When the cells were 80% confluent, differentiation into myoblasts containing myotubes was induced by switching to low serum differentiation medium (98% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 2% (v/v) horse serum). Differentiation medium was changed daily. By day 6, the cells were fully confluent and had differentiated into multinucleated myoblasts with contracting myotubes. Primary Muscle Cell Culture—The hind limbs of 3-week-old mouse fetuses were used to prepare muscle cell cultures (27Daniels M.P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 615-626PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, muscle tissue was dissected from the hind limbs under a microscope, and the tissue was then minced into small pieces with scissors. The suspension was digested with 0.1% (w/v) collagenase, 0.2% trypsin, and 0.1% DNase at 37 °C for 30 min. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum (growth medium) was added to the suspension. The remaining tissue fragments were dissociated by triturating with a 10-ml pipette. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Twenty microliters of growth medium was added, and the suspension was again triturated with a 10-ml wide-bore pipette to dissociate aggregated cells. The suspension was filtered through a 70-μm nylon mesh, and the cells were seeded onto two 100-mm Petri dishes for 45 min. During this time, the fibroblasts attached to the bottom of the dish, while the myoblasts remained in suspension. The medium was removed and the dishes were discarded. Cells were counted and seeded onto 100-mm dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin. For the purpose of further purification of the myocytes, fibroblasts and other contaminating cell types were removed by dispase treatment 48 h after seeding, as described by Daniels (27Daniels M.P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 615-626PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed on first passage cells 11–12 days after re-plating. RT-PCR Reaction—Total RNA from the hypothalamus, skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, and C2C12 cells was isolated using Tri reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA was quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm; the A260/A280 ratio was 1.8 or higher. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 2 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), 0.5 μg of random primer (Promega), 0.25 mm dNTPs (Promega), and 10 units of RNasin (Promega) in a final volume of 20 μl. PCR amplification was performed using 1 μl of RT products, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 1.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega) in a final volume of 50 μl. PCR amplification for each melanocortin receptor was performed with 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The following oligonucleotides were used for RT-PCR amplification: MC1R: forward, 5′-GCC ACC CTT ACT ATC CTT CT-3′; reverse, 5′-ATA TCA CTG TCA CCC TCT GC-3′; MC3R: forward, 5′-CAAGATGGTCATCGTGTGTCT-3′; reverse, 5′-TAGCCCAAGTTCATGCTGTT-3′; MC4R: forward, 5′-ATCATTTACTCGGACAGCAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACAACTCACAGATGCCTCCCA-3′; MC5R: forward, 5′-TCATTTGCCTCATCTCCATGT-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTGAGAGAGGAAGGCGTTT-3′; and β-actin: forward, 5′-TTCAACACCCCAGCCATGT-3′; reverse, 5′-TGTGGTACGACCAGAGGCATAC-3′. Muscle Mitochondria Preparation and CPT-1 Activity Assay— Animals were sacrificed by decapitation. The soleus muscles were homogenized in 0.15 m KCl medium containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA. Mitochondria were isolated as described by Saggerson and Carpenter (28Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 0.15 m KCl medium. Mitochondrial protein levels were measured using Lowry's method (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined within 15 min of mitochondrial isolation by measuring the incorporation of l-[methyl-14C]carnitine into the n-butanol-soluble product (28Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (250 μg of protein) were preincubated at 25 °C for 4 min in 1.0 ml of a mixture containing 150 mm sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm palmitoyl-CoA, and 1.3 mg/ml albumin (fatty acid-free). Reactions were started by adding 25 μl of a solution containing 1 μCi (0.4 μmol) of l-[methyl-14C]carnitine and continued for up to 4 min. The reactions were then stopped by adding 1.0 ml of ice-cold 1 n HCl. Blank values were determined by replacing the mitochondrial samples with an equal volume of resuspension buffer. Measurement of Palmitate Oxidation in the Primary Muscle Cells and C2C12 Cells—FAO was measured by quantifying the production of 3H O from [9,10-3H2]palmitate as previously described (30Djouadi F. Bonnefont J.P. Munnich A. Bastin J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 78: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were trypsinized, counted, plated (1 × 106 cells per well in 12-well coated microplates), and allowed to grow for 6 days in differentiation medium. Tritiated water release experiments were performed in triplicate. Cultured muscle cell layers were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Next, 500 μl of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (53 Ci/mmol) was bound to fatty acid-free albumin (final concentration: 125 μm, palmitate: albumin = 1:1). α-MSH was added as specified for each experiment. The incubation was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the mixture was removed and added to a tube containing 200 μl of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,200 × g at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatants (350 μl) were removed, mixed with 55 μl of 6 n NaOH, and applied to ion-exchange resin. The columns were washed twice with 750 μl of water, and the eluants were counted. AMPK Assay—AMPK activity was measured as previously described (31Kishi K. Yuasa T. Minami A. Yamada M. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ebina Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Differentiated cells on 6-well plates were incubated with the indicated concentrations of ligands for the specified periods at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared with a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and were immunoprecipitated with an anti-AMPKα2-subunit antibody (Upstate) and protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The beads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and once with AMPK assay buffer (40 mm HEPES, 200 mm AMP, 80 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of assay mixture (40 mm HEPES, 200 mm AMP, 80 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm “SAMS” peptide, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and incubated for 20 min or the indicated periods at 30 °C. Twenty microliters of the supernatant was spotted onto Whatman P81 chromatography paper. The filter was then washed four times with 1% phosphoric acid and air dried. AMPK activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of 32P using scintillation counting. Adenoviral Gene Transfer of Dominant-negative α1 and α2 AMPK—Plasmid encoding c-Myc-tagged forms of dominant-negative α1 and α2 AMPK were kindly provided by Dr J. Ha (Dept. of Molecular Biology, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea). Adenoviruses containing either β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal) or a mixture of dominant-negative α1 AMPK and α2 AMPK (Ad-DN-AMPK) were added to subconfluent C2C12 cells at a concentration of 50 plaque-forming units per cell for 2 h at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, as described previously (32Park J.Y. Takahara N. Gabriele A. Chou E. Naruse K. Suzuma K. Yamauchi T. Ha S.W. Meier M. Rhodes C.J. King G.L. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting Analysis—After stimulation for the indicated time, cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. The proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were incubated with 5% skim milk powder in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, also used for all incubation and washing steps) for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-Acetyl CoA polyclonal antibody (Upstate) or anti-acetyl-CoA polyclonal antibody (Upstate). After rinsing, the blots were incubated for 1 h with a 1:2,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. After washing three times, the signals were visualized with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Small Interfering RNA Construction—An appropriate siRNA sequence within the target melanocortin receptor mRNA sequence was chosen according to the manufacturer's software (provided by Ambion, Austin, TX). 5′-AAT GTG CTG GTT GTG GCC CCT GTC TC-3′ and 5′-AAG GCT ATC ACA ACC AGC ACA CCT GTC TC-3′ siRNA oligonucleotides for MC1R, 5′-AAC ACG TTC AAG GAG ATT CTC CCT GTC TC-3′ and 5′-AAG AGA ATC TCC TTG AAC GTG CCT GTC TC-3′ siRNA oligonucleotides for MC3R, and 5′-TCATTTGCCTCATCTCCATGT-3′ and 5′-ACTGAGAGAGGAAGGCGTT T-3′ siRNA oligonucleotides for MC5R were synthesized using a siRNA kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. C2C12 cells were plated in 6-well plates for RNA preparation and in 12-well plates for the palmitate oxidation assay. They were transfected at 70% confluency with 50 nm control siRNA or one of the melanocortin receptor siRNAs using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were recovered in the regular growth medium for 48 h before inducing differentiation into myoblasts with differentiation medium. Effective RNA interference probes and their effective concentrations were determined based on their ability to inactivate cognate sequences. The effect of each siRNA was measured by quantitative RT-PCR gel analysis. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Instat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All data were analyzed using the Student's t test or ANOVA. Effect of α-MSH on FAO in Primary Muscle and C2C12 Cells—To investigate whether α-MSH regulates FAO in skeletal muscle, the activity of CPT-1, the rate-limiting enzyme in FAO, was measured. Mice were subcutaneously injected with 100 nm α-MSH, and CPT-1 activity in skeletal muscle was measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 h after α-MSH treatment. CPT-1 activity increased significantly after treatment (36% increase at 1 h) and returned to the baseline level at 5 h (Fig. 1A). The effect of α-MSH on palmitate oxidation was also measured in C2C12 cells and primary culture muscle cells. In C2C12 cells, 10–8 m α-MSH induced a significant increase in palmitate oxidation (40% relative to control) and at 10–5 m α-MSH, palmitate oxidation increased to 210% (Fig. 1B). A similar dose-dependent effect was observed in primary muscle cells (Fig. 1C). NDP-MSH, another MCR agonist, also increased palmitate oxidation at concentrations ranging from 10–8 m to 10–5 m in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting a functional role for MCRs in melanocortin-induced FAO in skeletal muscle. MCR Subtypes Expressed in Skeletal Muscle and C2C12 Cells—To investigate the expression of the five MCR subtypes (MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R) in mouse peripheral tissues and C2C12 cells, RT-PCR was performed using primers specific to each subtype. The hypothalamus was used as a positive control. All subtypes, except MC2R, were detected at variable levels in skeletal muscle and C2C12 cells as well as adipose tissue and liver. Both MC1R and MC5R were diffusely expressed but most highly expressed in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). Identification of the MCR Subtype Mediating α-MSH-induced FAO in Skeletal Muscle—To clarify the functional subtype of MCR responsible for α-MSH-induced FAO in skeletal muscle, we treated C2C12 cells and primary muscle cells with several known agonists and antagonists. [Gln6]α-MSH-ND, which has an agonistic activity for only MC4R and MC3R, increased palmitate oxidation only at high concentrations (10–5 m) (Fig. 3A). SHU9119 is a potent, nonselective antagonist against both MC3R and MC4R; however, it is an agonist for both MC1R and MC5R (33Schioth H.B. Muceniece R. Mutulis F. Bouifrouri A.A. Mutule I. Wikberg J.E. Neuropeptides. 1999; 33: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SHU9119 increased the effect of α-MSH-induced palmitate oxidation in C2C12 cells (Fig. 3B) and primary muscle cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, SHU9119 alone increased palmitate oxidation in both cell lines (Fig. 3, B and C). JKC-363, a selective MC4R antagonist, slightly decreased α-MSH-induced palmitate oxidation, but not to a statistically significant degree (Fig. 3D). Effects of siRNA against MCR on FAO—To further examine the role of MCRs on FAO in skeletal muscle, C2C12 cells were transfected with siRNAs designed to suppress expression of the MCR subtypes. Two days after transfection, the cells reached a confluent state, and the medium was exchanged with a differentiation medium containing 2% horse serum. After 3 days of differentiation, mRNA expression of three subtypes of MCR was suppressed by up to 60% for MC1R, 90% for MC3R, and 80% for MC5R compared with the control (Fig. 4A). α-MSH increased FAO in cells transfected with the control siRNA, and siRNA against either MC1R or MC3R failed to show any visible suppression of α-MSH induced FAO in these cells (Fig. 4B). However, no significant α-MSH-induced increase in FAO was observed in cells transfected with MC5R-specific siRNA (Fig. 4B). Effects of α-MSH on AMPK Activity in C2C12 Cells and Primary Culture Muscle Cells—Activation of AMPK, a well known fuel-sensing enzyme present in skeletal muscle, increases FAO through the inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (24Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of AMPK in α-MSH-induced FAO in skeletal muscle, C2C12 cells and primary muscle cells were treated with α-MSH and SHU9119. AMPK activity was measured after 30 min. α-MSH treatment increased AMPK activity up to 56% in C2C12 cells and up to 86% in primary culture muscle cells. SHU9119 alone also increased AMPK activity, and co-treatment with α-MSH and SHU9119 did not reduce the effects of α-MSH on AMPK activity (Fig. 5, A and B). Dominant-negative AMPK partially blocked the α-MSH-induced increase in AMPK activity in C2C12 cells (Fig. 5C). Involvement of cAMP and PKA in α-MSH-induced FAO— MCRs belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor family; they are all linked to cAMP generation via stimulatory G-proteins and adenylate cyclase. To investigate whether direct stimulation of the cAMP pathway could increase FAO, we measured palmitate oxidation and AMPK activity after treatment of C2C12 cells and primary culture muscle cells with two cAMP analogues, Bt2cAMP and 8-Br-cAMP. Both analogues significantly increased palmitate oxidation (Fig. 6, A and B) and AMPK activity (Fig. 6, C and D) in both types of cells. To further identify the role of cAMP in α-MSH-induced FAO in skeletal muscle, palmitate oxidation and AMPK activity were measured after treatment with the cAMP antagonist, (Rp)-cAMP, or the PKA inhibitor, H89, in C2C12 cells. Both (Rp)-cAMP and H89 effectively decreased α-MSH-induced palmitate oxidation (Fig. 6D) and the activation of AMPK (Fig. 6E) in C2C12 cells, suggesting an important role for cAMP and the PKA activation pathway in α-MSH-induced FAO.

https://openalex.org/W2027146263,"Human calmodulin-like protein (CLP) is an epithelial-specific protein that is expressed during cell differentiation but down-regulated in primary cancers and transformed cell lines. Using stably transfected and inducible HeLa cell lines, we found that CLP expression did not alter the proliferation rate and colony-forming potential of these cells. However, remarkable phenotypic changes were observed in CLP-expressing compared with control cells. Soft agar colonies of CLP-expressing cells had rough boundaries, with peripheral cells migrating away from the colony. Cells expressing CLP displayed a striking increase in the number and length of myosin-10-positive filopodia and showed increased mobility in a wound healing assay. This increase in wound healing capacity was prevented by small interference RNA-mediated down-regulation of myosin-10. Fluorescence microscopy and Western blotting revealed that CLP expression results in up-regulation of its target protein, myosin-10. This up-regulation occurs at the protein level by stabilization of myosin-10. Thus, CLP functions by increasing the stability of myosin-10, leading to enhanced myosin-10 function and a subsequent increase in filopodial dynamics and cell migration. In stratified epithelia, CLP may be required during terminal differentiation to increase myosin-10 function as cells migrate toward the upper layers and establish new adhesive contacts.

Strehler E.E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Yaswen P. Smoll A. Peehl D.M. Trask D.K. Sager R. Stampfer M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Like calmodulin (CaM), CLP contains four “EF-hand” Ca2+ binding motifs but has an overall Ca2+ binding affinity that is ∼10-fold lower than in CaM (4Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure indicates that Ca2+-CLP is very similar in overall shape to Ca2+-CaM, although a notable difference is observed in the angle of the central helix with respect to the N- and C-terminal lobes. Major differences are also apparent in the putative target-interacting surfaces of the two lobes, including the hydrophobic patches thought to be involved in target recognition (5Han B-G. Han M. Sui H. Yaswen P. Walian P.J. Jap B.K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Accordingly, although CLP can substitute for CaM in binding and activation of some targets (e.g. CaM kinase II), many CaM targets either bind CLP with reduced affinity or not at all (4Rhyner J.A. Koller M. Durussel-Gerber I. Cox J.A. Strehler E.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Edman C.F. George S.E. Means A.R. Schulman H. Yaswen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent data have shown that CLP interacts with unique targets, specifically with the unconventional myosin Myo-10 (7Rogers M.S. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This suggests that CLP has a physiological function distinct from that of CaM and that CLP modulates a subset of CaM-regulated proteins and/or interacts with its own specific targets. CLP is exclusively expressed in normal pseudostratified and stratified epithelia such as those of breast, prostate, and skin (3Yaswen P. Smoll A. Hosoda J. Parry G. Stampfer M.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 335-345PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rogers M.S. Foley M.A. Crotty T.B. Hartmann L.C. Ingle J.N. Roche P.C. Strehler E.E. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The developmental- and growth factor-dependent patterns of expression further suggest that CLP is involved in the terminal differentiation process of multilayered epithelia (9Rogers M.S. Kobayashi T. Pittelkow M.R. Strehler E.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but its physiological role remains unknown. To study the effect of CLP in a cellular environment, we generated tetracycline-inducible stable HeLa cell lines. We here report that CLP expression does not change the cell proliferation rate and does not affect the colony-forming potential or the colony size of cells growing in soft agar. However, colony morphology was altered, with edges being irregular and indicative of increased peripheral cell motility. CLP expression resulted in increased cell motility in a wound healing assay, and individual cells displayed more and longer filopodia with increased levels of Myo-10. Biochemical analysis revealed that CLP up-regulates Myo-10 by increasing its intracellular stability. These findings show that CLP function is mechanistically linked to Myo-10 and suggest that CLP promotes cell motility by prolonging Myo-10 function. In stratified epithelia, CLP function may be required during migration and/or adhesion of terminally differentiating cells. Materials—All cell culture media and reagents (trypsin-EDTA, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics/antimycotics) were from Invitrogen. PCR reagents, enzymes, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete mini EDTA-free) were purchased from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Sigma. X-ray films were from Eastman Kodak. Plasmid Constructions—Construct pEGFP-Myo10 was made by cloning the full-length human Myo-10 coding sequence as KpnI-XbaI fragment into pEGFP-HA-His (7Rogers M.S. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Construct pEGFP-Myo10-(1-980) was made by cloning a PCR fragment of Myo-10 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF234532) corresponding to nucleotides 223-3165 into pEGFP-HA-His. The PCR product was generated using primer Myo10F2, 5′-GTA GGT ACC ATG GAT AAC TTC TTC ACC GA-3′, containing an added KpnI site (underlined) and primer Myo10-3165R, 5′-GTT TCT AGA TGT TGG GCT TCT CCT CGC-3′ with an added XbaI site (underlined). This fragment was A-tailed using Klenow fragment (Invitrogen) cloned into the TA-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), excised using KpnI/XbaI double digestion, and then ligated into pEGFP-HA-His that had been linearized with KpnI and XbaI. To create a construct for tetracycline-inducible expression of CLP, the open reading frame of CLP was first PCR amplified using primers CLP-forward, 5′-AAG CTT CAC CCC TGG CAT-3′, (added HindIII site underlined) and CLP-reverse, 5′-CTC GAG GCC TCA CTT GG-3′ (added XhoI site underlined). The resulting fragment was TA cloned, excised by HindIII/XhoI double digestion, and ligated into HindIII/XhoI-digested pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) to generate construct pcDNA4/TO-CLP. All constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing in the Mayo Genomics Core facility. Antibodies—Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody TG7 against human CLP has been described (8Rogers M.S. Foley M.A. Crotty T.B. Hartmann L.C. Ingle J.N. Roche P.C. Strehler E.E. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (MX-117) against bovine Myo-10 HMM was a generous gift from Dr. Richard Cheney (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and has been described (10Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against β-actin and GFP were from Sigma and Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), respectively, and monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibodies were from RDI (Concord, MA). Rhodamine-phalloidin and all secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were from Invitrogen. Secondary antibodies for Western blotting were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A polyclonal antibody against human Myo-10 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 936-953 of the protein (NCBI accession number AAF37875). The peptide (RAAQEFLESLNFDEIDEC) was synthesized in the Mayo Proteomics Core and attached via its C-terminal Cys residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin before use as antigen. Antisera were raised in two rabbits maintained and treated at Cocalico, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). Antibodies were affinity purified by chromatography over Sepharose coupled to a fusion protein of the antigenic peptide with bovine serum albumin. Affinity-purified antibodies were stored at a concentration of ∼0.15 μg/μl. Cell Cultures and Transfections—HeLa cells stable for the expression of the tetracycline repressor protein were obtained from Invitrogen and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, l-glutamine, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate with pyridoxine hydrochloride (11995-065; Invitrogen), as well as 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml G418 (to maintain Tet-repressor expression). Control HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and grown in minimal essential medium with balanced Earle's salts and l-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate (11095-080; Invitrogen), and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were maintained with antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For immunolocalization and fluorescence microscopy, cells were grown on glass coverslips in 12-well plates. 50-70% confluent cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/6-cm dish using Lipofectin™ and Plus™ (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Generation of Stably Transfected Cell Clones—HeLa cells were transfected with the CLP expression vector pcDNA4/TO-CLP, and stable transfectants were selected in medium containing Zeocin (3 μg/ml) as recommended by the supplier of the T-REx system (Invitrogen). Control clones were established by transfection with an empty pcDNA4/TO vector. After 6-10 days in selection medium, surviving clones were isolated using cloning cylinders and expanded for storage and further analysis. Clones were tested for the induction of CLP in the presence of 0.25 μg/ml doxycycline or tetracycline (Sigma). Cells in passages 8-20 were used in this study. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—Cells in culture dishes were rinsed twice with cold Ca2+-/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Invitrogen) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (aprotinin, leupeptin, pefabloc, and pepstatin). Cells were scraped, pelleted, and used immediately or stored at -80 °C until further use. Cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the pellets in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors and lysed by pipetting up and down on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 × g. Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using the BCA assay (Pierce). Appropriate amounts of protein were mixed with NuPAGE electrophoresis buffer in the presence of reducing agents and antioxidants and heated to 70 °C for 15 min, followed by separation in denaturing 4-12% NuPAGE gradient gels following the recommendations of the supplier (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures (11Gallagher S. Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrell J.G.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to improve the detection of CLP (9Rogers M.S. Kobayashi T. Pittelkow M.R. Strehler E.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk in CaTBST (2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) prior to incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody diluted in CaTBST plus 5% nonfat dry milk. The following primary antibodies were used: TG7 (anti-CLP) at 0.2 μg/ml, MX-117 (anti-bovine Myo-10) at 1 μg/ml, Myo10 2-2 (anti-human Myo-10) at 1:2,000, and anti-GFP at 1:2,000. In addition, some blots were reprobed with an anti-β-actin antibody (1:1,000) or anti-GAPDH (1:3,000) as a housekeeping protein marker to ensure equal protein loading. Following exposure to primary antibodies, the blots were rinsed in CaTBST, incubated for 1 h in horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000), rinsed again in CaTBST, and processed using the ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription PCR of Myo-10 mRNA—Total RNA was prepared from control and CLP-expressing HeLa cells using the RNAeasy mini spin kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's protocol for mammalian cells grown in a monolayer. cDNA was generated using 1 μg of total RNA and random hexamer oligonucleotides and Superscipt III (Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription PCR; Invitrogen). PCR was performed using 1 μl of cDNA in a 25-μl volume containing 5 pmol each of specific Myo-10 primers Myo10-2102F (5′-GCT CCT CTA ATC CTT TCT T-3′) and Myo10-2675R (5′-TTG CTC CCT TTC TCT GC-3′) or primers specific for β-actin (sense 5′-GCT CGT CGT CGA CAA CGG CTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAA ACA TGA TCT GGG TCA TCT TCT C-3′) (Invitrogen), 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 1.5 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, and Taq polymerase in 1× reaction buffer (Invitrogen). Touchdown PCR was done by 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C followed by annealing for 60 s at 66 °C and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. Annealing temperature was lowered by 2 °C for 5 cycles, and 15 to 35 additional cycles were then performed to determine the linear phase of amplification. After a final extension of 5 min, the samples were cooled to 4 °C and aliquots run on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Cell Proliferation Assay—Control and CLP-expressing cells were plated at 103 cells/well on 96-well plates and grown under standard conditions in the continued presence of selective anti-biotics and of 0.25 μg/ml doxycycline (as appropriate). Samples were counted every day for 3-4 days using a colorimetric MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell proliferation assay (ACTC) according to the manufacturer's instructions and optimized for these cell types. At the time of assay, 100 μl of tetrazolium salt reagent (as supplied) was added to each well and incubated for 30 min under standard cell culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). The reaction was halted by the addition of 200 μl of extracting reagent (as supplied) and incubated overnight in the dark. The samples were then analyzed using a microplate (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) reader at 600 nm. The A600 values determined for each sample were then compared with a standard curve for each cell type, and cell numbers/well were calculated and plotted as a function of the number of days in culture ± S.D. Colony-forming Assay—To assay for contact-independent growth in soft agar, 10-cm gridded Petri dishes were first coated with 1.5 ml of a base agar consisting of 0.5% agar B (Difco) in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium bicarbonate, and antibiotic/antimycotic). Control and CLP-expressing cells (± doxycycline) were trypsinized, counted using a hemocytometer, and then resuspended at low density (5,000 cells/1.5 ml) in 0.35% agar B in culture medium with or without doxycycline kept at ∼40 °C. After pouring into the 10-cm dishes containing base agar, the immobilized cells were grown for 14 days in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Plates were stained with 0.005% crystal violet in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Colonies were then photographed at low magnification (×10 objective) using a side port-mounted Sensi-Cam QE CCD camera (Cooke Corp., Auburn Hills, MI) and were then counted and measured using IP-Lab software. Wound Healing Assay—Cells were grown to confluence on gridded plastic dishes, and monolayers were then wounded by scratching with a 10-μl pipette tip. Inducible HeLa cells were preincubated for 24 h with doxycycline to induce maximal CLP expression before wounding. Wounds were photographed under the microscope (×20 objective) and their coordinates recorded. The same wounds were photographed again 8 h later. The area of the wound covered by cells was measured using IP-Lab software. Briefly, a region of interest was drawn to encompass the wound area free of cells. This area was calculated for at least eight independent wounds on three separate plates at times 0 and 8 h post-wounding with and without induced CLP expression. Cell migration into the wound was then calculated as the area of the wound covered after 8 h on each side of the wound ((area at 0 h - area at 8 h)/2). Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Untransfected and transiently transfected cells grown on glass coverslips for 24-72 h were washed with warm DPBS + Ca2+/Mg2+ (DPBS + CM; Invitrogen) and fixed for 15 min at 37 °C in 0.1 m PIPES, 1.0 mm EGTA, 3.0 mm MgSO4, and 4% paraformaldehyde (Tousimis, Rockville, MD) diluted in DPBS + CM, pH 6.95. Following three 3-min washes in DPBS + CM, cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X in DPBS + CM for 2 min. After washing with DPBS + CM, the cells were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in DPBS + CM containing 5% normal goat serum, 15% bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 0.04% sodium azide (blocking buffer) and were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Anti-Myo10-HMM MX-117 was used at 5 μg/ml. After washing three times for 10 min in DPBS + CM, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in darkness with the appropriate secondary antibody (1 μg/ml Alexa-488 goat anti-rabbit IgG; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 25 ng/ml rhodamine-phalloidin diluted in blocking buffer. To stain nuclei, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes) was also added to the secondary antibody application at 20 μg/ml. Following incubation, cells were washed three times for 10 min with DPBS + CM and once with dH2O, and coverslips were mounted onto slides using Prolong mounting medium (Invitrogen). Confocal micrographs were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 and captured using Zeiss LSM 510 software. Images were imported and edited using Adobe Photoshop. Filopodia Measurements—Filopodia were documented under epifluorescence illumination on low density cultures of live cells expressing GFP-tagged Myo-10 or of fixed cells stained for indirect immunofluorescence with antibody against Myo-10. To determine the number of filopodia, all filopodial extensions longer than 2 μm were counted on 10 individual cells/sample, and the average/cell was calculated ± S.E. To calculate the average filopodial length, the distance from the cell base to the tip was determined for all filopodia (>2 μm) of at least three separate cells in each sample (a total of 100 filopodia were analyzed/sample), and the average calculated per filopodium ± S.E. Myosin-10 Down-regulation by siRNA—Three Stealth™siRNAs specific to Myo-10 and a control siRNA were purchased from Invitrogen (MYO10-HSS106909, MYO10-HSS106910, MYO10-HSS106911, and P/N 46-2002) and were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates or gridded 10-cm dishes in 2 ml of regular growth medium without any antibiotics so the cells would be 50-60% confluent at the time of transfection. For transfection, 100 pmol of siRNA oligomer were diluted in 250 μl of Opti-MEM™ (Invitrogen). 5 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 were diluted in 250 μl of Opti-MEM™ and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before mixing with the diluted siRNA. The siRNA-Lipofectamine™ 2000 mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then added to the cells. After 8 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with growth medium containing antibiotics. Cells were then assayed 24-48 h post-transfection (wound healing followed by Western blotting). Expression of CLP Does Not Change the Proliferation Rate of HeLa Cells—CLP is down-regulated or absent in transformed cells, suggesting its expression may be incompatible with the transformed phenotype. We used the inducible T-REx system to generate stable HeLa cell clones in which CLP expression is repressed in the absence of tetracycline (or its analog doxycycline) but can be turned on upon addition of the inducing agent. Several clones were selected for further study (Fig. 1). Interestingly, one clone (clone 12) expressed CLP constitutively even in the absence of tetracycline and maintained this property through repeated cell passages. The amount of CLP expression in the stable HeLa clones was compared with endogenous levels of CLP in human keratinocytes and to a standard curve of purified CLP as shown in Fig. 1. Clone 12 expressed the highest amount of CLP (∼3% of the total soluble protein), more than 3-fold the level in 4-day keratinocytes. The other clones (e.g. clone TO12.2, see Fig. 1) expressed a more moderate amount of CLP comparable with the amounts in normal non-differentiating human keratinocytes. To determine the effects of CLP expression on the phenotype of HeLa cells, we performed a series of assays with several independent stable and inducible clones, which yielded comparable results for each cell line. Growth curves were first established for stable transfected control cells that do not express CLP (clone 20) and cells that express CLP at very high levels (clone 12). As shown in Fig. 2A, no significant difference was seen in the proliferation rate of control and CLP-expressing cells. Similarly, no difference in proliferation rate was seen in inducible HeLa clones grown in the absence (no CLP expression) or presence (CLP expressed) of doxycycline (Fig. 2B). Thus, HeLa cells expressing CLP proliferate normally and at rates similar to their non-expressing counterparts. CLP Expression Alters the Morphology of Soft Agar Colonies, but Not the Colony-forming Potential of HeLa Cells—Although CLP appears to have little effect on the proliferation rate of HeLa cells, it may affect their anchorage-independent growth capacity. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells constitutively expressing CLP (clone 12) or induced to express CLP (clone TO-12.2 + doxycycline) formed comparable numbers of soft agar colonies as cells lacking CLP. Furthermore, the colony sizes were similar (Fig. 3B). However, we noticed a distinct difference in the morphology of colonies formed by cells that express CLP (Fig. 3C). CLP-expressing colonies had irregular, diffuse-looking boundaries with numerous individual cells seeming to stray away from the colony edge. By contrast, colonies formed in the absence of CLP expression were more smooth-edged and regular. CLP Enhances Wound Healing by Promoting Increased Cell Migration—The colony-forming assay indicated that CLP expression might affect cell migration. Therefore, a wound healing assay was used as a standard test to compare cell migration in CLP-expressing and control cells. Fig. 4A shows a representative example with cells from HeLa clone TO-12.2. Cells induced with doxycycline migrated into the wound significantly faster than cells without CLP induction. Western blotting confirmed that the doxycycline-induced cells indeed expressed CLP (Fig. 4B). Quantitative measurements of the wound area remaining open after 8 h showed that CLP-expressing cells had covered an area ∼1.7 times greater than cells that did not express CLP (Fig. 4C). The improved wound healing capacity of CLP-expressing cells appears to be due to their increased motility and directional migration into the open space. Within minutes of wounding, CLP-expressing cells at the wound edge assumed an elongated shape and extended protrusions toward the wound. By contrast, control cells were oriented more randomly and contained fewer directional protrusions toward the wound (not shown). CLP Expression Increases the Number and Length of Myosin-10 Containing Filopodia—Unconventional myosin-10 is a specific target protein of CLP (7Rogers M.S. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12182-12189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Myo-10 is involved in filopodia extension and intrafilopodial motility (13Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14Tokuo H. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Zhang H. Berg J.S. Li Z. Wang Y. Lång P. Sousa A.D. Bhaskar A. Cheney R.E. Strömblad S. Nature Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the increased motility of CLP-expressing HeLa cells in the wound healing assay might be mediated by Myo-10. To visualize Myo-10 containing filopodia, we transfected HeLa cells from clone 20 (lacking CLP) and clone 12 (expressing high levels of CLP) with EGFP-Myo10. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, CLP-expressing cells displayed a striking increase in the number of Myo-10-positive filopodia compared with control cells lacking CLP. In addition, the average length of the filopodia was significantly greater in CLP-expressing cells. A quantitative evaluation of these observations is shown in Fig. 5B. Taken together, the results suggest that CLP acts on Myo-10 to induce more and longer filopodia in the cell. CLP Increases Filopodia-dependent Cell Motility by Stabilizing Myosin-10 Expression—In addition to the “starburst” pattern of EGFP-Myo10-labeled filopodia in the CLP-expressing cells, we observed that the overall level of Myo-10 fluorescence was consistently higher in these cells than in the control cells lacking CLP. This was unexpected because identical transfection conditions were used for all cells. To examine this further, we used an affinity-purified antibody against Myo-10 (MX-117, a gift from Dr. Richard Cheney) to determine the level of endogenous myosin-10 in control (clone 20) or CLP-expressing cells (clone 12). The results (Fig. 6A) show a striking increase in endogenous Myo-10 in CLP-expressing cells. We corroborated these data by Western blotting for endogenous Myo-10. Fig. 6B shows that endogenous Myo-10 was rapidly up-regulated following CLP induction in stably transfected HeLa cells. Within 2 h of induction, the amount of Myo-10 was significantly increased from basal levels and remained elevated for the duration of the experiment. To show that this is not due to CLP-mediated transcriptional up-regulation, but rather to stabilization of the Myo-10 protein, we transfected regular HeLa cells with recombinant EGFP-Myo10-(1-980) either alone or together with CLP. EGFP-Myo10-(1-980) encodes a GFP-tagged truncated Myo-10 fragment consisting of amino acids 1-980 that contains the CLP-binding “neck” domain but lacks the C-terminal half of the molecule. Fig. 6C shows that cells co-transfected with CLP contained significantly higher levels of EGFP-Myo10-(1-980) than cells transfected with EGFP-Myo10-(1-980) al"
https://openalex.org/W2010014912,"The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, is a key regulator of melanocyte proliferation and differentiation and a determinant of pigmentation, skin phototype, and skin cancer risk. MC1R activation stimulates melanogenesis and increases the ratio of black, strongly photoprotective eumelanins to yellowish and poorly photoprotective pheomelanin pigments. Desensitization and internalization are key regulatory mechanisms of GPCR signaling. Agonist-induced desensitization usually depends on phosphorylation by a GPCR kinase (GRK) followed by receptor internalization in endocytic vesicles. We have shown that MC1R desensitization is mediated by two GRKs expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells, GRK2 and GRK6. Here we show that in contrast with this dual specificity for desensitization, GRK6 but not GRK2 mediated MC1R internalization. Mutagenesis studies suggested that the targets of GRK6 are two residues located in the MC1R cytosolic C terminus, Thr-308 and Ser-316. A T308D/S316D mutant mimicking their phosphorylated state was constitutively desensitized and associated with endosomes, whereas a T308A/S316A mutant was resistant to desensitization and internalization. We studied the desensitization and internalization of three variant MC1R forms associated with red hair and increased skin cancer risk: R151C, R160W, and D294H. These variants showed a less efficient desensitization. Moreover, D294H was resistant to internalization, thus accounting for its abnormally high surface expression. Co-expression of variant and wild type MC1R modified its desensitization and internalization behavior. These data suggest that MC1R might be regulated by novel mechanisms including differential effects of GRKs and altered desensitization rates of certain allelic combinations.

Newton R.A. Beaumont K.A. Helen L.J. Sturm R.A. Pigm. Cell Res. 2006; 19: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Within melanocytes, MC1R regulates the amount and type of pigment production and is a major determinant of skin phototype, sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced damage, and skin cancer risk (2Rees J.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 75: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interaction with its ligands, α melanocyte-stimulating hormone (αMSH) or adrenocorticotropin, stimulates cAMP synthesis via the Gs protein. cAMP is responsible for most if not all the melanogenic actions of αMSH (3Busca R. Ballotti R. Pigm. Cell Res. 2000; 13: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). These include activation of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin biosynthesis, and a switch from the production of light-colored and poorly photoprotective pheomelanins to synthesis of darker and more photoprotective eumelanins (4Ito S. Wakamatsu K. Pigm. Cell Res. 2003; 16: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Tyrosinase activation occurs mainly at the transcriptional level and is mediated by induction of microphthalmia, a helix-loophelix transcription factor (5Vance K.W. Goding C.R. Pigm. Cell Res. 2004; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Melanin synthesis is confined in specialized organelles called melanosomes. The super-potent MC1R agonist norleucine 4 d-phenylalanine-7-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (NDP-MSH) also increases the number and size of melanosomes in mouse melanoma cells (6Martinez-Esparza M. Ferrer C. Castells M.T. Garcia-Borron J.C. Zuasti A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that MC1R signaling could stimulate melanosome biogenesis.More than 60 non-conservative natural mutations of human MC1R have been reported (7Garcia-Borron J.C. Sanchez-Laorden B.L. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Pigm. Cell Res. 2005; 18: 393-410PubMed Google Scholar). Population studies demonstrated that several variant alleles are associated with red hair and fair skin (the RHC phenotype) (8Box N.F. Wyeth J.R. O'Gorman L.E. Martin N.G. Sturm R.A. Hum. Mol.

Three frequent RHC alleles, R151C, R160W, and D294H, show odds ratios for red hair ranging from 50 to 120 (12Duffy D.L. Box N.F. Chen W. Palmer J.S. Montgomery G.W. James M.R. Hayward N.K.

These allelic variants are also associated with increased risk for melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers (14Sturm R.A. Duffy D.L. Box N.F. Chen W. Smit D.J. Brown D.L. Stow J.L. Leonard J.H.

Interestingly, this association seems at least partially independent on the effect on skin pigmentation and has been related with the ability of wild type (WT) MC1R, but not of the RHC variants, to activate DNA repair mechanisms after UV exposure (18Kadekaro A.L. Kavanagh R. Kanto H. Terzieva S. Hauser J. Kobayashi N. Schwemberger S. Cornelius J. Babcock G. Shertzer H.G. Scott G. Abdel-Malek Z.A.

Although it is widely agreed that the R151C, R160W, and D294H variant receptors correspond to diminished function forms, the degree of functional impairment and its molecular basis are not well understood. Therefore, the identification of the factors accounting for the genetic association between the RHC variants, the RHC phenotype, and skin cancer risk is a major area of research in skin biology.MC1R is desensitized upon minutes of exposure to melanocortin agonists (20Sanchez-Mas J. Guillo L.A. Zanna P. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Garcia-Borron J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1035-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but no data are available on the desensitization of the penetrant RHC alleles R151C, R160W, and D294H. MC1R desensitization is likely mediated by GRK2 or GRK6, two GRKs expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells. GRK6 seems more potent than GRK2 in that it is able to inhibit both constitutive and agonist-induced MC1R signaling, whereas GRK2 only inhibits agonist-dependent function. Phosphorylation of GPCRs by the GRKs is normally followed by recruitment of β-arrestins and endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits. This process may trigger new signaling events (21Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Internalization may target the receptor for degradation or be followed by recycling back to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, MC1R has a high agonist-independent constitutive activity (23Sanchez-Mas J. Hahmann C. Gerritsen I. Garcia-Borron J.C. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Pigm. Cell Res. 2004; 17: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it is, therefore, possible that the receptor may undergo constitutive endocytosis. Accordingly, it can be hypothesized that altered receptor desensitization, internalization, and/or recycling may cause changes in the level of MC1R cell surface expression. Interestingly, reduced cell surface expression has been shown for R151C and R160W expressed in heterologous systems, whereas D294H displayed a higher plasma membrane expression than WT (24Beaumont K.A.

Dermatol. 2006; 126: 172-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).GRK-dependent desensitization of GPCRs is carried out by phosphorylation of specific serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residues, most often located in the cytosolic C-terminal extension of the receptor protein or in the second and third intracellular loops (26Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 27Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pao C.S. Benovic J.L. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : E42Google Scholar). Interestingly, many well characterized RHC mutations impinge residues located in the second intracellular loop (7Garcia-Borron J.C. Sanchez-Laorden B.L. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Pigm. Cell Res. 2005; 18: 393-410PubMed Google Scholar). MC1R displays eight potential phosphorylation targets for the loose specificity GRKs (Fig. 1) of which three are located in the second intracellular loop in the vicinity of residues mutated in RHC forms and four cluster in the short C-terminal tail. The phosphorylation sites responsible for MC1R desensitization have not yet been identified. Here we have studied MC1R internalization as related to homologous desensitization, and we have compared the desensitization and internalization of WT and RHC alleles. We report that internalization is partially mediated by GRK6. We show that two residues located in the cytosolic C terminus of MC1R, Thr-308 and Ser-316, are the most likely GRK targets. Finally, we also show significantly different desensitization and internalization rates for the variant RHC alleles as compared with WT.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—A radioimmunoassay kit for cAMP and 125I-labeled NDP-MSH (2000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences.

HEK293 cells were grown in 12-well dishes using RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells grown to 75% confluence were transfected with 0.3 μg of plasmid and Lipofectamine. For cotransfections, 0.15 μg of each plasmid was employed unless specified otherwise. HBL and LND1 human melanoma cells (a gift from Prof. G. Ghanem, Free University of Brussels, Belgium) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. Stable transfectants derived from HBL cells have been already described (20Sanchez-Mas J. Guillo L.A. Zanna P. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Garcia-Borron J.C. Mol.

Garcia-Borron J.C. Mol.

Mayor Jr. (Madrid, Spain). The Rab5-EGFP and Rab7-EGFP constructs were a gift from Dr. Miguel Seabra (Imperial College, London, UK). The QuikChange mutagenesis kit was employed to generate one or two codon changes in the constructs next specified. A GRK6 dominant-negative mutant (32Lazari M.F. Liu X. Nakamura K. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 866-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was obtained by double mutagenesis using the human GRK6 plasmid as template and a pair of primers to convert Lys-215 and Lys-216 to Met. This mutant was designed GRK6-K215R/K216R. The 8 intracellular Ser and Thr residues present in MC1R (Ser-71, Ser-145, Ser-154, Thr-157, Thr-302, Thr-308, Thr-314, and Ser-316, Fig. 1) were independently mutated to either Ala or Asp to abolish or mimic (respectively) phosphorylation in these positions. Double mutants T308A/S316A and T308D/S316D were prepared using as template one single mutant and the pair of primers for the other residue. The sequences of mutagenic primers are provided as supplemental Table 1. After mutation, the coding sequence of all mutants was excised from the plasmid using the cloning enzymes (HindIII and EcoRI), and the inserts were subcloned into empty pcDNA3 to avoid undesirable mutations in the plasmid sequence. All cDNAs were verified by automated sequencing of both strands.Binding and Internalization Assays—Cells were serum-deprived at least 3 h before ligand addition. Radioligand binding assays were done with 10-10 M 125I-labeled NDP-MSH and increasing concentrations of unlabeled NDP-MSH up to 10-7 m when required (33Jimenez-Cervantes C. Germer S. Gonzalez P. Sanchez J. Sanchez C.O. Garcia-Borron J.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For internalization assays, an acid wash protocol was employed (34Martin N.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45954-45959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 125I-labeled NDP-MSH and isotopically diluted to achieve a final concentration of 10-9 m corresponding to ∼100,000 counts for 1.5 h (unless otherwise specified). Cells were then washed with cold serum-free RPMI followed by two 2-3-min ice-cold acid washes with 0.5 ml of 50 mm glycine and 150 mm NaCl, pH 3.0. The acid washes were pooled and counted to determine the amount of bound ligand remaining on the cell surface. Cells were then collected with 0.5 ml of trypsin (10 mg/ml) and counted to determine the amount of internalized receptor. An internalization index was calculated that represents the percentage of internalized ligand relative to the total bound ligand.cAMP Assays—Cells were grown in 12-well plates, transfected as required, and serum-deprived for 24 h. They were then incubated with NDP-MSH (10-7 m unless specified otherwise) for 30 min and 3 h depending on the experiment. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were quickly washed with 800 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Stimulated cells were lysed with 350 μl of preheated 0.1 n HCl (70 °C) per well and carefully scraped. The mix was freeze-dried, washed with 100 μl of H2O, and freeze-dried again. cAMP was measured with a commercial radioimmunoassay as per instructions. Parallel dishes were used for protein determination performed with the bicinchoninic acid method.Western Blot—Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and solubilized in 200 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm iodoacetamide). Samples were centrifuged (105,000 × g, 30 min), and a volume of supernatant containing 10 μg of protein was mixed (2:1 ratio) with electrophoresis sample buffer (180 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 9% SDS, 0.075% bromphenol blue, and 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol). Electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described (20Sanchez-Mas J. Guillo L.A. Zanna P. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Garcia-Borron J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1035-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Sanchez-Laorden B.L. Sanchez-Mas J. Martinez-Alonso E. Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Garcia-Borron J.C. Jimenez-Cervantes C. J.

Blots were probed with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate and stained with a chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Comparable loading was ascertained by stripping and reprobing the membranes with an anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 antibody. Stripping was performed by washing the membranes with PBS followed by treatment with 0.5 n NaOH for 10 min at room temperature and a final 10-min wash with PBS.Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the FLAG epitope-labeled WT or mutant MC1R constructs. In some experiments cells were co-transfected with MC1R variants and Rab5-EGFP or Rab7-EGFP (35Ali B.R. Wasmeier C. Lamoreux L. Strom M. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6401-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), used as a markers for endosomal vesicles. 24 h after transfection cells were serum deprived and incubated with 10-7 M NDP-MSH if needed. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% IGEPAL if required. Cells were then labeled with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:7000) followed by an Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibody unless specified otherwise. For co-localization of FLAG-MC1R and tyrosinase, cells treated as above were incubated simultaneously with the anti-FLAG monoclonal (1:7000) and αPEP7h (1:1500) followed by Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (both from Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Samples were mounted by standard procedures using a mounting medium from DakoCytomation and examined with a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope.Statistics—Unless otherwise specified, results are given as the mean ± S.E. for experiments performed at least 4 times, with independent duplicates or triplicates (n ≥ 8). Statistical significance was assessed with an unpaired Student's t test performed with the GraphPad Prism package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSGRK6 Promotes MC1R Internalization—In HEK293 cells transfected with WT MC1R, agonist treatment (NDP-MSH, 10-7 m) mediated a rapid and strong increase in cAMP. Maximal cAMP levels were obtained ∼30 min after addition of agonist and then decreased due to MC1R desensitization (20Sanchez-Mas J. Guillo L.A. Zanna P. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Garcia-Borron J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1035-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Sanchez-Mas J. Hahmann C. Gerritsen I. Garcia-Borron J.C. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Pigm. Cell Res. 2004; 17: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We used a functional receptor construct labeled with a FLAG epitope at the N terminus (25Sanchez-Laorden B.L. Sanchez-Mas J.

Dermatol. 2006; 126: 172-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to analyze MC1R cellular location during desensitization by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 2A). Staining of cells with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody showed a change of receptor distribution upon agonist treatment from a preferential location on the plasma membrane to a punctate intracellular staining indicative of receptor internalization in endocytic vesicles. Receptor sequestration away from the plasma membrane persisted for at least 90 min in the presence of agonist. The extent and rate of internalization were measured by following the appearance of acid-resistant binding (34Martin N.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45954-45959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). More than 36% of the bound ligand was internalized in the first hour of incubation (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Agonist-promoted internalization of MC1R in HEK293 cells. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with FLAG epitope-labeled MC1R and stimulated with NDP-MSH (10-7 m) for the times shown. The distribution of MC1R in permeabilized cells was visualized by confocal microscopy. B, internalization assay performed on MC1R-transfected HEK293 cells. Transfected cells were incubated with 125I-labeled NDP-MSH and isotopically diluted to achieve a final concentration of 10-9 m and 105 counts for the times shown. After the acid wash protocol (performed as described under “Experimental Procedures”), the radioactivity corresponding to radioligand bound on the cell surface (squares) or internalized (triangles) was measured. The internalization index (circles) represents the percentage of ligand internalized respect to total bound radioligand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We analyzed MC1R desensitization and internalization in a more physiological environment using two human melanoma cell lines, HBL and LND1, that express wild type MC1R (17Sanchez M.J.

Cells were treated with 10-7 m NDP-MSH, and cAMP was determined 30 min and 3 h after the challenge. The ratio of cAMP concentration at these time points is indicative of receptor desensitization (20Sanchez-Mas J. Guillo L.A. Zanna P. Jimenez-Cervantes C. Garcia-Borron J.C. Mol.

MC1R desensitization was efficient in HBL and LND1 melanoma cells, as shown by decreased cAMP levels at longer incubation times (Fig. 3A), thus confirming previous results (20Sanchez-Mas J.

To estimate the rate and extent of MC1R internalization, we used a clone of HBL human melanoma cells enriched in WT MC1R by stable transfection (clone HBL-20). This clone expresses a high density of plasma membrane melanocortin binding sites, thus facilitating accurate measurements of binding parameters (30Mas J.S. Gerritsen I. Hahmann C.

In resting cells, MC1R was present on the plasma membrane, in the perinuclear region, most likely corresponding to newly synthesized MC1R molecules located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in intracellular vesicles likely associated with receptor molecules in transit to or from the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). The addition of the agonist caused a redistribution of receptor molecules from the plasma membrane to internal vesicles, evidenced by the fading of plasma membrane staining and the intensification of the labeling of intracellular vesicles. The kinetics of these changes were similar to those described in Fig. 2A, further supporting the use of HEK293 cells as a suitable heterologous model. Early work suggested that endogenous Mc1r expressed in mouse melanoma cells internalized to melanosomes after agonist binding (40Orlow S.J. Hotchki"

Here, we investigated the biological effects of MLL.AF4, AF4.MLL or the combination of both reciprocal fusion proteins in a conditional in vitro cell culture model system. Several parameters like cell growth, cell cycling capacity, apoptotic behavior and growth transformation were investigated under physiological and stress conditions. Co-transfected cells displayed the highest resistance against apoptotic triggers, cell cycling capacity and loss-of-contact inhibition. These analyses were complemented by gene expression profiling experiments and specific gene signatures were established for each of the three cell lines. Interestingly, co-transfected cells strongly upregulate the homeobox gene Nanog. In combination with Oct4, the Nanog homeoprotein is steering maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. Transcription of Nanog and other stem cell factors, like Oct4 and Bmi1, was verified in biopsy material of t(4;11) patient cells which express both reciprocal t(4;11) fusion genes. In conclusion, the presence of both reciprocal MLL fusion proteins confers biological properties known from t(4;11) leukemia, suggesting that each of the two fusion proteins contribute specific properties and, in combination, also synergistic effects to the leukemic phenotype."

As proteins activated in the HER2/Ras/Raf/ERK pathway, the MNKs are of potential interest in HER2-overexpressing cancers. We utilized a panel of breast cell lines (HCC1419, AU565, SKBR3, MCF7, and MCF10A), three of which overexpress HER2, to characterize the amounts and activation status of MNKs and other pathway enzymes (ERKs and RSKs) in these cells. We generated a phosphospecific antibody to Thr(P)-214 in the T-loop of MNKs and found that phosphorylations of both Thr-209 and Thr-214 in human MNK1 are required for activation.

Biol. 2004; 24: 6539-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and only recently has a MNK1 function been shown in translation of cytokines (2.Buxade M. Parra J.L. Rousseau S. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Morrice N. Bain J. Espel E. Proud C.G. Immunity. 2005; 23: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Likewise, there are still large gaps in our understanding of how MNKs are regulated by MAP kinases. Human MNK1 was cloned as a novel substrate for ERK1, and the phosphorylation site identified was Thr-334 in the C terminus (3.Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar).MNK1 and MNK2 contain a canonical Thr-Pro motif for MAPKAP kinases in the T-loop, nine residues N-terminal to the conserved APE motif. Phosphorylation of the canonical Thr-Pro motif is required for activation of the RSK C-terminal domain (4.Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), the MSK1 C-terminal domain (5.McCoy C.E. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Bloomberg G.B. Arthur J.S. Biochem.

For these MAPKAP kinases, the canonical phosphorylation is the only phosphorylation required in the T-loop. However, MNK1 and MNK2 have atypical T-loops as the DFG motif is replaced by DFD, and in the only structures available (MNK2 (7.Jauch R. Jakel S. Netter C. Schreiter K. Aicher B. Jackle H. Wahl M.C. Structure (Lond.). 2005; 13: 1559-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), the MNK T-loop has out-in conformations requiring a conformational switch to coordinate with Mg2+/ATP. In the T-loop of MNKs, there is a second Thr-Pro motif, which is conserved even in Drosophila melanogaster Mnk (7.Jauch R. Jakel S. Netter C. Schreiter K. Aicher B. Jackle H. Wahl M.C. Structure (Lond.). 2005; 13: 1559-1568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The double alanine mutant of huMNK1 is inactive (T209A/T214A), and the T-loop is phosphorylated at both sites, as assessed by Thr to Ser mutations, peptide mapping, and phosphoamino acid analyses of resolved peptides (8.Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The available phosphospecific antibody (Cell Signaling) was made to a proprietary phosphopeptide containing both Thr-209/Thr-214 phospho-sites. The role of the canonical Thr-214 site, in particular, has not been deconvoluted and deserves more study. We investigated regulation of MNK phosphorylation with a phosphospecific antibody we generated for the canonical Thr-214–Pro as well as the available phospho-Mnk1 (Thr-197/202) antibody (Cell Signaling).Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (also known as ERBb2/Neu) is frequently overexpressed and/or mutated in aggressive breast cancers (9.Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. Ann. Oncol. 2001; 12: 9-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). HER2 is the molecular target of trastuzumab (Herceptin™). Trastuzumab is initially effective, but loss of activity during prolonged treatment has been reported (10.Nahta R. Esteva F.J. Cancer Lett. 2006; 232: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), an indication that additional therapeutic targets must be identified. We studied MNK1 and MNK2 and selected MAP kinase signaling pathways in a panel consisting of three cell lines that overexpress HER2 (HCC1419, AU565, and SKBR3), a cancer line that expresses HER2 (MCF7), and immortalized but nontumorigenic MCF10A cells for comparisons. The ERK pathway is altered in breast cancer cell lines that overexpress HER2, some by protein content and all by phosphorylation. MNK1 and MNK2 have increased and sustained activation in HER2-overexpressing cells, and treatment of AU565 cells with the MNK inhibitor CGP 57380 reduces colony formation in soft agar. This result identifies MNKs as therapeutic targets for breast cancers that have increased activation of the MNKs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents−Human cell lines MCF10A, MCF7, and HER2-overexpressing lines HCC1419, AU565, and SKBR3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The bicistronic plasmid for active ERK2 is from Melanie Cobb (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) (12.Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The bicistronic vector for active p38 was described previously (6.Chrestensen C.A. Schroeder M.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pelo J.W. Worthington M.T. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10176-10184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The construct for Escherichia coli expression of His6-human MNK1 was described (13.Tschopp C.

Curt Hagedorn (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas, Kansas City) generously provided eIF4E protein. Antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling Technology are as follows: dual phospho-Mnk1 (Thr-197/202) (catalog number 2111), phospho-eIF4E (Ser-209) (catalog number 9741), and active p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182) (catalog number 9211); antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology are as follows: MNK1 C20 (catalog number 6965), MNK2 S20 (catalog number 6964), RSK1 C-21 (catalog number 231-G), RSK2 C-19 (catalog number 1430), and p38 N-20 (catalog number 728-G) all goat antibodies and mouse anti-ERK2 monoclonal antibody (catalog number 1647). The HER2 antibody (21N) (catalog number RB-103) was from Lab Vision Corp. FLAG antibody (M2) was from Sigma (catalog number F-3165). Phospho-ERK antibody was produced for us by Promega to a proprietary immunogen. Purified mouse anti-ERK1 monoclonal antibody (catalog number 554100) was from BD Biosciences, and the monoclonal actin antibody (catalog number 69100) was from MP Biochemicals, antibody to eIF4E (rabbit) was a generous gift from Dr. John C. Lawrence (University of Virginia).Phosphospecific Antibodies−For the Thr(P)-214 immunogen (biotin-PELTT*PCGSAE), the phosphopeptide was synthesized with N-terminal biotin and photoconjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antisera were produced in rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). Antibodies were affinity-purified on affinity columns of Thr(P)-214 immunogen peptide immobilized on streptavidin beads. After extensive washing, bound antibodies were eluted with low pH glycine, quickly neutralized, and then equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline by dialysis, concentrated, and frozen in aliquots for storage at –70 °C.Reconstitution of MNK Activation in E. coli−MNK1 (accession number AB000409) was cloned into the plasmid pACYC184 to generate pAC-pET huMNK1. As described previously (6.Chrestensen C.A. Schroeder M.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pelo J.W. Worthington M.T. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10176-10184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the pAC-pET plasmids are a hybrid of the pET41 vector from the T7 promoter to the T7 terminator into pACYC184, a vector with a p15 origin of replication compatible for co-expression with the bicistronic plasmids that have ColE1 origin(s) of replication. The bicistronic plasmid expresses either MEK6EE and p38α or MEK1 R4F and ERK2.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection−Breast cancer cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in medium described by the ATCC. Serum starvation entailed two washes and then incubation of the cells with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with high glucose. For most of the assays described here, the cells were plated at 40–50% confluence at equivalent numbers of cells and then manipulated 1 or 2 days later (although still subconfluent) with either no change in medium or serum starvation (washed twice and then incubated for 5 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium high glucose) and any subsequent treatment. Cells were transfected at 70–80% confluence, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed by the manufacturer.Western Bot Analysis−Cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS three times before addition of 300 μl of lysis buffer (final: 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm Pefabloc, 200 μm Na3VO4, 1 μm microcystin LR) per 10-cm plate. Lysates were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and then cleared by centrifugation before analyzing for protein content using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. The cell samples were equalized to protein content in sample buffer and then equal amounts were loaded onto gels for analyses. Amounts loaded were optimized for each antibody. For MNK1, MNK2, the dual phospho-MNK, peIF4E, Thr(P)-214, and active p38, a minimum of 25 μg was used. For actin, ERK1, ERK2, RSK1, RSK2, active-ERK, active RSK, as well as p38 a minimum of 2 μg, but frequently 5 μg, was used. To observe the HER2 band in MCF10As, 30 μg was used.Mutagenesis of MNK1−The single mutations of MNK1 were created using site-directed mutagenesis, and the results were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Kinase Assays−Kinase activity of the purified GST or His6-tagged proteins were performed at 30 °C in 20-μl reactions containing (final concentrations) 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml eIF4E, 15 μg/ml recombinant enzyme, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼4000 cpm/pmol). Phosphate incorporation was quantified using a PhosphorImager and equal protein loading by Coomassie staining. For kinase assays of expressed proteins, cells were transfected with variants of FLAG-MNK variants, and after 24–30 h, the transfected cells were either left untreated or treated with 5% calf serum for 10 min or 50 μm sodium arsenite for 30 min, before harvesting in lysis buffer (300 μl). Resultant lysates were cleared and then immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of FLAG antibody, washed extensively, and subjected to in vitro kinase assays with eIF4E (0.5 μg per reaction) essentially as described previously (14.Chrestensen C.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27733-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Colony Formation Assays−Growth in soft agar of AU565 cells was assessed in 6-well plates. Cells (at 1 × 105) were plated on top of a thin layer of media containing 0.7% agar in complete media with 0.45% agar and varying concentrations of CGP57380 or the highest amount of Me2SO used. After 1 day, another layer of 0.7% agar media were placed on top, and every 3–4 days several drops of complete media were added to keep the plates moist. At 3 weeks the cells were stained with crystal violet (0.005%), counted, and photographed.RESULTSMNK1 Activation by p38α or ERK2 MAP Kinases in E. coli−We reconstituted the MNK1 kinase cascade in E. coli (Fig. 1) using a co-expression strategy. GST-MNK1 was co-expressed with bicistronic plasmids producing either active ERK2 or active p38α. Equal amounts of purified protein from the preparations were assayed for kinase activity in the presence or absence of eIF4E (Fig. 1A). Co-expression with active ERK2 or active p38α greatly increases GST-MNK1 phosphotransferase activity toward eIF4E (Fig. 1A, bottom panel); GST-MNK1 expressed alone is not phosphorylated on the T-loop (Fig. 1B) and does not phosphorylate eIF4E (data not shown). Phosphorylation of eIF4E by active GST-MNK1 is not because of residual co-purified MAP kinases, demonstrated for p38α by inclusion of SB203580 in the assays (data not shown). T334D MNK1 has constitutive activity in cells that does not require stimulation with ERK or p38α pathway activating agents (15.Knauf U. Tschopp C. Gram H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5500-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We compared equal amounts of recombinant His6-MNK1 to His6-MNK1 T334D proteins in parallel with the co-expressed phosphorylated proteins for eIF4E kinase activity using recombinant eIF4E and [γ-32P]ATP. The T334D mutation weakly increases autophosphorylation activity, but under our conditions, the T334D mutant did not phosphorylate eIF4E (data not shown). The T334D mutant can be phosphorylated in vitro at Thr-214 and appears to be a better substrate for p38 than the wild type enzyme (Fig. 1B). The T334D enzyme may require activating phosphorylations in the T-loop (Fig. 1E) by MAP kinases to display constitutive activity in cellular functional assays (15.Knauf U. Tschopp C. Gram H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5500-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 16.Nikolcheva T. Pyronnet S. Chou S.Y. Sonenberg N. Song A. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), because the T334D mutation, by itself, does not appear to activate MNK1 in vitro.Reconstitution of MNK1 activation in E. coli was also demonstrated by T-loop phosphorylation. Co-expression of GST-MNK1 with either active p38α or active ERK2 caused a “gel shift” of GST-MNK1 to a form of slower mobility indicative of phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). However, p38 was more effective at inducing the shift; possible explanations include better production of active p38 in the co-expression system or the presence of additional p38 sites on GST-MNK1. Incubation of GST-MNK1 or GST-MNK1 T334D with active p38α and ATP/Mg2+ in vitro induced Thr-214 phosphorylation in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). GST-MNK1 that had been co-expressed with active ERK2 was strongly reactive with anti-Thr(P)-214 antibody, whereas protein expressed alone was not (Fig. 1C). We conclude that the canonical Thr-Pro motif in the T-loop of MNK1 is phosphorylated by p38α MAP kinase or by ERK2, and the anti-Thr(P)-214 antibody is phosphospecific.We generated single threonine to alanine mutations for Thr-209 and Thr-214 in the T-loop of human GST-MNK1 to study MNK phosphorylation by either active ERK2 or p38α (Fig. 1D). GST-MNK1, expressed with either active ERK2 or p38α, generates a doublet detectable with phosphospecific antibodies to anti-Thr(P)-214. The bicistronic plasmid for active p38α was more effective in producing the active, dually phosphorylated MNK1 than the bicistronic plasmid for active ERK2. Anti-Thr(P)-214 recognizes both the upper and lower bands. This confirms that the antibody is specific for Thr-214 because recognition of both bands is lost with a T214A mutant but not the T209A mutant.Phospho-Mnk1 (Thr-197/202)™ from Cell Signaling Technologies (herein called dual phospho-Mnk) was made to a proprietary immunogen peptide that was dually phosphorylated. Its ability to detect activated MNK1 as a single phosphorylated band has been established in several reports (1.Ueda T. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Fukunaga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6539-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 11.Andersson K. Sundler R. Cytokine. 2006; 33: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17.O’Loghlen A. Gonzalez V.M. Pineiro D. Perez-Morgado M.I. Salinas M. Martin M.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Dual phospho-Mnk is reactive with the upper band, and alanine substitution at either T209A or T214A decreases reactivity with the antibody (Fig. 1D). The relative dependence of this antibody on Thr-209 versus Thr-214 was variable; in Fig. 1D reactivity of dual phospho-Mnk antibody with MNK1 proteins containing the single Thr to Ala mutations is dependent on which MAP kinase is co-expressed, and this may be due to a difference in selectivity of the upstream kinases for a particular site in the T-loop or co-expression levels of the ERK2 and p38α in E. coli. In MCF7 cells it appears that dual phospho-MNK antibody reacts better with protein singly phosphorylated at Thr-209, but this may be due to differences in ERK2 or p38 activities in these cells (Fig. 2A). We conclude that dual phospho-Mnk is selective for detecting GST-MNK1 having a dually phosphorylated T-loop, but if does react to some extent with the singly phosphorylated species.FIGURE 2Single active site mutants are not active in MCF7 cells. A, MCF7 cells were transfected with FLAG-MNK1 mutants and equal amounts of the resulting lysate loaded for Western blot analysis; eIF4E phosphorylation is increased when cells are transfected with WT-MNK1 but neither the T209A nor T214A proteins. The Thr(P)-214 antibody does not react with the T214A protein. B, MCF7 cells transfected with WT and MNK mutants were either untreated or treated with 5% serum for 10 min or 50 μm sodium arsenate for 30 min. The resulting lysates (see “Experimental Procedures”) were subjected to immunoprecipitation kinase assays with eIF4E as the substrate. The resulting Coomassie-stained gel and phosphorimage show that only WT MNK purified from MCF7 cells phosphorylates eIF4E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of Thr-209 and Thr-214 in MNK1 in MCF7 Cells−Wild type, T209A, and T214A MNK1 were expressed in MCF7 cells and subjected to Western blot analysis to correlate phosphorylations of the T-loop with activity (Fig. 2A). Transfection of wild type MNK1 increased phosphorylation of eIF4E, but addition of the single mutants did not detectably increase eIF4E phosphorylation. Anti-Thr(P)-214 gave a strong signal to wild type MNK1 as well as to the T209A mutant but did not recognize T214A MNK1, despite equivalent expression of the proteins. We conclude that the canonical Thr-Pro (Thr-214) is phosphorylated in MCF7 cells.Dual phospho-Mnk antibody was reactive with FLAG-MNK1 expressed in MCF7 cells, and reactivity was greatly reduced by the T209A single mutation (Fig. 2A). The dual phospho-Mnk antibody from Cell Signaling is phosphospecific as expected and, in this experiment, largely dependent on phosphorylation of the noncanonical Thr-Pro motif site, Thr-209 in our numbering. Reactivity of MNK1 with dual phospho-Mnk was less affected by alanine substitution of Thr-214 compared with wild type MNK1 in in vivo experiments, but this difference in reactivity was not observed in the in vitro experiments (Fig. 1D). Because MNKs are the physiological eIF4E kinases (1.Ueda T. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Fukuyama H. Nagata S. Fukunaga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6539-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), these results together prove the canonical Thr-Pro motif (Thr-214) is required but not sufficient for phosphorylation of eIF4E.We confirmed the requirement for both Thr-209 and Thr-214 in experiments in which MCF7 cells were treated by addition of fresh serum or sodium arsenite (Fig. 2B). Sodium arsenite is a strong activator of stress-activated MAP kinases, including p38α, and the agent stimulates eIF4E phosphorylation at Ser-209 (18.Morley S.J. Naegele S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19.Wang X. Flynn A. Waskiewicz A.J. Webb B.L. Vries R.G. Baines I.A. Cooper J.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Wild type MNK1 recovered from transfected MCF7 cells has eIF4E kinase activity that was modestly stimulated by additions of serum or sodium arsenite. No kinase activity was detectable for T209A or T214A mutants, despite similar expression and recovery. T209A and T214A mutants remain inactive despite additions of fresh serum or sodium arsenite to MCF7 cells. These independent results confirm that MNK1 enzymatic activity in cells requires phosphorylation at both the Thr-209 and Thr-214 sites.Characterization of ERKs and Their RSK and MNK Targets in Breast Cancer Cell Lines−Human cell lines HCC1419, AU565, and SKBR3 greatly overexpress HER2, and MCF7 slightly overexpresses HER2 (Fig. 3A). MCF10A cells are immortalized but not tumorigenic (20.Cowell J.K. LaDuca J. Rossi M.R. Burkhardt T. Nowak N.J. Matsui S. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 2005; 163: 23-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and they express HER2 at low levels. We characterized phosphorylation status of MNKs, as well as RSKs and MAP kinases in lysates prepared from equal numbers of cells collected although subconfluent and still growing in complete media. Lysates were analyzed for protein content and equalized in sample buffer (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Lysates were stored frozen at –70 °C to allow comparisons of multiple signaling components by Western blotting. Equal protein loading was confirmed by Western blotting for actin.FIGURE 3Breast cancer cell lines are different with respect to amounts and activation status of MAP kinase pathway proteins. A, breast cancer cell lines were plated with equivalent numbers of subconfluent cells and allowed to grow in normal growth conditions for either 1 or 2 days. The cells were harvested although still subconfluent, and the lysates were analyzed for protein content, and equal amounts of protein were loaded (see “Experimental Procedures”). Equivalent protein loading was confirmed with Western blotting for actin. The data shown are from one set of lysates, but at least three different profiles were done, and this profile is representative. B, specificity of the RSK1 and RSK2 antibodies was tested by expressing HA-tagged proteins in baby hamster kidney cells, immunoprecipitating the proteins from the resulting lysates, and analyzing portions of the precipitate by Western blotting with both antibodies in addition to anti-HA. The RSK1 antibody is much more selective for RSK1 than RSK2 is for itself.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ERK1 and ERK2−A monoclonal antibody specific for ERK2 and unreactive with ERK1 revealed that ERK2 expression is higher in the HER2-overexpressing lines (HCC1419, AU565, and SKBR3) than in MCF7 and MCF10A (Fig. 3A). An ERK1 monoclonal antibody shows ERK1 is not significantly up-regulated in the three HER2-overexpressing lines in comparison with MCF7, and surprisingly ERK1 is not detected in the MCF10A cells. This was a striking, consistent difference in expression for ERK1 in MCF10A versus all the other lines examined.ERK2 activity, inferred from reactivity to phospho-ERK antibody that detects dually phosphorylated kinase, was much higher in the HER2-overexpressing lines in comparison with MCF7 and MCF10A cells, as reported for HER2-overexpressing lines previously. There was active ERK2 (but not ERK1) in proliferating MCF10A cells but not detectably in MCF7. This is a relative absence in MCF7, as active ERK1 and ERK2 are detectable in MCF7 with longer exposures and/or by increasing the amount of total lysate protein.MAP Kinase p38α−The MAP kinase p38α was most active in MCF10A cells in comparison with the lines from human breast cancer (Fig. 3A). Total p38α MAP kinase was expressed at similar levels. The p38α MAP kinase pathway is activated by cellular stress, which we tried to minimize by comparisons of subconfluent cells in complete media. Activation of p38α correlates with differentiation and cell cycle exit in the intestinal epithelium (21.Houde M. Laprise P. Jean D. Blais M. Asselin C. Rivard N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21885-21894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).RSKs−Specificity of antibodies to RSK1 and RSK2 was established in control experiments (Fig. 3B). HA-RSK1 and HA-RSK2 were expressed in BHK21 cells and immunopurified; equivalent loading for Western blots was verified with the HA tag. RSK1 C-21 (goat) has much higher reactivity with HA-RSK1 than HA-RSK2 and is thus relatively specific for RSK1. RSK2 C-19 (goat) detects HA-RSK1 and HA-RSK2 equally well. RSK, most likely RSK1, was increased in HER2-expressing lines (Fig. 3A). RSK2 expression was variable, using RSK2 C-19, and expression correlated with active ERK2.Phosphorylation of Ser-386 is a sensitive marker for the ERK-RSK pathway in breast cancer. Ser-386 lies in the linker between the RSK kinase domains (22.Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), and it is conserved in RSK1–4 (14.Chrestensen C.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27733-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is phosphorylated intramolecularly by the C-terminal kinase. Phosphorylation of RSK1–4 was increased in all the breast cancer lines in comparison with MCF10A cells (Fig. 3A).MNK1−Anti-MNK1 (C20) (see under “Reagents”) detected two closely spaced bands of ∼46 and ∼48 kDa in all the lines. MNK1 has alternative transcripts. Isoform 2 (e.g. choriocarcinoma cDNA BC002755) encodes 465 amino acids with a predicted mass of 53.3 kDa and uses exon 9. We did not find isoform 2 in the huEST data base by searching with exon 9, using appropriate methods for short sequences. This suggests isoform 2 is rare. Isoform 1 (accession number AB000409), as cloned from HeLa cells by Fukunagawa and Hunter (3.Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), lacks exon 9 and encodes 424 amino acids, with a predicted mass 47.4 kDa. MNK1b (17.O’Loghlen A. Gonzalez V.M. Pineiro D.

Anti-MNK1 (C20) detects bands of the apparent mass for phosphoforms of MNK1a isoform 2, and in agreement with Myc-tagged MNK1a isoform 2 (17.O’Loghlen A. Gonzalez V.M. Pineiro D. Perez-Morgado M.I.

We report the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus Argonaute, refined at 3.2Å resolution.

This rearrangement leads to a branched, Y-shaped system of grooves that extends through the molecule and merges in a central channel containing the catalytic residues. A 5.5-ns molecular dynamics simulation of Argonaute shows a strong tendency of the PAZ and N-terminal domains to be mobile.

RNA interference, an ancient mechanism of gene silencing mediated by small RNAs, is widely distributed throughout most eukaryotes (1Meister G. Tuschl T.

Potent silencing of genes is achieved through the processing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; AaAgo, Aquifex aeolicus Argonaute; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. 2The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; AaAgo, Aquifex aeolicus Argonaute; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA. into small interfering RNAs (siRNA) by the enzyme Dicer. The ∼22-nt-long siRNAs contain a signature 5′-phosphate group and a 2-nt-long 3′-overhang (3Bernstein E. Caudy A.A. Hammond S.M. Hannon G.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3745) Google Scholar). The siRNA is then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), of which Argonaute is the primary catalytic component (4Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J.

This single-stranded guide strand siRNA bound to Argonaute is required for the sequence-dependent recognition of mRNA by RISC. Recombinantly expressed human Argonaute 2 in complex with single-stranded siRNA forms a minimal RISC, capable of mRNA recognition and cleavage (12Rivas F.V. Tolia N.H. Song J.J. Aragon J.P. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of Argonaute apoenzymes show the architecture of Argonaute to be a multidomain protein composed of N-terminal, PAZ, MID, and PIWI domains (13Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 14Yuan Y.R. Pei Y. Ma J.B. Kuryavyi V. Zhadina M. Meister G. Chen H.Y. Dauter Z. Tuschl T. Patel D.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 405-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle of RISC requires the binding of a number of different nucleotide structures to Argonaute, and we expect Argonaute to undergo a number of conformational changes during the cycle of mRNA recognition by RISC (15Filipowicz W. Cell. 2005; 122: 17-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 16Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the multidomain arrangement of Argonaute recognizes and distinguishes between single-stranded and double-stranded oligonucleotides that correspond to the Dicer-processed siRNA product, guide strand siRNA, and the guide strand/mRNA duplex. We report the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus Argonaute (AaAgo), crystallized in the presence of a single-stranded siRNA and refined using data to 3.2 Å resolution. We propose a model for Argonaute activity in the context of the RISC complex. We also report a kinetic and 5.5-ns molecular dynamics characterization of Argonaute, which highlights biphasic binding kinetics with ssDNA, and a tendency for pronounced motion of the PAZ and N-terminal domains. Together, these studies highlight a functional role for domain flexibility, especially of the PAZ, in Argonaute activity that may be crucial for the function of the RISC. Protein Expression and Purification—The full-length Argonaute gene from Aquifex aeolicus was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into a modified pET16b vector (Novagen) containing an N-terminal His7 tag. AaAgo was overexpressed in Escherichia coli host cell strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene) and induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (A600 ∼ 0.8) at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were resuspended and sonicated in 10 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Non-thermostable proteins were removed by a heating step of 72 °C for 30 min. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm, and the supernatant was applied to an immobilized metal affinity column (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose; Qiagen), with the partially purified target protein eluting at 300 mm imidazole. The N-terminal His7 tag was removed by addition of TEV protease overnight at 4 °C. The target was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. For binding experiments, the protein was purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.4. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement—siRNA nucleotides (5′-PO4 GGG AAU GCG ACU CAU GAA GCU-3′) were purchased from Ambion and solubilized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. An equimolar ratio of protein at 10 mg/ml and single-stranded siRNA was mixed together and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min prior to crystallization trials. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method at 22 °C, with 3.0 m sodium formate, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, as the precipitant. Crystals grew within 2 weeks to a maximum size of ∼200 × 200 × 30 μm. For cryoprotection, crystals were transferred into mother liquor containing 25% glycerol (v/v) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at beamline ID23-1 at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in 1° oscillations. Diffraction was observed to a useable resolution of 3.2 Å and indexed in tetragonal space group I422, with one molecule/asymmetric unit. Data were processed using MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (17Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the data were weak, with reflections at an I/σ(I) of 2 at 3.6 Å resolution, a plot of the SigmaA versus resolution (supplemental Fig. S1) showed that the weak data were still usable, and thus the refinement utilized all data to 3.2 Å resolution (18De La Barre B. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 932-1032Google Scholar, 19Ling H. Boodhoo A. Hazes B. Cummings M.D. Armstrong G.D. Brunton J.L. Read R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement, using 1YVU as a search model. Although an unambiguous solution was initially obtained by the CCP4 program MOLREP (17Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the density for the PAZ domain was poor. A second run using 1YVU excluding the PAZ domain was done in MOLREP, while placement of the PAZ domain was facilitated by EPMR (20Kissinger C.R. Ghlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The model was refined by a combination of rigid body, positional, simulated annealing, and grouped and individual B-factor refinement in CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22993) Google Scholar). B-factor refinement, though it potentially introduces a significantly higher number of parameters, is restrained in CNS and is recommended by the authors of the program, even at moderate resolution (18De La Barre B. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 932-1032Google Scholar). Tests of grouped and individual B-factor refinement favored individual B-factor refinement in the early stages and grouped B-factor refinement in the later stages. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The choice of refinement protocols, especially in regard to B-factor refinement, is described in greater detail in the supplemental data.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsSourceESRF ID23-1Wavelength (Å)0.9795Resolution (Å)aThe threshold for an I / σ(I) of 2 occurs at 3.6 Å resolution.3.2Space group1422Unit cell (Å)a = 125.0, c = 253.5RsymbValues in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell, 3.37-3.2 Å.0.135 (0.797)Redundancy independent RmergebValues in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell, 3.37-3.2 Å.0.145 (0.852)Completeness (%)bValues in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell, 3.37-3.2 Å.100 (100)Measured reflectionsbValues in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell, 3.37-3.2 Å.134396 (19238)Independent reflectionsbValues in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell, 3.37-3.2 Å.16989 (2443)RedundancybValues in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell, 3.37-3.2 Å.7.9 (7.9)<I/σ(I)>bValues in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell, 3.37-3.2 Å.4.5 (1.0)Overall (Å2)65PAZ domain101N-terminal / PIWI / Mid61Rfree / Rcryst (%)31.0 / 23.2Root mean square deviation bond angles (°)1.47Root mean square deviation bond lengths (Å)0.009Ramachandran allowed / generous / disallowed (%)97.0 / 2.0 / 1.0a The threshold for an I / σ(I) of 2 occurs at 3.6 Å resolution.b Values in parentheses refer to values in the highest resolution shell, 3.37-3.2 Å. Open table in a new tab Molecular Dynamics—The final crystallographic model was used for molecular dynamics simulations. First, loops of missing residues in the model were built using MODELLER (23Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). A 5.5-ns molecular dynamics simulation was then performed using the AMBER 8.0 (24Case D.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6410) Google Scholar) suite of programs together with the parm99 force field and a modification for backbone torsion angles (25Simmerling C. Strockbine B. Roitberg A.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11258-11259Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The starting structure was placed into an orthorhombic periodic box of TIP3P water molecules (26Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29438) Google Scholar) such that the distance between the edges of the water box and the closest protein atom was at least 10 Å. The particle mesh Ewald method (27Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20443) Google Scholar) was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions with a direct space non-bonded cutoff of 9 Å. Bond lengths involving bonds to hydrogen atoms were constrained using SHAKE (28Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16697) Google Scholar). The time step for the simulation was 2 fs. After minimization, the system was gradually heated to 300 K over a period of 50 ps, after which the solvent density was adjusted during another 50 ps. Harmonic restraints applied during these steps to all solute atoms were then reduced over 50 ps. After an additional 350 ps of simulation at 300 K, the following 5.0 ns were used for analysis, considering snapshots obtained every 1 ps. Structural changes during the simulation were analyzed in terms of root mean square deviations of Cα atoms from the starting structure and variations in the Cα-Cα distances between particular residues at the top of the M groove. To analyze dynamic properties of the molecule, equal time cross-correlations of atomic fluctuations C(i,j) between atoms i and j are obtained (29Ichiye T. Karplus M. Proteins. 1991; 11: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). For completely correlated motions, C(i,j) = 1, and for completely anticorrelated motions, C(i,j) =-1. Finally, a principal component analysis of Cα atom motions in Cartesian space was performed, yielding collective variables (also termed “modes”) that describe the essential dynamics of the system (30Amadei A. Linssen A.B. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar). The modes most involved in the observed conformational change Δr between 1YVU and the structure determined here were then obtained by calculating the overlap between each mode and Δr according to Ref. 31Marques O. Sanejouand Y.H. Proteins. 1995; 23: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar. An overlap of one indicates that the directions of both kinds of collective Cα displacements are identical. In all cases, only those Cα atoms not contained in the N-terminal or PAZ domain were used for least-squares fitting to avoid the introduction of spurious correlations (32Hunenberger P.H. Mark A.E. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 33Karplus M. Ichiye T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Binding Kinetics—Binding of fluorescently labeled DNA to immobilized AaAgo was detected in real time by total internal reflection fluorescence spectroscopy. This technique was used in combination with reflectance interference for mass-sensitive quantification of the amount of immobilized AaAgo (34Gavutis M. Lata S. Lamken P. Muller P. Piehler J. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 4289-4302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Site-specific immobilization of the protein onto the sensor chip through its His tag was achieved by using multivalent chelator heads coupled to a polyethylene glycol polymer brush, which were loaded with Ni2+ ions (35Lata S. Piehler J. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). 100 nm of 21-nt-long ssDNA (5′-CGT ACG CGG AAT ACT TCG ATT-3′), 15-nt-long ssDNA (5′-CGT ACG CGG AAT ACT-3′), and 9-nt-long (5′-CGT ACG CGG-3′), each 5′-phosphorylated and 3′-labeled with Oregon Green 488, were used for all binding experiments. Purified His-tagged AaAgo in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.4, was immobilized onto the sensor chip at various concentrations between 1 and 50 nm.10 mm MgCl2 was included in the buffer. The fluorescent label was excited with an argon ion laser at 488 nm, at ∼100 μW. All experiments were performed at 25 °C with a DNA injection of 36 s, followed by a 200-s wash period. Immobilized protein was washed off the sensor surface by addition of 500 mm imidazole. Kinetic constants were calculated using BIAevaluation 3.1 software. Structure of AaAgo—AaAgo is a roughly elliptical molecule measuring ∼55 × 70 × 90 Å in size. Nearly all of the amino acids are defined in the electron density, with the exception of residues 176-177, 245-247, and 262-271. The domains of AaAgo are divided into three lobes, comprising the N-terminal, PAZ, and the Mid/PIWI domains. The N-terminal domain is a mixed α-β fold (Fig. 1a, blue), resembling that of other DNA/RNA-binding proteins, as revealed by a DALI search for structural neighbors. A linker region, designated as L1 (Fig. 1a, green), lies at the junction between the three lobes, forming a base to two clefts defined by the N-terminal and PIWI domains and the N-terminal and PAZ domains. The PAZ domain (Fig. 1a, green) shares an overall architecture similar to that of other PAZ domain structures, divided into characteristic α-helical and β-sheet subdomains. The PAZ domain recognizes the two-nucleotide 3′-overhang of the guide strand siRNA. X-ray and NMR structures of PAZ-RNA complexes show the nucleotide end sandwiched between α-helical and β-sheet subdomains of PAZ (36Lingel A. Simon B. Izaurralde E. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Mol Biol. 2004; 11: 576-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 37Ma J.B. Yuan Y.R. Meister G. Pei Y. Tuschl T. Patel D.J. Nature. 2005; 434: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Although PAZ domains share little sequence homology, the binding cleft for the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide is hydrophobic and is mediated by conserved aromatic residues. In AaAgo, these residues are Trp-226 and Phe-209, within the α-helical region of PAZ. A third conserved residue, Arg-195, is involved in recognition and orientation of the guide strand phosphodiester backbone. A second linker region, L2 (Fig. 1a, dark green), connects the PAZ domain to the lobe formed by the MID and PIWI domains (Fig. 1a, cyan and pink, respectively). The binding pocket for the 5′-phosphate of the guide strand lies at the interface between the MID and PIWI domains. This positively charged binding pocket is highly conserved among Argonaute and PIWI proteins. Residues Tyr-439, Lys-443, Arg-444, and Lys-480, contributed by the MID domain, and Arg-681 and the C terminus of the protein (Leu-706), contributed by the PIWI domain, line this pocket in AaAgo. The PIWI domain has an RNase H fold, similar to other endonucleases such as transposases and viral integrases (38Lai L. Yokota H. Hung L.W. Kim R. Kim S.H. Structure. 2000; 8: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Chen J.C.-H. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J.W. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and as noted in structures of other Argonaute species and PIWI proteins. Cleavage of the target mRNA strand likely proceeds through a similar mechanism as other endonucleases, mediated by divalent cations such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ (12Rivas F.V. Tolia N.H. Song J.J. Aragon J.P. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). RNA Binding Sites—The architecture of this three-lobed structure results in a Y-shaped system of positively charged grooves that runs throughout the protein (Fig. 1b). The “stem” of the groove is flanked by the PAZ and MID/PIWI domains and contains the catalytic amino acids. Because of the location of the active site and the positively charged amino acids lining the stem, the dsRNA intermediate, composed of the guide strand siRNA and the target mRNA, likely binds here (13Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of PIWI bound to dsRNA strongly support this model (37Ma J.B. Yuan Y.R. Meister G. Pei Y. Tuschl T. Patel D.J. Nature. 2005; 434: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 40Parker J.S. Roe S.M. Barford D. Nature. 2005; 434: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In our structure, the groove stem measures ∼17-19 Å in diameter. Notably, the side chains of Arg-184 and Arg-601 approach within 4.5 Å of one another, thus requiring a conformational change or side chain rearrangement to properly accommodate the dsRNA substrate. The PAZ lies in an orientation that encloses part of the groove, forming a short tunnel. During the course of this work, a crystal structure of AaAgo was reported (14Yuan Y.R. Pei Y. Ma J.B. Kuryavyi V. Zhadina M. Meister G. Chen H.Y. Dauter Z. Tuschl T. Patel D.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 405-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), crystallized in a different space group from ours (henceforth referred to as 1YVU). The differences between the structures are most pronounced in the relative orientations of the PAZ domain. This movement arises from a gradual shift of the L1 β-sheet connecting the N-terminal and PAZ domains. Analysis of the conformational changes between our structure and 1YVU using DynDom (42Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) shows a ∼24° shift in the position of the PAZ in our structure, away from the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1c). Consequently, this domain shift in our structure exposes the binding site for the 3′-end of the guide strand siRNA. The orientation of the PAZ domain observed in our structure resembles the conformation of the Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute apoenzyme, which also adopts a three-lobed structure with prominent grooves between the N-terminal domain and the PAZ and PIWI domains (13Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The relatively high average B-factors of the PAZ domain, 101 Å2 compared with 61 Å2 for the remainder of the molecule, further support a tendency of the domain to be flexible. As the B-factors in the PAZ domain are relatively high, with an average amplitude of thermal vibration u = 1.13 Å (B = 8 π2 <u2>), we calculated a composite omit map to investigate how well the structure of the PAZ domain is defined by the density map. The map was created by omitting a fixed 5% volume of the model in the asymmetric unit and subjecting the remainder to simulated annealing refinement. The reassembled map shows clear density for the PAZ domain (supplemental Fig. S2), demonstrating that the position of the PAZ domain is well defined in our structure. We also note that in the crystal the PAZ domain is relatively unhindered by crystal contacts, which may be the source of the higher B-factors. In contrast, the PAZ domain of 1YVU is involved in extensive crystal contacts with the N-terminal, MID, and PIWI domains. As the conformational differences in the two AaAgo structures alternatively expose or occlude the entrance to the nucleotide binding site in PAZ, this implies a functional flexibility of the PAZ domain in RISC function. An analysis of the surface accessibility of the two AaAgo structures shows that Lys-37 and Trp-40 in the α1 of the N-terminal domain are exposed in our structure relative to 1YVU (91.1 and 110.6 Å2 in our structure versus 68.7 and 64.6 Å2, respectively, in 1YVU). Likewise, residues Glu-215, Arg-216, and Thr-218, lining the entrance to the nucleotide binding pocket in PAZ, are also comparatively exposed in our structure (131.9, 152.9, and 115.7 Å2 in our structure versus 109.7, 59.9, and 9.8 Å2, respectively, in 1YVU). One branch of the Y-shaped groove is lined by the N-terminal and PIWI domains (Fig. 2a, S groove) and measures ∼17-19 Å in diameter. The size of the groove is very similar in 1YVU as well as P. furiosus Argonaute. The S groove is lined with basic amino acids, which may serve to recognize the backbone of dsRNA. The stretch of sequence corresponding to the PIWI box, residues 615-657, a highly conserved element present in eukaryotic Argonaute proteins, lies at one end of the S groove. Although the corresponding amino acids of the PIWI box in human Ago2 (residues 730-772) are not conserved, the region is solvent-exposed and is structurally localized at the base of the groove defined by the PIWI and N-terminal domains. A direct interaction between Dicer and Argonaute was observed, localized to an interaction between the PIWI box and the second RNase III domain of Dicer (43Tahbaz N. Kolb F.A. Zhang H. Jaronczyk K. Filipowicz W. Hobman T.C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 44MacRae I.J. Zhou K. Li F. Repic A. Brooks A.N. Cande W.Z. Adams P.D. Doudna J.A. Science. 2006; 311: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), while subsequent studies have shown that Argonaute is responsible for the cleavage of the sense strand of Dicer-processed siRNA (9Rand T.A. Petersen S. Du F. Wang X. Cell. 2005; 123: 621-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 10Matranga C. Tomari Y. Shin C. Bartel D.P. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2005; 123: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). As such, these results constrain the location of Dicer within the RISC complex and suggest that the S groove may act as a channel for passage of the Dicer-cleaved siRNA product into the active site of Argonaute. The second branch of the Y-shaped groove is bordered by the N-terminal and PAZ domains (Fig. 2b, M groove), and measures ∼17 Å in diameter. The closest interactions between the N-terminal and PAZ domains in our structure occur between the side chains of residues Ser-73 and Thr-218 (7.3 Å), which lie at the top of the groove. Importantly, in our structure, the 3′-nucleotide binding pocket in PAZ is exposed to the M groove. In contrast, 1YVU shows a closed conformation, characterized by a salt bridge between the side chains of residues Arg-216 and Glu-76 (2.9 Å), as well as a hydrogen bond between the indole nitrogen of Trp-40 and the carbonyl oxygen of Thr-218 (3.2 Å). Our structure shows no interactions between these residues, with a Arg-216/Glu-76 distance of 17.8 Å and a Trp-40/Thr-218 distance of 10.2 Å. Notably, although the size of the M groove shows significant variation between our structure and 1YVU, the size of the S groove is the same. A sequence alignment of residues lining the S groove between AaAgo and human Ago1 and Ago2 reveals a number of conserved residues, including Lys-34, Arg-52, Arg-95, from the N-terminal domain, and Arg-573, Arg-576, Lys-642, and Arg-644 from the PIWI domain, which constitute the majority of the basic amino acids in the S groove (Fig. 2c). Helices α1 and α2 act as a putative RNA recognition face of the N-terminal domain, spanning both the M and S grooves (Fig. 2c). Although AaAgo was crystallized in the presence of a single-stranded siRNA, only disordered, unassignable electron density was observed in the 5′-nucleotide binding pocket, with no discernible density observed in the 3′-nucleotide binding site in PAZ. This may be explained by the preference of AaAgo for ssDNA (Kd ∼ 0.01 μm) relative to ssRNA (Kd ∼ 0.97 μm) as measured by filter binding assays (14Yuan Y.R. Pei Y. Ma J.B. Kuryavyi V. Zhadina M.

Patients with this syndrome carry an increased risk of parathyroid and renal tumors. To determine the relevance of HRPT2 for sporadic renal tumors, clear cell, papillary and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas as well as oncocytomas and Wilms tumors were analysed for HRPT2 gene alterations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of HRPT2 was found in seven of 56 (12.5%) clear cell, three of 14 (21%) papillary, six of 10 (60%) chromophobe renal cell carcinomas, three of eight (38%) oncocytomas and four of 10 (40%) Wilms tumors. In addition, two novel HRPT2 point mutations, causing K34Q and R292K changes in parafibromin, were detected in one clear cell carcinoma and one Wilms tumor, respectively. These tumors displayed LOH of the remaining wild-type allele, but interestingly no von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) mutation. Functional analysis revealed that the K34Q mutant species of parafibromin is, unlike wild-type protein, defective in suppressing cyclin D1 expression in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that renal cancer-associated mutations in parafibromin occur in the absence of VHL mutation, which in turn may contribute to constitutively elevated cyclin D1 expression and abnormal cell proliferation."

LOX has been also shown to play an essential role in promoting the invasive and metastatic potential of breast tumor cells. However, the LOX-interacting factors in these processes are not known. In this study, we identified placental lactogen (PL), a member of the growth hormone/prolactin hormone family, as a LOX-interacting partner using yeast two-hybrid screens. PL is normally only expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblasts, but PL genes are amplified and expressed in a high percentage of invasive ductal breast carcinomas. We confirmed LOX-PL interactions using far Western and solid phase binding assays. In activity assays, PL was not a substrate or inhibitor of LOX. We further demonstrated that PL is expressed in breast tumor epithelial cells and detected LOX-PL interactions by coimmunoprecipitation in invasive breast cancer cells. In MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells stably expressing LOX, PL, or both, LOX had no effect on cell proliferation, PL alone increased proliferation by 49%, and coexpression of LOX and PL led to a 121% increase in cell proliferation. Unlike in tumor cells, LOX did not induce a more migratory phenotype in MCF-10A cells; nor did PL. However, their coexpression resulted in a 240% increase in cell migration, suggesting that these interactions may be highly relevant to the transition of epithelial cells toward a migratory phenotype during the development and progression of breast carcinoma and a significant role for LOX-PL interactions in epithelial cell behavior.

Human lysyl oxidase is synthesized by diverse cell types as a 48-kDa preproenzyme that is secreted into the extracellular space following glycosylation.

Although the proteolytic activation of LOX and its matrix cross-linking activity has been extensively studied, its significance in pathological conditions is less understood. Consequently, questions have arisen regarding the regulation of LOX activation, potential new substrates, and protein interactions in these processes. To elucidate the factors that might play a role in these molecular mechanisms, we focused on LOX-protein interactions and identified human placental lactogen as a potential interacting partner of LOX from yeast two-hybrid screens. Human placental lactogen (PL) is a member of the growth hormone/prolactin peptide hormone family that includes growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), and placental lactogen. PL is produced by the placental syncytiotrophoblasts as a single chain polypeptide hormone of 191 amino acids that has been shown to form biologically active homodimers in vivo (13Schneider A.B.

Acta. 1977; 493: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In humans, PL is only expressed in the placenta during pregnancy, and it replaces the down-regulated pituitary PRL as the placental growth hormone (GH-V) replaces the down-regulated pituitary GH (16Walsh S.T. Kossiakoff A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Human placenta-derived PL stimulates mammary gland development, lactogenesis and the growth and metabolism of the fetus (17Walker W.H. Fitzpatrick S.L. Barrera-Saldana H.A. Resendez-Perez D. Saunders G.F. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Three PL genes have been identified within the growth hormone gene cluster on chromosome 17, PL-1 (also named PL-L or CS-L), PL-4 (PL-A or CS-A), and PL-3 (PL-B or CS-B) (18Chen E.Y. Liao Y.C.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 211: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PL-3 and PL-4, but not PL-1, contribute to the mature hormone production (20Resendez-Perez D. Ramirez-Solis R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4665-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the secreted protein products of these genes are identical (21Barrera-Saldana H.A. Seeburg P.H. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3787-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PL has been implicated in breast cancer, although its significance remains unexplored. All three PL genes have been shown to be amplified in 22% of breast carcinomas (22Latham C. Zhang A. Nalbanti A. Maner S. Zickert P. Blegen H. Zetterberg A. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 2001; 127: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PL expression was demonstrated within tumors in 77% of the cases in this panel, and another study reported PL expression in 82% of breast tumors (23Horne C.H. Reid I.N. Milne G.D. Lancet. 1976; 2: 279-282Abstract PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, a trend was noted toward an increased incidence of lymph node metastases with amplification of the PL genes (22Latham C. Zhang A. Nalbanti A. Maner S. Zickert P. Blegen H. Zetterberg A. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 2001; 127: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The two other members of this hormone family, GH and PRL, are potent oncogenes acting through their receptors, and PL exerts its effects via the same receptors. PL binds to the GH receptor (GHR) with lower affinity than GH (24Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10982-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) despite their significant (85%) amino acid sequence homology (25Peterson F.C. Brooks C.L. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PL has only 23% amino acid sequence homology to PRL (25Peterson F.C. Brooks C.L. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) but binds to the PRL receptor (PRLR) with a higher affinity (24Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Biol.

The PRL receptor mediates the growth and differentiating hormone effect of PRL in the breast. In breast cancer cells, stimulated PRLR activates signaling cascades associated with cytoskeletal alterations and enhances membrane ruffling and cell motility, events that have been associated with the progression of mammary carcinoma in vivo (27Maus M.V.

Cancer. 1984; 34: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although PL is expressed in a high percentage of breast carcinomas and can bind to PRLR, its expression and function in breast cancer cells has not been investigated. In this study, we describe the expression of PL in breast cancer cell lines and report a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified PL as an interacting partner of LOX. In subsequent experiments, we characterize LOX-PL binding affinity and binding site within LOX and confirm this interaction in invasive breast tumor epithelial cells. To address the mechanism and significance of potential LOX-PL interactions, we analyze cell proliferation and migration using MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cell lines stably expressing LOX, PL, or both. Our results support a proliferation-inducing function for PL in normal epithelial cells and, furthermore, suggest a potential role for LOX-PL interactions in breast epithelial cell proliferation and migration. Antibodies and Proteins Used—Polyclonal anti-PL antibody, polyclonal anti-GH antibody and monoclonal anti-PRL antibody were purchased from Novocastra Laboratories, Chemicon International, and Upstate Biotechnologies, respectively. Monoclonal anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal anti-LOX antibody, which recognizes both the full-length and the processed forms of human LOX, was previously characterized (32He Q. Csiszar K. Li P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 12: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Purified PL, GH, and PRL proteins were purchased from the National Hormone and Peptide Program. Purified bovine aorta LOX (bLOX) was generously provided by Dr. Herbert Kagan (Boston University) (33Kagan H.M. Sullivan K.A. Olsson III, T.A. Cronlund A.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Fixed human breast cancer tissues with corresponding normal tissues (AccuMax Array A712(II); ISU Abxis Co.) were obtained. Tissue sections were deparaffinized by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min and immersion in xylene three times for 15 min each. Rehydration of the tissue sections was performed in a decreasing concentration ethanol series. The sections were washed in PBS and in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min each and blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min. The sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies in 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 2 h, washed in PBS for 15 min, blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 10 min, incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 30 min, and then incubated with To-PRO-3 nuclear stain (Molecular Probes) for 15 min. After mounting the samples with Vectashield mounting medium, a Zeiss LSM Pascal confocal microscope was used for imaging. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Immortalized mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells and breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and T47D were kindly supplied by Dr. Dawn Kirschmann (Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Iowa) and were maintained as previously described (34Debnath J.

Expression of PL and LOX in the tumor cell lines was evaluated by Western analysis of the cell lines' conditioned cell medium (CCM). Briefly, at ∼70% confluence, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free, phenol red-free medium for 48 h. The CCM was collected, and the protein concentration was measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). To a volume of CCM containing 20 μg of proteins, 10 μl of Strataclean Resin (Stratagene) was added and mixed at room temperature for 10 min to bind the proteins (36Ziegler J. Vogt T. Miersch O. Strack D. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After centrifugation and the removal of the supernatant, the resin was resuspended in 10 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5 min before electrophoresis by SDS-PAGE. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to the Clontech System 3 protocol using a human placental cDNA library (Clontech), which contained over 3.5 × 106 independent clones generated from human placental mRNA with oligo(dT) primers described previously (37Fogelgren B. Polgar N. Szauter K.M. Ujfaludi Z. Laczko R. Fong K.S. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24690-24697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to introduce restriction sites 5′ and 3′ to sequence-verified human LOX cDNA in order to clone the inserts into the Clontech pGBKT7 vector downstream and in frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Several LOX expression constructs were designed and cloned, including the full-length pro-LOX (amino acids 1-417), the mature LOX (amino acids 169-417), the LOX propeptide (amino acids 1-168), the cytokine receptor-like (CRL) domain (amino acids 349-417), the pro-LOX without the CRL domain (amino acids 1-348), and the mature LOX without the CRL domain (amino acids 349-417). The finished constructs, pGBKT7-LOX1-417, pGBKT7-LOX169-417, pGBKT7-LOX1-168, pGBKT7-LOX349-417, pGBKT7-LOX1-348, and pGBKT7-LOX169-348, were each verified by DNA sequencing. Similar cloning was done to create yeast two-hybrid bait constructs for human lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) and lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) genes, which resulted in the constructs pGBKT7-LOXL26-574 (amino acids 26-574), pGBKT7-LOXL-Nterm26-368 (amino acids 26-368), pGBKT7-LOXL-Cterm338-574 (amino acids 338-574), pGBKT7-LOXL2-Nterm1-547 (amino acids 1-547), and pGBKT7-LOXL2-Cterm548-774 (amino acids 548-774). The library was transformed into AH-109 yeast that contained pGBKT7-LOX1-417 or pGBKT7-LOX169-417, and clones containing interacting proteins were selected based on activation of the three reporter genes HIS3, ADE2, and lacZ. The library plasmids were isolated from the positive yeast clones, and the cDNA inserts were sequenced. The interactions of the identified positive clones were further characterized by performing direct cotransformations into AH109 yeast of various combinations of LOX, LOXL, and LOXL2 deletion constructs with the positive clones and with parallel empty vector controls. These direct cotransformation assays also used selection based on HIS3 and ADE2 reporter gene expression. Bacterial Expression of GST-LOX—The plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) was used to generate an expression construct for the mature LOX containing an N-terminal GST tag, as described previously (37Fogelgren B. Polgar N. Szauter K.M. Ujfaludi Z. Laczko R. Fong K.S. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24690-24697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pGBKT7-LOX169-417 plasmid was digested with EcoRI and SalI, and the LOX insert was ligated into the pGEX-4T-1 vector downstream and in frame with the GST tag. The pGEX-4T-1-LOX expression plasmid was then transformed into the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene) in parallel with the empty pGEX-4T-1 vector to use for GST-only negative controls. GST-LOX fusion protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thio-galactopyranoside to growing cultures and shaking for an additional2hat37°C. Recombinant proteins were extracted from inclusion bodies using a solubilization buffer (8 m urea, 10 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.2), filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter, and refolded with a rapid dilution into 10 mm K2HPO4 buffer (pH 8.2). GST-LOX fusion proteins were captured and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and then eluted using the inclusion body solubilization buffer and refolded again. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Far Western Experiments—Our protocol was based on the modified protocol for far Westerns from Ref. 38Golemis E. Protein-Protein Interactions: A Molecular Cloning Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 37-142Google Scholar. Equal volumes of the purified GST-LOX169-417 construct and GST only as a control were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a pretreated Immobilion-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To refold the blotted proteins, we incubated the membrane at room temperature with refolding buffer R6 (refolding buffer: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride added) for 1 h, then with refolding buffer R4 (containing 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride) and with refolding buffer R2 (with 2 m guanidinium hydrochloride) for 15 min each, and finally with refolding buffer R1 (containing 0.187 m guanidinium hydrochloride) for 30 min. The membrane was incubated in refolding buffer R1 overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking and then blocked with 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk in PBST (1× PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then blocked with 3 μm reduced glutathione in 2.5% Carnation nonfat dry milk in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with PBST and incubated with 5 μg/ml of the target protein (PL) in PBST for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the membrane was incubated with anti-PL primary antibody and then with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. We used ECL reagents (GE Healthcare) for horseradish peroxidase detection. Solid Phase Binding Assay—To determine the binding affinity of LOX to PL, GH, and PRL, solid phase binding assays were performed as previously described (37Fogelgren B. Polgar N. Szauter K.M.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). Wells of high protein-binding EIA/RIA microplates (catalog number 3590; Corning Glass) were coated with purified PL, GH, and PRL proteins at 200 nm in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After aspirating the liquid, the wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 3 h at 37 °C. After removing the blocking solution, wells were washed three times with 0.1% BSA in PBS. Purified soluble GST-LOX protein was added to the wells at various concentrations (0-5000 nm) in 10 mm K2HPO4 (pH 8.2) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBST, and bound ligand was reacted with anti-GST (Upstate Biotechnology) primary antibody and then detected with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Peroxidase activity was measured using the QuantaBlu fluorogenic peroxidase substrate kit (Pierce) with readings performed by a POLARStar Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies). All measurements were performed in triplicates. The dissociation constants were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis performed by Graphpad Prism4 statistical software (Graphpad, Inc.). Coimmunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation experiments, CCM from cultured Hs578T breast cancer cells was collected from cultures grown under serum-free conditions for 2 days postconfluence, and the CCM was concentrated using Amicon Ultra tubes (Millipore). After preclearing the CCM by incubating it with 20 μl of TrueBlot anti-rabbit IgG beads (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 °C, 3 ml of the sample was incubated with 3 μg of the immunoprecipitating antibody (anti-LOX or anti-PL) at 4 °C overnight. An equal amount of purified rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used as a negative control to test the specificity of the immunocomplex formation. The formed immunocomplexes were captured by the addition of 50 μl of TrueBlot anti-rabbit IgG beads and incubation for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were then collected by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and after taking aliquots of the flow-through for further analysis, the beads were washed three times in PBST and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blotting. LOX Activity Assays—The LOX enzyme activity was measured using the Amplex Red fluorescence assay (40Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which was adapted for use in microplate format and described previously (37Fogelgren B. Polgar N. Szauter K.M.

The assay reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm sodium borate (pH 8.2), 1.2 m urea, 50 μm Amplex Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.), 0.1 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), and 10 mm 1,5-diaminopentane substrate (Sigma). To measure if LOX activity is affected by binding to PL, 10 pmol of purified bLOX was incubated with an equal molar amount of purified PL for 1 h at 4 °C. To measure if PL is a substrate for LOX, we replaced the 1,5-diaminopentane in the reaction mix with various amounts of purified PL and measured the activity of 10 pmol of purified bovine LOX. The protein samples were added to the reaction mix in the presence or absence of 500 μm of the LOX inhibitor β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN; Sigma), and the reactions were then incubated in a POLARstar Optima microplate reader at 37 °C. The fluorescent product was excited at 560 nm, and the emission was read at 590 nm. The LOX enzyme activity was calculated as the increase of fluorescent units over time (60 min) above the BAPN controls. All samples were assayed in triplicate to minimize experimental error. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism4 statistical software. Lentiviral Constructs—PL and LOX were stably expressed in mammalian cells using the ViraPower™ Lentiviral Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forward PCR primers were designed to contain the additional 5′-CACC-3′ bases necessary for directional cloning on the 5′ end, whereas the reverse primers were designed to contain the native stop codon. The primers used to amplify the human PL sequence were 5′-CAC CAT GGC TCC AGG CTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTA GAA GCC ACA GCT GCC CT-3′ (reverse). The primers designed to amplify LOX were 5′-CAC CAT GCG CTT CGC CT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTA ATA CGG TGA AAT TGT GCA GCC TG-3′ (reverse). For the LOX template, we used a previously cloned expression vector, pcDNA3.1-LOX, and for the PL-4 template, we used a positive clone isolated by the yeast two-hybrid screen. Both template plasmids were sequence-verified. DNA fragments were amplified by PCR, in a total volume of 50 μl, which consisted of 1× PCR buffer, 125 μm dNTP, 0.5 μm each primer, 1 unit of DeepVent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.), and 200 ng of template DNA. The PCR cycling consisted of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C, which was repeated 30 times. The first cycle was initiated with a denaturation step for 5 min at 95 °C. The amplified fragments were then cloned into the pLenti6/V5 lentiviral expression vector using the pLenti6/V5 directional TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lentiviral Transduction—HEK293FT human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (Invitrogen), used as hosts for the production of the designed lentiviruses, were maintained as recommended by the manufacturer. These cells were cotransfected with the pLenti6/V5-PL-4 or pLenti6/V5-LOX lentiviral DNA constructs and Virapower packaging mix using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as a transfection reagent. Viruscontaining supernatants were collected after 72 h of transfection. MCF-10A cells were stably transduced with lentiv"
https://openalex.org/W2077700968,"High-risk human papillomaviruses are the causative agents of cervical and other anogenital cancers. In these cancers, two viral oncogenes, E6 and E7, are expressed. E6 is best known for its ability to inactivate the tumor suppressor p53, which is thought to arise through ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53 and involve a ternary complex between E6, p53 and the E3 ligase, E6AP. In mice transgenic for wild-type HPV16 E6, its expression leads to epithelial hyperplasia and an abrogation of normal cellular responses to DNA damage. Whereas only the latter phenotype is dependent upon E6's inactivation of p53, both are reduced in transgenic mice expressing an E6 mutant severely reduced in its binding to E6AP and other cellular proteins that bind E6 through a shared alpha-helix motif. Here, we investigated whether E6AP is required for the induction of the above phenotypes through the use of both E6AP-mutant and E6AP-null mice. E6, in the absence of E6AP retains an ability to induce epithelial hyperplasia, abrogate DNA damage responses and inhibit the induction of p53 protein following exposure to ionizing radiation. We conclude that E6 is able to induce both p53-dependent and p53-independent phenotypes through E6AP-independent pathways in the mouse."

The -343 G → C polymorphism in the human FCGR2B promoter is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. The -343 C mutant promoter has decreased transcriptional activity. In the present study, we show that the transcriptional change correlates with quantitative differences in the interaction of the activating protein 1 complex with the mutant FCGR2B promoter. Promoter pulldown and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of c-Jun to the FCGR2B promoter. Phosphorylation of c-Jun was accompanied by transactivation of both FCGR2B promoter variants, whereas dephosphorylation of c-Jun by an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, markedly decreased the promoter activities. The -343 G → C substitution enabled the specific interaction of the transcription factor Yin-Yang 1 with the mutant FCGR2B promoter. Yin-Yang 1 competed with activating protein 1 for binding at the -343 site, and contributed to the repression of the mutant FCGR2B promoter activity. This mechanism could be responsible for the decreased expression of FcγRIIb associated with the -343 C/C homozygous FCGR2B genotype in lupus patients.

Human hematopoetic cells express several FcγR isoforms encoded by seven separate genes. Unlike activating FcγR, FcγRIIb is unique in that it contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in the intracellular domain. A specific amino acid sequence in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain of FcγRIIb allows the recruitment of phosphatases and the initiation of inhibitory signaling. Cross-linking of FcγRIIb with activating receptors on B cells and mononuclear phagocytes leads to down-regulation of antibody production, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that FcγRIIb is important in the maintenance of self-tolerance. FcγRIIb deficiency is associated with spontaneous development of autoimmune manifestations in several mouse genetic backgrounds (1Bolland S. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 2000; 13: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Autoimmune prone mouse strains share an Fcgr2 promoter haplotype containing deletions and polymorphisms associated with reduced expression of FcγRIIb on the surface of activated B cells and macrophages (2Luan J.J.

Whereas the engineered deletion and the natural deficiency in FcγRIIb confer susceptibility to development of lupus-like disease, transplantation of bone marrow cells transduced with FcγRIIb-expressing retrovirus restored the healthy phenotype (5McGaha T.L. Sorrentino B. Ravetch J.V. Science. 2005; 307: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This body of data created the impetus for the study of FcγRIIb regulation and function in humans.Genetic studies revealed a significant association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) encoding the amino acid substitution I232T in the transmembrane of FcγRIIb with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in several racial groups (6Kyogoku C.

In addition, several SNPs present in the FCGR2B promoter correlated with differences in regulatory function and associated with autoimmunity in certain racial groups (10Su K. Wu J. Edberg J.C. Li X.

The -343 G → C substitution identified by us in the proximal FCGR2B promoter correlates with decreased transcriptional activity and associates with SLE in European-Americans (11Blank M.C. Stefanescu R.N. Masuda E. Marti F. King P.D. Redecha P.B. Wurzburger R.J. Peterson M.G. Tanaka S. Pricop L. Hum.

The -343 G → C substitution correlated with decreased promoter activity in transiently transfected cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and supershift experiments indicated differences in the binding of activating protein 1 (AP-1) family members to the two FCGR2B promoter sequence variants, with decreased binding of c-Jun to the mutant sequence. The -343 G → C substitution created a new binding site for the nuclear factor Yin-Yang 1 (YY1) that interacted specifically with the mutant sequence competing with c-Jun for DNA binding. The inhibition of YY1 synthesis with specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted in the up-regulation of the mutant promoter activity. We identify a shift in the binding of YY1 versus c-Jun to the mutant promoter, and this mechanism could be responsible for the repression of FCGR2B promoter activity in SLE patients bearing the -343 C/C genotype. Our study has implications for the modulation of FCGR2B gene expression in SLE and other diseases having altered expression and function of inhibitory FcγRIIb as pathogenic factor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Human U937, Raji, and CL-01 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) (12Cerutti A.

Cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus 1 mm ionomycin (ION) or with 1 mm dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) (Sigma). The peptide inhibitor of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNKIII) Ac-YGRKKRRQRRR-gaba-ILKQSMTLNLADPVGSLKPHLRAKN-NH2 (Calbiochem) was added to the cell cultures at the concentration of 10 μm.Plasmids—The -537 to +43 fragment of the human FCGR2B promoter was amplified with primers containing recognition sites for KpnI in the forward primer (5′-GCGCGGTACCGCCATCCTGACATACCTCCTT-3′) and XhoI in the reverse primer (5-GCGCCTCGAGCACTCCCTGGAGCGACGTGGC-3′). The products were directionally ligated using a rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche) into the KpnI/XhoI site of the pGL3-Enhancer vectors (Promega, Madison, WI). Constructs containing G at position -343 were used as template to create -343 C constructs by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The c-Jun trans-Reporting System PathDetect Kit containing the pFC-MEKK plasmid expressing mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase (MEKK) and the pFA2-cJUN plasmid expressing c-Jun was obtained from Stratagene. The pCMV-YY1 vector expressing full-size YY1 was obtained from OriGene.Cell Transfection and Reporter Assays—Transient transfection of CL-01 cells was performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CL-01 cells (1.6 × 106 cell/ml) in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) were incubated with plasmid-Lipofectamine complexes for 5 h, and then supplemented with complete medium and cultured for 48 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured in cell lysates by the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) using a Wallac MicroBetta Trilux 1450 microplate luminometer. Where indicated, CL-01 cells were co-transfected with shRNA against YY1 1 day prior to the luciferase reporter assay. The TranSilent YY1 shRNA and TranSilent control vector (Panomics) were transfected into CL-01 using AMAXA nucleofector kit. Where indicated, co-transfection with pFC-MEKK, pFA2-cJUN, and pCMV-YY1 was performed.EMSA—Nuclear extracts from CL-01 and U937 cells were prepared as previously described (11Blank M.C. Stefanescu R.N. Masuda E. Marti F. King P.D. Redecha P.B. Wurzburger R.J. Peterson M.G. Tanaka S. Pricop L. Hum. Genet. 2005; 117: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (Operon, Inc.) were annealed and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Specific oligonucleotide competitors against AP-1, YY1, and SP1 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Nuclear extracts from resting and activated CL-01 and U937 cells were incubated on ice for 10 min in EMSA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 4% glycerol) with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), followed by addition of labeled probe. In EMSA competition studies, nuclear extracts were incubated with 200-fold excess of unlabeled competitor. Anti-c-Jun (number 06–225, Upstate Biolabs), anti-c-Fos, anti-JunB, anti-YY1, and anti-SP1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in supershift assays.Promoter Pulldown Assay—Biotinylated WT, MUT, and AP-1 oligonucleotides (Operon, Inc.) were annealed and coupled to streptavidin-agarose CL-4B (Sigma). Nuclear extracts from activated CL-01 cells were incubated overnight with agarose-coupled oligonucletides. Agarose suspensions containing bound nuclear factors were applied to minicolumns, washed, and the bound nuclear proteins were eluted with 400 mm NaCl and separated in 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out with anti-YY1, -c-Fos, and –phospho-c-JunP73 antibodies.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed according to a published procedure, with several modifications (13Hayakawa J. Mittal S. Wang Y. Korkmaz K.S. Adamson E. English C. Ohmichi M. McClelland M. Mercola D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 521-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, CL-01 cells, harvested at baseline or after activation, were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were lysed and sonicated with SONICATOR 3000 (MISONIX). Supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti c-Jun antibodies (sc-45X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-XBP (sc-7160X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubation with protein A-agarose in the presence of salmon sperm DNA. The chromatin fraction was eluted, treated with proteinase K, and precipitated. The DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using primers spanning regions -495 to -472 and -278 to -258 of the FCGR2B promoter.RESULTSWe investigated the binding of nuclear factors to the nucleotide sequence (-369 to -330) containing the -343 G → C substitution (dbSNP number rs3219018) identified by us in the human FCGR2B promoter (11Blank M.C. Stefanescu R.N. Masuda E. Marti F. King P.D. Redecha P.B. Wurzburger R.J. Peterson M.G. Tanaka S. Pricop L. Hum. Genet. 2005; 117: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Two FcγRIIb-expressing cell types, the B lymphoma cell line CL-01 and the myelomonocytic leukemia cell line U937, were used as sources for nuclear extracts. EMSA experiments were carried out with double-stranded oligonucleotide probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The WT probe corresponded to the sequence of the common FCGR2B promoter that contained -343 G, whereas the MUT probe contained -343 C (sequences are shown in Table 1). Analysis of the EMSA pattern revealed that the WT and MUT probes formed distinct DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 1, A and B). The WT probe formed complex b, and the MUT probe formed complexes b and c with nuclear extract from resting CL-01 cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). Nuclear extracts from U937 incubated with the MUT probe allowed the formation of complex c (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Complex b was not evident with nuclear extracts from U937 cells, suggesting cell-specific differences in the binding of nuclear factors to the FCGR2B promoter probes.TABLE 1Probes and competitors used for EMSANameSequenceFCGR2B-343 SNP|-369 GGA GAA GAT TGC TGG TGC ACG CTG TCC TGC ATC ACC CTT TCT -330ProbesWT5‘-GGA GAA GAT TGC TGG TGC ACG CTG TCC TGC ATC ACC CTT TCT GG-3‘MUT5‘-GGA GAA GAT TGC TGG TGC ACG CTG TCC TCC ATC ACC CTT TCT GG-3‘AP-15‘-GGA GAA GAT TGC TGG TGC ACG CTG TCC TGA CTC ACC CTT TCT GG-3‘AP-1neg5‘-GGA GAA GAT TGC TGG TGC ACG CTG TCC TAA GAC ACC CTT TCT GG-3‘CompetitorsCL 5‘-A GAA GAT TGC TGG TGC ACG CTG T-3‘CWT5‘-GG TCC TGC ATC ACC CTT TCT CC-3‘CMUT5‘-GG TCC TCC ATC ACC CTT TCT CC-3‘Specific competitors of transcription factor bindingCAP-15‘-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAG CCG GAA-3‘CYY15‘-CGC TCC CCG GCC ATC TTG GCG GCT GGT-3‘CSP15‘-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG-3‘ Open table in a new tab To test the effect of cell activation on the binding of nuclear factors to the WT and MUT probes, we treated CL-01 cells and U937 cells with PMA:ION. Two slow migrating DNA-protein complexes, a1 and a2, were formed when the WT probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from PMA:ION-treated CL-01 and U937 cells (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 5). Complex a1 was predominant in activated CL-01 cells, whereas complex a2 was predominant in activated U937 cells, indicating differences in the formation of the activation-induced complexes in the two cell types (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 5). The formation of complex a1 and a2 with the MUT probe was weak in activated CL-01 and U937 cells (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 6).Computer-based analysis of the FCGR2B sequence containing the -343 site indicated similarity with the core consensus binding sequence for AP-1 (TGACTCA) (Fig. 1C). We compared the migration pattern of complex a1 and a2 with that of AP-1 by generating a probe (AP-1 probe) containing the canonical AP-1 binding motif (TGACTCA) within the sequence of the FCGR2B promoter (Fig. 1C). The AP-1 probe formed bands with similar mobility with complexes a1 and a2 in activated CL-01 and U937 cells (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 7). These results suggested that AP-1 participated in the formation of activation-induced complex a1 and a2. The expression level of the AP-1 family members, c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos in nuclear extracts was analyzed in Western blots. The activation of CL-01 and U937 cells with PMA:ION induced the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos (Fig. 1D).To verify the interaction of complexes a1 and a2 with the AP-1 binding sequence, we created an additional probe AP-1neg bearing a mutated sequence (TAAGAC) of the AP-1 core consensus binding motif (Table 1). The AP-1neg probe did not form activation-induced complexes a1 and a2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 4). The nuclear factors that participate in the formation of complex b interacted with the AP-1neg probe, indicating that complex b bound outside the -343 to -340 nucleotide sequence (Fig. 2A, lane 4).FIGURE 2Analysis of nuclear factor binding to the sequence containing the -343 G → C SNP in the FCGR2B promoter by EMSA and ChIP assay. A, representative EMSA (n = 5–8) with nuclear extract from PMA:ION-activated CL-01 cells incubated with 32P-labeled WT (lane 1), MUT (lane 2), AP-1 (line 3), and the AP-1neg probe (lane 4). Unlabeled competitor probe (CL) was used in 200-fold molar excess with 32P-labeled WT (lane 5) and MUT probe (lane 6). Unlabeled competitor probes CWT and CMUT were used in 200-fold molar excess with 32P-labeled WT and MUT probes (lanes 7–10). In competition EMSA (n = 5–8), the WT probe was incubated with 200-fold excess of unlabeled competitors CAP-1 (lane 13) and CSP1 (lane 14), and the MUT probe was incubated with 200-fold excess of unlabeled competitors CAP-1 (lane 15), CYY1 (lane 16), or CSP1 (lane 17). B, EMSA (n = 3–5) with nuclear extract from PMA:ION-activated CL-01 cells with the WT probe was performed in the presence of anti-SP1 (lane 1), anti-c-Fos (lane 2), anti-c-Jun (lane 3), anti-JunB (lane 4), and with the MUT probe in the presence of anti-SP1 (lane 5) and anti-YY1 antibodies (lane 6). Supershifted (ss) complexes are indicated by arrows (left panel). Western blots with nuclear extract from resting and activated CL-01 cells overlaid with anti-YY1 antibodies (right panel). C, ChIP assay with CL-01 cells in the presence of anti-c-Jun antibodies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation from resting and PMA:ION-activated CL-01 cells was performed in the presence of anti-c-Jun and control antibodies (n = 3). The immunoprecipitated chromatin fraction was amplified by PCR with primers specific for the FCGR2B promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To localize the interaction of nuclear proteins with the WT and MUT promoter sequences, we synthesized a competitor probe corresponding to the FCGR2B promoter left flanking sequence excluding the -343 site (CL). In addition, we synthesized competitor probes corresponding to the FCGR2B promoter right flanking sequence containing -343 G (CWT) and -343 C (CMUT) (Table 1). We performed EMSA with 200-fold excess of each unlabeled competitor probe. The addition of competitor CL abolished the formation of complex b with the WT and MUT probes (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that the interaction of complex b with the FCGR2B promoter sequence was upstream and outside of the -343 G/C polymorphic region. Competitor CL added in excess did not abolish the formation of complexes a1 and c (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). Competitors CWT and CMUT did not influence the formation of complex b (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–10). CWT eliminated complex a1, but did not affect the formation of the MUT-specific complex c (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). CMUT eliminated the formation of complex a1 with the WT, and the formation of complex c with the MUT probe (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10). Complex a1 was eliminated by 200-fold excess of AP-1 oligonucleotide competitor, confirming the interaction of AP-1 factors with the WT promoter sequence at that site (Fig. 2A, lanes 13 and 15). The excess SP1 competitor did not affect the formation of complex a1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 14 and 17).We sought to identify the nuclear factors participating in the formation of the AP-1 transcriptional complex. Antibodies against SP1, used as control, did not form supershifts and did not eliminate the formation of the activation-induced complexes a1 and a2 (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Antibodies specific for c-Fos, c-Jun, and Jun-B enabled the formation of supershift bands with the WT probe (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4). The incubation of nuclear extract from CL-01 cells with anti-c-Jun antibodies eliminated complex a1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3), whereas anti-c-Fos antibodies eliminated complex a2 (Fig. 2B, lane 2). These results suggested that in CL-01 cells, complex a1 is formed preferentially by c-Jun, and that c-Fos participates mainly in the formation of complex a2.We investigated the direct interaction of c-Jun with the FCGR2B promoter by ChIP assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared from resting CL-01 cells (0 h) and CL-01 cells activated with PMA:ION for 3, 7, and 30 h (Fig. 2C). Immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Jun antibodies (sc-45X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) generated a PCR product with specific primers for the FCGR2B promoter (Fig. 2C). We did not detect PCR products by amplification with FCGR2B-specific primers following chromatin immunoprecipitation with control antibody (anti-XBP sc-7160X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). These results demonstrate the direct interaction of c-Jun with the FCGR2B promoter and suggest that c-Jun could act as transcriptional regulator of the FCGR2B promoter activity at this site.The formation of complex c was specific for the MUT probe in both CL-01 and U937 cells (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 3 and 6). The nuclear factor YY1, also known as NF-E1 and UCRBP, has the core consensus binding sequence CCATNTT (14Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 15Yao Y.L. Dupont B.R. Ghosh S. Fang Y. Leach R.J. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3776-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The -343 G → C mutation created a possible YY1 binding site (CCATCAC) to the FCGR2B promoter sequence (Fig. 1C). The MUT-specific complex c was eliminated by an excess of CYY1 competitor in both U937 cells (data not shown) and CL-01 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 16) without affecting other bands. Complex c was not eliminated by addition of the 200-fold excess of CSP1 competitor, used as control (Fig. 2A, lane 17). Supershift formation with YY1 antibodies, but not with SP1 antibodies, established the identity of complex c formed with the MUT probe as being YY1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). Western blot experiments did not show changes in the level of YY1 expression in resting or activated cells (Fig. 2B, right panel). These results suggested that the -343 G to C nucleotide substitution in the FCGR2B promoter created a new binding site for YY1 that may alter the transcriptional activity of the MUT promoter.Complex a1 and a2 had the highest intensity with the AP-1 probe (Figs. 1, A and B, lane 7, and 2A, lane 3). The WT probe formed more intense a1 and a2 complexes compared with the MUT probe (Figs. 1, A and B, lanes 5 and 6, and 2A, lanes 1 and 2). These results pointed out a lower ability of the MUT sequence to bind AP-1 compared with the WT sequence.To confirm that the MUT probe interacted less efficiently with the AP-1 complex, we performed EMSA experiments with nuclear extract from activated CL-01 cells in which 32P-labeled AP-1-specific probes were preincubated with the competitor oligonucleotides CWT and CMUT (Fig. 3A). The concentration of unlabeled CWT or CMUT ranged from 62.5- to 1000-fold excess. Analysis of the intensity of the AP-1 band indicated that 4 times more CMUT was necessary to attain 50% inhibition of AP-1 complex formation compared with using CWT (Fig. 3A,CWT lanes 2–6, and CMUT, lanes 7–11). The graphic representation of the inhibition of optical density of the AP-1 band by increasing concentrations of CWT and CMUT is depicted in Fig. 3B.FIGURE 3Interaction of transcription factors AP-1 and YY1 with the FCGR2B promoter WT and MUT probes. A, EMSA with nuclear extract from PMA:ION-activated CL-01 cells and 32P-labeled AP-1 probe in the absence of competitor (lane 1) and in the presence of increasing amounts (62.5–1000-fold) of unlabeled WT (lanes 2–6) or MUT competitor (lane 7–11).

Biotinylated probes coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads were incubated with nuclear extract from activated CL-01 cells. Bound nuclear factors were eluted and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against YY1, c-Fos, and phosphorylated c-Jun-P73 (Fig. 3C). YY1 was eluted only from the MUT probe, and was undetectable in pull-down assays using AP-1 and WT probes (Fig. 3C, upper panel). c-Fos was eluted from the AP-1 and WT probes, and was not detected in the eluted fraction obtained from the MUT probe (Fig. 3C, middle panel). A higher amount of phosphorylated c-Jun-P73 protein was eluted from the WT probe compared with the MUT probe (Fig. 3C, lower panel). The highest amount of phosphorylated c-Jun-P73 was eluted from the AP-1 probe.We tested whether the -343 G/C polymorphic region participates in transcriptional regulation of the FCGR2B promoter in luciferase reporter assays. WT and MUT promoter constructs (-537 to +43) were inserted into the pGL3-Enhancer vector upstream of the luciferase gene, and transfected into CL-01 cells. The -343 C promoter construct (MUT) had reduced promoter activity (0.6 ± 0.1, p < 0.01, n = 8) compared with the -343 G promoter construct (WT) in CL-01 cells (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4Transcriptional regulation of WT and MUT FCGR2B promoter constructs measured by luciferase reporter assay.

https://openalex.org/W1998294305,"Sorcin is a Ca2+ binding protein implicated in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ cycling and cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Structural and human genetic studies suggest that a naturally occurring sequence variant encoding L112-sorcin disrupts an E-F hand Ca2+ binding domain and may be responsible for a heritable form of hypertension and hypertrophic heart disease. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing L112-sorcin in the heart and characterized the effects on Ca2+ regulation and cardiac function both in vivo and in dissociated cardiomyocytes. Hearts of sorcin(F112L) transgenic mice were mildly dilated but ventricular function was preserved and systemic blood pressure was normal. Sorcin(F112L) myocytes were smaller than control cells and displayed complex alterations in Ca2+ regulation and contractility, including a slowed inactivation of L-type Ca2+ current, enhanced Ca2+ spark width, duration, and frequency, and increased Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. In contrast, mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of wild-type sorcin displayed directionally opposite effects on L-type Ca2+ channel function and Ca2+ spark behavior. These data further define the role of sorcin in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and highlight its negative regulation of SR calcium release. Our results also suggest that additional factors may be responsible for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension in humans expressing the L112-sorcin sequence variant."
https://openalex.org/W2039144824,"To identify genes involved in the mechanism to ensure ordered 5′ to 3′ exon joining in constitutively spliced pre-mRNAs, we screened for mutants that cause exon skipping in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe using a reporter plasmid, which contains the ura4+ gene with the nda3 intron 1-exon 2-intron 2 sequence. The reporter plasmid was designed to produce the functional ura4+ mRNA, when the central nda3 exon is skipped during the splicing reaction. We mutagenized cells harboring the plasmid by UV irradiation and isolated 34 ura+ mutants that grew on minimal medium. Of those, eight mutants were found to be temperature sensitive (ts) for growth. Complementation analyses revealed that the ts mutants belong to three distinct complementation groups named ods (ordered splicing) 1, 2, and 3. RT-PCR analyses showed that products of exon skipping were actually generated in the ods mutants. We cloned the genes responsible for the ods mutations, and found that ods1+, ods2+, and ods3+ encode splicing factors Prp2p/U2AF59, U2AF23, and SF1, respectively, which form a SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex involved in recognition of the branch-point and 3′ splice site sequences in a pre-mRNA. We also showed that mutations in the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 binding sequences in the reporter plasmid result in exon skipping in wild-type S. pombe cells. In addition, drugs that decrease the rate of transcription elongation were found to suppress the exon skipping in the ods mutants. These results suggest that co-transcriptional recognition of a nascent pre-mRNA by the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex is essential for ordered exon joining in constitutive splicing in S. pombe.

These results suggest that co-transcriptional recognition of a nascent pre-mRNA by the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex is essential for ordered exon joining in constitutive splicing in S. pombe. The coding regions of typical metazoan genes are interrupted by multiple noncoding introns. Removal of introns from a pre-mRNA (pre-mRNA splicing) is thus essential for expression of eukaryotic genes. The splicing reaction takes place in a dynamic complex termed a spliceosome (for a review, see Ref. 1Brow D.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A set of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) 2The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; U2AF, U2 snRNP auxiliary factor; ods, ordered splicing; 6-AU, 6-azauracil; MPA, mycophenolic acid; CTD, C-terminal domain; ts, temperature sensitive. and more than 50 accessory proteins are assembled onto each intron to form the spliceosome. Experiments using the in vitro splicing system revealed that, at the initial step for the spliceosome formation, the U1 snRNP binds to the 5′ splice site through base pairing between the splice site and the U1 snRNA. The branchpoint, which is required for formation of a lariat intermediate, and the polypyrimidine tract are bound by SF1 (also called BBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and the large subunit of U2AF (U2AF65), respectively (for a review, see Ref. 2Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, the small subunit of U2AF (U2AF35) binds to AG at the 3′ splice site. The earliest complex containing the U1 snRNP and U2AF in spliceosome assembly is called the E (early) or commitment complex. The U2 snRNP, the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP and other splicing factors are then assembled sequentially to form the final spliceosome, in which the splicing reaction is carried out. In a multi-intron pre-mRNA, alterations in splice site choice can produce diversity in protein synthesis. Such alternative pre-mRNA splicing is now known to be as high as 60% for human genes (3Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In general, alternative splicing occurs in specific sets of introns and exons, and is carried out in a highly regulated manner (3Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Most other exons, in contrast, are joined in an orderly manner and are included in the final mature mRNA that directs the synthesis of a functional protein (constitutive splicing). Although binding of regulatory proteins to pre-mRNA is shown to activate or repress the use of splice sites in alternative splicing (4Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 5Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanisms that ensure ordered exon joining in constitutive splicing. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, more than 43% of the protein-coding genes contain introns, and individual genes can contain up to 15 introns (6Wood V. Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar), some of which have been reported to be alternatively spliced (6Wood V. Nature. 2002; 415: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 7Okazaki K. Niwa O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Habara Y. Urushiyama S. Tani T. Ohshima Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5662-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These facts indicate that the S. pombe splicing system is closer to that of mammals than is the system of S. cerevisiae, in which only a small portion of the genes (about 4% of the total genes) contains an intron and most of them have only one intron per gene (9Blandin G. Durrens P. Tekaia F. Aigle M. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Bon E. Casaregola S. de Montigny J. Gaillardin C. Lepingle A. Llorente B. Malpertuy A. Neuveglise C. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Perrin A. Potier S. Souciet J. Talla E. Toffano-Nioche C. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Marck C. Dujon B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). From that point of view, we have thought that S. pombe is a good model organism to analyze the splicing mechanisms including that for constitutive splicing. In this report, we isolated three classes of mutations that cause exon skipping in S. pombe and revealed that the genes carrying these mutations encode subunits of the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex. We also showed that exon skipping in these mutants was repressed when cells are treated with inhibitors of transcription elongation. These results suggest that the initial co-transcriptional recognition of pre-mRNA by the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex is important to ensure ordered exon joining in constitutive splicing.

Appropriate growth supplements (adenine, leucine, and uracil, 80 mg/liter each) were added to MM. SPA medium was used for induction of mating and sporulation of S. pombe (10Gutz H. Heslot H.

Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1984; 39: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) by PCR amplification from the cloned gene (kindly provided by M. Yanagida) and inserted it into the StuI site of the ura4+ gene on the pURA4 plasmid (14Humphrey T. Sadhale P. Platt T. Proudfoot N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3503-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which carries the ARS1 autonomously replicating sequence and the S. cerevisiae LEU2 gene. The resultant ura4 construct (pURA4β) was sequenced to confirm that the inserted β-tubulin sequence and the ura4+ coding sequence are intact. Isolation of ods Mutants—Cells from an S. pombe strain (UR471, Table 1) that is auxotrophic for leucine and uracil were transformed with pURA4β and cultured for 20 h at 26 °C in minimal medium (MM) containing uracil (MMU). After two washes with MM, cells were spread on MM plates at a density of about 500,000 cells per plate. Cells were then irradiated with a 254-nm germicidal UV light at a flux of 100 J/m2 using a CL-1000 UV cross-linker (UVP Inc., Cambridge, UK), and incubated at 26 °C for up to 10 days. Colonies that grew on MM plates were then selected. Of those, mutants that are temperature sensitive for growth were chosen for further analyses. To check that their growth on MM plates was due to exon-skipped transcripts from pURA4β, the plasmid was dropped from cells by streaking on YPD plates successively several times. Growth abilities of the mutants that lost the plasmid were then analyzed. All the isolated mutants could not grow on MM plates without pURA4β. Genetic Analyses—The isolated mutants were crossed with a leu– ura– strain (UR470, Table 1) and tetrad analysis was performed. Analysis of 10 tetrads for each mutant showed that the ts and wild-type phenotypes segregated 2:2 in all cases. Each mutant was backcrossed at least three times with UR470. Co-segregation of the exon skipping phenotype (ura+) with the ts phenotype was confirmed by re-transformation of backcrossed mutants with pURA4β. To determine whether the ts mutations in isolated mutants are dominant or recessive, heterozygous diploids were obtained by crossing with strain RS1 (Table 1). All diploids grew at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C, demonstrating that the mutations were recessive. Preparation of RNA and RT-PCR—Cells containing pURA4β were grown in 10 ml of appropriate medium (MMU for wild-type cells and MM for ods muants) to mid-log phase at the permissive temperature (26 or 30 °C), and then shifted to the restrictive temperature (37 °C) for 2 h. In the case of snh29, cells were cultured to the mid-log phase at 26 °C and shifted to the restrictive temperatures of 30 or 36 °C for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with sterile water, and total RNA was prepared by glass beads disruption as described by Urushiyama et al. (15Urushiyama S. Tani T. Ohshima Y. Genetics. 1997; 147: 101-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yield of total RNA was usually 40–200 μg. RNA samples were treated with RQ1 RNase free DNase (Promega) in 5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 1 h to remove contaminating genomic DNA, followed by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitation. Reverse transcription was then performed using Ready-To-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads (Amersham Biosciences), 3.33 μm gene-specific RT primer (tub-4: 5′-CTTTGGAAGACATTTCAGC-3′) or oligo dT (50 mer), and 2 μg of total RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was done in a solution containing Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa), 0.2 mm dNTP mix, 3.33 μm 5′-forward primer (tub-3: 5′-ATATGCATCTGGTGTGTAC-3′), 3.33 μm tub-4 primer, and 2 μl of reverse-transcribed cDNAs. The tub-3 and tub-4 primers are complementary to the 3′-end of the ura4+ first exon and the 5′-end of the ura4+ second exon, respectively. The amplified products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide solution (1 μg/ml). Southern Blot Analysis—After electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, the amplified products were transferred onto a Gene Screen Plus filter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary blotting and detected by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the sequence in the ura4+ mRNA produced by the exon skipping spliced product (5′-TCTTTGAGGCCTTGTATA-3′), which was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 568-572Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed in a solution containing 6× SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml boiled salmon sperm DNA and the 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C. After hybridization, filters were exposed to a Fuji imaging plate and analyzed using a Bioimaging Analyzer BAS-1500 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Site-directed Mutagenesis of pURA4β—The various mutations of pURA4β were generated by site directed mutagenesis of single-stranded DNA using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligonucleotides listed in Table 2.TABLE 2List of oligonucleotidesNamesSequencesPrimers for RT-PCR analysis tub-35′-atatgcatctggtgtgtac-3′ tub-45′-ctttggaagacatttcagc-3′Probe for exon-skipped product ura4 probe5′-tctttgaggccttgtata-3′Oligonucleotides for site directed mutagenesis nda3In1-3mut-15′-gctattttaatattcaaagtgattaaaaaggttcatattcaagctgg-3′ nda3In1-3mut-1′5′-ccagcttgaatatgaacctttttaatcactttgaatattaaaatagc-3′ nda3In1-3mut-25′-gctattttaatattcaaagtgattaaaactgttcatattcaagctgg-3′ nda3In1-3mut-2′5′-ccagcttgaatatgaacagttttaatcactttgaatattaaaatagc-3′ nda3In1-3mut-35′-gctattttaatattcaaagctaatcaatctgttcatattcaagctgg-3′ nda3In1-3mut-3′5′-ccagcttgaatatgaacagattgattagctttgaatattaaaatagc-3′ nda3In2-5ss.mut5′-ccaagtcggtgcggccttttgaagagcaaaatctactttg-3′ nda3In2-5ss.mut′5′-caaagtagattttgctcttcaaaaggccgcaccgacttgg-3′ In2 polyY-s5′-tttaatattcaaagctaatgcttggaaggttcatattcaagctggtc-3′ In2 polyY-as5′-gaccagcttgaatatgaaccttccaagcattagctttgaatattaaa-3′ In2 bps-s5′-gagctattttaatattcaaaactaaccaataggttcatattcaagc-3′ In2 bps-as5′-gcttgaatatgaacctattggttagttttgaatattaaaatagctc-3′ In2 5′ss-s5′-cgagggtattatacaagggtaagcactattttaatattcaaagct-3′ In2 5′ss-as5′-agctttgaatattaaaatagtgcttacccttgtataataccctcg-3′ In2 bps-polyY-s5′-tttaatattcaaaactaacgcttggaaggttcatattcaagctggtc-3′ In2 bps-polyY-as5′-gaccagcttgaatatgaaccttccaagcgttagttttgaatattaaa-3′ Open table in a new tab Analyses of Exon Skipping using Drugs That Slow the Transcription Elongation—Strain UR471 (Table 1) or ods1-1 cells harboring pURA4β were cultured in MM containing uracil at 26 °C to A600 of 0.5. After washing once with sterilized water, cells were resuspended in MM containing 6-azauracil (6-AU, 0.08 mg/ml) or mycophenolic acid (MPA, 0.1 mg/ml) and then incubated with shaking for 4 h at 26°C. After cultivation, total RNAs were isolated and subjected to RT-PCR analyses with the tub-3 and tub-4 primers, as described above, to detect the exon skipping. Isolation of S. pombe Mutants That Cause Exon Skipping—To isolate S. pombe mutants that induce exon skipping, we constructed a reporter plasmid (pURA4β) carrying a chimeric ura4+ gene, in which the intron 1-exon 2-intron 2 sequence of the nda3+ gene was inserted at a site previously shown to tolerate the insertion of an artificial intron (17Gatermann K.B. Hoffman A. Rosenberg G.H. Käufer N.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 1526-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In ura– cells harboring pURA4β, if skipping of the inserted β-tubulin exon occurs, then functional ura4+ mRNA is regenerated, and the cells are expected to become prototrophic for uracil, resulting in growth on minimal medium (MM) (Fig. 1B). We mutagenized about 15 million cells containing pURA4β by UV irradiation and isolated 34 ura+ mutants that grew on MM plates. Of those, eight mutants (snh4, 19, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, and 34) were temperature-sensitive for growth (Fig. 2A) and chosen for further analyses.FIGURE 2A, temperature sensitive growth of the isolated mutants. Each mutant and the wild type strain (UR471) was streaked on YEALU plates and incubated at indicated temperatures for 5 days. B, growth of the isolated mutants on MM plates depends on the pURA4β plasmid. The mutant cells transformed with the vector could not grow on an MM plate. C, complementation analyses of the isolated ods mutants. All isolated odsts mutants were crossed with the wild-type haploid strain (UR471) or each of the isolated odsts mutants to produce diploid strains. Resultant diploid strains were streaked on two YEALU plates. One was then incubated at 26 °C and the other at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To exclude a possibility that the ura+ phenotype of the isolated mutants resulted from mutations in the intron-containing ura+ gene of the reporter plasmid, we dropped the plasmid from the mutants and then re-introduced pURA4β. As expected, the mutant cells without pURA4β could not grow on MM plates; whereas, mutant cells re-transformed with pURA4β recovered the ability to grow on MM plates (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the expression of the ura+ phenotype of the isolated mutants depended on pURA4β and probably resulted from exon skipping in the splicing of pre-mRNAs from the intron-containing ura4+ gene. The mutants were backcrossed three times with a wild-type strain to remove extra mutations. Tetrad analysis showed 2:2 segregation of the ts– and ts+ phenotypes in all cases, suggesting that the ts– phenotype is caused by a single mutation. The ability to grow on MM co-segregated with the ts– phenotype in all the mutants, indicating that in each mutant a single mutation is responsible for both phenotypes. All mutations are recessive, as the heterozygous diploids with the wild-type alleles grew well at the restrictive temperature. After backcrossing, each mutant was subjected to complementation analysis in all combinations. As shown in Fig. 2C, the isolated mutants fell into three different complementation groups named ods (ordered splicing) 1 to 3. We categorized snh4, 25, 28, 29, and 32 in ods1, snh19 in ods2, and snh33 and 34 in ods3, respectively. Detection of Exon Skipping Products in the ods Mutants—To demonstrate that exon skipping is induced in ods mutants, we isolated total RNAs from wild type (UR471) and ods cells carrying pURA4β and subjected them to RT-PCR analyses using primers for amplification of the intron-containing region of the chimeric ura4+ gene. The amplified products were then analyzed by an electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, followed by Southern blot analysis using an oligonucleotide probe that specifically recognized the exon-skipped product. In ods1, ods2, and ods3 cells we observed three major bands corresponding to pre-mRNAs with two introns, partially spliced mRNAs containing only the second intron and constitutively spliced mature mRNAs (Fig. 3). In addition to these major bands, a small amount of an amplified product predicted to be the exon-skipped ura4+ mRNA was observed in gels stained with ethidium bromide (Fig. 3, upper panel). Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3, lower panel) and the sequence analysis (not shown) of the products revealed that those are actually derived from the exon-skipped transcripts. In contrast, bands for pre-mRNA with two introns and exon-skipped products were barely detected in the wild-type cells. From these results, we concluded that skipping of the central exon in the chimeric ura4+ pre-mRNA was induced in the isolated mutants, although the amount of the exon skipping products is low compared with those for constitutively spliced mRNAs or unspliced products. Cloning of the ods1+, ods2+, and ods3+ Genes—To clone the ods1+, ods2+, and ods3+ genes, we transformed each ods mutant with an S. pombe genomic library, and isolated clones that were able to complement the ts– growth defects. In the case of the ods1-1 (snh4) mutation, we obtained two cosmid clones that rescued the ts– phenotype: the complementing activity localized to a 9.5-kb XhoI/SacII fragment in a region shared by the two clones (Fig. 4A). That fragment contains the prp2+ gene encoding the large subunit (U2AF59) of the U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF), which binds to a polypyrimidine tract between the branchpoint sequence and the 3′ splice site (18Potashkin J. Naik K. Wentz-Hunter K. Science. 1993; 22: 573-575Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Ramfo C.M. Lakhe-Reddy S. Wise J.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As only the subcloned fragment that included the complete prp2+ gene could rescue the ts– phenotype, we presumed that the ods1 mutation resides in the prp2+ gene. Sequence analysis of the prp2 gene in ods1-1 revealed a single nucleotide change (G to A) at position 919 of the protein-coding region, which results in replacement of aspartic acid at amino acid 307 of the Prp2 protein with aspargine. The prp2 alleles in the snh25, snh28, and snh32 mutants were found to have the identical mutation. Thus, we categorized these mutant strains as ods1-1. We named snh29 as ods1-2 as it has a C to A change at nucleotide position 1148 of the protein-coding region, which results in replacement of alanine with glutamine at amino acid 383 in the Prp2 protein. Identification of mutations in the prp2 gene in the ods1 mutants establishes that the ods1+ gene is identical with prp2+. We also isolated ten cosmid clones that rescue the ts– phenotype of ods2-1. Restriction mapping revealed that those clones contained the same DNA insert (data not shown). After subcloning, we found that a 1.5-kb XhoI/NdeI fragment including only the U2AF23 gene is able to complement the ods2-1 (snh19) mutation (Fig. 4B). Sequence analysis of the U2AF23 gene in ods2-1 revealed that there is a C to G change at nucleotide position 447 of the protein-coding region, resulting in replacement of cystein with tryptophan. These results suggest that the ods2 mutation resides in the gene encoding U2AF23, a small subunit of U2AF (20Webb C.J. Wise J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4229-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As for the cloning of the ods3+ gene, we isolated 21 clones able to complement the ts– phenotype of ods3-1 (snh33). Of those, we analyzed three independent clones. Restriction mapping analysis revealed that those clones contain the same overlapped genomic region of 4410 bp in length. In that overlapped region, there is a single complete ORF (SPCC962.06c), which encodes S. pombe SF1 (Fig. 4C). Sequence analysis of the sf1 gene in ods3-1 revealed that there is a C to A change at nucleotide position 301 of the protein-coding region, resulting in replacement of glutamine with lysine at amino acid 101 of the SF1 protein. snh33 and snh34 contained the same C to A mutation described above; both alleles were designated as ods3-1. SF1 has been shown to form a tight complex with U2AF59 and U2AF23 that may represent the earliest pre-spliceosome complex in S. pombe (21Huang T. Vilardell J. Query C.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutations in the SF1-U2AF 59-U2AF23 Binding Sequence in the First Intron Cause Exon Skipping—We found that the genes responsible for the ods1, ods2, and ods3 mutations encode components of the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex, suggesting that the complex plays an important role to ensure ordered exon joining during the splicing reaction. To examine further requirement of the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex in ordered splicing, we mutagenized the sequence of the binding site region for the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex (21Huang T. Vilardell J. Query C.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), that is, the region spanning from the branch site to the 3′ splice site, in the chimeric ura4+ gene, as shown in Fig. 5A. The putative branch site sequence GCTAAT, which matches the S. pombe branch site consensus sequence PuCT-PuAPy (Pu, purine; Py, pyrimidine) (22Kuhn A.N. Käufer N.F. Curr. Genet. 2003; 42: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was changed to GTGATT and two pyrimidines between the branch site and the 3′ splice site were changed to A. The conserved 3′ splice site AG was also mutagenized to CT. In addition to those mutations, we generated a mutation in the 5′ splice site of the second intron. The mutations were introduced into the ura4 reporter gene plasmid in all combinations. The efficiency of exon-skipping was then evaluated by growth of transformants on MM plates and Southern blot analyses of the RT-PCR products amplified from total RNAs prepared from the transformants. Fig. 5B shows the results of the growth test on MM plates. The cells transformed with the plasmid containing the mutation at the 5′ splice site could not grow on MM, suggesting that, as with the unmutated ura4β construct in wild-type cells, exon skipping did not occur, which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the transformants with the plasmid carrying the branch site mutation grew well on MM (Fig. 5B), and the product of exon skipping was detected by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 5C, lanes 3, 4, 6, and 7). Interestingly, the mutation of the branch site in the first intron results in accumulation of pre-mRNA containing not only the first intron, but also the second intron, suggesting that the splicing of the second intron was also impaired to some extent by the mutation in the first intron (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 4). In the case of the transformant with the 3′ splice site mutation (Fig. 5A, mutant 5), growth on MM was slow (Fig. 5B), and the amount of the exon-skipped product was low (Fig. 5C, lane 5). Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR product revealed that a cryptic 3′ splice site localized 13 nucleotides downstream of the authentic 3′ splice site in the first intron was used for the splicing of this mutant pre-mRNA. In construct 4, combining the 3′ splice site and branch point mutations appear to decrease the efficiency of exon skipping compared with construct 3, which has only the branch site mutation (Fig. 5C, lane 4). Addition of the 5′ splice site mutation in the second intron to the branch site mutation in the first intron did not enhance the exon skipping above that produces by the branch point mutation alone (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 3 and 6). As expected, addition of both the 3′ splice site mutation in the first intron and the 5′ splice site mutation in the second intron to the branch point mutation in the first intron abolished splicing of both the first and second introns separately and promoted exon skipping exclusively (Fig. 5C, lane 7). The plasmid containing mutations of both the 3′ and 5′ splice sites also caused exon skipping, but the efficiency was lower than that of the gene with the branch site mutation (Fig. 5C, lane 8). These results, which demonstrate that cis-acting mutations in the region recognized by the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex cause the same type of exon skipping as trans-acting mutations in the subunits, support a role for the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex in the maintenance of orderly, constitutive splicing in multi-exon pre-mRNAs. Treatment of the ods Mutants with Drugs That Slow the Transcription Elongation Represses Exon Skipping—Recently, Howe et al. (23Howe K.J. Kane C.M. Ares Jr., M. RNA. 2003; 9: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) found that exon skipping in S. cerevisiae is suppressed when transcription is slowed by treatment of cells with 6-azauracil (6-AU) or mycophenolic acid (MPA), inhibitors of nucleotide biosyntheis that deplete cellular nucleotide pools required for efficient transcription by RNA polymerase (23Howe K.J. Kane C.M. Ares Jr., M. RNA. 2003; 9: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Based on this phenomenon, Howe et al. (23Howe K.J. Kane C.M. Ares Jr., M. RNA. 2003; 9: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) speculated that a drug-induced reduction in the rate of transcript elongation relative to splicing represses exon skipping by allowing more time for branchpoint recognition in the first intron to occur before the second intron is transcribed. Using our pURA4β reporter system, we examined how the rate of transcriptional elongation affects the fidelity of ordered exon joining in the ods mutants. We found that both 6-AU (0.08 mg/ml) and MPA (0.1 mg/ml) induced impaired growth of ods mutant cells on MM at 26 °C, suggesting suppression of exon skipping (data not shown), which was confirmed by the reduction of the exon-skipped product detected by RT-PCR followed by Southern blot analysis with the probe specific for the exon-skipped product (Fig. 6). As the amounts of the constitutively spliced chimeric ura4 product (Fig. 6, upper left panel) and actin transcript (lower left panel) were not changed, decrease of the exon-skipped product seems not to be the outcome from the general inhibition of the transcription. Rather, it appears that a shift in the choice of splicing pathway from exon skipping to exon inclusion has occurred as a result of the slowed elongation of the nascent transcript. To understand the molecular mechanisms that ensure ordered exon joining in constitutive splicing, we screened for mutations that cause exon-skipping during splicing of the pre-mRNA transcribed from a reporter gene and found that all of the mutations fell within the three genes that encode the subunits of the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex, which is essential for the recognition of the branchpoint sequence and the 3′ splice site (2Reed R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cis-acting mutations that reproduced the exon skipping phenotype of the mutations in the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex confirmed the importance of branchpoint recognition in the maintenance of ordered exon joining. In the isolated ods mutants, the amounts of the exon-skipped products detected were low, although those were sufficient to support growth of the plasmid-bearing mutants on MM (Figs. 2 and 3). ods mutations would also affect splicing of pre-mRNAs from endogenous genes, in addition to splicing of transcripts from the pURA4β reporter plasmid. Actually, we detected a small amount of exon 2-skipped transcripts from the endogenous nda3+ gene in the ods1-1 mutant (data not shown). As severe splicing perturbations result in cell mortality, ods alleles that cause strong induction of exon skipping are expected to be difficult to recover in our screening. We showed that mutating the 5′ splice site of the second intron produced exclusive retention of the mutated intron during splicing, in contrast to the case of vertebrates that causes exon skipping (24Robberson B.L. Cote G.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). This result indicates that splicing in fission yeast is conducted via intron definition, which is consistent with the data reported by Romfo et al. (25Romfo C.M. Alvarez C.J. van Heeckeren W.J. Webb C.J. Wise J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7955-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to induction of exon skipping, branchpoint mutations that block splicing of the first intron decreases the splicing efficiency of the second intron, leading to accumulation of the unspliced pre-mRNA (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 4). Contrary, the 5′ splice site mutation in the second intron neither significantly reduces the efficiency of the first intron splicing, nor induces exon skipping (Fig. 5C, lane 2). There might be a mechanism that represses splicing of the downstream intron when splicing of the preceding intron is inhibited, besides a mechanism that induces exon skipping. In S. pombe, SF1 was shown to bind U2AF59 and U2AF23 and form a stable complex required for pre-spliceosome complex A formation (21Huang T. Vilardell J. Query C.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5516-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical experiments in S. cerevisiae have shown that BBP (a homologue of SF1) interacts directly with both Mud2p (a homologue of U2AF65) and the U1 snRNP protein Prp40p (26Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). As BBP and Prp40p are involved in recognition of the branchpoint sequence and the 5′ splice site, respectively, the interaction is thought to define bridging between the two ends of an intron (26Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In mammals, SF1 interacts with U2AF65 and with U1C through FBP21, a Prp40p like protein, indicating that the interaction between SF1 and Prp40p is conserved among organisms (26Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Interestingly, S. cerevisiae Prp40p was shown to bind the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of elongating RNA polymerase II, suggesting co-transcriptional formation of a commitment complex for splicing (27Morris D.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39935-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, mutations in the DYN2 gene that reduce recognition of the branchpoint sequence in the first intron cause exon skipping, indicating that efficient recognition of the first intron is important for exon inclusion (23Howe K.J. Kane C.M. Ares Jr., M. RNA. 2003; 9: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment of cells with inhibitors for nucleotide biosynthesis that reduce the rate of transcription elongation was found to inhibit exon skipping in vivo. Those observations are consistent with the predictions of the previously proposed “first come, first served” model, which suggest the co-transcriptional recognition of splice sites (28Aebi M. Weissmann C. Trend Genet. 1987; 3: 102-107Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this report, we provided another evidence supporting the “first come, first served” model in S. pombe. We found that mutations in the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex or the reporter gene that affect branchpoint recognition enhances exon skipping in S. pombe. We also showed that drugs that slow transcription elongation suppress exon skipping in the ods mutants, suggesting that co-transcriptional recognition of a nascent pre-mRNA by the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex is essential for ordered 5′ to 3′ exon joining. Taken together with the previously reported results mentioned above, we propose the ordered splicing model shown in Fig. 7. In this model, the U1 snRNP bound to the CTD of elongating RNA polymerase II through Prp40p recognizes the 5′ splice site of a nascent transcript first, and then the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex associated with U1 snRNP through Prp40p recognizes the branchpoint sequence and the 3′ splice site, which appears in the transcript as transcription proceeds (Fig. 7A). In this model, the association between U1 snRNP and the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex via Prp40p assures co-transcriptional ordered exon joining. In the ods mutants, reduced fidelity of the branchpoint recognition in the first intron by mutations in the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex might induce exon skipping (Fig. 7B). If U1 snRNP is stalled at the 5′ splice site of the first intron, as shown in Fig. 7B, then recognition of the 5′ splice site of the second intron by U1 snRNP would be hampered, which may explain a mechanism for repression of the second intron splicing by mutations in the first intron (Fig. 5C). The vast majority of metazoan pre-mRNAs have multiple introns, which typically range in size from 103 to 104 nucleotides. Exons in these pre-mRNAs are relatively short, averaging less than 200 nucleotides. It has been thought that initial splice site recognition in metazoan pre-mRNAs is established across a short exon (exon definition), rather than across an intron with long length (29Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, in contrast, introns are short (the average size is 107 nucleotides) relative to exons that appear not to be constrained in size (30Kupfer D.M. Drabenstot S.D. Buchanan K.L. Lai H. Zhu H. Dyer D.W. Roe B.A. Murphy W. Euk. Cells. 2004; 3: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, there is less of a need for a system that recognizes exons in this organism. In S. pombe, a system with a strong dependence on recognition of the branch-point-3′ splice site sequence by the SF1-U2AF59-U2AF23 complex might have evolved to make sure that a spliceosome is not assembled until both the 5′ and 3′ splice sites in an intron are recognized.

As the pipeline of new antibiotics slows to a trickle, scientists are developing innovative strategies to unearth antibacterial compounds in unexpected places. Resistance of microbial pathogens to an increasing number of antibiotics is a serious problem. In the US alone, 90,000 people die every year from infections acquired while in the hospital. According to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), 70% of these deaths have been attributed to infection with drug-resistant bacteria, in particular methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Compounding the problem, the World Health Organization warned in September of a new form of tuberculosis, XDR-TB, caused by a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium that leaves patients virtually untreatable with current anti-TB drugs. Despite this threat, the pipeline of new antibiotics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is running dry. The number of new antibiotics is now about 60% lower than in the mid-1980s, says Brad Spellberg, an infectious disease specialist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, CA. “It's a straight line down,” he says. Since the 1960s, only two new classes of antibiotics have been introduced in the clinic, linezolid in 2000 and daptomycin in 2003, says Jun Wang, a senior biochemist at Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, NJ. The IDSA estimates that about a dozen new antibiotics are in late clinical testing. But most of them, says Spellberg, are “me-too” drugs comprising modifications to existing compounds or members of known classes of antibiotics. “That doesn't help us treat drug resistant bacteria,” Spellberg points out, because they are often not sufficiently different to overcome resistance. Pharmaceutical companies are less interested in developing antibiotics than drugs that treat lifelong diseases because people only take antibiotics for a short time, notes Spellberg. “There has been at least as many drugs developed over the last 12 to 13 years for HIV as compared to all bacterial infections put together,” he says. “It's all about money.” It takes 250–500 patients treated with an antibiotic for every patient on a medication for a chronic disease to get the same return on investment, says Christopher Spivey, manager of business development at the nonprofit Alliance for the Prudent use of Antibiotics (APUA) in Boston, MA. “That's why companies have been walking away.” The reason that the antibiotics pipeline is running dry is not only money but also because the search has become more challenging. The first antibiotic, discovered by the British microbiologist Alexander Fleming in the 1920s, came from a mold, Penicillium notatum. Since then, soil-dwelling microorganisms have been the traditional source of antibiotics. But searching for antibiotics the old way—culturing soil bacteria and screening them for compounds they produce that kill bacterial pathogens—means that the same antibiotics are discovered over and over again, in part because those already identified are potent and highly concentrated, says Merck's Wang. We have run out of soil bacteria that are easy to culture, says Kim Lewis, a microbiologist at Northeastern University in Boston, MA: “As with a gold mine, you mine it out and it ends.” Some companies are moving away from a dependence on soil bacteria, instead screening libraries of synthetic compounds for their antimicrobial properties. Pfizer researchers are using the genomic sequence information of different bacterial strains to identify bacterial survival genes. They then screen millions of synthetic chemicals to find those that interfere with the products of these essential genes. This approach has yielded three new compounds that are now in clinical trials and a few more that will be soon, says Paul Miller, head of Therapeutic Area Research for Antibacterials at Pfizer. But this strategy is not always successful. Between 1995 and 2001, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) did 70 high-throughput screens of synthetic chemical and other libraries for inhibitors of essential bacterial targets. The success rate was 4–5 times lower than with mammalian cell targets, says David Payne, director of microbiology at GSK in Collegeville, PA. One reason, he says, is that bacterial enzymes are harder to inhibit because they have evolved for longer and are well suited to harsh conditions. Wyeth had a similar experience. “Having had a similar degree of futility to GSK using high-throughput screening, we are certainly not going to do that ourselves in the future,” says Steven Projan, vice president for biological technologies at Wyeth Research in Cambridge, MA. “Right now we are doing very little antibacterial drug discovery.” Screening efforts may fail because many compounds cannot get into bacterial cells or are toxic to mammalian cells as well as bacteria or because bacteria have transporter proteins that can pump out synthetic compounds. Given the mixed success of large screening efforts, it may be difficult to get big pharmaceutical companies interested. That's where APUA plans to help by developing a not-for-profit screening library that would be funded by corporate sponsors and public money. This would spread the risk, and companies would have to pay less for the initial screening effort, says Michael Feldgarden, APUA's research director. There are plenty of antibiotic hunters who have not given up on nature. Some research groups are trying to isolate rare bacteria or antibiotics from soil and are devising methods to grow hard-to-culture soil bacteria in the lab. Others are isolating DNA directly from the soil, using it as a blueprint to produce antibiotics, or are looking for bacteria in unusual places, such as in lichens, seaweed, or deep sea mud. Merck scientists are using a new method to screen for antibiotics at such low concentrations that they would be missed in traditional screens. First, bacteria are made more sensitive to potential antibiotics using antisense RNA to induce the microbes to make less of a certain target enzyme that is essential for survival. Inhibitors of that target enzyme then block the growth of the sensitized bacteria to a greater extent than the growth of the wild-type strain. Selecting a target that is essential for survival across a broad range of bacteria could yield an inhibitor capable of blocking the growth of many different bacterial strains. The Merck team have screened extracts of 83,000 bacterial strains from soil samples across the globe under three different growth conditions. From a South African soil sample, they isolated Platensimycin, a member of a new class of antibiotics that can kill MRSA in vitro. Platensimycin inhibits FabF, a bacterial enzyme that synthesizes membrane fatty acids. The bacterial strain that produced Platensimycin can be cultured in the lab, but, as Julian Davies, a microbiologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, points out, at least 99% of soil bacteria cannot be cultured in vitro. “We know less about soil than we do about outer space,” Davies says. One gram of soil, he says, contains at least 1,000 different species of bacteria. That's why Northeastern University's Lewis is developing ways to culture “unculturable” soil bacteria, to find those strains that make new antibiotics. “We have a protocol to domesticate them,” Lewis says. “They don't know that they are not in their environment.” The bacteria are cultured in chambers that separate them from the environment physically, but not chemically. “We just bring big buckets of soil in the lab and then insert the chambers into the soil,” he says. Lewis cofounded NovoBiotic Pharmaceuticals, based in Cambridge, MA, which uses this strategy to find new antibiotics. Already, the company has isolated thousands of bacterial strains, mainly from soil, and currently is focusing on about 200 that seem “especially interesting,” Lewis says. Meanwhile, other scientists are not even trying to culture recalcitrant soil bacteria. Instead, they isolate DNA directly from the soil, express the DNA in host bacteria in the lab, and then screen for antibiotic production—a strategy called metagenomics. One advantage is that the several dozen genes that bacteria use to synthesize antibiotics are usually arranged together in a cluster. But to get a complete cluster entails isolating a large chunk of DNA (about 100 kb), and it can be difficult for host organisms in the lab to express genes in this DNA. Not everyone is convinced that the metagenomics strategy will work. There is only proof of principle that this approach can lead to compounds with antibiotic activity, Davies says. “I don't think any of the things that have been found will become drugs.” Jo Handelsman of the University of Wisconsin, Madison has developed a way to screen for metagenomic DNA clusters that produce small molecules, some of which could be antibiotics. A reporter gene expressing green fluorescent protein detects very low concentrations of these small molecules inside the bacterial cell with the metagenomic DNA. Handelsman says this system has identified one known antibiotic, which shows that the method works. She is currently sequencing about 200 bacterial clones containing metagenomic DNA from soil collected in a remote corner of Alaska, which due to the harsh environment may yield new bacterial species. Handelsman hopes the sequences will reveal clones that look like they might synthesize new antibiotics. The Wisconsin-based company eMetagen has identified about a dozen bacterial clones from Wisconsin agricultural soil that appear to produce compounds with in vitro activity against MRSA, says Robert Goodman, one of the company's co-founders. At least one of them might belong to a new class of antibiotics. For now, the company is focusing on two compounds to determine their structure and to do initial toxicity testing in animals. The company has been able to create libraries with an average insert size of 50 kb, he says. Next, the company hopes to get better expression of the genes in its soil bacterial library by switching from a gram-negative host (Escherichia coli) to a gram-positive host. “Many of the genomic DNAs we are accumulating are probably from gram-positive organisms,” Goodman says. Not everyone has had success with the metagenomics approach, however. The Lexington, MA based company Cubist Pharmaceuticals tried it for several years, but then gave up, says Jeff Alder, vice president for drug discovery and evaluation. He says too many technical steps were required, often yielding false positives after a lot of effort. “It is just so difficult to get a big piece of DNA, get it expressed and then screen and [only then] find out what's valuable,” he says. Instead, Cubist researchers are trying to culture soil bacteria that are so rare that they have been overlooked. Alder says the trick is to use indicator bacteria that are resistant to most known antibiotics. Only bacterial strains that produce new compounds can kill these indicator bacteria in test assays. About 1–2 out of every 10,000 strains tested are able to kill the indicator bacteria, says Alder, and 70% of these promising bacteria have never been described before. Soil is not the only source of new bacterial strains. Brian Austin, a microbiologist at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, has isolated bacteria from seaweed and seawater. However, they only started to make antibiotic compounds when he cultured them on a sponge from his local supermarket. So far, he has found two new compounds that show antibiotic activity against MRSA in vitro. He says both antibiotic-producing strains are now with a company for further evaluation. Sifting through marine mud, oceanographer William Fenical of the Scripps Institution in La Jolla, CA has found several new bacterial strains that produce antibacterial compounds. And Davies has isolated about 2000 bacterial strains that grow on lichens, half of which show some kind of antibiotic activity. Currently, he is focusing on two compounds that appear to be new, one of which is being further investigated by a major pharmaceutical company. Fungi, too, have not been forgotten. The Danish company Novozymes has isolated an antimicrobial peptide called plectasin from a fungus that inhabits European pine forests. Plectasin kills MRSA in mice, and Novozymes is planning an early clinical trial of this compound in 2008. The Philadelphia-based company PolyMedix has made artificial molecules with similar properties to antimicrobial peptides. Their lead compound can kill both MRSA and TB in vitro, and PolyMedix plans early clinical trials next year. Despite these encouraging leads, one major hurdle for many small biotech companies is to pay for clinical trials once they have identified a compound. “We are going to have to do this in partnership with a drug company,” says eMetagen's Goodman. Novozymes says it will pay for phase I trials but is looking for partners to take over the project after that. PolyMedix also plans to fund initial trials but is engaged in partnering discussions with major pharmaceutical companies, says Nicholas Landekic, the company's President and CEO. He says the company has raised much of the funding from selling stock and plans to apply for grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to pay for part of the cost. But overall, he says, such grants could only pay for a small portion of the total costs of clinical development. Most small companies will probably have a similar mix of financing, he says, although many can't pay for clinical trials at all. “Thus many products simply do not ever get developed,” Landekic says. At least for this year, NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is offering contracts to support several early clinical trials of antibacterial drugs, according to Michael Kurilla, Director of the Office of Biodefense Research Affairs at NIAID. “If you have a successful phase I/phase II that we have supported you are going to look very attractive to a large pharmaceutical company to take on a phase III trial,” he says. Spellberg, for his part, calls for legislative incentives to get big pharmaceutical companies back into antibiotic development for the long haul. After all, he says, new antibiotics will always be needed. “Bacteria are going to become resistant to everything we come up with, it's just a matter of time.” He may well be right. According to a study in Science earlier this year, resistance to even the newest antibiotics, including synthetic antimicrobials, may already exist in nature. The authors screened 480 strains of soil bacteria from different environments against 21 antibiotics and found them to be resistant, on average, to 7 antibiotics, even those bacteria from remote areas. Many were resistant to the new semisynthetic antibiotic tigecycline, which was approved for use only last year. While the findings sound a note of doom, they do give us the opportunity to look for resistance mechanisms in nature as an early warning system, before they are found in hospital bacteria, says Gerard D. Wright of McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, who led the study. “Resistance is inevitable,” Wright says. “There is no such thing as an irresistible antibiotic; no matter what chemistry you can think of, because the organisms have been around for so long, they figured out a way to survive. And they will.”"
