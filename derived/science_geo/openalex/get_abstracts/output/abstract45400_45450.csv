https://openalex.org/W2094387116,"Predicting the extinction of single populations or species requires ecological and evolutionary information. Primary demographic factors affecting population dynamics include social structure, life history variation caused by environmental fluctuation, dispersal in spatially heterogeneous environments, and local extinction and colonization. In small populations, inbreeding can greatly reduce the average individual fitness, and loss of genetic variability from random genetic drift can diminish future adaptability to a changing environment. Theory and empirical examples suggest that demography is usually of more immediate importance than population genetics in determining the minimum viable sizes of wild populations. The practical need in biological conservation for understanding the interaction of demographic and genetic factors in extinction may provide a focus for fundamental advances at the interface of ecology and evolution."

Trees can emit significant quantities of hydrocarbons to metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, and model calculations indicate that these natural emissions can significantly affect urban ozone levels. By neglecting these compounds, previous investigators may have overestimated the effectiveness of an ozone abatement strategy based on reducing anthropogenic hydrocarbons."

https://openalex.org/W2094866017,"The imaging of phosphorescence provides a method for monitoring oxygen distribution within the vascular system of intact tissues. Isolated rat lives were perfused through the portal vein with media containing palladium coproporphyrin, which phosphoresced and was used to image the liver at various perfusion rates. Because oxygen is a powerful quenching agent for phosphors, the transition from well-perfused liver to anoxia (no flow of oxygen) resulted in large increases of phosphorescence. During stepwise restoration of oxygen flow, the phosphorescence images showed marked heterogeneous patterns of tissue reoxygenation, which indicated that there were regional inequalities in oxygen delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2064185923,"Mesoderm induction in the amphibian embryo can be studied by exposing animal region explants (destined to become ectoderm) to appropriate stimuli and assaying the appearance of mesodermal products like alpha-actin messenger RNA. Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), but not TGF-beta 1, was active in alpha-actin induction, while addition of fibroblast growth factor had a small synergistic effect. Medium conditioned by Xenopus XTC cells (XTC-CM), known to have powerful mesoderm-inducing activity, was shown to contain TGF-beta-like activity as measured by a radioreceptor binding assay, colony formation in NRK cells, and growth inhibition in CCL64 cells. The activity of XTC-CM in mesoderm induction and in growth inhibition of CCL64 cells was inhibited partially by antibodies to TGF-beta 2 but not by antibodies to TGF-beta 1. Thus, a TGF-beta 2-like molecule may be involved in mesoderm induction."
https://openalex.org/W1592658968,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) increases up to 20-fold the expression of various forms of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, the major type of sulfated proteoglycan present in the extracellular matrix and culture medium of various human, rodent, and mink cell types including kidney and lung fibroblasts, lung epithelial cells, preadipocytes, and skeletal muscle myoblasts. TGF-beta regulates the level and molecular size of these proteoglycans by acting simultaneously at two levels: it elevates the biosynthetic rate of the 45-kDa proteoglycan core protein in a cycloheximide- and actinomycin D-sensitive manner, and it induces an increase in the molecular mass of the glycosaminoglycan chains. These cellular responses correlate with occupancy of type III TGF-beta receptors by TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 and are not induced by other growth factors tested. The parameters of this effect of TGF-beta in kidney fibroblasts and myoblasts are ED50 = 5-10 pM TGF-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2, and t 1/2 = 6-8 h. These results identify the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans as a major component of mammalian mesenchymal and epithelial extracellular matrices whose expression and structure are regulated by TGF-beta."

https://openalex.org/W2023996613,"Hormone-sensitive lipase, a key enzyme in fatty acid mobilization, overall energy homeostasis, and possibly steroidogenesis, is acutely controlled through reversible phosphorylation by catecholamines and insulin. The 757-amino acid sequence predicted from a cloned rat adipocyte complementary DNA showed no homology with any other known lipase or protein. The activity-controlling phosphorylation site was localized to Ser563 in a markedly hydrophilic domain, and a lipid-binding consensus site was tentatively identified. One or several messenger RNA species (3.3, 3.5, or 3.9 kilobases) were expressed in adipose and steroidogenic tissues and heart and skeletal muscle. The human hormone-sensitive lipase gene mapped to chromosome 19 cent-q13.3."

https://openalex.org/W1975954941,"The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that is found in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients (ALL). In CML, this results in the expression of a chimeric 8.5-kilobase BCR-ABL transcript that encodes the P210BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. The Ph1 chromosome in ALL expresses a distinct ABL-derived 7-kilobase messenger RNA that encodes the P185ALL-ABL protein. Since the expression of different oncogene products may play a role in the distinctive presentation of Ph1-positive ALL versus CML, it is necessary to understand the molecular basis for the expression of P185ALL-ABL. Both P210BCR-ABL and P185ALL-ABL are recognized by an antiserum directed to BCR determinants in the amino-terminal region of both proteins. Antisera to BCR determinants proximal to the BCR-ABL junction in CML immunoprecipitated P210BCR-ABL but not P185ALL-ABL. Nucleotide sequence analysis of complementary DNA clones made from RNA from the Ph1-positive ALL SUP-B15 cell line, and S1 nuclease protection analysis confirmed the presence of BCR-ABL chimeric transcripts in Ph1-positive ALL cells. In Ph1-positive ALL, ABL sequences were joined to BCR sequences approximately 1.5 kilobases 5' of the CML junction. P185ALL-ABL represents the product of a BCR-ABL fusion gene in Ph1-positive ALL that is distinct from the BCR-ABL fusion gene of CML."

Although the etiology is unknown, inheritance plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Recent work indicates that an autosomal dominant gene for Alzheimer's disease is located on chromosome 21 at band q21. In the present study of a group of autopsy-documented kindreds, no evidence for linkage was found between familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and chromosome 21q21 markers (D21S1/D21S72 and the amyloid beta gene). Linkage to the D21S1/D21S72 locus was excluded at recombination fractions (theta) up to 0.17. Linkage to the amyloid gene was excluded at theta = 0.10. Apparent recombinants were noted in two families for the amyloid gene and in five families for the D21S1/D21S72 locus. These data indicate that FAD is genetically heterogeneous."

Dissociation of transcription factors from oocyte 5S RNA genes during development allows them to be repressed by chromatin assembly. In the same cells, somatic 5S RNA genes remain active because their transcription complexes are stable."

https://openalex.org/W1976322247,"A bioassay that is based on trans-activation has been developed for the detection and quantitation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Indicator cell lines were constructed that contain the HIV-1 long terminal repeat ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Infection of these cells by HIV activates the expression of CAT protein. Isolates of HIV-1 with divergent nucleotide sequences activated the indicator cell lines to a similar extent, approximately 500- to 1000-fold. Human T cell lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2, equine infectious anemia virus, and herpes simplex virus 1 did not activate the indicator cell lines. Isolates of simian immunodeficiency virus and human T cell lymphotropic virus type 4 activated these cells to a much lesser extent, which suggests that these viruses contain similar, but distinct, trans-activators. This assay can be used for the detection, quantitation, and typing of HIV and for studying the effect of drugs on the replication of HIV in different cellular backgrounds."

The efficiency of transfer depended upon binding mode and driving force. For a given donor-acceptor pair, surface-bound complexes showed greater rate enhancements than those that were intercalatively bound. Even in rigid glycerol at 253 K, the rates for donor-acceptor pairs bound to DNA remained enhanced. For the series of acceptors, the greatest enhancement in electron-transfer rate was found with chromium, the acceptor of intermediate driving force. The DNA polymer appears to provide an efficient intervening medium to couple donor and acceptor metal complexes for electron transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1508282658,"Cholesterol esterification by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) in macrophages is a key process in atheroma foam cell formation. However, the process of cholesterol substrate delivery to ACAT is not well defined. In this study, J774 macrophages, which form foam cells with native low density lipoprotein (LDL), were labeled with [3H]cholesterol-containing liposomes. Most (80-90%) of the cholesterol label could be converted by cholesterol oxidase to cholestenone, suggesting plasma membrane localization; only 0.6% of the label was in cholesteryl ester (CE). In cells chased for 6 h in medium lacking LDL, the distribution of label was essentially unchanged, whereas in cells chased with LDL, 28% of the label was incorporated into CE concomitant with a decrease in cholestenone label to 50%. [3H]Cholesterol-labeled mouse peritoneal macrophages incubated with acetyl-LDL, and both J774 and mouse peritoneal macrophages incubated with 25-hydroxy-cholesterol, also showed a shift of label from cholestenone to CE. Similar results were found when cellular cholesterol was biosynthetically labeled with [3H]mevalonate. The percentage of cholesterol substrate for ACAT in LDL-treated J774 macrophages which originates from endogenous cellular pools (versus that originating from LDL itself) is approximately 50%. We conclude that upon activation of ACAT in macrophages, there is a novel process whereby a cholesterol oxidase-accessible pool of cellular cholesterol, presumably plasma membrane cholesterol, is translocated to ACAT in the endoplasmic reticulum."

The only species to have been infected with HIV-1 so far is the chimpanzee. However, the scarcity of this animal and its designation as an endangered species place severe restrictions on its use as an animal model. Attempts to infect mice, rats, hamsters, guinea-pigs, musk shrews, and rabbits with HIV-1 or infected cells have all been unsuccessful. We now report that the intraperitoneal inoculation of rabbits with HIV-1 or chronically infected H9 cells consistently induces a persistent infection."
https://openalex.org/W1597669312,"Human neutrophil elastase (NE) functions as a powerful serine protease capable of attacking a broad range of proteins. To examine the cellular site(s) of NE gene expression, a 0.65-kilobase cDNA (pPB15) complementary to the coding region of the NE gene was cloned from the cell line U937 using an oligonucleotide based on the known NE protein sequence. The sequence of pPB15 demonstrated that it coded for the 173 C-terminal residues of the 218 amino acids that comprise the mature NE protein, plus an additional 3' 60 base pairs prior to the in-frame stop codon, suggesting the NE mRNA contains sequences for a 20-residue C-terminal pro peptide that is not found in the mature protein. Northern analysis using 32P-labeled pPB15 as a probe revealed that neutrophils do not contain detectable NE mRNA transcripts despite the fact that this cell carries large amounts of this protein. Furthermore, resting and activated blood monocytes also contained no detectable NE mRNA transcripts, although these cells also carry detectable NE. In contrast, bone marrow precursor cells contained NE transcripts, suggesting the NE gene is expressed in blood precursor cells. In this regard, evaluation of HL-60 cells, a human cell line with myelomonocytic lineage features, demonstrated NE transcripts in resting cells and increased NE mRNA levels when the cells were induced toward the myelocytic lineage with dimethyl sulfoxide. However, when the HL-60 cells were induced toward the monocytic lineage with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, NE transcripts were lost even though transcripts for interleukin-1 beta were plentiful. Together, these observations are consistent with the concept that the NE gene is not expressed in the blood cells that carry the protein, but in bone marrow precursors that express NE transcripts about the time of commitment to the myelocytic series."
https://openalex.org/W1543460442,"Staphylococcus aureus is known to produce three very active extracellular proteinases. One of these enzymes, a cysteine proteinase, after purification to homogeneity was found to degrade insoluble bovine lung elastin at a rate comparable to human neutrophil elastase. This enzyme had no detectable activity against a range of synthetic substrates normally utilized by elastase, chymotrypsin, or trypsin-like proteinases. However, it did hydrolyze the synthetic substrate carbobenzoxy-phenylalanyl-leucyl-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (Km = 0.5 mM, kcat = 0.16 s-1). The proteolytic activity of the cysteine proteinase was rapidly and efficiently inhibited by alpha 2-macroglobulin and also by the cysteine-specific inhibitor rat T-kininogen (Ki = 5.2 X 10(-7) M). Human kininogens, however, did not inhibit. Human plasma apparently contains other inhibitors of this enzyme, since plasma depleted of alpha 2-macroglobulin retained significant inhibitory capacity. The elastolytic activity of this S. aureus proteinase and its lack of control by human kininogens or cystatin C may explain some of the connective tissue destruction seen in bacterial infections due to this and related organisms such as may occur in septicemia, septic arthritis, and otitis."
https://openalex.org/W1579303074,"Conditioned media of isolated Kupffer and endothelial liver cells were added to incubations of parenchymal liver cells, in order to test whether secretory products of Kupffer and endothelial liver cells could influence parenchymal liver cell metabolism. With Kupffer cell medium an average stimulation of glucose production by parenchymal liver cells of 140% was obtained, while endothelial liver cell medium stimulated with an average of 127%. The separation of the secretory products of Kupffer and endothelial liver cells in a low and a high molecular weight fraction indicated that the active factor(s) had a low molecular weight. Media, obtained from aspirin-pretreated Kupffer and endothelial liver cells, had no effect on the glucose production by parenchymal liver cells. Because aspirin blocks prostaglandin synthesis, it was tested if prostaglandins could be responsible for the effect of media on parenchymal liver cells. It was found that prostaglandin (PG) E1, E2, and D2 all stimulated the glucose production by parenchymal liver cells, PGD2 being the most potent. Kupffer and endothelial liver cell media as well as prostaglandins E1, E2, and D2 stimulated the activity of phosphorylase, the regulatory enzyme in glycogenolysis. The data indicate that prostaglandins, present in media from Kupffer and endothelial liver cells, may stimulate glycogenolysis in parenchymal liver cells. This implies that products of Kupffer and endothelial liver cells may play a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis by the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1711477522,"Rat liver and kidney homogenates, fortified with the appropriate cofactors, produced H2O2 when incubated with prostaglandin (PG) E2 or its CoA ester (PGE2-CoA), indicating that PGE2-CoA served as substrate for acyl-CoA oxidase, the first enzyme of peroxisomal beta-oxidation. PGE2-CoA oxidase was stimulated to the same extent as palmitoyl-CoA oxidase by treatment of rats with the peroxisome proliferator clofibrate. Subcellular fractionation confirmed that both oxidase activities were located in peroxisomes. When highly purified peroxisomes were incubated with [1-14C]PGE2, radioactive oxidation products were released, demonstrating that peroxisomes were capable of catalyzing the complete beta-oxidation sequence. However, PGE2 beta-oxidizing activity was expressed only when isolated microsomes were added to the purified peroxisomes, indicating that PGE2-CoA synthetase is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cofactor requirements for peroxisomal [1-14C]PGE2 and [1-14C]palmitate oxidation were identical, and oxidation was not inhibited by cyanide. [1-14C]PGE2 was also beta-oxidized by highly purified mitochondrial fractions, devoid of peroxisomes, when microsomes were added. Mitochondrial [1-14C]PGE2 and [1-14C]palmitate oxidation was CoA- and ATP-dependent and inhibited by cyanide. Palmitate oxidation was carnitine-dependent, but PGE2 oxidation was not. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, but not carnitine acyltransferase activity, was detected with PGE2-CoA as substrate. [1-14C]PGE2 oxidation in whole liver homogenates was only slightly inhibited by cyanide, indicating that peroxisomes oxidized the major portion of PGE2. The concentrations of PGE2 employed in these experiments exceeded the in vivo concentrations by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, we suggest that the urinary PG metabolite excretion be measured in patients with hereditary diseases in which peroxisomal or mitochondrial beta-oxidation is not functioning in order to clarify the role of each organelle in PG oxidation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1518266712,"The first bacterial chloroperoxidase that is capable of catalyzing the chlorination of indole to 7-chloroindole was detected in Pseudomonas pyrrocinia ATCC 15958, a bacterium that produces the antifungal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin (Wiesner, W., van Pee, K.H., and Lingens, F. (1986) FEBS Lett. 209, 321-324). Here we describe the purification and characterization of this bacterial non-heme chloroperoxidase. The enzyme was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography at different pH values, molecular sieve chromatography, and Bio-Gel HTP hydroxylapatite. After the last purification step, chloroperoxidase was homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. Based on gel filtration and ultracentrifugation results, the molecular weight of the enzyme was 64,000 +/- 3,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a single band with the mobility of a 32,000 molecular weight species. Therefore, in solution at neutral pH, this chloroperoxidase is a dimer. The enzyme did not exhibit any absorbance in the visible region of the spectrum. The isoelectric point was 4.1. Chloroperoxidase was specific for I-, Br-, and Cl- and was not inhibited by azide, but was inhibited by cyanide and F-. This procaryotic chloroperoxidase catalyzed the bromination of monochlorodimedone but not its chlorination and has no peroxidase or catalase activity. The pH optimum of the enzyme was between 4.0 and 4.5, and the enzyme was stable between pH 3.5 and 8.5 and showed no loss of activity when incubated at 60 degrees C for 2 h. Chloroperoxidase also chlorinated 4-(2-amino-3-chlorophenyl) pyrrole to yield aminopyrrolnitrin, the immediate precursor of pyrrolnitrin. This suggests very strongly that chloroperoxidase is involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic pyrrolnitrin."
https://openalex.org/W1560117329,"N-Heparan-sulfate sulfotransferase catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenilyl sulfate to the nitrogen of glucosamine in heparan sulfate. This reaction is an obligatory step for subsequent epimerization of D-glucuronic to L-iduronic acid and of O-sulfation of the sugar chains. We have purified this sulfotransferase from rat liver membranes to apparent homogeneity using a combination of conventional and affinity chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, heparin-agarose, 3',5'-ADP-agarose, wheat germ-Sepharose, and finally a glycerol gradient. The pure enzyme is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 97,000. It was enriched in specific activity 65,000-fold over the homogenate. The recovery of activity was 4% of that of the homogenate. Preliminary enzymatic characterization of the purified sulfotransferase indicates a high degree of substrate specificity. Transfer of sulfate occurs to heparan sulfate, N-heparan sulfate, and N-desulfated heparin, but not to N-acetylated heparan sulfate, N-acetylated heparin, chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate, and tyrosine-containing tripeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1579890853,"In addition to regulating gene expression at the level of transcription, estrogen is generally considered to selectively stabilize induced mRNAs against degradation. As a result of mRNA stabilization, estrogen-induced mRNAs accumulate to much higher levels in target cells, and the encoded proteins are made at much greater rates than would occur on the basis of transcriptional activation alone. The present study examined the effect of estrogen on the stabilities of avian liver mRNAs that code for the yolk precursor proteins apolipoprotein (apo) II and vitellogenin (VTG) II. The results show that the degradation rates of apoII and VTG II mRNAs during hormone withdrawal are dramatically altered by the duration of prior estrogen treatment. During the 2 days required for the hormonal inductions of these mRNAs to new steady states, the turnover rates of both mRNAs were the same in the presence and absence of estrogen (t1/2 = 13 h). This result indicates that mRNA stabilization does not contribute to the extensive accumulation of apoII and VTG II mRNAs. When the duration of estrogen treatment was extended beyond 3 days, however, hormone withdrawal led to the rapid (t1/2 = 1.5 h) and selective destabilization of these mRNAs. This result suggests that estrogen induced a destabilization activity that was only functional following hormone withdrawal. Thus, the point at which estrogen alters mRNA stability is at the level of mRNA degradation. An absence of detectable apoII mRNA degradation intermediates during either the slow or rapid mode of mRNA decay suggests that the rate-limiting step for apoII mRNA turnover is an estrogen-sensitive targeting event that marks the mRNA for rapid degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1541023832,"Genetically engineered cytochrome b5 has been used to quantitative binding interactions of this protein with cytochrome P-450cam and sperm whale metmyoglobin by static fluorescence titration. Two cytochrome b5 mutants were constructed by cassette mutagenesis to replace a surface threonine residue with cysteine at two crystallographically defined positions, 65 and 8, located 11 and 21 A, respectively, from the nearest heme edge. The T65C and T8C mutant proteins were labeled with the sulfhydryl selective fluorescent reagent, acrylodan, which provided a spectral probe for monitoring protein-protein association. The fluorescence emission spectra of the acrylodan-labeled T65C mutant exhibited an ionic strength-dependent, blue-shifted fluorescence enhancement upon binding met-myoglobin, cytochrome c, and cytochrome P-450cam, whereas the acrylodan-labeled T8C mutant fluorescence emission remained unchanged during all titrations. Dissociation constants of 1.3, 0.6, and 0.5 microM, pH 7.15, were measured for metmyoglobin, cytochrome P-450cam, and cytochrome c, respectively. A similar averaged binding surface for cytochrome P-450cam and cytochrome c is suggested by their closely related degree of fluorescence enhancement, degree of emission blue shift, and binding free energies. Myoglobin binds less tightly, enhances fluorescence to a greater extent, and exhibits a larger blue shift in acrylodan emission spectra suggesting a different averaged binding orientation relative to the acrylodan probe."

An exchange assay using isolated nuclei showed the presence of two binding sites with approximate KD values of 7 and 88 nM for JH I and 4 and 59 nM for IVMA. There were about 10,000 of the high affinity sites per nucleus. The binding of both hormones was sensitive to pH and Pronase digestion. In competition studies, JH II and JH III competed for 3H-JH I binding sites, whereas IVMA, hydroprene, and methoprene did not. In similar studies, methoprene and hydroprene competed for [125I]IVMA binding sites but JH I, JH II, and JH III were all ineffective. These results are consistent with the presence of specific and distinct binding sites for JH and IVMA in these nuclei."

Complex formation was observed between late fragment E and thrombin but not with fragment D. The three reduced chain remnants of fragment E all formed complexes with thrombin. Also, thrombin bound to the intact, separated A alpha, B beta, and gamma chains of fibrinogen as well as to the alpha and beta chains of fibrin. In these experiments the extended substrate-binding site, but not the catalytic-binding site, was being examined because fragment E had as its amino-terminal amino acids Val20 in the alpha chain, Lys54 in the beta chain, and Tyr1 in the gamma chain. Also, thrombin inhibited in its active center by D-phenyl-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-chloromethyl ketone bound to fragment E and to the separated chains in the same manner as unmodified thrombin. A lysine residue to thrombin was essential for its binding to fibrinogen. Thrombin attached to CNBr-activated Sepharose through its amino groups did not bind to fragment E, but when thrombin was attached through its carboxyl groups, it bound fragment E."

The antibody reacts strongly with gastrointestinal carcinoma and showed a clear dependence on the degree of differentiation of gastric cancer cells. The antibody defines a series of glycolipid species with extremely slow TLC mobility present in both acidic and neutral glycolipid fractions of the extract from gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma and the original MKN74 cells. Isolation and structural study of the active glycolipids present in the acidic and neutral fractions and comparison of the antibody reactivity with glycolipids having related structures revealed a novel specificity. The minimum requirement for the maximal reactivity of ACFH-18 was identified as VII3Fuc-nLc10 (Structure A below and Fig. 8 in text). Since the antibody did not react with III3Fuc-nLc6 (Structure B below), which shares the same terminal sequence as VII3Fuc-nLc10, and since it cross-reacted with VII3Fuc-nLc8 (Z1 glycolipid) and VII3Fuc,V3-Fuc,III3Fuc-nLc8 (Z3 glycolipid), antibody ACFH-18 is capable of recognizing a fucosyl residue plus an internal repeating N-acetyllactosamine proximal to ceramide, as indicated by lines in Fig. 8 (Structures A, B, and E-G).

In the continuous presence of PMA or PDBu, the rate of transcription of c-myc decreased to 20% of control within 2 h and was maintained at 20-30% of the control level for the ensuing 24 h. Cell-permeable sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), a diacylglycerol analogue, also caused a rapid decrease in c-myc transcription. The decrease in the transcription of c-myc induced by diC8 or PDBu was reversible; prolonged exposure of the cells to either agent for periods greater than 2 h was necessary to maintain the transcription of c-myc below the control rate. With both PDBu and diC8, there was a close correlation between the concentration dependence for binding to the phorbol ester receptor and the concentration dependence for inhibition of c-myc transcription. The decrease in transcription of c-myc induced by PDBu or diC8 appeared to be due to a block of elongation of the nascent mRNA beyond exon 1. The results of this study suggest that prolonged stimulation of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) is required for persistent inhibition of transcription of c-myc in HL-60 cells."

https://openalex.org/W1579712963,"During the course of prothrombin activation, as catalyzed by Factor Xa, Factor Va, Ca2+, and negatively-charged phospholipid vesicles, the three proteins distribute between the fluid phase and the vesicle surface. On the vesicle, efficient Factor Xa-catalyzed proteolysis yields thrombin plus Fragment 1.2. Further thrombin-catalyzed feedback cleavage of the latter then yields Fragment 1 plus Fragment 2. Prior to this cleavage Fragment 1.2 might retain thrombin at the site of catalysis since it binds both phospholipid and thrombin through its respective Fragment 1 and Fragment 2 domains. In order to study the role of the feedback cleavage, light scattering at right angles was used to deduce the nature of the components associated with the vesicle during prothrombin activation by continuous monitoring of the relative molecular weight of the vesicle-protein complex. When prothrombin (1.4 microM) was added to homogeneously sized phospholipid vesicles of phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylserine (3:1) at a total phospholipid concentration of 20 microM, the scattering intensity doubled. Upon subsequent addition of Factor Xa and Factor Va (5.0 nM each) the scattering intensity smoothly decreased to a value about 1.25-fold greater than that of the vesicles alone. Analysis of the composition of the reaction mixture at intervals during the course of the reaction by gel electrophoresis and laser densitometry, provided a good correlation between the mass of the vesicle-protein complex measured by light scattering and its mass inferred by composition. In addition, the decrease in mass of the vesicle-protein complex measured by light scattering correlated temporally with cleavage of Fragment 1.2. When the reaction was initiated in the presence of the reversible thrombin inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide no cleavage of Fragment 1.2 occurred, as indicated by gel electrophoresis, and no change in the mass of the vesicle-protein complex occurred as indicated by light scattering. The absence of change in scattering intensity in the presence of dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide suggests a 1:1 replacement of prothrombin at the catalytic surface by components of equivalent mass (Fragment 1.2 plus thrombin), whereas the decrease in scattering in the absence of dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide suggests replacement of prothrombin by Fragment 1 only. Together these results indicate that the thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of Fragment 1.2 promotes release of thrombin from the catalytic surface."
https://openalex.org/W1598479361,"The presence of a reactive exofacial sulfhydryl on the human erythrocyte hexose carrier was used to test several predictions of the alternating conformation or one-site model of transport. The cell-impermeant glutathione-maleimide-I (GS-Mal) irreversibly inhibited hexose entry by decreasing the transport Vmax. This effect was potentiated by phloretin and maltose but decreased by cytochalasin B, indicating that under the one-site model the external sulfhydryl is on the outward-facing carrier but that it does not overlap with the exofacial substrate-binding site. Incubation of erythrocytes with maltose competitively inhibited the binding of [3H]cytochalasin B to the inward-facing carrier (Ki = 40 mM). Furthermore, both equilibrium cytochalasin B binding and its photolabeling of the band 4.5 carrier protein were decreased in ghosts prepared from GS-Mal-treated cells. Thus induction of an outward-facing carrier conformation with either maltose or GS-Mal caused the endofacial substrate-binding site to disappear. Dose-response studies of GS-Mal treatment of intact cells suggested that some functional carriers lack a reactive external sulfhydryl, which can be partially regenerated by pretreatment with excess cysteine. These data provide direct support for the one-site model of transport and further define the role of the external sulfhydryl in the transport mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2039897511,"The kinetics of microtubule reassembly was studied in vitro by quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). When microtubules assembled in the absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were sheared, they rapidly depolymerized, recovered, and reassembled. The mean length of the recovered microtubules was the same as that observed just before shearing, implying that on average one fragment per original microtubule survived the fragmentation and recovery. When microtubules that contained 25 percent brain MAP were sheared, the fragments did not depolymerize extensively and the average length of the fragments decreased by a factor of 3 relative to the unsheared sample. The results support the dynamic instability model, which predicts that cellular microtubules are latently unstable structures protected on their ends by stabilizing caps."
https://openalex.org/W1590259064,"Acyl-CoA:1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol acyl-transferase, a newly detected enzyme related to platelet-activating factor metabolism, has been characterized in microsomes of a human leukemia cell line (HL-60 cells). It has a sharp pH optimum of 6.8, does not require divalent metal ions, is stable at preincubation temperatures up to 45 degrees C, and among a variety of acyl-CoA thioesters (8:0-20:4) tested, linoleoyl-CoA is the best substrate. Km and Vmax values for 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol acyltransferase are 8.5 microM and 1.7 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. For comparative purposes acyl-CoA:1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol acyltransferase was also characterized in HL-60 microsomes. It has a relatively broad pH optimum of 6.1, is stimulated 1.4-fold by Mg2+, is relatively labile at preincubation temperatures higher than 25 degrees C, and among the various acyl-CoA thioesters tested, myristoyl-CoA is the best substrate. In substrate competition experiments, we found 1-O-hexadecyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol is a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 32 microM). Our findings indicate acyl-CoA:1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol acyltransferase in HL-60 cells is distinctly different from acyl-CoA:1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol acyltransferase. Our experimental results demonstrate that the unique enzyme activity characterized in this report also is expressed in intact HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1525897937,"Monoclonal antibodies (8/1, 10/10, and 25/3) against rat brain type II protein kinase C were used for the immunochemical characterization of this kinase. These antibodies immunoprecipitated the type II protein kinase C in a dose-dependent manner but did neither to the type I nor III isozyme. Immunoblot analysis of the tryptic fragments from protein kinase C revealed that all three antibodies recognized the 27-38-kDa fragments, the phospholipid/phorbol ester-binding domain, but not the 45-48-kDa fragments, the kinase catalytic domain. The immune complexes of the kinase and the antibodies retained 70-80% of the kinase activity which was dependent on Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine and further activated by diacylglycerol or tumor-promoting phorbol ester. With antibody 8/1, the kinetic parameters with respect to Km for ATP and histone and K alpha for phosphatidylserine and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were not significantly influenced. However, the antibody causes variable effects on the K alpha for Ca2+ under different assay conditions. When determined in the presence of phosphatidylserine, the K alpha for Ca2+ was reduced by an order of magnitude (37 +/- 8 to 2.0 +/- 1.8 microM); in the presence of phosphatidylserine and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, the K alpha for Ca2+ was not significantly altered; and in the presence of phosphatidylserine and dioleoylglycerol, the kinase became an apparently Ca2+-independent enzyme. The effects of antibody 8/1 on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme for phorbol ester binding were different from those for kinase activity. This antibody causes a 20-30% reduction in phorbol ester binding and a 2-fold increase (1.9 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml) in the concentration of phosphatidylserine required for half-maximal binding, but is without significant influence on those parameters for Ca2+ and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. The differential effects of antibody 8/1 on kinase activity and phorbol ester binding with respect to the kinetic parameter of phosphatidylserine suggest that the roles of this phospholipid in supporting phorbol ester binding and kinase activation are different. In the presence of the antibody, the autophosphorylations of the phospholipid/phorbol ester-binding domain and the kinase domain were reduced; the reduction was more pronounced for the former than for the latter. These results suggest that the epitope for antibody 8/1 is localized within the phospholipid/phorbol ester-binding domain at the region adjacent to the kinase domain so that the autophosphorylations of both domains are affected."
https://openalex.org/W1499617788,"The orientation of the light-driven chloride pump, halorhodopsin, in the membrane was determined using antibodies directed against a synthetic peptide which represents the C-terminal segment of the protein. Antibodies against this decapeptide did not bind to right-side-out cell vesicles. Partial inversion by sonication or lysis under low salt conditions exposed this COOH-terminal antigenic site. Antibody binding was removed by preincubation with the decapeptide. The COOH terminus of the molecule is therefore located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1491502102,"The stoichiometric and thermodynamic properties of nitrogen (N2) binding to human deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) at N2 saturation pressures up to 400 atm were derived from measured N2 solubilities in protein-free buffers (pH 7.1) and in corresponding buffer + Hb (6.5% w/w) solutions at 20.0, 25.0, and 37.0 degrees C. At each temperature, approximately 3 N2 molecules bind per Hb tetramer at N2 pressures of 100 atm, while about 7 N2 molecules bind per tetramer at 400 atm N2 pressure, where available binding sites are still not fully saturated. Calculated N2-Hb binding isotherms are well described by a simple binding model with 12 independent and equivalent binding sites/Hb tetramer. N2 binding at each of the sites is hydrophobic, exhibiting the typical increase of the dissociation enthalpy with temperature. Enthalpies of dissociation are slightly more negative, while corresponding unitary entropies are somewhat less negative than those for the transfer of N2 from olive oil to water. Calculated partial molar volumes of N2 in Hb are positive but less than the corresponding partial molar volumes of N2 in buffer. Results indicate that N2 binding to Hb is accompanied by only small protein conformational changes which entail slight structural destabilization and loss of free volume in the protein that partially accommodates the volume of the N2 ligand. Results are related to previously reported effects of high pressure and high-pressure N2 on HbO2 affinity, illuminating essential features of the molecular mechanisms for these effects."
