https://openalex.org/W2068427129,"Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) is a key molecule involved in cell growth signaling. We demonstrated that overexpression of PTEN, a putative tumor suppressor, reduced insulin-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production in human 293 cells without effecting insulin-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation. Further, transfection of the catalytically inactive mutant of PTEN (C124S) caused PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation in the absence of insulin stimulation. Purified recombinant PTEN catalyzed dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, specifically at position 3 on the inositol ring. PTEN also exhibited 3-phosphatase activity toward inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. Our results raise the possibility that PTEN acts in vivo as a phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase by regulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels. As expected, the C124S mutant of PTEN was incapable of catalyzing dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 consistent with the mechanism observed in protein-tyrosine phosphatase-catalyzed reactions.

A recently identified candidate tumor suppressor gene, PTEN/MMAC1, shares sequence identity with the family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PI, phosphoinositide; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; VHR, VH1-related.

Deletions and mutations within the PTEN gene have been observed in several cancer cell types and tumor cell lines (2Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4315) Google Scholar, 3Steck P.A.

Genet. 1997; 15: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Additional evidence that PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor was obtained by Furnari et al. (4Furnari F.B. Lin H. Huang H.S. Cavenee W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12479-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), who showed that PTEN had a growth suppressor activity in glioma cells. PTEN encodes the active site consensus motif HCXXGXXR(S/T) found in all PTPases. In contrast, the recombinant protein is a poor catalyst toward both phosphoproteins and peptide substrates with the highest activity of PTEN observed toward the highly negatively charged, multiply phosphorylated polymer of (Glu-Tyr)n (5Li D.M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar, 6Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Based on these observations we thought it possible that PTEN could catalyze the dephosphorylation of acidic nonproteinaceous substrate. Identification of possible in vivo substrates would not only suggest a possible physiological function of PTEN, but they might also provide insight into how PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is an important second messenger involved in cell growth signaling (7Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is specifically produced from PtdIns(4,5)P2 by PI 3-kinase upon stimulation by a variety of ligands (7Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can directly activate Akt, which in turn activates p70 S6 kinase and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (8Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 9Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although there are several phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases, the mechanism of regulation and particularly the degradation pathway of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vivois still unclear (10Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Guilherme A. Klarlund J.K. Krystal G. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29533-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that recombinant PTEN has PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 3-phosphatase activity. In addition, we provide evidence that PTEN may act in vivo as a regulator of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which produces a substrate that can be recycled by PI 3-kinase. The coding sequence of human PTEN and the C124S mutant of PTEN (gift from Yi Zhao) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using 5′ primer (5′-CCGGTACCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGACAGCCATCATCAAAGAG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CCGTCGACTCAGACTTTTGTAATTTGTG-3′). The product was cleaved with KpnI and SalI and ligated into the KpnI/SalI sites of pCMV5 (gift from David W. Russell) to produce FLAG-tagged PTEN/pCMV5 and PTEN(CS)/pCMV5. Human 293 cells were cultured on a 6-well plate, and transfection of the cells were performed as described (12Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of the constructs. The efficiency of transfection was about 80% in this condition. 48 h after the transfection, the cells were serum-starved and labeled with [32P]Pi (100 μCi/ml) for 4 h. The cells were stimulated by incubation with insulin (0.1 μg/ml) for 2.5 min at 37 °C, and the stimulation was quenched by the addition of 0.93 ml of CH3OH/CHCl3/1% HClO4 (50/25/18, v/v/v). The lipids were extracted and separated on a TLC plate as described (13Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to determine the amount of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. To analyze the expression of FLAG-tagged PTEN protein, the transfected cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The samples were transferred to Immobilon filter (Millipore) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak), and the signal was visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Transfection, starvation and stimulation of human 293 cells were carried out as described above in the absence of radiolabel. After the stimulation, the cells were lysed, followed by immunoprecipitation as described (14Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino S. Fukui Y. Ui M. Hazeki O. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24252-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) using 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). To analyze the PI 3-kinase activity of the immunoprecipitants, the sample was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 33 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi), 0.1 mg/ml PtdIns(4,5)P2, and 0.15 mg/ml phosphatidylserine. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.47 ml of CH3OH/CHCl3/6% HClO4(30/15/2, v/v/v), and the phospholipids were extracted and separated on a TLC plate as described (13Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The expression vector for PTEN was constructed by ligating a bluntedNdeI/SalI fragment from PTEN/pT7–7 (12Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) into theSmaI site of pGEX-KG (15Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). This vector was used to transformEscherichia coli strain JM109. Protein expression in 4-liter culture was carried out as described (16Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Santoro N. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All of the following procedures were performed at 4 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 80 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication. The crude lysate was diluted by the addition of 720 ml of the lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and stirred for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 20 min. A 5-ml slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added to the supernatant. After the incubation for 2 h, the resin was packed in a column and washed with 100 ml of the lysis buffer, and the glutathioneS-transferase-fusioned PTEN was eluted with 10 ml of the lysis buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. After overnight incubation with thrombin, the eluate was dialyzed against the lysis buffer and passed through glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, followed by a p-aminobezamidine-agarose column for adsorption of glutathione S-transferase and thrombin, respectively. Then the eluate was diluted with equal volume of TED buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmDTT) and applied to MonoQ HR5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with TED buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. PTEN was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (150–500 mm, 20 ml), followed by concentration using Centricon-30 (Amicon) and stored at −80 °C until use. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase assay was performed at 37 °C in a buffer (20 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm DTT, [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and 1 μg of purified PTEN. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.47 ml of CH3OH/CHCl3/6% HClO4 (30/15/2, v/v/v). Then the phospholipids were extracted and separated on a TLC plate as described (13Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To prepare [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the phosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by PI 3-kinase using [γ-32P]ATP was carried out as described above. Then the phospholipids were extracted as described (13Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C until use. The PI 3-kinase used was prepared by immunoprecipitation from the 293 cell lysate with anti-p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as described (14Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino S. Fukui Y. Ui M. Hazeki O. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24252-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For identification of the dephosphorylation site (see Fig. 2 B), dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by PTEN was carried out in a buffer (20 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (BIOMOL), 0.15 mg/ml of phosphatidylserine, and 1 μg of purified PTEN. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.47 ml of CH3OH/CHCl3/6% HClO4 (30/15/2, v/v). The phospholipids were extracted as described (13Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), dried, and then used for PI 3-kinase-catalyzed reaction. Inositol phosphatase assays were performed using commercially available [3H]inositol phosphate (NEN) as substrates. Assay was carried out at 37 °C in a buffer (20 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm DTT, 60 μm [3H]inositol phosphate (0.01 μCi) and 1 μg of enzyme. After an incubation of 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of stop solution. Then, to separate the dephosphorylated product from the substrate, the sample was applied to AG1-X8 column (0.5 ml) equilibrated with the stop solution. Dephosphorylated [3H]inositol phosphate was eluted with 5 ml of the stop solution, whereas the substrate remained in the column, and the radioactivity of the eluate was measured. The stop solutions used were 0.2 m HCOONH4/0.1 mHCOOH, 0.4 m HCOONH4/0.1 m HCOOH, and 0.7 m HCOONH4/0.1 m HCOOH for [3H]inositol 1, 4-bisphosphate, [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, and [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, respectively. Recombinant human VHR, Cdc25B, and PTP1D were kindly gifts from Harris Vikis, Elizabeth Gottlin, and Jin Zhou, respectively. For kinetic analysis (see Fig. 3 B), inositol phosphatase activity was assayed in the same buffer as described above using 10–150 μmIns(1,3,4,5)P4 instead of [3H]inositol phosphate. After an incubation of 1 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold water, and the amount of Ins(1,4,5)P3 produced was estimated using BIOTRAK Ins(1,4,5)P3 detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Kinetic constants were determined using KaleidaGraph software (Abelbech).Figure 3Inositol phosphatase activity of PTEN. A, inositol phosphatase activity of various enzymes was assayed using [3H]inositol phosphate as indicated. After the incubation for 30 min, dephosphorylated [3H]inositol phosphate was separated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then the radioactivity of the dephosphorylated products was counted. Similar results were obtained in a repeated experiment. WT, wild type; CS, C124S mutant.B, initial rate of PTEN-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” using various concentration of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The Lineweaver-Burk plot is shown ininset. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although PTEN has the consensus sequence of a PTPase, it dephosphorylates p-nitrophenylphosphate and other artificial protein substrates poorly, having the highest catalytic activity with the highly negatively charged, multiply phosphorylated polymer of (Glu-Tyr)n (5Li D.M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar, 6Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). This observation raised the distinct possibility that PTEN might utilize acidic substrates other than Tyr or Ser/Thr phosphoproteins. In order to explore this possibility, we transfected PTEN into 293 cells and analyzed the changes in cellular phospholipids. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3is an important second messenger in the regulation of cell growth (7Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In human 293 cells, insulin stimulates PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.1 C, lanes 1 and2), resulting in an increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3(Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). When PTEN was overexpressed in the 293 cells, the insulin-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A andB), whereas no effect on the activation of PI 3-kinase was observed (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 4). Because PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is specifically produced by PI 3-kinase, this result suggests that PTEN directly effects the turnover of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Additionally, overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant (C124S) of PTEN (see Fig. 3 A) caused an accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the absence of insulin stimulation (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1 and3), whereas overexpression of the mutant did not affect PI 3-kinase activity (data not shown). These results suggest that PTEN potentially regulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in cells without alteration of the insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. To investigate the possibility that PTEN has PtdIns(3,4,5)P3phosphatase activity, the recombinant enzyme was expressed inE. coli and purified to homogeneity (data not shown). Radiolabel was incorporated in position 3 of the substrate, [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, using PtdIns(4,5)P2, PI 3-kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. When [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was incubated with the purified PTEN, the radiolabel of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 rapidly disappeared from the lipid phase (Fig. 2 A,inset) while coincidentally appearing in the aqueous phase (Fig. 2 A), suggesting the release of inorganic phosphate. In order to conclusively prove that the only phosphate that had been cleaved was at position 3 of the phosphoinositide, as opposed to other possible cleavages that could also generate a water-soluble radiolabel, we used the product of the reaction of PTEN as a substrate for PI 3-kinase. When the product was treated with PI 3-kinase, [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was reformed, thereby providing further evidence that the two products generated by PTEN were inorganic phosphate and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2 B). Under similar conditions, PTEN also exhibited 3-phosphatase activity on phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; however, dephosphorylation of these phosphoinositides occurred at ~20% the rate observed with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3(data not shown). PTPases including PTP1D and dual-specific phosphatases (VHR, Cdc25B) exhibited no phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (data not shown). To more carefully dissect the specific nature of the catalytic activity of PTEN toward PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, we asked if PTEN displayed activity toward inositol phosphates. PTEN can dephosphorylate Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, whereas tyrosine-specific (PTP1D) and the dual-specific phosphatases (Cdc25B, VHR) exhibited no activity toward this inositol phosphate (Fig.3 A). Again, the PTEN-catalyzed reaction was specific for the position 3 of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Other inositol phosphates that do not have a phosphate at the position 3 on the inositol ring were not dephosphorylated by PTEN (Fig.3 A). The dephosphorylated product was identified as Ins(1,4,5)P3 using the Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding protein (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that PTEN also has 3-phosphatase activity toward inositol phosphate. Both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 have been proposed to be a functional second messenger responsible for the intracellular calcium signaling (17Putney J.W. Bird G.S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 can associate and activate a GTPase-activating protein (18Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In contrast to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is water-soluble and therefore was used to assess the significance of ourin vitro observations by determining the kinetic parameters for the PTEN-catalyzed dephosphorylation occurred at position 3 on the inositol ring. The K m andV max values for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were 98.9 μm and 8.49 nmol/min/mg (k cat, 0.49 min−1), respectively (Fig. 3 B). The K m value of 98.9 μm is 250-fold lower than the K m ofp-nitrophenylphosphate, which is 25.6 mm. Similar comparisons with the phosphorylated polymer (Glu-Tyr)nwere difficult to assess because a detailed kinetic analysis was not performed with this substrate (6Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), and it is likely to be phosphorylated at more than one site. The lowV max for the PTEN-catalyzed dephosphorylation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 implies that this may not be the preferred substrate in vitro for this enzyme. These in vitro assays may not be reflective of the in vivoactivity of PTEN because the phosphatase could be regulated by phosphorylation, subcellular localization, and/or interaction with other cellular proteins. It is noteworthy that the C terminus of the phosphatase has a consensus PDZ binding site, and we have recently shown that PTEN interacts with several PDZ-containing proteins. 2Y. Zhao and J. E. Dixon, unpublished data. The activity of PTPases and dual-specific phosphatases toward all protein substrates is dependent upon an essential cysteine residue that forms a phosphoenzyme intermediate during catalysis (1Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Because PTEN has the HCXXGXXR(S/T) motif conserved in all tyrosine or dual-specific phosphatases, we were interested in determining whether the cysteine was essential for the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 phosphatase activity. Mutation at Cys124 of PTEN (C124S) resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity toward Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (Fig. 3 A). This mutation also resulted in a loss of phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (data not shown). Additionally, PTEN is extremely labile in the absence of thiols in the assay buffer. Optimum concentration of DTT for the PTEN-catalyzed reactions was 10 mm (data not shown). Therefore, we propose that PTEN-catalyzed dephosphorylation of inositol phosphate and phosphoinositide proceeds via a mechanism that is consistent with that described for other PTPases (1Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We have established that the recombinant PTEN has phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase and inositol phosphate 3-phosphatase activities. The data shown in Fig. 1 suggest that suppression of insulin-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production by overexpression of PTEN is due to its phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. In addition, as shown in Fig. 1 D, overexpression of the CS mutant caused PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation without insulin stimulation. These results strongly suggest that PTEN can act as a regulator of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in vivo. Insulin activates PI 3-kinase via tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 catalyzed by the insulin receptor (Fig.4). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 produced by the PI 3-kinase can then activate Akt-mediated signals (Fig. 4). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels reached a plateau within 3–5 min after the stimulation, and then PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is degraded by unknown mechanisms (data not shown). Although our results suggest that PTEN can alter PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in 293 cells, it is clear that there are other cellular mechanisms that can also alter phosphoinositide concentrations. For example, Guilherme et al. (11Guilherme A. Klarlund J.K. Krystal G. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29533-29536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase was activated by insulin stimulation, and SHIP (SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase) is also well known as a regulator of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (10Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 961-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). If PTEN functions in vivo as a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3phosphatase, it follows that a homozygous deletion/mutation of this tumor suppressor gene could lead to a tumorigenic state through activation of the proto-oncogene, Akt. Specifically, loss of PTEN function would increase cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, thereby resulting in enhanced activation of Akt. In conclusion, although the physiological function of PTEN needs further clarification, we propose that: (i) members of the PTPase family of enzymes having an active site motif HCXXGXXR(S/T) such as PTEN are candidates to regulate intracellular levels of nonproteinaceous substrates as has also been reported for the RNA 5′-triphosphatase activity of CEL-1 (20Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); (ii) the dephosphorylation of phosphoinositide and inositol phosphate by PTEN is specific for position 3 on the inositol ring; and (iii) there are likely to be additional activating and/or localization mechanisms for PTEN within the cell regulating the catalytic activity of this enzyme.

All three subunits participate in channel formation as the absence of any one subunit results in a significant reduction or complete abrogation of Na+ current expression inXenopus oocytes. To determine the subunit stoichiometry, a biophysical assay was employed utilizing mutant subunits that display significant differences in sensitivity to channel blockers from the wild type channel. Our results indicate that ENaC is a tetrameric channel with an α2βγ stoichiometry, similar to that reported for other cation selective channels, such as Kv, Kir, as well as voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels that have 4-fold internal symmetry.

Epithelial Na+ channels are expressed in apical plasma membranes of principal cells in the distal nephron, airway and alveolar epithelia in the lung, surface cells in the distal colon, urinary bladder epithelia, and other tissues including ducts of salivary and sweat glands (1Duc C.

Epithelial Na+ channels have a key role in the regulation of urinary Na+ reabsorption, extracellular fluid volume homeostasis, and control of blood pressure, and are a major site of action of volume regulatory hormones, including aldosterone (2Benos D.J.

The role of Na+ channels in blood pressure regulation has been illustrated in recent studies that have identified mutations in ENaC as the basis of the pathogenesis of Liddle's disease, a disorder characterized by volume expansion and hypertension (9Shimkets R.A.

The epithelial Na+ channel consists of at least three structurally related subunits, termed α-ENaC, 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; mec, mechanosensation defects; deg, degenerin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate. β-ENaC, and γ-ENaC (epithelial Na+ channel) (12Canessa C.M.

The primary and predicted secondary structures of these ENaCs have been described (12Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschl I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C.

Significant amino acid sequence similarities across species have been observed for individual subunits (on the order of ~60% to greater than 90% amino acid homology), although regions are present that are more highly conserved. A family of genes identified in Caenorhabditis elegans based on mutations that result in mechanosensation defects (mecs) and degeneration of selected neuronal cells (degs) are structurally related to ENaCs (16Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 17Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C.

Several of these genes, including mec-4, mec-6, and mec-10, are thought to form an ion channel in a manner analogous to the three ENaC subunits (16Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 19Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ENaCs and mecs (and degs) are members of a new gene superfamily. Members of this family include ENaCs, mecs and degs, FaNaCh (a peptide-gated channel cloned from the marine snail Helix aspers), δ-ENaC, and BNaC (cloned from human brain)), ASIC (an acid-sensing ionic channel), DRASIC (dorsal root ganglia acid-sensing ion channel) (20Lingueglia E.

Science. 1996; 273: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Epithelial Na+channels are composed of at least three structurally distinct subunits (12Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschl I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). We have used a biophysical approach to assess number of each ENaC subunit that assembles to form the Na+ channel complex (i.e. subunit stoichiometry). Our results suggest that ENaC has a tetrameric structure and is composed of two α-, one β-, and one γ-subunit. Reagents were purchased from vendors listed below or from Sigma. All three mutants were made using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis technique (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995: 8.5.8Google Scholar). For each mutant, two rounds of PCR amplification were performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA) and an MJ Research thermal cycler (Watertown, MA). Two overlapping fragments were generated in the first round of PCR amplification using the internal mutagenic forward primer with the 3′ end external reverse primer and, in a separate reaction, using the internal mutagenic reverse primer with the 5′ end external forward primer. In the second round of PCR amplification, the two overlapping fragments generated in the first PCR were first spliced together by two rounds of thermocycling, followed by 22 rounds of amplification with added external primers. The PCR product from the second step was ligated into the original mENaC clone, using unique restriction sites at the two ends. All sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis performed at the University of Pennsylvania's DNA sequencing facility. The mutant and the wild type cRNAs were prepared using a cRNA synthesis kit (m-MESSAGE mMACHINE, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). cRNA concentration was measured spectroscopically. For optimum ENaC expression, equal amounts (3 ng) of each of the three subunits were injected into oocytes and electrophysiological measurements were performed 1 to 5 days after injection. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed by clamping oocytes to −100 mV (with reference to bath) for 500 ms and 0 mV for 450 ms. For all measurements, the current difference between the two command potentials was used for data analysis. The difference in current measured in the presence and absence of amiloride (100 μm for wild type mENaC and 1 or 5 mm amiloride for mutant mENaCs) was used to define the amiloride-sensitive current. Amiloride titration measurements were performed under continuous flow (~4 ml/min) of buffers containing varying concentrations of amiloride. Single channel recordings were performed in the cell attached configuration. All data were collected at room temperature and were filtered at 100 Hz. The applied voltage to the membrane patch represents the voltage deflection from the resting membrane potential. Inward Na+ current is represented by a downward deflection in single channel recordings. Following injection, oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's saline solution containing (in mm): 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 15 HEPES, 0.3 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, pH 7.2. The buffer was supplemented with 10 μg/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, and 10 μg/ml nystatin. The bath media for two-electrode voltage clamp experiments contained in mm: 100 sodium gluconate, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2 ,10 HEPES, 5 BaCl2, and 10 TEA-Cl, pH 7.2. Measurements of single channel conductance were performed with a buffer containing (in mm): 100 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 KCl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, in the pipette and in the bath. In patch-clamp studies performed to examine the effects of (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA, Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the bath solution contained (in mm): 100 potassium gluconate, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2 10 HEPES, 5 BaCl2, 10 TEA-Cl, pH 7.2; the pipette solution in these experiments contained (in mm): 100 LiCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 KCl, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. To investigate the effects of MTSEA on single channels, a 5 mm MTSEA solution was freshly prepared for each patch-clamp, and was perfused into the pipette (26Tang J.M. Wang J. Eisenberg R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 176-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) following single channel recordings in the absence of the drug. Curve fitting and statistical analysis were performed using Matlab software package (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The inhibition constant, K i, and the pseudo Hill coefficient, n′, described by the Langmuir inhibition isotherm (Equation 1) were determined by nonlinear regression,I/I0=Kin′Ktn′+[B]n′,Equation 1 where I and I o are the macroscopic current in the presence and absence of the blocker (B), respectively. Wild type and mutant mENaC subunits that express different sensitivities to channel blockers were used to determine mENaC stoichiometry. The injection of oocytes with varying ratios of wild type and mutant mENaC cRNAs results in expression of oligomeric channels, each containing either inhibitor-sensitive and/or inhibitor-insensitive subunits. Analyses of the effects of inhibitors on the expressed channels allows for determination of subunit stoichiometry (27MacKinnon R.

Kleyman, manuscript in preparation. All three subunits appear to participate in amiloride binding, as single point mutations in the putative pore forming regions of any of these subunits results in altered amiloride binding (30Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The mutants αS583C, βG525C, and γG542C were used for these studies, as they differ from wild type ENaC in their sensitivities to channel blockers (30Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). α,βG525C,γ-mENaC and α,β,γG542C-mENaC are inhibited by amiloride with IC50values of 73 and 43 μm, respectively (Fig.1 and TableI). αS583C,β,γ-mENaC is blocked by amiloride with an IC50 of 0.6 μm (Table I), sufficiently close to the IC50 of wild type mENaC to preclude the use of amiloride in the determination of the stoichiometry of the α-subunit. However, wild type mENaCs are insensitive to the sulfhydryl reagent MTSEA (0.5 mm), whereas αS583C,β,γ-ENaC is blocked by MTSEA (Fig.2 A).Table IProperties of wild type and mutant mENaCsmENaC speciesK i amilorideHill coefficient conductance (pS)Single channelWild type92.8 nm (n = 7)0.994.7αS583C,β,γ600 nm(n = 2)ND1-aND, not determined.4.7α,βG525C,γ73 μm (n = 8–10)0.752.8α,β,γG542C43 μm(n = 6–7)0.843.21-a ND, not determined.

Wild type α,β,γ-mENaC (open bar) is insensitive to 0.5 mm MTSEA (5 ± 2% inhibition) whereas αS583C,β,γ-mENaC mutant (closed bar) is largely blocked (92 ± 2% inhibition) by the drug.

We examined the single channel conductances of the mutant mENaCs (αS583C,β,γ-mENaC; α,βG525C,γ-mENaC; and α,β,γG542C-mENaC) expressed inXenopus oocytes (Fig. 3). The slope conductance of αS583C,β,γ-mENaC was 4.7 pS, essentially indistinguishable from wild type mENaC.2 In contrast, the slope conductance for α,βG525C,γ-mENaC was 2.8 pS, and for α,β,γG542C-mENaC was 3.2 pS. These slope conductances are in reasonable agreement with previous observations (30Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As the single channel conductances of α,βG525C,γ-mENaC and α,β,γG542C-mENaC differ from wild type α,β,γ-mENaC, these differences were taken into account when determining β- and γ-subunit stoichiometry. The differential sensitivities of wild type α,β,γ-mENaC and αS583C,β,γ-mENaC to MTSEA were used to determine α-subunit stoichiometry. Fig. 2 illustrates the response to MTSEA (0.5 mm) of oocytes injected with a 1:1 (Fig. 2 B) or 4:1 (Fig. 2 C) mixture of wild type and α mutant (αS583C) cRNAs. This figure also illustrates the predicted responses to MTSEA for α-subunit stoichiometries (N) of 1, 2, or 3; assuming, 1) a binomial distribution of wild type and mutant α-subunits in the expressed mENaCs; and 2) that a single MTSEA-sensitive subunit (i.e. αS583C) confers blocker sensitivity to the heteroligomeric channel. The responses of oocytes injected with either 1:1 or 4:1 mixtures of wild type and mutant cRNAs were consistent with an α-subunit stoichiometry of two. The maximum likelihood of N to match all data is attained with an n= 2. An n = 2 is e 59 times more likely than n = 1, and e 23 times more likely than n = 3 to produce the experimental results. We next examined whether MTSEA-induced block of channels composed of a wild type and a mutant α-subunit ENaC (i.e. a hybrid channel) is complete or partial. If MTSEA induces a partial block of the hybrid channel, our results could be consistent with a stoichiometry of greater than 2. Cell-attached patch-clamp was used to examine the effects of MTSEA on single channel currents in oocytes injected with: 1) wild type α,β,γ-mENaC cRNA; 2) αS583C,β,γ-mENaC cRNA; 3) or oocytes co-injected with a 1:1 ratio of α,β,γ-mENaC and αS583C,β,γ-mENaC cRNAs (Fig.4). Wild type α,β,γ Na+channels detected in the absence of MTSEA were also observed following MTSEA infusion into the patch pipette (n = 26) (26Tang J.M. Wang J. Eisenberg R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 176-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, all αS583C,β,γ Na+ channels detected in the absence of MTSEA were completely blocked following MTSEA infusion (n = 17). Of the 28 Na+ channels observed in oocytes injected with the 1:1 mixture of α,β,γ-mENaC and αS583C,β,γ-mENaC cRNAs, no prolonged subconductance state, suggestive of a partial Na+ channel block, was observed following MTSEA infusion. In addition, no flickering response suggestive of a rapid, reversible block of Na+ channels was observed. The differential sensitivities of wild type mENaC and α,βG525C,γ-mENaC to amiloride were used to determine β-subunit stoichiometry. The responses to amiloride of oocytes injected with a 1:1 or a 1:4 mixture of wild type (α, β, γ) and mutant (α,βG525C,γ) mENaC cRNAs are illustrated in Fig. 5. This figure also illustrates the predicted responses of oocytes injected with a 1:1 or 1:4 mixture of wild type and mutant cRNAs, for β-subunit stoichiometries (n) of 1 or 2. A random assembly resulting in a binomial distribution of wild type and mutant β-subunits expressed in channels was assumed. In generating the predicted responses, the conductance difference between the mutant and the wild type channels has been taken into account (see Fig. 5, legend). If channels are composed of 2 β-subunit, three distinct populations of channel will be present: (i) wild type channels, (ii) fully mutant channels, and (iii) channels that have both a wild type and a mutant β-subunit (i.e. hybrid channels). The values for theK i for amiloride, Hill coefficient, and single channel conductance for the hybrid channels were obtained by minimizing the χ2 error of the predicted response for a stoichiometry of 2 to the experimental data. Optimized parameters from nonlinear regression were utilized in likelihood ratio analysis. This analysis indicated that n = 1 ise 25 times more likely to produce the experimental results than n = 2. Therefore, the experimental data is most consistent with the a β-subunit stoichiometry of one. β-Subunit stoichiometry can also be illustrated graphically by transforming the amiloride titration data (Fig. 5 A) according to Equation 2 (see Fig. 5 B, legend). Fig.5 B illustrates the outcome of such a transformation using data collected from oocytes injected with 1:4 ratio of (α, β, γ):(α,βG525C,γ) cRNAs. Evident from the figure, as the amiloride concentration increases, the left side of Equation 2 approaches a β-subunit stoichiometry of one. A similar approach was adopted to determine the stoichiometry of γ-subunit. The responses to amiloride of oocytes injected with a 1:1 or a 1:4 mixture of wild type (α, β, γ) and mutant (α,β,γG542C) mENaC cRNAs is illustrated in Fig. 6 A. The predicted responses for γ-subunit stoichiometries of 1 and 2 are also plotted in the figure. In generating the predicted response for a stoichiometry of 2, the Hill coefficient, K i for amiloride and single channel conductance for the hybrid species (channels containing both wild type γ and the γG542C mutant) were inferred from minimizing χ2 error by nonlinear regression. Likelihood analysis indicate that n = 1 fits the experimental data e 61 times better thann = 2. Fig. 6 B displays the analysis of transformed data obtained from 1:4 mixture of wild type (α, β, γ) and mutant (α,β,γG542C). Similar to the β-subunit, as amiloride concentration increases, the transformed data approach a value of 1 for γ-subunit stoichiometry. Therefore, this analysis indicates that a single γ-subunit takes part in formation of ENaC. Our analyses of inhibition of wild type and mutant mENaCs suggest that ENaCs are composed of two α-subunits, one β-subunit, and one γ-subunit. This channel has a quaternary structure, similar to that reported for Kv, Kir, and voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels (Na+ and Ca2+ channels are composed of a large polypeptide with 4-fold internal symmetry) (27MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 29Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the analysis of subunit stoichiometry rests on the assumption that the integration of wild type or mutant subunits into Na+channels during assembly is a random event. The validity of this assumption is supported by analyses of currents expressed by oocytes injected with mixtures of wild type and mutant subunits that demonstrated that the distribution of these subunits was indeed binomial. Our analysis also rests on the assumption that a single drug-sensitive subunit confers blocker sensitivity to the channel. Again, this is a valid assumption. We demonstrated that channels that have one wild type and one mutant (i.e. αS583C) α-subunit, or channels that have two mutant α-subunits, are completely blocked by MTSEA (Figs. 2, B and C, and 4). As Na+ channels have only one β-subunit and one γ-subunit, the presence (or lack) of a mutant β-subunit (α,βG525C,γ) or mutant γ-subunit (α,β,γG542C) determines the sensitivity to amiloride.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) have recently reported an ENaC subunit stoichiometry in agreement with what we observed, using both a biophysical approach as well as analysis of ENaC subunit concatemers, although limitations in the use of concatemers to determine stoichiometry of ion channels have been described (34McCormack K. Lin L. Iverson L.E. Tanouye M.A. Sigworth F.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1406-1411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Snyder and co-workers (35Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) have recently reported an entirely different ENaC stoichiometry of 3 α-, 3 β-, and 3 γ-subunits. This proposed stoichiometry of 9 subunits would be unique for an ion channel. In utilizing a biophysical approach to determine subunit stoichiometry, a major assumption is that other than differential sensitivities to inhibitors, functional properties of mutant and wild type channels are similar (27MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 28Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2741-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These authors utilized 2 different mutants to determine γ-subunit stoichiometry, one of which was used in our study (γG542C-mENaC) (35Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). mENaCs that have this mutant have a single channel conductance that is 69% of wild type. If we did not include a correction for the reduced conductance of the mutant channel, our results would indicate a γ-subunit stoichiometry of between 1 and 2. The effects of the other subunit mutations (αS549C, βS520C, γS529C) on human ENaC functional (single channel) properties were not reported. These mutations are within largely hydrophobic regions preceding the predicted second membrane spanning domain of the channel that appear to participate in the formation of the channel pore. If these mutations introduce changes in human ENaC (hENaC) functional properties in the presence (or absence) of the methanethiosulfonate derivatives used in their study, analyses of the response to inhibitors might lead to an error in determination of subunit stoichiometry. In addition, a determination of stoichiometry requires that the relative amounts of Na+ subunits expressed in oocytes are precisely known. The authors injected hENaC subunit cDNAs into oocytes and examined subsequent functional expression. In this regard, both transcription and translation efficiencies among the different subunits must be similar. The use of cDNAs, rather than cRNAs, introduces an independent variable that is not present in our expression studies. Snyder and co-workers (35Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) also examined the mass of hENaC expressed in COS-7 cells and synthesized in vitro in the presence of microsomal membranes by sucrose density sedimentation. A predicted mass of ~950 kDa was observed, and the authors suggest that this size is consistent with an ENaC stoichiometry of 3 α-, 3 β-, and 3 γ-subunits. However, ENaC is likely associated with cytoskeletal proteins, and these associated proteins may contribute to the apparent size of the ENaC complex, assessed by sucrose density sedimentation. For example, we have observed that ankryin, α-spectrin, and the protein Apx (Apical protein Xenopus) (36Staub O. Verrey F. Kleyman T.R. Benos D.J. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbuhl J.P. J.

Smith, manuscript in preparation. α-Subunits by themselves can form ENaC channels (12Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschl I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C.

Recent studies, presented in abstract form, suggest that these α-subunit channels are composed of four subunits (37Berdiev B.K. Karlson K.H. Kozak F. Stanton B.A. Kleyman T.R. Ismailov I.I. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): A402Google Scholar), consistent with the tetrameric structure that we report for α, β, γ Na+channels. These studies used an α-subunit that has a deletion of a 6-residue tract (rat α-ENaCΔ278–283 (α-rENaCΔ278–283)) that results in a loss of sensitivity of the channel to submicromolar concentrations of amiloride (38Ismailov I.I. Kieber-Emmons T. Lin C. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Patton H.K. Fuller C.M. Worrell R. Zuckerman J.B. Sun W. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21075-21083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing αΔ278–283,β,γ-rENaCs have current levels that are markedly lower than currents observed in oocytes expressing wild type α,β,γ-rENaCs (38Ismailov I.I. Kieber-Emmons T. Lin C. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Patton H.K. Fuller C.M. Worrell R. Zuckerman J.B. Sun W. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21075-21083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This precluded the use of α-rENaC Δ278–283 in our analysis of α,β,γ-ENaC stoichiometry. We previously observed that α-subunit channels formed by the mutant α-rENaC H282D was insensitive to submicromolar concentrations of amiloride (38Ismailov I.I. Kieber-Emmons T. Lin C. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Patton H.K. Fuller C.M. Worrell R. Zuckerman J.B. Sun W. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21075-21083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, αH282D,β,γ-rENaC is inhibited by amiloride with an IC50 similar to wild type α,β,γ-rENaC (data not shown), again precluding the use of this mutant in our analysis of α,β,γ-ENaC stoichiometry. α, β-, Or α,γ-subunits expressed in oocytes form functional Na+channels (12Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschl I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). McNicholas and Canessa (39McNicholas C.M. Canessa C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) suggested that α,β-rENaC and α,γ-rENaC are composed of equal numbers of α- and β-subunits or of α- and γ-subunits. As our results suggest that ENaCs have a tetrameric structure, we propose that these channels are composed of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits or of 2 α- and 2 γ-subunits. We express our sincere thanks to Dr. Martin Pring for assistance with statistical analyses."

The early-onset AD has been correlated with an increased level of 42-residue AβP (AβP1–42). However, very little is known about the role of AβP1–42 in such pathology. We have examined the activity of AβP1–42 reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. Vesicles reconstituted with AβP show strong immunofluorescence labeling with an antibody raised against an extracellular domain of AβP suggesting the incorporation of AβP peptide in the vesicular membrane. Vesicles reconstituted with AβP showed a significant level of 45Ca2+ uptake. The 45Ca2+ uptake was inhibited by (i) a monoclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal region of AβP, (ii) Tris, and (iii) Zn2+. However, reducing agents Trolox and dithiothreitol did not inhibit the 45Ca2+uptake, indicating that the oxidation of AβP or its surrounding lipid molecules is not directly involved in the AβP-mediated Ca2+ uptake. An atomic force microscope was used to image the structure and physical properties of these vesicles. Vesicles ranged from 0.5 to 1 μm in diameter. The stiffness of the AβP-containing vesicles was significantly higher in the presence of calcium. The stiffness change was prevented in the presence of zinc, Tris, and anti-AβP antibody but not in the presence of Trolox and dithiothreitol. Thus the stiffness change is consistent with the vesicular uptake of Ca2+. These findings provide biochemical and structural evidence that AβP1–42 forms calcium-permeable channels and thus may induce cellular toxicity by regulating the calcium homeostasis in Alzheimer's disease.

AβP is derived primarily from a proteolytic cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (AβPP), a highly conserved and widely expressed integral membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning polypeptide.

Whether AβP1–42 toxicity is also mediated via AβP1–42 forming calcium-permeable ion channel is unclear. The molecular structure of AβP oligomers, especially as an ion channel, is unknown. Durell et al. (29Durell S.R. Guy H.R. Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.V. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2137-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have developed theoretical models for the structure of ion channel formed by the membrane-bound AβP1–40. However, no direct structural data from EM, NMR, x-ray diffraction, or other microscopic techniques are available to support the presence of the AβP channel. We have used an atomic force microscope (AFM) (30Binnig G. Quate C.F. Gerber C. Physiol. Rev. Lett. 1986; 56: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (12525) Google Scholar) integrated with a light and fluorescence microscope (31Lal R. Proksch R. Int. J. Imaging Syst. Technol. 1997; 8: 293-300Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to examine the mechanism(s) of AβP1–42 toxicity. AβP1–42 was reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles and were imaged in buffer to reveal the AβP-membrane complex and a channel-like structure. Consistent with the possibility of fresh AβPs forming ion-permeable channels (i) fluorescently labeled anti-AβP antibodies were localized in AβP-reconstituted vesicles, (ii) vesicles reconstituted with AβP show a significant level of 45Ca2+ uptake which was blocked by anti-AβP-antibody, Zn2+, and tromethamine, but not blocked by antioxidants, and (iii) AβP-reconstituted vesicles have considerably higher stiffness in the presence of calcium. Human AβP1–42 and phospholipids were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA) and Avanti Polar (Birmingham, AL), respectively. Liposomes were prepared from both palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine. 10 μl of phospholipids (10 mg/ml palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine: palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine::1:1) in chloroform was dried under argon gas, and then 2 ml of buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4) was added. The mixture was then bath sonicated for 20 min. For the incorporation of AβP1–42 into liposomes, the phospholipids were first dried under argon gas, then 1.5 ml of buffer was added, followed by 20 min of bath sonication. The AβP stock solution (5 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was sonicated for another 20 min. The final concentration of phospholipids and AβP is 1 mg/ml. A mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the N′ terminus of AβP (named 3D6 antibody [anti-AβP 1–5 (DAEFR)]) was obtained from Dr. Russell Rydel at Athena Neurosciences (San Francisco, CA). Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1 mg/ml) was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Liposomes were adsorbed on glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA and 1% goat serum to minimize nonspecific binding. Primary antibody (diluted 500-fold) was added in the presence of 3% BSA and 1% goat serum and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the sample was incubated with secondary antibody (500-fold dilution) at the same condition as primary incubation. Fluorescent images were obtained using 40× high numerical aperture objective lens with an inverted Olympus inverted fluorescence microscope. 45Ca2+ uptake was measured by the modified method of Nakade et al. (32Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 25 μl of liposomes reconstituted with/without AβP1–42 was incubated with 75 μl of HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing 2 μCi of 45Ca2+. Calcium influx was measured separately for each perturbation: anti-AβP-antibody, Zn2+, Tris, Trolox, and DTT, respectively. After incubation for 1 min at 30 °C, in the presence of a perturbation, the calcium influx reaction was stopped with a blocking solution containing 300 μl HEPES buffer, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 5 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm Tris, and 15 μg/ml 3D6 antibody. The 400-μl mixture of liposomes and the blocking solution was immediately loaded onto a Chelex 100 column (bead volume: 3 ml) (Bio-Rad) which was pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 200 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at room temperature), and 0.3% BSA. The column was then washed immediately with 5 ml of a buffer containing 200 mm sucrose and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to take the liposomes. The45Ca2+ content of the liposomes was measured with a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. AFM images were obtained as described (33Lal R. Drake B. Blumberg D. Saner D.S. Hansma P.K. Feinstein S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C275-C285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 3Y. J. Zhu, Y. Zhang, and R. Lal, submitted for publication. using a prototype of Bioscope AFM and a Multimode AFM (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). Contact mode AFM was used for most of the images. Oxide-sharpened silicon nitride tips with a nominal spring constant of about 0.06 newton/m (Digital Instruments) were used for most experiments. All imaging was conducted on wet and hydrated liposomes. For liposomes reconstituted with/without AβP1–42, 20–50 μl of sample was deposited on a clean glass Petri dish and left for 30 min. The surface of the Petri dish was then rinsed with a buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and imaged in the buffer. The imaging force was regularly monitored and kept to a minimum. The imaging force varied from subnanonewton to tens of nanonewtons. All imaging was performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). We measured stiffness of AβP vesicles by the AFM force-mapping technique as described (34Laney D. Garcia R. Parsons S. Hansma H.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 806-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) using the Nanoscope III software (Version 4.23R2; Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara). Force maps were taken by raster scanning the tip over the sample with 64 × 64 measuring points with a pixel resolution of 95 nm. Each force map thus consists of a topographical image of 64 × 64 pixels, and a force curve is stored for every pixel. Force maps were obtained alternately with the regular height and error modes of imaging the surface topography, using the same cantilever. Vesicle stiffness was calculated from the force-volume imaging data. Force maps were exported to and analyzed with IGOR Pro software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and macros written by Dan Laney (34Laney D. Garcia R. Parsons S. Hansma H.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 806-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To calculate the elastic modulus of vesicles from the force curves, the Hertz model was used and the vesicle-tip system was equated to a sphere-sphere interaction (35Radmacher M. Fritz M. Hansma P.K. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 264-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 36Young W.C. Roark's Formulas for Stress and Stain. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989Google Scholar). First, the indentation of the tip into the sample was determined by comparing force curves on the vesicles with those on the hard glass substrate. Then, the elastic modulus was extracted from the portion of the force curve where the indentation was still very small (~10 nm). Liposomes reconstituted with fresh AβP1–42 show strong immunolabeling with an anti-AβP antibody. Fig. 1 D shows a fluorescence labeling image of liposomes reconstituted with AβP1–42. For comparison, no immunofluorescence labeling was observed in the liposomes prepared without AβP1–42(Fig. 1 B). Also, there was no immunofluorescence labeling observed in vesicles reconstituted with aged AβP1–42(AβP stored for 24 h or longer). All immunolabeled liposomes have a well defined vesicular structure as revealed by AFM imaging (Fig. 1, A and C). Vesicles with strong immunofluorescence signals appear to have double-layered (two membranes) disc-shaped structures in AFM images. Vesicle size ranged from 0.5 to 1 μm. Vesicles without AβPs are on average half in diameter but more spherical compared with the vesicles with AβPs. The average height of vesicles without AβP is 40 nm and 31 nm for vesicles with AβP. The vesicular flattening and larger size are probably due to the protein-lipid interactions (37Anholt R. Fredkin D.R. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Montal M. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7122-7134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rhee S.K. Bevans C. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9212-9223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as is the case with other membrane proteins such as gap junctions and acetylcholine receptors. Since AβPP is a membrane protein, it was believed that the membrane-bound AβP portion would not be found as a free peptide except in case of membrane injury leading to a proteolytic cleavage of AβPP and also that the hydrophobic and self-aggregating nature of AβP would prohibit it from existing as a soluble, circulating peptide in normal biological fluids. Subsequent studies, however, revealed secreted soluble AβP in the conditioned media of a variety of primary or transfected AβPP-expressing cells under normal metabolic conditions (39Hass C.

Science. 1992; 258: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Our result is consistent with the presence of soluble AβPs that could interact with lipid membrane and form channels. Liposomes reconstituted with AβP1–42 show a significantly larger (>4-fold) increase in the influx of 45Ca2+ compared with the liposomes without AβP1–42 (compare A andB in the top panel of Fig.2). In the presence of an antibody raised against the amino-terminal domain of AβP, there was no significant influx of 45Ca2+ in the liposomes reconstituted with AβP (compare A, B, and C in thetop panel of Fig. 2). Such inhibition of calcium uptake by the anti-AβP antibody shows the specificity of AβP1–42-induced calcium uptake. The level of inhibition by anti-AβP antibody would have been greater if all epitopes of the reconstituted AβPs were oriented outside of the liposomes. We examined the mechanisms of AβP1–42-specific calcium uptake. Recent studies suggest that AβPs form cation-selective ion channels which can be inhibited by zinc, Tris, and other related compounds. Consistent with such a possibility, calcium uptake was prevented when the liposomes reconstituted with AβP1–42were incubated with Tris or zinc (compare A, B, and C, in the lower panel of Fig. 2). Whether this is also true at the cellular level needs to be examined. AβP1–40-specific cationic channels are reported in AD-free fibroblasts and neuronal patches(24–27, 47).3 AβP is reported to bind specifically and saturably with zinc in a biphase mode: at high affinity (K D = 107 nm) or at low affinity (K D = 5.2 μm) (42Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. de Paradis M. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26618-26621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The zinc-binding site was mapped to a stretch of contiguous residues between positions 6 and 28 of the AβP sequence. Zinc, at more than 1 μm concentration in the AβP-solubilized solution, is thought to facilitate the precipitation of AβP (43Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. de Paradis M. Gusella J.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21037-21044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This property is important because zinc is abundant in the same neocortical regions where AβP deposits are most commonly found, and high micromolar concentration of zinc is achieved during glutamatergic neurotransmission (45Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 46Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J.

J. 1998; 74: A316Google Scholar), providing one possible explanation for the propensity of AβP to deposit close to the neocortical synaptic vicinity. The influx of 45Ca2+ into liposomes containing AβP1–42 was not prevented by anti-oxidants Trolox (100 mm) and dithiothreitol (2 mm) (compare A, D, and E in thelower panel of Fig. 2). Rather, these anti-oxidants often appear to increase the calcium uptake. Anti-oxidants have been proposed to interact with the membrane lipid components and change the membrane permeability (for review see Refs.16Kosik K.S. Coleman P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 535-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 17Calingasan N.Y. Gandy S.E. Baker K.F. Sheu K.S. Kim H.M. Wisniewski Gibson G.E. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Benzi G. Moretti A. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, in our study, there was no significant change in calcium uptake in the liposomes prepared without AβPs. Our results thus strongly suggest that the anti-oxidants have little to no effect on AβP1–42 channel-mediated ionic exchange in vitro. Whether this is also true at the cellular level needs to be determined. In cells, calcium uptake would lead to altered metabolic load and an imbalance in the ionic homeostasis. In reconstituted vesicles, calcium uptake should change the physicochemical properties, especially vesicle stiffness and charge-charge interactions. We examined the change in vesicle stiffness using the force-mapping feature of the AFM imaging on vesicles reconstituted with/without AβP1–42(Fig. 3) with a well defined morphology as revealed in AFM images. The shape and size of the vesicles appear to vary, but the apparent height of the unilammellar vesicles was similar. Change in stiffness was examined for each treatment, e.g.anti-AβP antibody, Zn2+, Tris, Trolox, and DTT. Stiffness was measured on the same vesicles before and after the application of a perturbation, thus each vesicle serving as its own control. Stiffness change was normalized with respect to the average stiffness in the calcium-free medium. In parallel with the change in the calcium uptake, stiffness of the vesicles reconstituted with AβP1–42increased significantly compared with that for the vesicles without AβPs (compare A, B, and C in thetop panel of Fig.4). This stiffness change was inhibited by the anti-AβP antibody suggesting the presence of AβP. The calcium uptake-induced increased stiffness was inhibited by the presence of zinc or Tris (compare A, B, andC in the bottom panel in Fig. 4). On the other hand, anti-oxidants, such as Trolox and DTT, had diverse effects on the calcium uptake-induced stiffness increase. DTT inhibited the stiffness change whereas Trolox enhanced the stiffness change. The inhibitory effect of DTT, however, is weaker than the inhibitory effect of zinc, Tris, and antibody. Such a complex effect of these antioxidants and the channel blockers may be reflected in the modes of action of these perturbations. The change in stiffness is expected to result from (i) calcium ion-induced charge-charge repulsion energy inside liposomes, (ii) the binding of calcium to the lipids and proteins, and also (iii) the increased efficacy of lipid-protein interactions. However, the binding between calcium and the lipids or peptides on the external surface of the liposomes is unlikely the main driving force to increase in stiffness of liposomes because the same divalent cation zinc blocked the increase in stiffness of liposomes (Fig. 4, lower panel). It is possible that antioxidants do not prevent calcium binding to lipids on the internal face of the vesicle whereas zinc, Tris, and antibody (perhaps by steric effect) all prevent the binding of calcium to the lipids and proteins on the external face of the vesicles. Further study is required to examine this issue. In summary, our study strongly suggests that AβP1–42 forms calcium-permeable, Zn2+-sensitive channels in vitro and allows calcium transport. Such calcium exchange could destabilize cellular calcium homeostasis and lead to the cell toxicity. We thank Drs. Bruce Kagan and Dennis Clegg for useful advice and critical evaluation of the manuscript, Dr. Russell Rydel of Athena Neurosciences for kindly providing us the antibodies used in our study, and Dr. Paul Hansma for encouragement with the AFM study of Alzheimer's disease."

In skeletal muscle the primary control of RyR-1 (the predominant skeletal RyR isoform) occurs via an interaction with plasmalemmal dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), which function as both voltage sensors for EC coupling and as l-type Ca2+ channels (Rios, E., and Brum, G. (1987) Nature325, 717–720). In addition to “receiving” the EC coupling signal from the DHPR, RyR-1 also “transmits” a retrograde signal that enhances the Ca2+ channel activity of the DHPR (Nakai, J., Dirksen, R. T., Nguyen, H. T., Pessah, I. N., Beam, K. G., and Allen, P. D. (1996) Nature380, 72–76). A similar kind of retrograde signaling (from RyRs tol-type Ca2+ channels) has also been reported in neurons (Chavis, P., Fagni, L., Lansman, J. B., and Bockaert, J. (1996) Nature382, 719–722). To investigate the molecular mechanism of reciprocal signaling, we constructed cDNAs encoding chimeras of RyR-1 and RyR-2 (the predominant cardiac RyR isoform) and expressed them in dyspedic myotubes, which lack an endogenous RyR-1. We found that a chimera that contained residues 1,635–2,636 of RyR-1 both mediated skeletal-type EC coupling and enhanced Ca2+channel function, whereas a chimera containing adjacent RyR-1 residues (2,659–3,720) was only able to enhance Ca2+ channel function. These results demonstrate that two distinct regions are involved in the reciprocal interactions of RyR-1 with the skeletal DHPR.

Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and the RyRs function as Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (7Imagawa T. Smith J.S. Coronado R. Campbell K.P.

A. 1988; 85: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In response to depolarization, the DHPRs undergo conformational changes that produce membrane-bound charge movements (10Schneider M.F. Chandler W.K. Nature. 1973; 242: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). As one consequence of these conformational changes, a signal is transmitted to the RyRs, causing them to release Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These conformational changes also control a slowly activating l-type Ca2+ current, which mediates the entry of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasmalemma. However, the slow l-type Ca2+ current is not important for skeletal muscle-type EC coupling because this coupling persists under conditions that prevent the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (11Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The use of dysgenic myotubes (12Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Science. 1963; 142: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which lack the endogenous α1 subunit of the skeletal DHPR (α1S), together with expression of cDNAs encoding chimeric combinations of α1S and α1C (the cardiac isoform of the DHPR α1 subunit), has revealed (13Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) that the loop linking homology repeats II and III is critical for transmitting the orthograde, EC coupling signal from the skeletal DHPR to RyR-1, the predominant skeletal isoform of the RyR. Recently, cultured myotubes from dyspedic mice (6Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), which lack a functional RyR-1 gene, have provided a skeletal muscle system that makes it possible to express and functionally analyze cDNAs encoding RyRs. Results with dyspedic myotubes indicate that in addition to the “orthograde” (EC coupling) signal from DHPRs to RyRs in skeletal muscle, there also seems to be a “retrograde” signal from RyRs to DHPRs (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Specifically, DHPRs appear to be present in the plasmalemma of dyspedic myotubes and able to undergo the voltage-driven conformational changes producing charge movement; however, the magnitude of slow l-type Ca2+ current is decreased in relationship to that of charge movement, indicating that the probability of channel opening is reduced and/or the channels open to less than the full conductance level. Expression in dyspedic myotubes of cDNA encoding RyR-1 causes the magnitude of thel-type Ca2+ current to return toward normal and also restores skeletal-type EC coupling. Expression in dyspedic myotubes of cDNA encoding RyR-2, the predominant cardiac RyR, fails to restore either orthograde signaling (skeletal-type EC coupling) or retrograde signaling (increased density of l-type Ca2+ current) (14Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To identify regions of RyR-1 important for reciprocal interactions with the skeletal DHPR, we have expressed cDNAs encoding chimeras of RyR-1 and RyR-2. We find that two distinct regions of RyR-1 appear to be important for reciprocal interactions with the DHPR. Because the RyR-1 plasmid (pRyR/Hygro) used in our previous experiments (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) lacked convenient restriction sites at the ends of the cDNA insert, we constructed a new RyR-1 plasmid (pCIneoRyR-1) as follows. MluI andXbaI sites were created before the Kozak initiation sequence (GCCGCC) and after the translation termination codon (15,112–15,114) of pRyR/Hygro, respectively, by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The MluI-SalI (PCR-547) fragment amplified from pRyR/Hygro, the SalI-ClaI (547–14,313) fragment from pRyR/Hygro, and the ClaI-XbaI (14,313-PCR) fragment amplified from pRyR/Hygro were ligated to theMluI/XbaI sites of pCIneo (Promega) to yield pCIneoRyR-1. Because pRyR/Hygro and pCIneoRyR-1 behaved similarly, data from both clones are illustrated. The construction of pCIneoRyR-2 was described previously (14Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Chimeric plasmids included the following sequences (PL designates the polylinker, and an asterisk designates a restriction site introduced by means of PCR). pCIneoR1:MluI-NdeI (PL-Sk 11,173) from pCIneoRyR-1 andNdeI-MluI (Ca 11,071-PL) from pCIneoRyR-2;pCIneoR2: MluI-BamHI (PL-Sk 4,894) from pCIneoRyR-1 and BamHI-MluI (Ca 4,867-PL) from pCIneoRyR-2; pCIneoR4: BamHI-NdeI (Sk 4, 894–11,173) from pCIneoRyR-1 andNdeI-BamHI (Ca 11,071–4,867) from pCIneoRyR-2;pCIneoR6: EcoRI-NdeI (Sk 2, 396–11,173) from pCIneoRyR-1 and NdeI-EcoRI (Ca 11,071–2,429*) from pCIneoRyR-2; pCIneoR9:AflII-NdeI (Sk 7,922*-11, 173) from pCIneoRyR-1 and NdeI-AflII (Ca 11,071–7,820) from pCIneoRyR-2; pCIneoR10: BamHI-AflII (Sk 4,894–7,922*) from pCIneoRyR-1 andAflII-BamHI (Ca 7,820–4,867) from pCIneoRyR-2. PCR was used to create EcoRI (Ca 2,429) and AflII (Sk 7,922) sites (by the mutations G2430A and C7923T, respectively) without altering the amino acid code. All fragments amplified by PCR were sequenced. The procedures for primary culture of dyspedic myotubes and for nuclear injection of plasmid DNA were as described previously (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 5Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S.

RyR cDNAs (0.5 μg/μl except 0.1–0.5 μg/μl for pCIneoRyR-2) were coinjected with CD8 cDNA (0.1 μg/μl) (16Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing the injected plasmids were identified on the basis of contraction and/or binding of CD8 antibody-coated beads (16Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar) and were analyzed 1–4 days after plasmid injection. Ca2+ currents were measured with the whole cell patch clamp technique (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In some instances, a 5-min exposure of cells to 0.1 mm BAPTA-AM (at room temperature) was used to abolish spontaneous contractions. The patch pipette contained (mM) 140 cesium aspartate, 5 MgCl2, 10 Cs2EGTA (20 nm free Ca2+), 5 Na2ATP, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH) with or without 0.2 or 0.4 pentapotassium Fluo-3. The bath solution contained (mM) 145 tetraethylammonium+, 165 Cl−, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH), 0.003 tetrodotoxin, and 10 Ca2+. The voltage clamp command sequence consisted of stepping from the holding potential (−80 mV) to −30 mV for 1 s, to −50 mV for 25–30 ms, to the test potential for 200 ms, to −50 mV for 25–30 ms, and then back to the holding potential. To analyze intracellular Ca2+ transients in response to electrical stimulation, myotubes were loaded with Fluo-3 AM, and fluorescence changes (in arbitrary units) were measured as described previously (17GarcıÖa J. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cells were bathed in either normal rodent Ringer containing (mM) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), or in Ca2+-free Ringer (made by equimolar substitution of Mg2+ for Ca2+ in the normal rodent Ringer). Cells were stimulated with a 10-ms pulse applied via an extracellular pipette (5Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S.

Additional support for this general architecture is provided by the recent observation that even after removal of the majority of the amino-terminal (~80%), the remaining carboxyl-terminal portion of RyR-1 is still able to form functional Ca2+ release channels (24Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because the foot bridges the gap between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the sarcolemma (25Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Takeshima H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it would seem to be the part of the RyR most likely to participate in reciprocal interactions with the DHPR. To identify regions of RyR-1 (18Takeshima H. Nishimura N. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 19Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) critical for these reciprocal interactions, we constructed six cDNAs encoding chimeric RyRs in which a varying portion of the foot region of RyR-2 (20Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamata Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 21Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13472-13483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was replaced with the corresponding portion of RyR-1 (Fig.1). The chimeric RyRs were expressed in myotubes obtained from dyspedic mice, which lack an intact RyR-1 gene (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This approach is based on previous work with dyspedic myotubes, which demonstrated that (a) expression of RyR-1 both restored skeletal-type EC coupling (i.e. not requiring entry of extracellular Ca2+) and enhanced the Ca2+channel activity of the DHPR (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and (b) expression of RyR-2 neither restored skeletal-type EC coupling nor enhancedl-type Ca2+ channel activity (14Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The RyR expression plasmids were co-injected with a plasmid encoding CD8 T-cell antigen into nuclei of dyspedic myotubes. Myotubes selected for analysis displayed spontaneous and/or electrically evoked contractions together with decoration by CD8 antibody-coated beads (16Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar), which had been added to the bathing medium. Fig. 2 illustrates whole cell Ca2+ currents and Ca2+ transients recorded from myotubes expressing wild-type or chimeric RyRs. In order to minimize the amount of exogenous Ca2+ buffering, the Ca2+ transients were measured in intact myotubes loaded with Fluo-3 AM. Some of the chimeric RyRs caused spontaneous oscillatory contractions like those previously described for RyR-2 (14Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,26Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Sakurai T. Endo M. Iino M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6172-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, BAPTA-AM was used in some experiments to suppress the contractions before measurement of Ca2+ currents (see legend to Fig. 2). Control experiments on normal myotubes demonstrated that the Ca2+ current density was slightly lower in BAPTA-AM-treated cells (11.3 ± 2.7 pA/pF, n = 10) than in nontreated cells (16.8 ± 4.1 pA/pF, n = 15). As reported previously, dyspedic myotubes had a small Ca2+ current density (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 27Fleig A. Takeshima H. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and lacked EC coupling (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 6Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), both of which were restored toward normal after expression of RyR-1 (Fig. 2) (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The restored EC coupling was skeletal-type because the depolarization-evoked Ca2+ transient was observed even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Also as reported previously, expression of RyR-2 restored neither l-type Ca2+ current (14Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) nor depolarization-induced Ca2+ release (even when external Ca2+ was present) (14Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Sakurai T. Endo M. Iino M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6172-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The chimera R1, in which the majority of the amino-terminal portion of RyR-2 was replaced with RyR-1 sequence (1Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 3Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 720), restored both Ca2+ current density and skeletal-type EC coupling. Therefore, the foot portion of RyR-1 is important for reciprocal interactions with the skeletal DHPR. To localize more precisely the RyR regions critical for reciprocal interaction with the skeletal DHPR, we next examined chimeras that contained segments of RyR-1 sequence smaller than in R1. The chimera R2, which contained the RyR-1 sequence (1–1,631) corresponding only to the amino-terminal half of that in R1, restored neither Ca2+ current nor EC coupling. Despite being unable to interact reciprocally with the DHPR, R2 did encode a functional protein because myotubes expressing R2 cDNA displayed spontaneous, oscillatory contractions and could release Ca2+ in response to application of 0.1 mm caffeine (data not shown). Because R1 (RyR-1: 1–3, 720) could reciprocally interact with the skeletal DHPR but R2 (RyR-1: 1–1, 631) could not, we next examined chimeras R6 (RyR-1: 812–3,720), R4 (RyR-1: 1,635–3, 720), and R9 (RyR-1: 2,659–3,720), in which successively longer portions of the RyR-1 sequence at the amino terminus of R1 were replaced with RyR-2 sequence. The R6 and R4 chimeras were able both to increase Ca2+current density and to restore skeletal-type EC coupling. Chimera R9 increased Ca2+ current density and restored a depolarization-induced Ca2+ transient that was presentonly when there was extracellular Ca2+. It is unlikely that Ca2+ entering via the enhanced, slowl-type Ca2+ current was by itself sufficient to produce this Ca2+ transient because even a large, rapidly activating Ca2+ current (resulting from heterologously expressed l-channels) produces only a small change in myoplasmic Ca2+ in dyspedic myotubes (14Nakai J. Ogura T. Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, R9 appears capable of supporting Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release but cannot mediate skeletal-type EC coupling. Because R4 (RyR-1: 1,635–3,720) supported skeletal-type coupling and R9 (RyR-1: 2,659–3,720) did not, we next examined R10 (RyR-1: 1,635–2,636). R10 both supported skeletal-type coupling and increased the density ofl-type Ca2+ current (Fig. 2). Three regions, which have been designated D1, D2, and D3 (28Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), are particularly divergent between RyR-1 (18Takeshima H. Nishimura N. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 19Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RyR-2 (20Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamata Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 21Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13472-13483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yamazawa et al. reported that deletion of D2 (RyR-1: 1,342–1,403) abolishes the ability of RyR-1 to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling, although EC coupling is preserved when the sequence of the D2 region is converted to RyR-2 sequence (29Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Iino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8161-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that neither D2 nor D1 (RyR-1: 4,254–4,631) is important for the difference between RyR-1 and RyR-2 in mediating skeletal-type EC coupling and enhanced Ca2+ channel activity of the DHPR (Fig. 1). However, the D3 region (RyR-1: 1,872–1,923), which contains a cluster of acidic residues not present in RyR-2, could have specific importance for the ability of RyR-1 to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling because the R10 chimera includes the D3 region. Fig. 3 is a schematic model of interactions between the DHPR and RyR in skeletal muscle. The skeletal DHPR is an l-type Ca2+ channel with voltage-sensing elements that have been adapted to control the gating of the slow l-type Ca2+ current and also to initiate EC coupling by triggering the opening of the Ca2+release channel (i.e. RyR-1). Previous work has shown that the putative, intracellular loop connecting repeats II and III of the DHPR is critical for skeletal-type EC coupling (13Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 30Lu X. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lu X. Xu L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The demonstration here that chimera R10 restores skeletal-type EC coupling suggests the possibility that the II-III loop triggers Ca2+release by means of contact with RyR-1 in a region delimited by amino acids 1,635–2,636. Because l-type Ca2+ current density was increased by both R10 and R9, some of the residues between 1,635 and 2,636, as well as residues between 2,659 and 3,720, may represent sites of contact for retrograde signaling whereby RyR-1 enhances Ca2+ channel activity of the DHPR (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Interestingly, R10 and R9 are contained within two calpain digestion fragments of RyR-1 (1,401–2,843 and 2,844–4,685), which appear to be linked by an intrasubunit disulfide bridge (33Wu Y.

No matter what the actual folding structure of RyRs, the demonstration that R9 enhancesl-type Ca2+ channel activity without restoring skeletal-type EC coupling indicates that the structures of RyR-1 involved in retrograde (channel-enhancing) signaling are not identical to those involved in orthograde (EC coupling) signaling. Because RyR-1 is expressed in brain (22Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 34Kuwajima G. Futatsugi A. Niinobe M.

In the absence of substrate, the complex formed between ferrous NOS and O2 was sufficiently long lived for a precise spectroscopic characterization. This complex displayed similar spectral characteristics as the oxyferrous complex of cytochrome P450 (λmax = 416.5 nm). It then decomposed to the ferric state. The oxidation of the flavin components was much slower and could be observed only at temperatures higher than −20 °C. In the presence of substrate (l-arginine), another, 12-nm blue-shifted, intermediate spectrum was formed. The breakdown of the latter species resulted in the production ofN ω-hydroxy-l-arginine in a stoichiometry of maximally 52% per NOS heme. This product formation took place also in the absence of the reductase domain of NOS. Both formation of the blue-shifted intermediate and ofN ω-hydroxy-l-arginine required the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). We propose that the blue-shifted intermediate is the result of reductive activation of the oxygenated complex, and the electron is provided by BH4. These observations suggest that the reduction of the oxyferroheme complex may be the main function of BH4 in NOS catalysis.

The first one leads to the formation ofN ω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHLA), and the second one leads to the formation ofl-citrulline and NO (1Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 2Mayer B. Vincent S.R. Nitric Oxide in the Nervous System. Academic Press, London1995: 21-41Crossref Google Scholar). The latter reaction is not specific for NOS; the formation of l-citrulline and nitrite, an oxidation product of NO, has also been reported for cytochrome P450 (3Renaud J.P. Boucher J.L. Vadon S. Delaforge M. Mansuy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similarly to cytochrome P450, NOS contains a thiolate ligated heme, NADPH is the initial electron donor, and the reaction requires molecular oxygen (O2), which has to be activated and split for the oxidation of l-arginine and the formation of water (4Kwon N.S.

Ashton D.S. Moncada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23790-23795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to P450, in NOS the entire electron transfer chain is contained in a single molecule, consisting of a flavin-containing reductase domain and a heme-containing oxygenase domain (6Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it requires a cofactor, (6R)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydro-l-biopterin (tetrahydrobiopterin; BH4), the role of which is still unclear but the presence of which is essential for NO synthesis (7Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8List B.M. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+/calmodulin is required for electron flow from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain (9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). NOS catalysis involves the interaction of the reduced enzyme with molecular oxygen. Although little is known about this process for NOS, a wealth of data is available about the analogous P450 system (10Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P-450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, London1986: 217-271Crossref Google Scholar). As shown in Scheme FS1, reduced P450 is known to react rapidly with oxygen to form a transient oxygen complex, which has been stabilized at low temperature (11Eisenstein L. Debey P. Douzou P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 1377-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several biophysical studies have elucidated the electronic structure of this complex as a Fe(II)O2 ← Fe(III)O2· equilibrium, which is poised in favor of the ferric form (Scheme FS1, 1) (12Gunsalus I.C. Meeks J.R. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P. Münck E. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 561-613Google Scholar, 13Blanck J. Smettan G. Greschner S.

Chem. 1986; 261: 8089-8092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent reduction of this complex is thought to lead first to a peroxy compound (2) and eventually, after two protonation steps, to an iron(IV) porphyrin π-cation radical (3). Both species 2 and 3 have been proposed to act as oxygenating agents (15Vaz A.D.N. Pernecky S.J. Raner G.M. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4644-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The breakdown of these species results in product release and formation of ferriheme via still unknown intermediates (4). The corresponding reactions for NOS have not been reported, except for a very recent stopped-flow study, which demonstrated the transient formation in the oxidation of ferrous NOS by O2 of a compound absorbing at 427 nm (16Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this work, we used a different approach to study the reaction between molecular oxygen and reduced neuronal NOS (nNOS). In order to trap possible intermediates, most of the experiments were carried out at subzero temperatures in the presence of 50% ethylene glycol as anti-freeze solvent (17Douzou P. Cryobiochemistry. Academic Press, London1977: 45-90Google Scholar). The same procedure was employed previously for the study of P450 oxygen complexes (11Eisenstein L. Debey P. Douzou P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 1377-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Bonfils C. Debey P. Maurel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Special attention was paid to the role of BH4 in the reduction of the oxygen complex in the presence of l-arginine. Our results throw more light on the function of BH4 in NOS catalysis. Enzymes used for molecular biological procedures were from New England Biolabs (supplied by Biotrade, Vienna). The TA cloning kit from Invitrogen was from the same vendor. The Sequenase kit was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (supplied by MedPro, Vienna). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Institute of Microbiology and Genetics at the Biocenter of the University of Vienna. Glutathione-agarose beads, thrombin, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. BH4 was from Alexis Biochemicals (Switzerland); 7,8-dihydro-l-biopterin (BH2) was from Schircks Laboratories (Switzerland); calmodulin, l-arginine, and NOHLA were from Sigma; l-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine hydrochloride (57 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and purified by HPLC before use. All other reagents were purchased from Merck except for CHAPS, which was from Boehringer Mannheim. Oxygen (99.995% pure) was from Aga (Toulouse, France). Recombinant rat brain nNOS was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (20Harteneck C. Klatt P. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme contained tightly bound BH4in the ratio of 0.5 per heme. BH4-free nNOS was obtained from Sf9 cells treated with 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine according to a published procedure (8List B.M. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The nNOS oxygenase domain was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli by a procedure to be published elsewhere. The molar concentrations of nNOS and its oxygenase domain were determined from absorption coefficients of the oxidized and the ferrous-CO complex according to Sono et al.(21Sono M. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 CYP2B4 from rabbits, which had been under phenobarbital treatment for 1 week, was prepared according to the procedure of Coon et al. (22Coon M.J. van der Haeven T.A. Dahl S.B. Haugen D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The protein was kept frozen as a 69 μm solution in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 20% glycerol and 1 mm EDTA. The purified enzyme was electrophoretically homogenous, and in the oxidized state it displayed an absorbance ratio of R 417/277 = 1.06. Neither NOS nor cytochrome P450 showed P420 characteristics. Base line-corrected absorbance spectra in the 350–700-nm range were recorded with a Cary 3E (Varian) spectrophotometer in the double beam mode, using a 1.5-nm slit width. Data acquisition was in steps of 0.5 nm, with an acquisition time of 0.033–0.5 s/data point. The instrument was equipped with a home-built double sample compartment, which allowed spectral recordings at low temperatures (down to −50 °C). Sample and reference cuvettes were placed in a bloc made of aluminum, which was thermostatted by circulation of ethanol, thermoregulated in a Haake F3-Q bath. Inside the cells, the temperature was monitored continuously with a thermocouple connected to an AOIP voltmeter. For thermal insulation, the sample compartment was surrounded by polyvinyl chloride walls, equipped with double quartz windows. Formation of ice and condensation of water on the windows was prevented by a flow of dry nitrogen. To prevent freezing of the sample, the experiments were done in mixed organic solvents. If not specified otherwise, we used ethylene glycol/water (1:1, v/v). This solvent did not change significantly the spectral properties of NOS, it did not induce a transition to the P420 state, and in its presence the enzyme was still active in a standard assay (23Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The buffer was 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. It contained no calmodulin, and, unless specified, no BH4 was added. For CYP2B4, the solvent was 50% glycerol, and the buffer was sodium phosphate, 50 mm, pH 7.4. The pH of these mixed solvents is known to vary only little as a function of temperature (17Douzou P. Cryobiochemistry. Academic Press, London1977: 45-90Google Scholar). The sodium dithionite stock solution (23 mm) was prepared in the same solvent. Prior to use, argon was bubbled through the solutions for 30 min. The enzymes were diluted in the oxygen-free buffers at final concentrations of 3 μm in Teflon closed cuvettes in total volumes of 2 ml. They were reduced at 15 °C by the addition of 20 μl of a concentrated solution of sodium dithionite (final concentration, 230 μm) using a Hamilton syringe. When reduction was complete, the temperature was decreased to the desired value (typically −30 °C). 2–5 ml of precooled oxygen were then bubbled in the enzyme solution with a syringe. This procedure took about 5 s, and thereafter the spectra were recorded in intervals of 2 min. Reduction and oxygenation of NOS and its heme domain were carried out as described above, except for the presence of 500,000 cpm of 200 μml-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine. After incubation for 5–60 min at the specified temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 75 μl HCl (1 m) to the reaction mixture (1 ml). After centrifugation with a bench-top centrifuge, 100 μl of the supernatant were injected into a 25-cm Nucleosil SA 100–5 HPLC column from Macherey & Nagel. The arginine derivatives were separated at room temperature in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions of 750 μl were collected for 30 min, and radioactivity was determined in each fraction by liquid scintillation counting. NOHLA was identified by comparison with an authentic standard (24Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its formation was quantified from its integrated elution peak relative to the total radioactivity. In one control experiment, we used NADPH and not dithionite to reduce nNOS. In that case, the phosphate buffer was replaced by triethanolamine, 50 mm, pH 7.4, and a procedure similar to that described by Abu-Soud et al.(25Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was used. First, the heme iron of nNOS was reduced by 200 μm NADPH in the presence of 14 μmcalmodulin and 1 mm calcium chloride in aqueous buffer at 15 °C under the experimental conditions we had employed for reduction by dithionite. After dissociation of calmodulin by excess EDTA (1.8 mm final concentration), 200 μmradiolabeled l-arginine, was added, and oxygen was bubbled through the solution. The production of NOHLA was then quantified as described above. Under anaerobic conditions, 230 μmdithionite reduced the NOS sample within 10–15 min at 15 °C. Spectrally, the reduction was characterized by a loss of the flavin absorbance, a shift of the Soret band from 400 to 410 nm, a shoulder at 455 nm, and a maximum at 554 nm. During the subsequent temperature decrease to −30 °C, the spectrum of Fe(II) nNOS remained essentially the same, except for a slight sharpening of the Soret band. After the addition of oxygen at −30 °C, the spectrum changed within 1 min. As shown in Fig. 1, the amplitude of the Soret band was slightly decreased, and its maximum was red-shifted to 416.5 nm. In the visible region, the main effect was a broadening of the absorption band. As shown in Fig.2 A, the oxygenated minus reduced difference spectrum showed a strong maximum at 426 nm, two sharp minima at 401 and 458 nm, and an isosbestic point at 415 nm. Furthermore, two broad maxima appeared around 500 and 600 nm, as well as a minimum at about 550 nm.Figure 2Comparison with the oxyferrous complex of cytochrome P450. The P450 LM2 (···) difference spectra were normalized with respect to those of nNOS (——). A, formation of the oxygen complex; difference spectra between the oxygen complex minus the reduced state.

As shown in Fig.2 A, the oxidized minus oxygen complex difference spectrum grew with maxima at 387.5, 418.5, 516.5, and 650 nm, minima at 442.5 and 558 nm, and an isosbestic point at 427 nm. The observed changes and the resulting spectrum are indicative of a mixture of high and low spin ferriheme but with a much higher fraction in the low spin state than before the experiment at 15 °C. Finally, when the temperature was raised above −20 °C, the flavins became also oxidized, as evidenced by a broad absorbance increase between 350 and 420, and between 470 and 550 nm (not shown). The latter reaction is probably due to a direct (nonphysiological) reaction of the reduced flavins with oxygen or with hydrogen peroxide resulting from the reaction of oxygen with dithionite. As shown in Fig. 2, the spectral characteristics of formation and decomposition of the oxygen complex were similar to those observed with cytochrome P450. An exception was the trough at 458 nm in the difference spectrum (intermediate − reduced state, Fig.2 A), which was absent in P450. However, a comparison of the spectra of the reduced states shows that this spectral trough originates from the properties of the reduced state of NOS rather than from its oxygen complex. Indeed, the spectrum of reduced NOS, but not reduced P450, exhibits a shoulder at this wavelength. The differences observed during the autoxidation of the oxygen complex as compared with the analogous reaction in P450 (Fig. 2 B), i.e.additional absorbance increases at 387.5, 516.5, and 650 nm, can be ascribed to the formation of a significant fraction high spin ferriheme. The kinetics of oxygen binding and autoxidation were followed at 442.5 nm. Oxygen binding to reduced NOS was very rapid even at −30 °C. Subsequent oxidation of the heme was monoexponential (τ = 6.5 min at −30 °C). Oxidation of the flavins could only be observed at considerably higher temperatures (τ = 15.6 min at −11 °C). The addition ofl-arginine (200 μm) resulted in the well known shift of the heme iron spin equilibrium toward more high spin. This effect persisted in the presence of ethylene glycol and at low temperatures. Reduction gave rise to a spectrum very similar to that of substrate-free reduced nNOS (Fig.3 A). In this case, too, mixing of reduced nNOS with oxygen at −30 °C produced a detectable intermediate, but its Soret band was blue-shifted (λmax = 404.5 nm) (Fig. 3 B). In the visible region, the intermediate spectrum was similar to that obtained in the absence ofl-arginine. At −30 °C, its decay kinetics resulted within 37 min in an oxidized type high spin enzyme. The difference spectra reflecting formation (intermediate − reduced state, Fig.3 C) and decomposition (reoxidized − intermediate) were strikingly different from those obtained in the absence ofl-arginine (see above). The formation was characterized by a strong maximum at 375 nm and a double minimum at 417 and 453 nm. During the decomposition of the intermediate, a broad maximum appeared at 370 nm, with a shoulder at 420 nm and a minimum at 444 nm. In the absence ofl-arginine, binding of oxygen to BH4-free NOS at −30 °C resulted in similar spectral changes as those observed with BH4-bound NOS (cf. “Discussion” and Table II); the autoxidation of the oxygen complex (λmax = 415 nm), resulted in low spin ferric heme. In contrast, the presence ofl-arginine did not induce the blue-shifted oxygen complex observed in BH4-bound NOS, and the spectral characteristics of the oxygen complex were close to those observed in the BH4-free NOS in the absence of l-arginine. As for the BH4-bound NOS in the presence ofl-arginine, the autoxidation of this complex resulted in high spin ferric heme.Table IISoret band position of oxygen complexes of selected hemoproteinsEnzymeExperimentλmaxAttributed to species no. in Scheme FS1 and Fig. 6ReferencenmnNOSFe(II) + O2(stopped-flow)427116Abu-Soud H.M.

In all cases, a direct transition from the reduced to the oxidized state was observed, and no intermediate state could be detected. Whereas the cofactors did not significantly affect the spectrum of the reduced state, the final oxidized state was primarily low spin in the absence of substrate and high spin in the presence of l-arginine and/or BH4. As an example, the spectral changes in the presence of BH4 and l-arginine are shown in Fig. 4. Clear isosbestic points were observed at 406, 483, 534, and 595 nm. At −30 °C, the oxidation kinetics were relatively slow (τ = 12.4 min) without being affected noticeably by l-arginine and/or BH4. One explanation for the blue-shifted oxygen complex of BH4-bound full-length NOS in the presence of l-arginine might be that it represents a later intermediate in the activation of oxygen, one electron reduced beyond the ferrous oxygenated species. Since such a state could in principal furnish the two electrons required for the oxidation ofl-arginine to NOHLA and the concomitant reduction of oxygen to water, we decided to analyze the decomposition products of the reaction with radiolabeled l-arginine. Fig.5 shows a typical HPLC profile of the reaction products. Only one radioactive reaction product was formed, and this had the same retention time as authentic NOHLA. Control experiments in the absence of enzyme with or without added BH4 showed no product formation, and no NOHLA was detected unless the enzyme was reduced prior to the addition of oxygen. As shown in Table I, NOHLA formation was proportional to the NOS concentration in a stoichiometry between 0.3 and 0.5 per nNOS heme. NOHLA formation took place in both aqueous and mixed organic solvent. Moreover, the production of NOHLA was not specific to the presence of dithionite as the source of the first electron. When dithionite was replaced by NADPH (see “Experimental Procedures”), the yield of NOHLA production in aqueous buffer was 0.47 ± 0.03 per heme, which is the same value as that obtained with an initial reduction by dithionite. It must be mentioned here that under similar conditions (reduction with NADPH, but with excess BH4) Abu-Soud et al. (25Abu-Soud H.M. Presta A. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10811-10816Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) did not detect the formation of NOHLA. The reason for this difference is not clear. However, we are confident in our result; the experiment was carried out under argon atmosphere, and the result was reproducible.Table IFormation of NOHLA as the decomposition product of oxygenated reduced nNOS or its oxygenase domainEnzymeConcentrationTemperatureNOHLA formationNOHLA:heme stoichiometryμm°CμmnNOS2.8151.00.36nNOS8.4153.00.36nNOS2.8−300.80.29nNOS in aqueous buffer2.8151.280.46nNOS + 20 μmBH22.8150.420.15nNOS (oxidized)2.815ND1-aND, not detectable.NDOxygenase domain4.515NDNDOxygenase domain + 20 μm BH44.5152.340.52Oxygenase domain + 20 μmBH24.5150.10.02Full-length nNOS contains BH4 in a stoichiometry of approximately one per nNOS dimer.

Open table in a new tab Full-length nNOS contains BH4 in a stoichiometry of approximately one per nNOS dimer. If not otherwise stated, the buffer contained 50% ethylene glycol; for experimental conditions see “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Table I, the oxygenase domain alone was sufficient for this reaction. The presence of BH4, however, was essential. The oxidation state of the biopterin is also important; with the oxygenase domain, no NOHLA was produced when BH4 was replaced by BH2. The low residual NOHLA production in the full-length holoenzyme in the presence of BH2 is due to endogenous BH4, which is not readily displaced by added BH2 (26Klatt P. Schmid M. Leopold E. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13861-13866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By the use of subzero temperature spectroscopy, it was possible to detect an intermediate complex between reduced nNOS and molecular oxygen. This technique was employed previously to trap the analogous complex of various cytochrome P450 forms. The spectral characteristics of the complexes of both enzyme classes are quite similar, and the differences observed during complex formation (a trough at 458 nm) are due to a spectral particularity of deoxyferrous nNOS. The shoulder at 458 nm persists in reduced nNOS in the absence of the reductase domain and is not affected by BH4. The shoulder, which was noted before by others (21Sono M. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), may be due to the presence of a sixth ligand in a fraction of the enzyme. The additional absorbance increase at 380–390 nm suggests a hyperporphyrin spectrum, as has been reported for many ferrous complexes of cytochrome P450 (27Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13637-13645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Dawson J.D. Sono M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1255-1276Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The identity of the putative ligand cannot be established on the basis of the spectral changes, since most exogenous ligands other than O2 induce a red shift upon binding to ferrous P450 type heme. The spectral similarity of nNOS and P450 oxygen complexes suggests that both complexes have a similar electronic configuration. Most evidence in P450 points to a structure of Fe(III)O2·, and this configuration is also expected for NOS (29Korth H.G. Sustmann R. Thater C. Butler A.R. Ingold K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17776-17779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the same intermediate spectrum was obtained also in the absence of BH4, it may be concluded that, in substrate-free nNOS, BH4 does not perturb the electronic structure of the oxygen complex. The oxygen complex of nNOS is rather unstable, and it was necessary to lower the temperature to −30 °C to prevent its immediate autoxidation. In that aspect, nNOS resembles microsomal cytochrome P450 (18Bonfils C. Debey P. Maurel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The oxygen complex of mitochondrial P450scc is more stable (several hours at −30 °C (19Larroque C. van Lier J.E. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). The most stable one, the complex of soluble P450cam, can be detected without difficulty above 0 °C (at 25 °C, τ = 90 s (14Bangcharoenpaurpong O. Rizos A.K. Champion P.M. Jollie D. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8089-8092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). It appears thus that the protein environment plays a significant role in the stability of the oxygen complex. This idea is further supported by the fact that"

Such interactions, generally electrostatic in nature, regularly involve specific oligosaccharide domains generated by an elaborate biosynthetic machinery in the Golgi apparatus. HS formation starts by assembly of an initial (GlcA-GlcNAc)n polymer. Parts of the nascent polymer are subsequently modified byN-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues, and further modifications, including C-5 epimerization of GlcA residues into IdceA residues as well as O-sulfation at various positions, occur mainly in the vicinity of the previously incorporatedN-sulfate groups (3Salmivirta M.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) suggest that the biosynthesis of HS is subject to regulation during development or aging. Control of the appropriate expression of functional HS domains in given organs or at particular developmental stages would appear essential, whereas, conversely, perturbed regulation could contribute to various pathologies. In the present study we have explored the aging aortic wall as a model to gain insight into the control of HS structure and function in humans. Aging is a strong predisposing factor to atherosclerosis, characterized by endothelial damage, lipid accumulation, and cell proliferation in arterial wall plaques (16Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar). HS has been attributed multiple roles in these processes by interacting with lipoprotein lipase (17Berryman D. Bensadoun A. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24525-24531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and with growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) (18Vlodavsky I.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PDGFs are homo- or heterodimers of two closely related, A and B, polypeptide chains. The PDGF-A chain exists as two variants due to alternative mRNA splicing. The longer variant (PDGF-AL) contains a C-terminal polybasic sequence that serves as a cell retention signal and is associated with the localization of PDGF to the surface of the producer cell or to the extracellular matrix (21Östman A. Andersson M. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), presumably due to interactions with HS (20Raines E.W. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A similar but not identical retention signal is found at the C terminus of the PDGF-B propeptide chain (PDGF-BL) (21Östman A. Andersson M. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H.

This propeptide may undergo various N- and C-terminal proteolytic processing events that give rise to multiple forms of cell-associated PDGF-B species (23Östman A. Thyberg J. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Tissue samples from human abdominal aorta were obtained at autopsy and stored at −70 °C until processed for HS isolation. The surrounding connective tissue was removed, and the sample, encompassing the entire thickness of the vessel wall, was cut into fine pieces with a scalpel. The samples were defatted essentially as described (15Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with the exception that ethyl ether was replaced by ethanol. Defatted samples (dry weight, 0.15–2.0 g) were subjected to protease digestion with papain (Sigma; 5 mg/g of defatted tissue) in 25 ml of 0.05m Tris, pH 5.5, 0.01 m EDTA, 2 mNaCl, 0.01 m cysteine/HCl at 60 °C for 18 h and centrifuged (10 min at 2000 × g), and the supernatants were applied to columns of DEAE-Sephacel (1.5 × 5 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.2. The column was washed with 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, followed by elution of the DEAE-bound material (containing sulfated GAGs) by a linear gradient of LiCl (0.15–2.0 m) in the acetate buffer (15Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 2-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for uronic acid content by the carbazole reaction (24Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). Fractions containing GAGs were pooled, dialyzed against water, lyophilized, and digested with 1 unit of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corporation) and 125 units of endonuclease (Benzonase, Benzon Pharma A/S) in 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 m sodium acetate at 37 °C overnight (25Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16991-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The digest was heated for 2 min and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 0.2 mNH4HCO3 and eluted by a linear gradient of NH4HCO3 (0.2–2.0 m). Fractions containing HS were identified by the carbazole reaction, pooled, and freeze-dried, and the material was stored at −20 °C until further use. Treatment of the purified HS preparations with HNO2 at pH 1.5 resulted in quantitative degradation of the material into lower molecular weight species as demonstrated by chromatography of intact and HNO2-treated samples on a column of Superose 12 (data not shown), indicating that the purification procedure yielded pure HS. For radiolabeling, HS samples (80–150 μg) wereN-deacetylated in hydrazine hydrate (Fluka Chemie AG) containing 30% water and 1% hydrazine sulfate (Merck) for 2–4 h at 100 °C (26Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), desalted, and reacetylated using [3H]acetic anhydride (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (15Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The specific activity was calculated after measurement of the uronic acid content of the [3H]HS samples by the carbazole reaction. The binding of [3H]HS preparations to recombinant PDGF-AAL(27Lustig F. Hoebeke J. Östergren-Lundén G. Velge-Roussel F. Bondjers G. Olsson U. Rüetschi U. Fager G.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 5 mg of recombinant PDGF-AAL was mixed with an equimolar amount of heparin and immobilized to 3 ml of CH-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions (8Feyzi E.

The column was equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) prior to the application of [3H]HS. Subsequently, the column was washed with 10 ml of Tris-buffered saline, and the bound material was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (0.15–2.0 m in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. Samples of HS (~30 μg) were subjected to cleavage with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (28Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The cleavage products were end-labeled by reduction with 250 μCi of NaB3H4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight as described previously (4Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and desalted on a Sephadex G-15 column (1 × 190 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.2 mNH4HCO3. Fractions containing disaccharides were analyzed by anion exchange HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column (4.6 × 250 mm, Whatman Inc.) (29Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To calculate the degree of N-sulfation of GlcN residues the [3H]aManR end group-labeled HS oligosaccharides resulting from the HNO2 pH 1.5/NaB3H4 treatment were separated by chromatography on a column of Bio-Gel P-10 (1 × 160 cm, Bio-Rad) in 0.5 m NH4HCO3. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for radioactivity. The degree ofN-sulfation was calculated from the elution profiles using the following formula.N­sulfate groupstotalN­substituents=∑n=2n=∞an∑n=2n=∞an×n/2Equation 1 where n is the number of monosaccharide units anda is the total radioactivity in a given oligosaccharide species. In order to isolate 3H-labeled tetrasaccharides, aliquots of the HS oligosaccharides resulting from cleavage with HNO2 at pH 1.5 were separated by gel chromatography on a Superdex 30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in 0.5 mNH4HCO3. Fractions corresponding to tetrasaccharides were pooled and desalted. Tetrasaccharide species were separated by high voltage paper electrophoresis on Whatman number 3MM paper in 6.5% HCOOH, pH 1.7. We first examined the binding of radiolabeled human aorta HS from a young and an old individual to FGF-2 and to dimers of the long isoforms of PDGF A or B chains (designated PDGF-AAL and PDGF-BBL below) (30Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A filter trapping procedure was employed, involving interaction of labeled HS and the protein ligand in solution followed by rapid passage of the mixture through a nitrocellulose filter. Protein and protein-bound HS chains (but not free HS chains) were retained on the filter (8Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We found that the binding capacity for PDGF-AAL and PDGF-BBL of HS from a 76-year-old individual was 4–5 times higher than that of HS from a 21-year-old individual (Fig.1 A), whereas the binding to FGF-2 differed only marginally between the two HS samples. To assess the inter-individual variation in these interactions, we next compared the binding of six HS preparations, from three young and three old subjects, to PDGF and FGF-2. The results of this experiment (Fig.1 B) indicated a virtually invariable level of binding of HS to a given protein ligand within each of the two age groups but marked differences in binding characteristics between these groups. The effect of age thus was selectively expressed for different proteins, in accord with the data shown in Fig. 1 A. These findings clearly point to the occurrence of age-dependent differences in HS structure that affect the binding of HS to PDGF and FGF-2 in distinct ways. The effect of this structural transition with regard to PDGF binding was further examined by affinity chromatography of HS from young and old subjects on a column of immobilized PDGF-AAL(Fig. 1 C). Both types of HS contained material that remained bound to the growth factor at physiological pH and ionic strength, as well as a fraction of unbound material. The PDGF-binding chains amounted to 50.0 ± 2.4% versus 81.8 ± 1.5% (mean ± S.E. from three and two samples, respectively) of the total HS from young and old subjects, respectively. These results thus confirm not only the correlation between individual age and PDGF binding ability of aortic HS but also the striking inter-individual similarity within each age group. Binding of HS to PDGF-AAL and FGF-2 involves structurally distinct oligosaccharide domains. The former domain is comprised by N-sulfated ~8-mer sequences with at least one trisulfated IdceA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) disaccharide unit (8Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5518-5524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas the minimal FGF-2-binding site contains an essential IdceA(2-OSO3) residue but no 6-O-sulfate groups (5Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given these data, we wanted to examine whether the differential protein binding of aorta HS from young and old subjects would correlate with the O-sulfate substitution pattern of the N-sulfated regions of HS. We therefore determined the disaccharide composition of these regions in a total of 15 HS preparations from subjects aged 20–84 years (including the six preparations used in the binding experiments). The results of this analysis (Table I) demonstrated an age-dependent increase in the proportion of the IdceA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) unit (Fig. 2). Calculation of the overall extent of 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation indicated that this increase was due to an approximate doubling of the level of 6-O-sulfate substitution of GlcNSO3 residues in the old subjects (Fig. 2), whereas the IdceA 2-O-sulfation remained high and essentially unchanged (Fig. 2). The 6-O-sulfation of GlcNSO3 residues showed an almost linear increase between the age of 20 and 40 years; in the still older subjects the levels of 6-O-sulfation were somewhat scattered but consistently higher than in the young individuals (Fig.2).Table IAnalysis of O-sulfated disaccharide species derived from the contiguous N-sulfated regions of human aorta heparan sulfateSubject characteristicsDisaccharide compositionSubject1-aIn samples 12 and 13, macroscopic atherosclerotic lesions were present.AgeSexGlcA(2-OSO3)-aManRGlcA-aManR(6-OSO3)IdceA-aManR(6-OSO3)IdceA(2-OSO3)-aManRIdceA(2-OSO3)-aManR(6-OSO3)% of O-sulfated disaccharides 120M0.63.32.486.77.0 221M0.82.41.188.27.5 322M1.02.61.586.48.5 431M1.84.61.483.38.9 531M1.63.71.782.610.5 637M1.13.82.083.010.1 743M1.04.41.881.411.5 847M1.34.12.678.114.0 950M1.43.62.082.910.01070F0.86.41.874.016.91175M2.04.23.278.712.01276F0.73.81.881.911.91380M0.63.82.280.512.91481F1.24.22.578.313.81584M1.85.54.074.314.4Samples of HS were treated with HNO2 at pH 1.5, resulting in deaminative cleavage at GlcNSO3 residues.

Open table in a new tab Samples of HS were treated with HNO2 at pH 1.5, resulting in deaminative cleavage at GlcNSO3 residues. The cleavage products were radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4. Disaccharides were recovered by gel chromatography and analyzed by anion exchange HPLC as described. We further determined the degree of N-sulfate substitution of GlcN residues from the pattern of HS depolymerization following cleavage with HNO2 (at pH 1.5; see “Materials and Methods”). Five of the HS samples (subject aged 20, 21, 74, 76, and 80 years) were analyzed (Fig. 3) and found to contain essentially similar proportions of GlcNSO3units (means ± S.D., 39 ± 2% of total GlcN units). Finally, we assessed the degree of sulfation of the sequences comprised of alternating N-sulfated and N-acetylated disaccharide units. These domains typically harbor GlcN 6-O-sulfate groups but few or no IdceA 2-O-sulfate groups (4Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and are recovered as tetrasaccharides after cleavage of HS with HNO2 at pH 1.5. Analysis of tetrasaccharides from four HS samples (subject aged 20, 30, 50, and 80 years) indicated essentially similar proportions of nonsulfated, monosulfated, and disulfated species (76 ± 3, 20 ± 3, and 4 ± 1% of all tetrasaccharides, respectively, expressed as means ± S.D.). The increase in 6-O-sulfate substitution of GlcN units in the old individuals thus is essentially confined to the contiguous N-sulfated domains of HS. The major alteration in human aorta HS in association with aging is increased 6-O-sulfation of GlcNSO3 residues. The 6-O-sulfate groups were largely incorporated into GlcNSO3 units linked at C-4 to IdceA(2-OSO3) residues, leading to increased formation of the trisulfated IdceA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) disaccharide units. These results are in good agreement with the protein binding properties of the polysaccharide because IdceA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) units have been implicated in the binding of HS to PDGF-AAL. By contrast, the expression of FGF-2-binding HS domains was not affected by aging, as might be expected because regardless of the subject age the HS species were rich in IdceA(2-OSO3) residues and had proportions similar to those of N-sulfate groups. The present study demonstrates that human aging is accompanied by specific alterations in the fine structure of HS in the aortic wall. The increased degree of 6-O-sulfate substitution of GlcNSO3 residues in old subjects is reflected by an elevated proportion of trisulfated, “heparin-type” IdceA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) disaccharide units and enhanced binding of the HS to PDGFs. Such progressive, age-dependent structural alteration represents a previously unrecognized type of functional modulation of a mammalian macromolecule. Unlike rapid and reversible modifications such as phosphorylation, the alterations in sulfation described here occur during an extended time span of several decades. The remarkable structural and functional similarities of HS specimens from different age-matched subjects suggest a strictly controlled process of HS assembly. Our findings point to 6-O-sulfation of GlcNSO3units as a key regulator of the biological properties of HS in the human aortic wall. The 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation reactions appear to be separately regulated during HS biosynthesis, because the former sulfation type is largely confined to the contiguousN-sulfated sequences, whereas the latter modification occurs within as well as outside these domains (4Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the enhanced 6-O-sulfation appeared to selectively involve the contiguousN-sulfated domains, because the sulfation of alternating domains (recovered as tetrasaccharides after cleavage of HS with HNO2 at pH 1.5) was essentially similar in HS from young and old subjects. This finding suggests the involvement of two (or more) HS GlcN 6-O-sulfotransferase species that differ in substrate specificity and mode of regulation. Unfortunately, our knowledge regarding the regulatory mechanisms in HS biosynthesis is still fragmentary (3Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Could the abundance of a given sulfate group simply reflect the expression level for a corresponding sulfotransferase? Atherosclerotic lesions are frequently encountered in human aorta, and HS-binding growth factors such as FGFs and PDGFs are thought to contribute to the pathological smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation characterizing the disease (16Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar). The expression level of the PDGF-AL chain is high in human arterial smooth muscle cells and increases markedly during the conversion of monocytes into macrophages (32Krettek A. Fager G. Lindmark H. Simonson C. Lustig F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2897-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PDGF isoforms containing the AL or B chains are retained at cell surfaces or in the extracellular matrix by HS (20Raines E.W. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Östman A. Andersson M. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the arterial wall, increased binding of PDGF to HS could thus result in extracellular accumulation of PDGF. Such early changes might facilitate later pathophysiological processes such as aberrant smooth muscle cell migration and growth in individuals prone to develop atherosclerotic disease. Moreover, we note that the trisulfated IdceA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) disaccharide units found to promote binding of PDGF to HS has also been implicated in binding of lipoprotein lipase (6Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a cell surface-bound enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of triglycerides and affects the cellular uptake of lipids (17Berryman D. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24525-24531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The observed change in HS structure thus is likely to have more widespread functional implications than those emphasized in this study. We thank Drs. F. Lustig and G. Fager (Wallenberg Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research, Gothenburg, Sweden) for generous gifts of recombinant PDGFs and T. Lehtipalo, U. Elinder, and T.

The current studies, designed to determine the mechanism for the differential intracellular accumulation or retention of apoE, demonstrate that apoE3- and apoE4-containing β-very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL) possess similar cell binding and internalization and delivery of cholesterol to the cells. However, as assessed by immunocytochemistry, analysis of extracted cellular proteins, or quantitation of 125I-apoE-enriched β-VLDL, there was a 2–3-fold greater accumulation of apoE3 than apoE4 in Neuro-2a cells, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes (HepG2) after 1–2 h, and this differential was maintained for up to 48 h. ApoE2 also accumulated in Neuro-2a cells to a greater extent than apoE4. The differential effect was mediated by the apoE-enriched β-VLDL and not by free apoE. Neither the low density lipoprotein receptor nor the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein was responsible for the differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4, since cells deficient in either or both of these receptors also displayed the differential accumulation. The effect appears to be mediated primarily by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The retention of both apoE3 and apoE4 was markedly reduced, and the differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4 was eliminated both in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells that did not express HSPG and in HSPG-expressing cells treated with heparinase. The data suggest that cell surface HSPG directly mediate the uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins, that the differential accumulation/retention of apoE by cells is mediated via HSPG, and that there is a differential intracellular handling of the specific apoE isoforms.

Subjects with apoE4 have higher plasma cholesterol levels and are more prone to developing atherosclerosis than subjects with apoE3, the most common form of apoE. The apoE4 allele is also associated with a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, whereas the apoE3 and apoE2 alleles may be protective (13Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J.

In initial attempts to understand how apoE4 contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease, we examined the effect of apoE with lipoproteins on the outgrowth of neurites from neurons in culture. We found that both rabbit dorsal root ganglion neurons (18Handelmann G.E. Boyles J.K. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J.

Similar results were obtained with Neuro-2a cells stably transfected to secrete either apoE3 or apoE4 (21Bellosta S. Nathan B.P. Orth M. Dong L.-M. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27063-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). When the cells were incubated with cerebrospinal fluid lipoproteins or with a plasma lipoprotein, β-VLDL, the cells expressing apoE3 had long neurite extensions, whereas in the cells expressing apoE4 neurite extension was suppressed (21Bellosta S.

Various studies have demonstrated a role for the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)·LRP pathway in the differential effects of the apoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth. In this pathway, cell surface HSPG first sequester apoE-enriched lipoproteins before their internalization via the HSPG·LRP complex (22Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. He D. Ann. N. Y.

Treatment of the cells with chlorate, heparinase, lactoferrin, or the receptor-associated protein, all of which block the HSPG·LRP pathway, eliminates the differential effects of the apoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth (21Bellosta S.

Furthermore, the LRP appears to be essential for the apoE3-mediated stimulation of nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in a central nervous system-derived neuronal cell line (26Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In nonneuronal cells, apoE3 and apoE4 show an equivalent ability to enhance binding and stimulate uptake of β-VLDL by the LRP pathway (27Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas apoE2 is ~50–90% as active (23Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13421-13428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Neuro-2a cells, we found that incubation with apoE3 or apoE4-enriched β-VLDL also led to a similar increase in cellular cholesterol content, suggesting that apoE3 and apoE4 stimulated the uptake of lipoprotein particles to a similar extent (20Nathan B.P.

By contrast, when the cellular content of apoE was examined by immunochemistry and confocal microscopy, a differential cellular accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4 was observed (20Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19791-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation with apoE3- or apoE4-enriched β-VLDL, Neuro-2a cells accumulated and retained more apoE3 than apoE4 (20Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19791-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The accumulation of apoE3 by the cells was associated with enhanced neurite outgrowth and microtubule stability, whereas the lesser accumulation of apoE4 was associated with an inhibition of neurite outgrowth and disruption of the cellular microtubule network (12Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 20Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol.

The current studies were performed to identify the mechanism by which the cells internalize and retain apoE and to determine if the differential accumulation of apoE in cells is specific for neurons. Our results demonstrate that there is a differential accumulation or retention of intact apoE3 and apoE4 by neurons, fibroblasts, and hepatocytes with a greater accumulation of apoE3 than apoE4. Using cells deficient in the LDL receptor, the LRP, or the expression of cell surface HSPG, we demonstrate that the differential accumulation is mediated, at least in part, by cell surface HSPG. These studies describe a new mechanism for the internalization and accumulation of apoE within cells and suggest that the HSPG pathway may process (bind, internalize, and/or sequester) the apoE isoforms differently. Heparinase I and specific phospholipase C were purchased from Sigma. Suramin was obtained from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Purified human plasma apoE and sheep anti-human apoE antibody were provided by Dr. Karl Weisgraber (Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco, CA). Donkey anti-sheep IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Rabbit β-VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) were isolated from the plasma of New Zealand White rabbits fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet for 4 days (29Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Esser V. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5810-5814Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The ratio of cholesterol to protein in this β-VLDL ranged from ~15:1 to 20:1. Human apoE-enriched β-VLDL were prepared by incubating apoE with β-VLDL at 37 °C for 1 h. For some experiments, the apoE-enriched β-VLDL were reisolated by fast performance liquid chromatography as follows. Either125I-β-VLDL and unlabeled apoE or 125I-apoE and unlabeled β-VLDL were mixed in a 1:1.5 ratio of β-VLDL protein to apoE and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture (250 μl) was then fractionated by chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden; 10/50 HR). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The elution profile was monitored by quantitation of 125I and cholesterol. The β-VLDL were iodinated by the method of Bilheimer et al. (30Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins E3 and E4 were iodinated by the Bolton-Hunter procedure (31Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Free iodine was removed by P10 column chromatography. The β-VLDL were labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI), as described previously (32Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murine neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells were grown to ~100% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), washed with N2 medium, and incubated in N2 medium with β-VLDL (40 μg of cholesterol/ml) alone or together with 30 μg/ml of iodinated apoE3 or iodinated apoE4. At the times indicated, the surface-bound apoE was removed by incubation with 10 mm suramin for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C and gently scraped with a rubber policeman. The cells were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer, and the cell proteins were separated by 3–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; apoE was detected by autoradiography. Neuro-2a cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% FBS; this medium was replaced with serum-free medium ~16 h before use. Human skin fibroblasts were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Human hepatoma (HepG2) cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS, 1% human nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate as described (25Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cellspgsA-745 (xylose transferase-deficient), which do not produce any glycosaminoglycans, and pgsD-677 (N-acetylglucosamine transferase-deficient and glucuronic acid transferase-deficient), which do not produce heparan sulfate (33Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Esko (University of Alabama, Birmingham). The CHO cells were maintained in F-12 medium containing 7.5% FBS. Mouse fibroblasts that are LRP-negative (LRP−/−), LRP-heterozygous (LRP+/−), and LDL receptor- and LRP-negative (LDLR−/−, LRP−/−), provided by Dr. J. Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, TX) (34Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cholesterol content of the β-VLDL or cultured cells was assayed as described previously (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Neuro-2a cells or fibroblasts grown in tissue culture dishes were washed with serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C with apoE3 (30 μg/ml) or apoE4 (30 μg/ml) plus β-VLDL (40 μg of cholesterol/ml) for the time indicated. After incubation, the cells were placed immediately on ice and washed with phosphate buffer. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for immunofluorescence cytochemistry. Immunofluorescence from apoE was detected as described previously (20Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19791-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The intensity of apoE immunofluorescence was quantitated by confocal microscopy. Cultured cells were grown to ~100% confluence, washed twice with fresh serum-free medium, and incubated at 37 °C with apoE-enriched β-VLDL. Before the addition to the cells, the β-VLDL and apoE were incubated together (5 and 7.5 μg of protein, respectively, unless otherwise indicated) for 1 h at 37 °C. Some cells were incubated with 50 μm chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal protease (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), at 37 °C for 2 h before the addition of the apoE-enriched β-VLDL. At the times indicated, the cells were placed on ice, and the medium was assayed for protein degradation products (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). For the cell association studies, Neuro-2a cells were washed five times on ice with 0.1 m PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and once with 0.1 mPBS. Cell-associated ligand represents both bound and internalized material. The fibroblasts were washed three times with DMEM-Hepes on ice and incubated with 10 mm suramin at 4 °C for 30 min to remove surface-bound ligand (36Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X.-X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The radioactivity remaining within the cells represents that which was “internalized.” After washing, the cells were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH for measurement of radioactivity and protein concentration (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization of 125I-apoE-enriched β-VLDL by fibroblasts and by Neuro-2a cells was also studied at 18 °C. The cells were placed in an 18 °C incubator for 20 min before the addition of the lipoproteins and then incubated for an additional 3 h at 18 °C. After incubation, the cells were placed on ice, washed three times with DMEM-Hepes, and incubated with 10 mm suramin at 4 °C for 30 min to remove cell surface-bound 125I-apoE. Degradation products of125I-β-VLDL or 125I-apoE in the medium were assayed as described previously (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Neuro-2a cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with DiI-labeled β-VLDL alone or together with either apoE3 or apoE4. The cells were then washed and solubilized with 0.1 n NaOH, and the cell-associated DiI, which is proportional to the total amount of lipoprotein metabolized (bound, internalized, and degraded), was assayed (38Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 2-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were pretreated at 37 °C with heparinase I (10 units/ml) for 2 h or with specific phospholipase C (5 units/ml) for 30 min. The cells were then incubated in the presence of the enzymes with β-VLDL together with either apoE3 or apoE4. A second addition of phospholipase C (5 units/ml) was made 1 h after the addition of the lipoproteins. The β-VLDL (5 μg protein/ml) and apoE (7.5 μg/ml) were mixed and incubated together for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition to the cells. Cultured cells were grown to ~100% confluence, placed on ice, and washed twice with cold DMEM-Hepes. The cells were then incubated with 125I-apoE plus β-VLDL at 4 °C for 1 h to allow for cell surface binding (zero time-bound ligand). Cells were rinsed three times with cold F-12 medium to remove unbound ligands. Prewarmed F-12 medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. At each time point, the cells were again placed on ice, and the culture medium was collected. To 0.5 ml of medium was added 0.4 ml of 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.4 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The medium was then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected for125I-apoE degradation assay (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), and the pellet was counted as trichloroacetic acid-precipitable intact125I-apoE. The cells were washed once with cold DMEM-Hepes, incubated with 10 mm suramin on ice in a cold room for 30 min, and then dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH. Cellular radioactivity (internalized apoE) was measured with a γ-counter, and protein concentration was determined by Lowry's method (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies with cultured fibroblasts have shown that apoE3 and apoE4 mediate the binding and uptake of lipoproteins by LDL receptors to a similar extent (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar) and that the binding and uptake of β-VLDL enriched in apoE3 or apoE4 were greatly enhanced via the HSPG·LRP pathway (22Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. He D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the metabolism of apoE-enriched β-VLDL by cultured neurons (Neuro-2a cells) was examined in three ways: by measuring the cell association (binding and internalization) of apoE-enriched 125I-β-VLDL, by examining the metabolism of apoE-enriched DiI-labeled β-VLDL (DiI serving as a fluorescent marker for the lipid moieties of the lipoprotein particle), and by quantitating the ability of the apoE-enriched β-VLDL to increase the content of cellular cholesterol. The cell association of 125I-β-VLDL or125I-β-VLDL enriched with either human apoE3 or apoE4 by Neuro-2a cells was examined at 37 °C (Fig.1 A). In these studies, the maximal cell association of β-VLDL alone was ~225 ng/mg of cell protein. The cell association of β-VLDL was enhanced ~1.7-fold by apoE3 or apoE4. There was therefore no major isoform-specific difference in the ability of apoE3 or apoE4 to promote the binding and internalization of 125I-β-VLDL, suggesting that a similar amount of β-VLDL was internalized. In addition, DiI-labeled β-VLDL were used to examine the uptake of the β-VLDL particles by Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 1 B). DiI internalized with lipoproteins is retained by cells and can be used to quantitate the total amount of lipoprotein metabolized (bound, internalized, and degraded) (38Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 2-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Converse C.A. Skinner E.R. Lipoprotein Analysis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 215-242Google Scholar). In these studies, at 2 h both apoE3 and apoE4 stimulated the uptake of DiI-labeled β-VLDL (~1.8–2-fold) compared with the amount of DiI-labeled β-VLDL internalized in the absence of apoE (apoE4 stimulated β-VLDL uptake to a slightly greater extent than apoE3 (p < 0.02)). To establish further that apoE3 and apoE4 stimulated similar β-VLDL particle uptake, the cells were incubated in medium alone, medium containing β-VLDL, or medium containing β-VLDL and either apoE3 or apoE4, and the cholesterol content of the cells was determined (Fig.2). The β-VLDL alone increased the cellular cholesterol content ~4.7-fold, compared with the control cells maintained in the absence of lipoprotein. The β-VLDL enriched with either apoE3 or apoE4 increased the cellular cholesterol content ~(1.5- and ~1.7-fold, respectively; the cholesterol content with apoE4 was significantly greater (p < 0.005)) compared with the cells incubated with β-VLDL alone. Free apoE3 or apoE4 added without lipid had essentially no effect on the cellular cholesterol level (data not shown). Taken together, the results examining the effect of apoE3 and apoE4 on the uptake of 125I-β-VLDL or DiI-labeled β-VLDL and the ability of the cells to accumulate β-VLDL-derived cholesterol demonstrate that apoE3 and apoE4 stimulate β-VLDL internalization to a similar extent in Neuro-2a cells, with apoE4 being somewhat more active. These results are consistent with those previously reported in fibroblasts (25Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kowal R.C. Herz J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in lipoprotein particle uptake could not therefore account for the difference in the accumulation of apoE3 versus apoE4 (apoE3 greater than apoE4) in Neuro-2a cells incubated with apoE-enriched β-VLDL (20Nathan B.P. Chang K.-C. Bellosta S. Brisch E. Ge N. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19791-19799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The time course for differential accumulation of apoE3 and apoE4 was analyzed in the Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 3). The cells were incubated with apoE-enriched β-VLDL for 2–48 h, permeabilized, and processed for immunocytochemistry with a polyclonal antibody that detects purified human apoE3 and E4 equally well on Western blots (data not shown). Immunoreactive apoE was detected and quantitated by confocal microscopy to measure the relative fluorescence intensity. At the earliest time point (2 h), the cells contained approximately 1.8-fold more apoE3 than apoE4. This difference in the level of immunoreactive apoE was maintained for up to 48 h (~1.6-fold more apoE3 than apoE4) (Fig. 3). The a"

We purified this enzyme over 61,000-fold to near homogeneity with a 29.7% yield from rat brain membrane fractions. The isolation procedure included solubilization with Triton X-100, affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and UDP-hexanolamine-agarose, and hydroxylapatite column chromatography, followed by ion exchange chromatography. The final preparation migrated as a broad band with an apparent molecular mass of 61 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This apparent molecular mass was reduced to 51 kDa by N-glycanase digestion, suggesting that the enzyme has a glycoprotein nature. The enzyme required Mn2+ for its activity, and glucosylceramide was its preferred substrate. The cDNA for the enzyme was cloned from a rat brain cDNA library. The cDNA insert encoded a polypeptide of 382 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 44,776. The polypeptide contained eight putative glycosylation sites and a 20-amino acid residue transmembrane domain at its N terminus. Amino acid sequence homology analysis revealed that this enzyme shared 39% homology with mouse β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38), which catalyzes the transfer of Gal to β-1,4-GlcNAc in glycoproteins.

This apparent molecular mass was reduced to 51 kDa by N-glycanase digestion, suggesting that the enzyme has a glycoprotein nature. The enzyme required Mn2+ for its activity, and glucosylceramide was its preferred substrate. The cDNA for the enzyme was cloned from a rat brain cDNA library. The cDNA insert encoded a polypeptide of 382 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 44,776. The polypeptide contained eight putative glycosylation sites and a 20-amino acid residue transmembrane domain at its N terminus. Amino acid sequence homology analysis revealed that this enzyme shared 39% homology with mouse β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38), which catalyzes the transfer of Gal to β-1,4-GlcNAc in glycoproteins.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar). GSLs are synthesized by the sequential addition of sugar residues to ceramide by glycosyltransferases, which are specific to each glycosidic linkage. Glucosylceramide is a product of the first glycosylation step in GSL biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by glucosylceramide synthase (UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.80)). The purification (2Paul P. Kamisaka Y. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and cDNA cloning (3Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) of this enzyme has recently been reported. Lactosylceramide (LacCer), synthesized after glucosylceramide, is a precursor for the synthesis of four different major classes of GSLs: the ganglio series, the lacto and neolacto series, the globo series, and sulfated GSLs. The enzyme synthesizing LacCer is therefore a key enzyme, in addition to glucosylceramide synthase, for the synthesis of these GSL families. Lactosylceramide synthase (UDP-galactose:glucosylceramide β-1,4-galactosyltransferase) transfers galactose from UDP-Gal to glucosylceramide (GlcCer), generating a β-1,4-glycosidic linkage. Several groups have detected the activity of this enzyme in embryonic chicken brain (4Base M. De T. Das K.K. Kyle J.W. Chon H.-C. Schaeper R.J. Basu S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 575-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), rat liver (5Trinchera M. Fiorilli A. Ghidoni R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2719-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), rat bone marrow cells (6Taki T. Kamada R. Matsumoto M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1982; 91: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and human proximal tubular cells (7Chatterjee S. Castiglione E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). β-1,4-Galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.22), which generates an identical glycosidic linkage when GlcNAc is associated with glycoproteins, has also been reported to be able to catalyze LacCer synthesis (8Yamato K. Yoshida A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1982; 92: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Nakazawa et al. (9Nakazawa K. Fukuhara K. Natimatsu H. Kobata H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 113: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that recombinant glycopeptide β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β-1,4-GalT) had little activity toward GlcCer, indicating that LacCer synthase and glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT are different enzymes. In order to draw a clear conclusion on this point, it is essential to purify LacCer synthase and to clone LacCer synthase cDNA. Chatterjee et al. (10Chatterjee S. Ghosh N. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7148-7153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a purification of LacCer synthase from human kidney. However, its relation to other galactosyltransferases and its cDNA structure have not been revealed yet. Here, we report the purification of LacCer synthase from rat brain and its cDNA cloning. We found that purified LacCer synthase preferred GlcCer as a substrate and exhibited low activity toward a glycoprotein. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that LacCer synthase was different from glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT, although there was some homology between the C-terminal domains of both enzymes. UDP-galactose, CDP-choline, ceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, globoside, GM2, GA2, ovalbumin, Triton X-100, UDP-hexanolamine-agarose, sodium cacodylate, and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine were purchased from Sigma. WGA-agarose was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan), and hydroxylapatite was from Seikagaku-kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). DTT and Pefabloc SC were purchased from Merck. UDP-[14C]galactose (10.5 GBq/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP, and the Rediprime DNA labeling system were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The PD-10 and Mini Q columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rat brains (dissected from 2–3-week-old male and female Wistar rats) were obtained from Oriental Bio Service Kanto (Tsukuba, Japan). RecombinantN-glycanase (EC 3.5.1.52) was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Rat brain Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA and rat multiple tissue Northern blot were from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). SuperScriptTM Rat Brain cDNA Library was from Life Technologies, Inc. The other chemicals used were of analytical grade. LacCer synthase activity was determined as described previously (5Trinchera M. Fiorilli A. Ghidoni R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2719-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. The standard 0.1-ml incubation mixture contained 20 μmol of sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 1.0 μmol of MnCl2, 0.75 μmol of CDP-choline, 0.4 mg of Triton X-100, 1.9 μmol of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, 27 nmol of GlcCer, and 2.1 nmol (23 kBq) of UDP-[U-14C]galactose. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of methanol to the reaction mixture, and the products were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (12Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42861) Google Scholar). The lower phase was washed with the theoretical upper phase, and dried with a N2 gas stream. The radioactivity in the extracted lipid was counted using TopCount (Packard Instrument, Meriden, CT). Galactosylceramide synthase activity was determined using the same method as for the LacCer synthase assay. The activity of the enzyme toward other GSLs was also determined by the same method, except that extraction of the product was carried out using Sep-Pak18 (13Nagai Y. Yamashiro S. Yodoi J. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12082-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT activity toward glycopeptide was determined as described previously (14Uemura M. Winant R.C. Sikic B.I. Brandt A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5325-5334PubMed Google Scholar) with a minor modification. The standard 0.1-ml incubation mixture contained 2.0 μmol of HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.0 μmol of MnCl2, 0.75 μmol of CDP-choline, 0.01 mg of Triton X-100, 1.9 μmol of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, 20 μg of ovalbumin, and 2.1 nmol (23 kBq) of UDP-[U-14C]galactose. Ovalbumin is a convenient substrate because it contains asparagine-linked oligosaccharides with terminal nonreducing GlcNAc residues (15Chechik B.E. Fong M. Narasimhan S. Schachter H. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 16Kadowaki S. Yamamoto K. Fujisaki M. Tochikura T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 110: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by cooling to 0 °C. Aliquots were removed, spotted on 1-inch squares of Whatman 3-MM paper and immediately placed in 10% trichloroacetic acid at room temperature. The assay papers were washed three times with 10% trichloroacetic acid (10 min each wash), the excess trichloroacetic acid was removed by washing with 95% ethanol (10 min), and the papers were air-dried. The amount of acid-precipitated [14C]galactose was quantified using liquid scintillation counter. All purification steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Rat brains, which had been stored frozen at −80 °C were thawed, minced with scissors, and homogenized with nine volumes of the homogenizing solution (0.32 m sucrose, 0.25 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a mechanically driven Teflon pestle at 1200 rpm. The membrane fraction was prepared by successive centrifugation of the homogenate. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate at 800 ×g for 10 min was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. The precipitate from this second centrifugation, designated the brain membrane fraction, was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% NaN3, and 150 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer S), and stored at −135 °C. Since the enzyme activity of the membrane fraction obtained from the second centrifugation was greater, in terms of both total and specific activity, than that obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the former was used as the membrane fraction. The brain membrane fraction was suspended in buffer S, and the detergent Triton X-100 was added to 1.0%. The protein concentration of this mixture was adjusted to 4 mg/ml. The enzyme was extracted at 0 °C for 2 h without stirring. The mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant, designated the solubilized enzyme, was used for purification. A WGA-agarose column (5.2 mg of WGA/ml of gel, 50 × 76 mm) was equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% NaN3 and 100 μm Pefabloc (buffer B). The NaCl concentration of the solubilized enzyme was adjusted to 0.5m by adding 110 volume of 10 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% NaN3, and 100 μm Pefabloc SC. The sample was then loaded onto the column and washed with buffer B. The protein adsorbed to the column was then eluted with the same solution containing 200 mm GlcNAc (buffer C). The column was operated at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The active fractions from the WGA-agarose column were supplemented with MnCl2 to achieve a final concentration of 10 mm, and the resulting sample was loaded to a column (32 × 50 mm) of UDP-hexanolamine-agarose (4.7 μmol/ml gel) previously equilibrated with 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, and 100 μm Pefabloc SC (buffer D). The column was washed with the same buffer, and the adsorbed protein was eluted with buffer D containing 1 mmUDP (buffer E). The column was operated at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The active fractions from step 2 were subjected to gel filtration on a PD-10 column to substitute the buffer for 10 mm phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm DTT, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 μm Pefabloc SC (buffer F), thereby enabling the next chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column. The enzyme solution obtained was applied to a small column (0.5 ml) of hydroxylapatite equilibrated with buffer F. The column was washed with the same buffer. The adsorbed fraction was eluted by increasing the phosphate concentration of the buffer F to 600 mm. The flow-through fraction was loaded directly onto a Mini Q column equilibrated with buffer F. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the adsorbed fraction was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–2.0m NaCl in buffer F. The Smart system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to operate the column. The active fractions from the Mini Q column (fractions 7–13) were collected, concentrated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained bands of 61 kDa were excised and treated with 0.3 μg of Achromobacter protease I (a gift from Dr. Masaki, Ibaraki University (17Masaki T. Seo M. Dohmae N. Takio K. Kamiyama Y. Koshiba T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)) at 37 °C for 17 h in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 0.1% SDS and 2 mm EDTA. The peptides thus generated were extracted from the gel and separated on columns of DEAE-5PW (2 × 20 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and Mightysil RP-18 (2 × 50 mm; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) connected in series with a model 1090M (Hewlett Packard) liquid chromatography system. The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–60% solvent B, where solvents A and B were 0.09% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile, respectively. Selected peptides were subjected to Edman degradation on a model 477A automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) connected on-line to a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Perkin-Elmer) using an in house-generated gas phase program and to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry on a Reflex MALD-TOF (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear mode, using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. The degenerated oligonucleotides GGNYTNACNGTNGAACAAT and TTNARNCCRTCDATGAACTG were synthesized, based on the peptide sequences GLTVEQF and QFIDGLN, respectively. PCR amplification was performed on the Marathon-ReadyTM rat brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the pCR2.1 vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and their DNA sequences were determined. 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Screening of the cDNA library was performed using GeneTrapperTM cDNA Positive Selection System (Life Technologies) with the SuperScriptTM rat brain cDNA library (Life Technologies). The probes were biotinylated in accordance with the supplier's instructions. Plasmid cDNA was digested with GeneII followed by ExoIII. The resulting single-stranded DNA was hybridized with a biotinylated probe, and hybrids were selected with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. The selected single-stranded DNA was repaired and transfected intoE. coli. Positive clones were detected by PCR amplification. Probes for hybridization and PCR primers for the detection of positive clones were synthesized on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the PCR fragment described above or the cDNA sequence obtained using the GeneTrapperTM cDNA Positive Selection System. The sequences of these oligonucleotide probes were as follows. The probes for hybridization were TCTATTCCCCATCACCATCG and TACAAGCTAGAGGCATCATG; the primers for PCR were TTGTGTGAAATGAAGGGACTG, GAGGCACAAGATCCCTGACAC, AGCTAGAGGCATCATGCTGAGAG, and AGTTCTGCGGAAGATACGTTGTTG. The DNA sequence was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method on an ALFexpress DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). M13 universal and reverse primers and synthetic oligonucleotides were used as sequencing primers. Rat multiple tissue northern blot (CLONTECH) was used for rat mRNA analysis. A 796-bp segment of lactosylceramide synthase cDNA (nucleotide positions 145–940, Fig.3 B) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using theRediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed in 6× SSC, 1.0% SDS at 65 °C for 17 h, and final washes were performed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. cDNA encoding the coding and noncoding regions of LacCer synthase (nucleotide positions −50 to 1593, Fig. 3 B) was inserted into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies). The plasmid thus obtained was designated LacCer synthase pFASTBAC1. A recombinant virus was prepared using the BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression system (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells (6 × 105 cells/ml) were mixed with recombinant or wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (multiplicity of infection = 10) and incubated for 72 h at 27 °C. The cells were harvested, and LacCer synthase activity was determined as described above. The protein concentration was determined as described by Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar), using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). N-Glycanase digestion was performed according to protocols provided by Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). LacCer synthase was purified by the sequential application of two types of affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. The typical elution profile of activity from the Mini Q column and the SDS-PAGE pattern of the fractions are shown in Fig.1. LacCer synthase activity was eluted with 250 mm NaCl as a single peak (Fig. 1 A), and the intensity of the broad band appearing at 61 kDa correlated well with the activity, suggesting that the protein band at 61 kDa corresponds to LacCer synthase. Table Ishows a summary of the purification of LacCer synthase. LacCer synthase was successfully purified 62,000-fold from the rat brain membrane fraction extract to apparent homogeneity, with a 29.7% yield. LacCer synthase appeared to be a glycoprotein because it was adsorbed onto WGA-agarose during the purification step. To confirm the glycoprotein nature of LacCer synthase, the fraction (fraction 9) obtained from the final step was subjected to N-glycanase digestion. AfterN-glycanase digestion, the molecular mass of the enzyme decreased to 51 kDa, indicating that it is a glycoprotein containing about 15% N-linked carbohydrate moieties (Fig.2).Table IPurification of rat brain LacCer synthaseTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmgpmol/minpmol/min/mg%-foldTriton X-100 extract365523650.6471001WGA-agarose7.18144520157.1311UDP-agaroseNDa66726.3HydroxylapatiteNDb121548.01-cThe increment in the yield is due to the increased specific activity repeatedly observed after the buffer change from Tris-HCl to phosphate.Mini Q0.018751-dThe amount of protein was determined by the density of the bands of gel electrophoresis stained by silver staining.75040,00029.761,818a,b ND, not detected.

Fig.3 A shows the effect of divalent metal cations. No enzyme activity was detected in the presence of EDTA. The enzyme was activated by Mn2+ and to a lesser extent by Mg2+ and Ca2+. Substrate specificity is shown in Fig. 3 B. GlcCer was the best substrate among the GLSs examined. We also investigated whether the enzyme transferred Gal to a glycoprotein, and found that it exhibited low activity toward ovalbumin, a model glycoprotein substrate (14Uemura M. Winant R.C. Sikic B.I. Brandt A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5325-5334PubMed Google Scholar). The apparentK m value of LacCer synthase was 80.6 μm for UDP-galactose and 23.7 μm for glucosylceramide (data not shown). The partial amino acid sequence of rat brain LacCer synthase was determined by digestion of the purified enzyme withAchromobacter protease I, a lysine-specific protease. The results are summarized in Table II. On the basis of these sequences, degenerate primers were synthesized and used for PCR with a rat brain cDNA library as a template. One set of primers yielded a 203-bp product containing a sequence corresponding to peptide 3 (Fig. 4 A). A cDNA clone that was extended 90 bp toward the 5′-end was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Fig. 4 A). This clone contained sequences corresponding to peptides 1, 3, and 4 and part of peptide 2. From these results, we concluded that these amplified products were generated from LacCer synthase cDNA. To obtain a clone containing full-length cDNA, a 20-bp primer was synthesized based on the sequence obtained and was used to screen a rat brain cDNA library. Using the GeneTrapper cDNA Positive Selection System (Life Technologies), a 1.6-kb cDNA (clone A1–84, Fig. 4 A) was obtained. This contained a sequence corresponding to 398 amino acid residues, which included all the amino acid sequences obtained during the partial amino acid sequence analysis. Since we had no information about the N-terminal amino acid sequence of LacCer synthase, it was not clear whether clone A1–84 contained the entire coding region. In order to isolate clones containing additional sequences to the 5′-end, the cDNA library was rescreened. As a result, we obtained a 5.7-kb cDNA (clone G4–35, Fig. 4 A). Fig. 4 B shows the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of LacCer synthase. There are three possible initiation codons, ATG (Met1, Met7 and Met8, Fig. 3 B). The nucleotide sequences surrounding the first and third ATGs agree with Kozak's rules (20Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Met1 is more likely to be the initiation codon for the following reasons: 1) more than 90% of eukaryotic mRNAs have their initiation site at the 5′-proximal ATG and 2) the sequence between the 5′-end and the presumed initiating ATG codon appears to be a termination codon, TGA, which is in frame with the downstream open reading frame (position −267) (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). The open reading frame containing this initiation codon predicted a protein of 382 amino acids with a molecular weight of 44,776 and eight possibleN-glycosylation sites. Hydropathy plot analysis revealed a considerable hydrophobic segment near the N terminus; this is the putative signal anchor sequence (Fig. 5). Analysis using the TMpred program (22Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) predicted that LacCer synthase would be a membrane-bound protein with one transmembrane helix composed of 20 amino acid residues (Leu15–Val34) at the N terminus, extending the N-terminal segment into the cytoplasmic surface.Table IIAmino acid sequence and mass values of API peptides of rat brain LacCer synthase.Peptide sequenceObserved mass (M + H+)Calculated mass (M + H+)1.XFFGGVXGLTVEQFXK1801.0(1802.0)2.

To confirm that the cDNA obtained during our experiments encoded LacCer synthase, a recombinant baculovirus was prepared and used to infect Sf9 insect cells. Fig. 6 shows that a homogenate of Sf9 cells infected with this recombinant baculovirus exhibited significant LacCer synthase activity, whereas a homogenate of Sf9 cells infected with wild-type virus did not. We searched the protein data base SWISS-PROT for similar sequences using the DNASIS (version 3.6) program. Mouse, bovine, and human glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT showed significant homology with LacCer synthase (Fig. 7). The enzyme purified in the present study showed 39% identity with mouse glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT, and higher identity was observed in the C-terminal domain. There was no significant homology with other GalTs, including galactosylceramide synthase (23Schulte A. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10265-10269Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and GD1b/GM1/GA1 synthase (24Miyazaki H. Fukumoto S. Okada M. Hasegawa T. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

No sequence identity was observed between rat LacCer synthase and the short sequence reported for rat glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT (25Bendiak B. Ward L.D. Simpson R.J. Eur. J.

Comparison of the locations of cysteines in the predicted amino acid sequences of LacCer synthase (6 cysteines) and glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT (7 cysteines) showed the conservation of 5 cysteines, including 2 cysteine residues (Cys108 and Cys223, marked with asterisks in Fig. 7) which are predicted to form a disulfide linkage in glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT (26Yadav S.P. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 698-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wang Y. Wong S.S. Fukuda M.N. Zu H. Liu Z. Tang Q. Appert H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The expression of LacCer synthase mRNA in rat tissues was analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig.8). A major band of 6.5 kb and a minor band of 2.7 kb were detected in poly(A) RNA from the lungs, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis, with the highest level in the brain and the lowest level in the liver and spleen. The high expression of LacCer synthase mRNA in the brain may explain the large amount of GSLs in the brain. In this study, we purified LacCer synthase from rat brain and obtained its cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of the LacCer synthase was different from that of glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT previously reported (28Shaper N.L. Hollis G.F. Douglas J.G. Kirsch I.R. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10420-10428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although there is a significant homology between these two enzymes especially in their C-terminal region (Fig.7). The highest sequence identity (68.3%) was found between amino acids Leu260–Arg300 of the LacCer synthase sequence (boxed in Fig. 7). Information on the active sites of glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT is gradually accumulating. Aoki et al. (29Aoki D. Appert H.E. Johnson D. Wong S.S. Fukuda M.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the peptide segment between Asp276 and Met328in human glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT (underlined in Fig. 7) may participate in UDP-Gal binding, using photoaffinity labeling. This region includes the area that showed the highest homology with LacCer synthase. They also identified the amino acid residues participating in UDP-Gal and GlcNAc binding in the C-terminal domain of human glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT by site-directed mutagenesis. They showed that Tyr284, Tyr309, and Trp310(marked with closed triangles in Fig. 7) were critically important for acceptor (GlcNAc) binding, and that Tyr309was involved in donor (UDP-Gal) binding (29Aoki D. Appert H.E. Johnson D. Wong S.S. Fukuda M.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the carbohydrate residue of the LacCer synthase acceptor is glucose, the amino acids corresponding to Tyr284 and Trp310 are well conserved. Tyr309, which is concerned with UDP-Gal binding, was substituted into Phe in LacCer synthase. Zu et al. (30Zu H. Hukuda M.N. Wong S.S. Wang Y. Liu Z. Tang Q. Appert H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that Phe305, Pro306, Asn307, and Asn308 (marked with open triangles in Fig. 7) of human glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT were involved in UDP-Gal binding. In LacCer synthase, three of these four amino acids, Phe305, Pro306, and Asn307, were conserved. These observations suggest that LacCer synthase has its catalytic site in the C-terminal domain, as is generally the case with other glycosyltransferases (31Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the region that shows high homology with glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT is involved in substrate binding. Bakker et al. (32Bakker H. Agterberg M. Van Tetering A. Koeleman C.A.M. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Die I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30326-30333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the cloning of UDP-GlcNAc:GlcNAc β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase from Lymnaea stagnalis. Although this enzyme was cloned by heterologous hybridization using the coding region of bovine glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT cDNA as a probe, it transferred GlcNAc rather than Gal to GlcNAc with a β-1,4-glycosidic linkage. This enzyme shows a significant homology with both glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT and LacCer synthase in the boxed area of the C-terminal domain (Fig.7). These three enzymes have a common property in that they catalyze the transfer of sugars with a β-1,4-glycosidic linkage from UDP-sugar. It might therefore be speculated that this region is concerned with the substrate binding site and/or formation of β-1,4-glycosidic linkages. A hexapeptide (RDKKNE, indicated by adotted line in Fig. 7) in the C-terminal domain of glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT has been suggested to be the UDP-Gal binding site from a comparison with α-1,3-GalT (33Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Tunen A.J. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14290-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no identical or similar peptide in the LacCer synthase amino acid sequence. In summary, we have purified LacCer synthase from rat brain, and cloned its cDNA for the first time. We have also shown that LacCer synthase is different from glycopeptide β-1,4-GalT. This information regarding the cDNA and amino acid sequence of LacCer synthase opens the door to creating knockout mice and LacCer synthase-deficient cells and to immunological studies. Since LacCer is a precursor for most GSLs, these would be useful tools for studying GSL functions. We thank Hatsue Kato for the preparation of rat brain membrane fraction."

The goal of the present study was to elucidate the potential sites of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) regulation affected by ANP and revealed the following. 1) ANP and dibutyryl-cGMP did not inhibit catalytic iNOS activity measured by the conversion rate ofl-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline in homogenates of LPS-treated cells. 2) Pretreatment of cells with ANP dose-dependently reduced the LPS-inducedl-[3H]citrulline production that has been shown to be due to reduced iNOS protein levels detected by Western blot. 3) ANP does not alter the ratio of catalytically active iNOS dimer versus inactive iNOS monomer considered to be a major post-translational regulatory mechanism for the enzyme. 4) Macrophages exposed to ANP display decreased LPS-induced iNOS mRNA levels. 5) Importantly, two basic mechanisms seem to be responsible for this observation, i.e. ANP specifically induced acceleration of iNOS mRNA decay and ANP reduced binding activity of NF-κB, the transcription factor predominantly responsible for LPS-induced iNOS expression in murine macrophages. Moreover, 6) ANP acts via an autocrine mechanism since recently ANP was shown to be secreted by LPS-activated macrophages, and we demonstrated here that LPS-induced NO synthesis was increased after blocking the binding of endogenous ANP by a receptor antagonist. These observations suggest ANP as a new autocrine macrophage factor regulating NO synthesis both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. ANP may help to balance NO production of activated macrophages and thus may allow successful immune response without adverse effects on host cells.

The main and best studied actions of ANP are geared toward the regulation of volume pressure homeostasis (for review see Refs. 1Rosenzweig A. Seidman C.E.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 229-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar and 2Maack T. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There are two biochemically and functionally distinct classes of natriuretic peptide receptors (NPR). Clearance receptors (NPR-C) are by far the most abundant class of NPR. Besides their well established role in removing ANP from the circulation, the NPR-C elicit biological functions by interacting with G-proteins (2Maack T. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Levin E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E483-E489PubMed Google Scholar). The guanylate cyclase-coupled receptors (NPR-A) are signaling receptors that mediate all known cardiovascular and renal effects of ANP via cGMP (2Maack T. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Kishimoto I. Dubois S.K. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6215-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The functions of the natriuretic peptides, however, are not restricted to the regulation of volume homeostasis as suggested earlier by demonstration of ANP and its receptors in diverse tissues besides the cardiovascular and renal system (5Gutkowska J. Nemer M. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 519-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). ANP was suggested to play a role in the immune system because thymus (6Vollmar A.M. Schulz R.

Invest. 1994; 94: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Kiemer A.K. Vollmar A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) are sites of synthesis of the natriuretic peptide and its receptors. In the course of functional investigations concerning ANP in the immune system, the peptide was found to inhibit maturation and differentiation of fetal thymus (11Vollmar A.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1997; 78: 90-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as well as proliferation of thymocytes of adult animals (8Vollmar A.M. Schmidt K.N. Schulz R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1706-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, ANP was shown to reduce nitrite accumulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophages (10Kiemer A.K. Vollmar A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the peptide might interfere with the synthesis of a mediator that plays an important role in inflammation and host defense response (12Bogdan C. Ro¨llinghoff M. Vodovotz Y. Xie Q. Nathan C. Masihi N. Immunotherapy of Infection. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 37-54Google Scholar). The enzyme nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), which catalyzes the synthesis of NO froml-arginine, exists in three different isoforms that differ in their tissue distribution, calcium dependence, and in the regulation of their expression (13Fo¨rstermann U. Kleinert H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 352: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 14Moncada S.R. Palmer M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-129PubMed Google Scholar). The two constitutive isoforms expressed in neurons (neuronal nitric-oxide synthase; NOS I) and endothelial cells (endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; NOS III) are calcium/calmodulin-dependent. They are mainly involved in neurotransmission and vascular regulation, respectively (15Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). A major function of NO derived from the inducible NO synthase (iNOS; NOS II) is target cell cytotoxicity. Target cells may include tumor cells as well as bacteria, viral particles, and other microorganisms (12Bogdan C. Ro¨llinghoff M. Vodovotz Y. Xie Q. Nathan C. Masihi N. Immunotherapy of Infection. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 37-54Google Scholar). However, NO produced by iNOS of macrophages (as well as other cells) also has the potential for adverse activities depending on its concentration and site of release. These include the induction of severe hypotension and cardiovascular shock and cytotoxicity toward host cells such as vascular cells, lymphocytes, or even macrophages themselves (12Bogdan C. Ro¨llinghoff M. Vodovotz Y. Xie Q. Nathan C. Masihi N. Immunotherapy of Infection. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 37-54Google Scholar). Therefore, a better understanding of the physiological regulation of iNOS is important. The major activator of iNOS in macrophages has been shown to be bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (12Bogdan C. Ro¨llinghoff M. Vodovotz Y. Xie Q. Nathan C. Masihi N. Immunotherapy of Infection. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 37-54Google Scholar, 16Stuehr D.J. Marletta M.A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5590-5594PubMed Google Scholar). Co-stimulatory effects were demonstrated for INF-γ and a variety of other cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-2, INF-α, and -β (12Bogdan C. Ro¨llinghoff M. Vodovotz Y. Xie Q. Nathan C. Masihi N. Immunotherapy of Infection. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 37-54Google Scholar). So far, little is known about what terminates the production of NO by macrophages. However, this is of particular importance regarding the severe pathophysiological effects of sustained NO production such as circulatory failure and tissue damage. Again cytokines, i.e.transforming growth factor-β, IL-4, and IL-10, have been described to suppress NO release of macrophages (12Bogdan C. Ro¨llinghoff M. Vodovotz Y. Xie Q. Nathan C. Masihi N. Immunotherapy of Infection. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 37-54Google Scholar, 17Bogdan C. Nathan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 685: 713-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms appeared to be different for the respective cytokines (12Bogdan C. Ro¨llinghoff M. Vodovotz Y. Xie Q. Nathan C. Masihi N. Immunotherapy of Infection. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 37-54Google Scholar, 17Bogdan C. Nathan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 685: 713-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 18Vodovotz Y. Bogdan C. Paik J. Xie Q. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The observation that ANP, a circulating hormone best known for its vasodilative effects, inhibits NO synthesis in activated macrophages is particularly interesting since ANP concentrations are highly elevated in septic shock (19Aiura K. Ueda M. Endo M. Kitajima M. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 23: 1898-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and moreover LPS-exposed macrophages were shown to produce increased ANP (9Vollmar A.M. Schulz R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, ANP may be a novel autocrine substance modulating NO production. Consecutively, aim of the present study was to clarify the basic mechanisms underlying the inhibition of NO synthesis by ANP. Mouse ANP 99-126 was purchased from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). HS-142-1 was a gift from Dr. Matsuda, Tokyo Research Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan. iNOS cDNA probe was provided by Dr. Kleinert, University of Mainz, Germany; COX-2 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Herschman, UCLA; TNF-α cDNA was obtained from Dr. Decker, University of Freiburg, Germany; IL-6 cDNA was provided by Dr. Kremer, GSF, Munich, Germany.

(Eggenstein, Germany). cGMP radioimmunoassay kit (cGMP 125I-assay system) and [3H]l-arginine (60 Ci/mmol), ECL detection system, and random primer labeling system (Rediprime®) were from Amersham (Braunschweig, Germany); Dowex 50 WX8 (Na+ form) was obtained from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dCTP (both 3000 Ci/mmol) were from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany); T3/T7 RNA polymerase transcription system was obtained from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany); dexamethasone solution was ordered from Centravet (Bad Bentheim, Germany); NF-κB and AP-2 binding oligonucleotides, SP6 polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts (Heidelberg, Germany); IRF-1 binding oligonucleotide was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Bradford protein assay was from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany). All other materials were purchased from either Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) or ICN Biomedicals (Eschwege, Germany). Mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMM) were prepared as described previously (9Vollmar A.M. Schulz R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well tissue plates and grown for 5 days (5% CO2, 37 °C) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% L-929 cell-conditioned medium, 10% heat-inactivated FCS, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). L-cell-conditioned medium was removed at least 12 h before experiments. BMM were found >95% pure as judged by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACscan, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using an antiserum against the macrophage antigen F4/80 (20Szu-Hee L. Starkey P.M. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Adult bovine aortic endothelial cells (ABAE, provided by Dr. Plendl, Munich) were cultivated in 24-well tissue plates in DMEM containing 10% FCS (21Obeso J. Weber J. Auerbach R. Lab. Invest. 1990; 63: 259-269PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent BMM or ABAE (24-well tissue plates) were washed three times and pretreated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mm) in serum-free RPMI 1640 for 10 min at 37 °C. Various stimuli were added for 30 min. Thereafter, medium was aspirated and cGMP was extracted immediately by the addition of HCl (0.1 n). After 10 min of incubation on ice the cell extracts were transferred to fresh tubes, lyophilized, and assayed for cGMP content by radioimmunoassay using a commercially available kit. BMM (24-well plates, 200 μl) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli, serotype 055:B5, 1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of ANP 99-126 and/or HS-142-1. After 20 h the stable metabolite of NO, nitrite, was measured in the medium by the Griess reaction (22Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). 100 μl of cell culture supernatant was removed, and 90 μl of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H3PO4 and 90 μl of 0.1%N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in H2O was added, followed by spectrophotometric measurement at 550 nm (reference wavelength 620 nm). BMM (24-well plates) were either untreated, stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) only, or co-incubated with ANP 10 nm–1 μm) for 12 h, washed three times with cold PBS, frozen immediately, and stored at −70 °C. iNOS activity was determined by measuring the conversion of [3H]l-arginine to [3H]l-citrulline according to Ref. 23Stevens-Truss R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15638-15645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing EDTA (0.1 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 1 mm) by freezing and thawing. Homogenates of equal protein concentration (Bradford method) (100 μl, 200 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of l-arginine (10 μm), NADPH (1 mm), l-valine (50 mm), FAD (4 μm), tetrahydrobiopterin (4 μm), and [3H]l-arginine (0.2 μCi; 0.033 μm). Reactions were stopped by adding ice-cold sodium acetate, pH 5.5 (20 mm, 1 ml), containing EDTA (2 mm) and l-citrulline (0.1 mm). [3H]l-Citrulline was separated by ion exchange columns (Dowex 50 WX8, Na+ form) and measured by scintillation counting. The effect of test substances on the specific enzyme activity was evaluated using homogenates of cells treated with LPS for 12 h. Substances were incubated with cell homogenate for 10 min and further processed as described above. Extent ofl-[3H]citrulline formation independent of iNOS activity was determined in each experiment by employing homogenates of cells not exposed to LPS. The results are expressed as percentage of iNOS-specific [3H]citrulline formation. BMM (24-well plates) were treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) or a combination of LPS (1 μg/ml) plus ANP (1 μm) with or without HS-142-1 (100 μg/ml) for 12 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and stored at −70 °C. Western blot analysis was performed according to Ref. 24Xie Q.W. Leung M. Fuortes M. Sassa S. Nathan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar except that the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.004% bromphenol blue) was supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete®). After sonication lysates were either boiled for 5 min (fully denaturing conditions) or not boiled (partially denaturing conditions) to discriminate between iNOS dimer and monomer (24Xie Q.W. Leung M. Fuortes M. Sassa S. Nathan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Samples (60 μg of protein) were loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) and electroblotted, and iNOS protein was detected using an anti-iNOS monoclonal antibody and the ECL detection system. Signal intensities were evaluated by densitometric analysis (Herolab, E.A.S.Y. plus system, Wiesloch, Germany). BMM were stimulated with or without LPS (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of ANP (1 μm) or dexamethasone (10 μm) for 6 h (24-well plates). RNA was prepared using TRIzolTM reagent and pooled from 6 wells. Northern blot was performed in principle as described previously (6Vollmar A.M. Schulz R. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2277-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Vollmar A.M. Schulz R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized to a32P-labeled murine macrophage iNOS cRNA probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml). iNOS cDNA (558 base pairs) was subcloned in a pBluescript SK(+) vector, linearized (HindIII), and labeled with [32P]UTP (50 μCi) using a T3 RNA polymerase transcription system. Signal intensity was evaluated by densitometric analysis. To control for comparable amounts of intact mRNA loaded on the gel, membranes were rehybridized with a32P-labeled β-actin probe (2 × 106cpm/ml) as described (6Vollmar A.M. Schulz R. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2277-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). BMM in 24-well plates were treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) or a combination of LPS (1 μg/ml) plus ANP 99-126 (1 μm) for 5 h before addition of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Total RNA was prepared at the times indicated and further processed for Northern blot hybridization as described above. In addition to hybridization with an iNOS cRNA probe, blots have been rehybridized with probes for TNF-α (25Estler H.C. Grewe M. Gaussling R. Pavlovic M. Decker K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), COX-2 (26Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and IL-6 (27Van-Snick J. Cayphas S. Szikora J.P. Renauld J.C. Van-Roost E. Boon T. Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), respectively. To normalize mRNA concentrations membranes were hybridized with a β-actin probe. The iNOS, β-actin, TNF-α, and COX-2 probes were radiolabeled by in vitrotranscription and the IL-6 DNA probe by random-primed cDNA synthesis. The signal intensities were analyzed densitometrically, and signal density for iNOS or the other mRNAs was divided by that of β-actin in order to correct the loading differences. mRNA decay was evaluated based on the assumption that change of mRNA concentration at any time is a first-order process depending on the amount of mRNA present at that time (28Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, the ratios of the signal intensities of the respective mRNA/β-actin mRNA at each time point were expressed as percentage of the time point 0,i.e. before addition of actinomycin D and plotted against time. BMM were grown in 24-well plates and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of ANP 99-126 (1 μm-10 nm) for 2 h. Dibutyryl-cGMP (1 mm) or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC, 50 μm) was added 1 h prior to LPS stimulation. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmPMSF), and were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. Nonidet P-40 (10%, 25 μl) was added followed by 10 s of vigorous vortexing and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was removed, and the nuclear pellet was extracted with 50 μl of hypertonic buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF) by shaking at 4 °C for 15 min. The extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was frozen at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two 22-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing a consensus binding sequence for either NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) or IRF-1 (5′-GGAAGCGAAAATGAAATTGACT-3′) were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]-ATP (10 μCi) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. 10 μg of nuclear protein were incubated (20 min at room temperature) in a 15-μl reaction volume containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 × 104 cpm radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm DTT. Nucleoprotein-oligonucleotide complexes were resolved by electrophoresis (4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, 100 V). The gel was autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at −70 °C overnight. Specificity of the DNA-protein complex was confirmed by competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled NF-κB and AP-2 (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′) binding sequences, respectively. Previous data that have been confirmed by a representative experiment shown in Fig.1 A demonstrated that ANP dose-dependently inhibits nitrite accumulation of LPS-activated BMM. The ANP-induced NO inhibition seems to be mediated by the guanylate cyclase-coupled NPR-A receptor, since HS-142-1, an NPR-A antagonist (31Matsuda Y. Morishita Y. Cardiovasc. Drug Rev. 1993; 11: 45-59Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), abrogated the ANP effect. In addition, expression of the mRNA coding for both of the ANP receptors (NPR-A and NPR-C) has been shown before in BMM (10Kiemer A.K. Vollmar A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The aim here was to clarify the actual presence of functional NPR-A protein in BMM. BMM were treated with ANP, and cGMP production was determined. Intracellular cGMP levels were significantly elevated in cells exposed to ANP (10 μm-10 nm) for 30 min compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). HS-142-1 (100 μg/ml) was able to antagonize this increase. To exclude that elevated cGMP levels were due to enzymatic activity of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) we incubated the cells with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which is able to release NO, a known activator of sGC (14Moncada S.R. Palmer M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-129PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). SNP (100 μg/ml) did not change intracellular cGMP levels in BMM (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, cGMP production of ABAE, known to express sGC (32Ganz P. Davies P.F. Leopold J.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Alexander R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3552-3556Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was dose-dependently elevated by the addition of SNP (10 and 100 μg/ml) under identical conditions. Thus, BMM release NO when activated but do not possess sGC as an important target system for NO action. Suppression of nitrite accumulation in BMM by ANP has to be discussed as the sum of potentially cumulative actions of ANP on the iNOS system and, for instance, does not allow us to assess effects of ANP on specific enzyme activity. Therefore, ANP (1 μm) was added to the homogenate of LPS (1 μg/ml)-stimulated cells, and iNOS enzyme activity was measured as conversion rate of [3H]l-arginine to [3H]l-citrulline (Fig.2 A). Incubation of cell homogenate with ANP did not result in a change of iNOS activity. The cGMP analog dibutyryl-cGMP (1 mm) had no effect either. The known specific inhibitor of NOS enzyme activityN G-monomethyl-l-arginine (3 mm) served as control and was able to inhibit specific iNOS enzyme activity up to 90%. By having excluded a direct effect of ANP on the enzyme activity, we next wanted to examine whether reduction of NO synthesis by ANP is due to factors such as decreased uptake ofl-arginine or availability of other necessary substrates and cofactors for iNOS. By using an indirect approach, measurement of enzyme activity was performed with cell homogenates of ANP-pretreated cells in the presence of optimal concentrations of substrates and cofactors (i.e. NADPH, l-arginine, BH4, FAD, and FMN). ANP pretreatment of cells dose-dependently (10 μm to 10 nm) reduced iNOS activity up to 70% (1 μm) compared with the activity of only LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, ANP induces inhibition of NO synthesis most likely not by causing an intracellular shortage of iNOS substrates. [3H]l-Citrulline formation in the homogenate of ANP-exposed cells co-treated with the ANP-receptor antagonist HS-142-1 (10 μg/ml) was almost restored completely to levels of LPS treatment only (Fig. 2 B). The reduced activity of iNOS after ANP treatment reflected a decrease of iNOS protein as revealed by immunoblot with a monoclonal mouse anti-iNOS antibody (Fig. 3 A). No iNOS was detected in unstimulated BMM. Upon stimulation with LPS (1 μg/ml, 12 h) a single band (130 kDa) corresponding to iNOS appeared when fully denaturing conditions were used for sample preparation. The expression of iNOS protein was significantly reduced by ANP (1 μm), whereas co-incubation with the NPR-A receptor antagonist HS-142-1 (100 μg/ml) attenuated the decrease in iNOS protein by ANP. The next question was to determine whether ANP influenced the ratio of catalytically active iNOS dimerversus inactive monomer. Western blots were performed under partially denaturing conditions that allow detection of iNOS dimer (260 kDa) (24Xie Q.W. Leung M. Fuortes M. Sassa S. Nathan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Signal intensity of both dimer and monomer diminished in ANP-treated cells, but the proportion of monomer/dimer remained unchanged compared with LPS treatment only (Fig. 3 B). Northern blot analysis was performed to determine whether ANP inhibits iNOS mRNA accumulation when added simultaneously with LPS (1 μg/ml). Time course experiments showed that appearance of iNOS mRNA in BMM was maximal between 4 and 8 h and decreases after 12 h (data not shown). Subsequently mRNA was isolated from cells after 6 h of treatment. In unstimulated cells no iNOS mRNA was detectable (Fig.4). ANP (1 μm) caused a marked reduction of LPS-induced iNOS mRNA steady-state levels. Dexamethasone (10 μm), a known inhibitor of iNOS i"

The increase in basal lipolysis due to nitrosothiols was prevented by dithiothreitol but not by a guanylate cyclase inhibitor. In addition the cyclic GMP-inhibited low K m, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited by SNAP suggesting that SNAP acting as NO+ donor increases basal lipolysis through a S-nitrosylation mediated inhibition of phosphodiesterase. Contrasting with these findings, SNAP reduced both isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis and cyclic AMP production, whereas it failed to modify forskolin-, dibutyryl cyclic AMP-, or isobutylmethylxanthine-stimulated lipolysis, suggesting that SNAP interferes with the β-adrenergic signal transduction pathway upstream the adenylate cyclase. In contrast with SNAP, PAPA-NONOate or NO gas inhibited stimulated lipolysis whatever the stimulating agents used without altering cyclic AMP production. Moreover PAPA-NONOate slightly reduces (30%) the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activity indicating that stimulated lipolysis inhibition by NOċ is linked to both inhibition of the HSL activity and the cyclic AMP-dependent activation of HSL. These data suggest that NOċ or related redox species like NO+/NO− are potential regulators of lipolysis through distinct mechanisms.

This molecule, which is the smallest biological signal known in mammalian cells, can control vital functions such as neurotransmission and blood vessel tone as well as host defense and immunity (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lowenstein C.J. Dinerman J.L. Snyder S.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Some of the effects due to NO are elicited through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic GMP content (3Ignarro L.J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 67: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition NO and NO-related species interact with redox metal-containing proteins and/or with thiol groups of proteins (4Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that S-nitrosylation of proteins could mediate signaling functions and that thiols may be involved in the stabilization and metabolism of NO (5Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 6Stamler J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 196: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).NO is synthesized via l-arginine oxidation by a family of nitric oxide synthase isoforms (NOS). NOS are either constitutively expressed and calcium/calmodulin-dependent (NOS I and NOS III were originally described in neuronal tissue and endothelial cells, respectively) or inducible and almost calcium/calmodulin-independent (NOS II was originally identified in macrophages) (7Fo¨rstermann U. Gath I. Schwarz P. Closs E.I. Kleinert H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that white adipose tissue expresses the NOS II and NOS III isoforms (8Ribiére C. Jaubert A.M. Gaudiot N. Sabourault D. Marcus M.L. Boucher J.L. Denis-Henriot D. Giudicelli Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of NOS II in this tissue can be related to the fact that tumor necrosis factor α is expressed and secreted by adipose tissue, which is also an important target of this cytokine (9Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar). Indeed tumor necrosis factor α was reported to decrease lipoprotein lipase activity and expression (10Kawakami M. Murase T. Ogawa H. Ishibashi S. Mori N. Takaku F. Shibata S. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Grunfeld C. Gulli R. Moser A.H. Gavin L.A. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 579-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to stimulate lipolysis in white adipocytes (10Kawakami M. Murase T. Ogawa H. Ishibashi S. Mori N. Takaku F. Shibata S. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Hauner H. Petruschke Th Russ M. Ro¨hrig K. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the role of NO in these cells is so far unknown. Because of the stimulatory effect of tumor necrosis factor α on both NOS II and lipolysis, a role for NO as a putative regulatory signal controlling lipolysis is questionable.The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis by investigating the influence of NO itself and different NO donors of various reactive nitrogen intermediates on lipolysis in rat fat cells. The donors tested were (i) two nitrosothiols,S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GS-NO) that are described as performing protein S-nitrosylation through the NO+ properties of their NO group (14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and (ii) one compound belonging to the NONOate family, PAPA-NONOate, that generates NOċ (15Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, West Sussex, England1996: 71-115Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step of adipocyte lipolysis is the hydrolysis of triacyl glycerol by the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). The main mechanism involves phosphorylation of the HSL by protein kinase A. Therefore, hormones that affect cyclic AMP levels modulate lipolysis. The stimulatory effect of catecholamines on lipolysis is connected to the β-adrenergic receptor-controlled increment of intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations. In the present study we report the effect of NO and related species on basal lipolysis as well as on stimulated lipolysis by isoproterenol or agents acting on cyclic AMP levels.Here, we provide clear evidence that NO modulates lipolysis through different mechanisms that appear dependent on the redox forms of NO.DISCUSSIONIn this study we provide the first evidence for a modulation of the lipolytic process in isolated adipocytes by NO donors and NO gas. Our results also indicate that there are at least two opposite effects of NO-related species in the control of lipolysis. Among the NO donors tested, only nitrosothiols were found to increase the rate of basal lipolysis through a mechanism apparently unrelated to cyclic GMP. Since the NO group of RS-NO has properties that enableS-nitrosylation of proteins (6Stamler J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 196: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) one likely mechanism explaining the stimulatory effect of RS-NO on basal lipolysis could be the S-nitrosylation of SH group(s) belonging to critical protein(s) for lipolysis. Such a critical role for thiol has been previously emphasized from the observation that exposure of adipose tissue to N-ethylmaleimide (an irreversible thiol alkylating agent) results in a stimulation of basal lipolysis as well (32Giudicelli Y. Provins D. Nordmann R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As nitrosothiols are cell impermeables (27Campbell D.L. Stamler J.S. Strauss H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), interaction of nitrosothiols with extracellular or membraneous redox switch is likely. The particulate cGI-PDE, containing critical thiol (31Degerman E. Belfrage P. Newman A.H. Rice K.C. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5797-5807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), appears to be the target of SNAP as we have observed an inhibitory effect of this enzyme activity by this nitrosothiol. Our present experiment showing that the SNAP-induced stimulation of basal lipolysis was prevented by DTT (thiol-reducing agent) adds further weight to the hypothesis.It has been shown that addition of DTT (a 1–4 dithiol) to solution of nitrosothiol accelerates the nitrosothiol decomposition into hydroxylamine (NH2OH) (14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This production of NH2OH was attributed to a nitrosation of DTT via transnitrosation followed by formation of nitroxyl anion (NO−) and disulfide (14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus DTT is able to modify the redox form of NO generated from nitrosothiols. From this finding and the results of the present study it can be concluded that NO+ donors increase basal lipolysis, whereas NO− generated from SNAP in the presence of DTT or NOċ formed from NONOates and authentic NOċ have no influence on basal lipolysis.Whereas SNAP increases basal lipolysis, it markedly reduced isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. This effect seems to be linked to the decrease in cyclic AMP production observed in isoproterenol-treated adipocytes after exposure to SNAP. A direct effect of SNAP on adenylate cyclase appears unlikely since SNAP failed to decrease the forskolin-induced lipolysis. Moreover, the production of cyclic AMP was unchanged under these conditions. These results are consistent with an interaction of SNAP with the early steps of the signal transduction pathway of isoproterenol i.e. the lipolytic β-adrenergic receptor and/or the Gs coupling protein but not with the adenylate cyclase. It is expected that S-nitrosylation or disulfide formation occurred on the β-receptor since this receptor contains key cysteines implicated in the hormone signal transduction process (33Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Additional effects of SNAP on G proteins could be also suggested as G proteins have been shown to be targets of NO in human lymphocytes (34Lander H.M. Sehajpal P.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7182-7187PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, DTT failed to prevent SNAP inhibition, a finding which indicates that both NO+ (in the absence of DTT) and NO− (in the presence of DTT) are able to inhibit isoproterenol-induced lipolysis. Inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis by SNAP could also be mediated by NOċ as the homolytic cleavage of the S-N bound of SNAP generates NOċ (14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This possibility seems to be ruled out, however, since NOċ donors like NONOates failed to alter isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP production in adipocytes.The mechanism(s) whereby NOċ (issue from authentic NO or NONOates) inhibits lipolysis clearly appears different from that underlying the antilipolytic effect of nitrosothiols, although both are cyclic GMP-independent. As the matter of fact, NOċelicited a marked antilipolytic effect regardless of the stimulatory agent used and NOċ failed to reduce the cyclic AMP responses to isoproterenol or forskolin. Moreover, the marked inhibition induced by NOċ on dibutyryl cyclic AMP- or IBMX-stimulated lipolysis excludes the possibility that an activation of phosphodiesterases could be involved in the inhibitory mechanism of NOċ. A direct effect of NOċ on HSL activity can be suggested as PAPA-NONOate slightly decreased the HSL activity. It appears thus that NOċ probably interferes at the level of the HSL but also on the cyclic AMP-dependent activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and/or on cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent HSL phosphorylation by a mechanism that remains to be determined.Under physiological conditions, NO can be interconverted among different redox forms with distinctive chemistries (4Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). The present results obtained with different NO donors suggest that the intracellular or extracellular redox states are important factors in determining the type of response of the lipolytic process to NO. An increase in basal lipolysis can be observed with nitrosothiols. Nitrosothiols do occur naturally in human plasma mainly as the nitrosothiol of human serum albumin (5Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar).S-nitrosoglutathione has been identified in normal airways (35Gaston B. Reilly J. Drazen J.M. Fackler J. Ramdev P. Arnelle D. Mullins M. Sugarbaker D.J. Chee C. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and in neutrophils (36Clancy R.M. Yegudin J. Levartovsky D. Piziak-Leszcynska J. Abramson S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3680-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Concerning the stimulated lipolysis, NO-related species inhibit the β-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis. However, the inhibitory mechanisms are depending on the NO form. Such inhibition of catecholamine-induced lipolysis could have important physiological metabolic consequences as lipolysis is mainly controlled by the sympathetic nervous system activity and the plasma insulin levels. NO produced by white adipocytes may function as an autocrine regulator of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis.In summary, we have identified a potentially important modulation of lipolysis by NO. Our findings indicate that NO activates or inhibits lipolysis through cyclic GMP-independent mechanisms that are tighly linked to the redox state of NO.

This molecule, which is the smallest biological signal known in mammalian cells, can control vital functions such as neurotransmission and blood vessel tone as well as host defense and immunity (1Moncada S.

Med. 1994; 120: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Some of the effects due to NO are elicited through the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic GMP content (3Ignarro L.J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 67: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition NO and NO-related species interact with redox metal-containing proteins and/or with thiol groups of proteins (4Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that S-nitrosylation of proteins could mediate signaling functions and that thiols may be involved in the stabilization and metabolism of NO (5Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 6Stamler J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 196: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). NO is synthesized via l-arginine oxidation by a family of nitric oxide synthase isoforms (NOS). NOS are either constitutively expressed and calcium/calmodulin-dependent (NOS I and NOS III were originally described in neuronal tissue and endothelial cells, respectively) or inducible and almost calcium/calmodulin-independent (NOS II was originally identified in macrophages) (7Fo¨rstermann U. Gath I. Schwarz P. Closs E.I. Kleinert H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that white adipose tissue expresses the NOS II and NOS III isoforms (8Ribiére C. Jaubert A.M. Gaudiot N. Sabourault D. Marcus M.L. Boucher J.L. Denis-Henriot D. Giudicelli Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of NOS II in this tissue can be related to the fact that tumor necrosis factor α is expressed and secreted by adipose tissue, which is also an important target of this cytokine (9Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6026) Google Scholar). Indeed tumor necrosis factor α was reported to decrease lipoprotein lipase activity and expression (10Kawakami M. Murase T. Ogawa H. Ishibashi S. Mori N. Takaku F. Shibata S. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Grunfeld C. Gulli R. Moser A.H. Gavin L.A. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 579-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to stimulate lipolysis in white adipocytes (10Kawakami M. Murase T. Ogawa H. Ishibashi S. Mori N. Takaku F. Shibata S. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Hauner H. Petruschke Th Russ M. Ro¨hrig K. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the role of NO in these cells is so far unknown. Because of the stimulatory effect of tumor necrosis factor α on both NOS II and lipolysis, a role for NO as a putative regulatory signal controlling lipolysis is questionable. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis by investigating the influence of NO itself and different NO donors of various reactive nitrogen intermediates on lipolysis in rat fat cells. The donors tested were (i) two nitrosothiols,S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GS-NO) that are described as performing protein S-nitrosylation through the NO+ properties of their NO group (14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and (ii) one compound belonging to the NONOate family, PAPA-NONOate, that generates NOċ (15Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, West Sussex, England1996: 71-115Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step of adipocyte lipolysis is the hydrolysis of triacyl glycerol by the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). The main mechanism involves phosphorylation of the HSL by protein kinase A. Therefore, hormones that affect cyclic AMP levels modulate lipolysis. The stimulatory effect of catecholamines on lipolysis is connected to the β-adrenergic receptor-controlled increment of intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations. In the present study we report the effect of NO and related species on basal lipolysis as well as on stimulated lipolysis by isoproterenol or agents acting on cyclic AMP levels. Here, we provide clear evidence that NO modulates lipolysis through different mechanisms that appear dependent on the redox forms of NO. DISCUSSIONIn this study we provide the first evidence for a modulation of the lipolytic process in isolated adipocytes by NO donors and NO gas. Our results also indicate that there are at least two opposite effects of NO-related species in the control of lipolysis. Among the NO donors tested, only nitrosothiols were found to increase the rate of basal lipolysis through a mechanism apparently unrelated to cyclic GMP. Since the NO group of RS-NO has properties that enableS-nitrosylation of proteins (6Stamler J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 196: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) one likely mechanism explaining the stimulatory effect of RS-NO on basal lipolysis could be the S-nitrosylation of SH group(s) belonging to critical protein(s) for lipolysis. Such a critical role for thiol has been previously emphasized from the observation that exposure of adipose tissue to N-ethylmaleimide (an irreversible thiol alkylating agent) results in a stimulation of basal lipolysis as well (32Giudicelli Y. Provins D. Nordmann R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As nitrosothiols are cell impermeables (27Campbell D.L. Stamler J.S. Strauss H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), interaction of nitrosothiols with extracellular or membraneous redox switch is likely. The particulate cGI-PDE, containing critical thiol (31Degerman E. Belfrage P. Newman A.H. Rice K.C. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5797-5807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), appears to be the target of SNAP as we have observed an inhibitory effect of this enzyme activity by this nitrosothiol. Our present experiment showing that the SNAP-induced stimulation of basal lipolysis was prevented by DTT (thiol-reducing agent) adds further weight to the hypothesis.It has been shown that addition of DTT (a 1–4 dithiol) to solution of nitrosothiol accelerates the nitrosothiol decomposition into hydroxylamine (NH2OH) (14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This production of NH2OH was attributed to a nitrosation of DTT via transnitrosation followed by formation of nitroxyl anion (NO−) and disulfide (14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus DTT is able to modify the redox form of NO generated from nitrosothiols. From this finding and the results of the present study it can be concluded that NO+ donors increase basal lipolysis, whereas NO− generated from SNAP in the presence of DTT or NOċ formed from NONOates and authentic NOċ have no influence on basal lipolysis.Whereas SNAP increases basal lipolysis, it markedly reduced isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. This effect seems to be linked to the decrease in cyclic AMP production observed in isoproterenol-treated adipocytes after exposure to SNAP. A direct effect of SNAP on adenylate cyclase appears unlikely since SNAP failed to decrease the forskolin-induced lipolysis. Moreover, the production of cyclic AMP was unchanged under these conditions. These results are consistent with an interaction of SNAP with the early steps of the signal transduction pathway of isoproterenol i.e. the lipolytic β-adrenergic receptor and/or the Gs coupling protein but not with the adenylate cyclase. It is expected that S-nitrosylation or disulfide formation occurred on the β-receptor since this receptor contains key cysteines implicated in the hormone signal transduction process (33Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Additional effects of SNAP on G proteins could be also suggested as G proteins have been shown to be targets of NO in human lymphocytes (34Lander H.M. Sehajpal P.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7182-7187PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, DTT failed to prevent SNAP inhibition, a finding which indicates that both NO+ (in the absence of DTT) and NO− (in the presence of DTT) are able to inhibit isoproterenol-induced lipolysis. Inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis by SNAP could also be mediated by NOċ as the homolytic cleavage of the S-N bound of SNAP generates NOċ (14Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This possibility seems to be ruled out, however, since NOċ donors like NONOates failed to alter isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP production in adipocytes.The mechanism(s) whereby NOċ (issue from authentic NO or NONOates) inhibits lipolysis clearly appears different from that underlying the antilipolytic effect of nitrosothiols, although both are cyclic GMP-independent. As the matter of fact, NOċelicited a marked antilipolytic effect regardless of the stimulatory agent used and NOċ failed to reduce the cyclic AMP responses to isoproterenol or forskolin. Moreover, the marked inhibition induced by NOċ on dibutyryl cyclic AMP- or IBMX-stimulated lipolysis excludes the possibility that an activation of phosphodiesterases could be involved in the inhibitory mechanism of NOċ. A direct effect of NOċ on HSL activity can be suggested as PAPA-NONOate slightly decreased the HSL activity. It appears thus that NOċ probably interferes at the level of the HSL but also on the cyclic AMP-dependent activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and/or on cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent HSL phosphorylation by a mechanism that remains to be determined.Under physiological conditions, NO can be interconverted among different redox forms with distinctive chemistries (4Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). The present results obtained with different NO donors suggest that the intracellular or extracellular redox states are important factors in determining the type of response of the lipolytic process to NO. An increase in basal lipolysis can be observed with nitrosothiols. Nitrosothiols do occur naturally in human plasma mainly as the nitrosothiol of human serum albumin (5Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar).S-nitrosoglutathione has been identified in normal airways (35Gaston B. Reilly J. Drazen J.M. Fackler J. Ramdev P. Arnelle D.

A. 1994; 91: 3680-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Concerning the stimulated lipolysis, NO-related species inhibit the β-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis. However, the inhibitory mechanisms are depending on the NO form. Such inhibition of catecholamine-induced lipolysis could have important physiological metabolic consequences as lipolysis is mainly controlled by the sympathetic nervous system activity and the plasma insulin levels. NO produced by white adipocytes may function as an autocrine regulator of catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis.In summary, we have identified a potentially important modulation of lipolysis by NO.

Csps are involved in neurotransmitter release and may modulate presynaptic calcium channel activity, although the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Interactions between Csps, proteins of the synaptic core (SNARE) complex, and P/Q-type calcium channels were therefore explored. Co-immunoprecipitation suggested that Csps occur in complexes containing synaptobrevin (VAMP), but not syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, nor P/Q-type calcium channels labeled with125I-ω-conotoxin MVIIC. However binding experiments with 35S-labeled Csp1 demonstrated an interaction (apparentK D = 700 nm at pH 7.4 and 4 °C) with a fusion protein containing a segment of the cytoplasmic loop linking homologous domains II-III of the α1A calcium channel subunit (BI isoform, residues 780–969). Binding was specific as it was displaced by unlabeled Csp1, and no interactions were detected with fusion proteins containing other calcium channel domains, VAMP, or syntaxin 1A. A Csp binding site on the P/Q-type calcium channel is thus located within the 200 residue synaptic protein interaction site that can also bind syntaxin I, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin I. Csp may act as a molecular chaperone to direct assembly or disassembly of exocytotic complexes at the calcium channel.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that they are involved in membrane trafficking and/or exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Deletion of the cspc gene in Drosophila causes temperature-sensitive failure of synaptic transmission, resulting in paralysis (13Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Walter N. Benzer S. Science. 1994; 263: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) due to impaired excitation-secretion coupling at nerve terminals (14Umbach J.A. Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Benzer S.

Lett. 1997; 228: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that the default involves either a deficit in calcium entry or in the ability of calcium to trigger exocytosis (16Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7203-7209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data are thus consistent with earlier results indicating that Csps act as positive modulators of ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive calcium channels from Torpedo electric organ, heterologously expressed inXenopus oocytes (2Gundersen C.B. Umbach J.A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fusion competent synaptic vesicles are thought to be docked at the active zone in close proximity to the voltage-gated calcium channels that trigger release. It has been proposed that interactions between calcium channels and Csps may be necessary for the channels associated with docked vesicles to open in response to depolarization (7Mastrogiacomo A Parsons S.M. Zampighi G.A. Jenden D.J. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. Science. 1994; 263: 981-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), although biochemical evidence in favor of this interaction has not been reported. We have therefore examined the molecular interactions of Csp with proteins of the synaptic core (SNARE) complex (17Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar) and P/Q-type calcium channels, which support a major fraction of transmitter release in many synaptic fields of the mammalian brain (18Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. Science. 1994; 258: 917-924Google Scholar). A maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Csp1 fusion protein was prepared (10Pupier S. Leveque C. Marqueze B. Kataoka M. Takahashi M. Seagar M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by affinity chromatography on an amylose column (New England Biolabs). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing domains of the rabbit brain calcium channel α1A (BI-2 isoform) subunit (19Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Homann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), syntaxin 1A, VAMP 2, and synaptotagmin IV were generated as reported previously (20De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Charvin N. Lévêque C. Walker D. Berton F. Raymond C. Kataoka M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. De Waard M. Seagar M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A GST fusion protein, including sequence from the III-IV loop of α1A, was constructed by amplifiying base pairs 4561–4725 and subcloning into pGEXKG. Fusion protein production was induced in cultures of the protease-deficientEscherichia coli strain BL21, and lysates were purified with glutathione-agarose. 35S-Csp1 was synthesized by coupled transcription and translation in vitro, in the presence of [35S]cysteine (>600 Ci/mmol, DuPont), using the TNT™ system (Promega). Polyclonal antibodies against MBP-Csp1 (10Pupier S. Leveque C. Marqueze B. Kataoka M. Takahashi M. Seagar M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were purified on protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitation of125I-ω-conotoxin MVIIC-labeled P/Q-type calcium channels from CHAPS extracts of a rat cerebellar P2 fraction was performed as described previously (22Martin-Moutot N. Charvin N. Leveque C. Sato K. Nishiki T. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. Seagar M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6567-6570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 35S-Csp1 was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of anti-Csp antibodies in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.3% (w/v) BSA. 35S-Csp·antibody complexes were then recovered by mixing with protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow beads for 1 h at 4 °C, centrifuging for 30 s at 10000 × g, and then washed three times in TBS, 0.3% BSA. The washed pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of scintillation solvant, and 35S-Csp binding was quantified by scintillation counting. Binding assays were performed by incubating GST fusion proteins with in vitro-translated35S-Csp in 300 μl of TBS containing 0.5% BSA at 4 °C in the presence of 30 μl glutathione-agarose beads (20De Waard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Charvin N. Lévêque C. Walker D. Berton F. Raymond C. Kataoka M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. De Waard M. Seagar M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Beads were washed three times by centrifugation with the same buffer, and35S-Csp binding was quantified by scintillation counting. Rat brain homogenates were solubilized in 1% of the indicated detergent (see figure legends) in 10 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, and incubated for 5 h at 4 °C with GST or GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Beads were then washed once with TBS containing 0.3% BSA and once with TBS, and bound Csp was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (10Pupier S. Leveque C. Marqueze B. Kataoka M. Takahashi M. Seagar M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spectroscopy was performed on a BIAcore apparatus (Pharmacia Biosensor), with GST fusion proteins immobilized on the sensor chip via covalently linked anti-GST antibodies. 2 μm MBP-Csp or MBP were introduced at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 22 °C. Experiments were performed in order to explore the molecular mechanisms by which Csps may modulate exocytosis. First we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to examine the hypothesis that Csps may associate with components of the trimeric synaptic core (SNARE) complex and/or presynaptic P/Q-type calcium channels. Rat brain membranes were solubilized with CHAPS, and detergent extracts were incubated with non-immune immunoglobulins, polyclonal antibodies raised against Csp1 in the absence and presence of MBP-Csp1, and polyclonal anti-VAMP antibodies. Immune complexes were recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed, and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Western blots were prepared and probed with antibodies directed against Csp1, syntaxin 1, synaptosomal associated 25-kDa protein (SNAP-25) and VAMP. Anti-Csp antibodies were found to co-immunoprecipitate a small fraction of the total VAMP, but neither syntaxin 1 nor SNAP-25 was detected (Fig.1). Immunoprecipitation was specific as an added excess of MBP-Csp1-blocked recovery of both Csp and VAMP. Conversely, when membrane extracts were incubated with an anti-VAMP antibody, Csp and the three SNARE proteins were all identified among the immunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 1). These experiments suggest that anti-Csp antibodies trap protein complexes containing Csp and VAMP but not syntaxin 1 nor SNAP-25, whereas anti-VAMP antibodies recover both Csp/VAMP complexes and synaptic core complexes of VAMP, syntaxin 1, and SNAP-25. While this approach demonstrates that a small population of complexes containing Csp and VAMP does occur, it does not indicate whether these proteins interact directly or indirectly via unidentified protein partners. Cross-linking experiments were performed with the bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate, but failed to reveal complexes between Csp and VAMP or other proteins. Furthermore binding experiments with in vitro translated35S-Csp1 and immobilized GST-VAMP 2 did not provide any support for a direct interaction between these two proteins (see below). A crude synaptosomal (P2) fraction from rat cerebellum was incubated with 125I-ω-conotoxin MVIIC in conditions that allow specific labeling of P/Q-type calcium channels and then extracted with CHAPS (22Martin-Moutot N. Charvin N. Leveque C. Sato K. Nishiki T. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. Seagar M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6567-6570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As reported previously prelabeled channels were immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal anti-syntaxin 1 antibody 10H5 (Fig. 2) (22Martin-Moutot N. Charvin N. Leveque C. Sato K. Nishiki T. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. Seagar M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6567-6570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast anti-Csp antibodies failed to capture solubilized125I-ω-conotoxin MVIIC receptors. The amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated by anti-Csp antibodies was not significantly different from that in control assays in which anti-Csp antibodies were preincubated with a large excess of MBP-Csp1 or in which non-immune rabbit IgG was used. As this approach did not detect interactions between endogenous Csps and P/Q-type calcium channels, experiments were performed with recombinant proteins. 35S-Csp1 was produced by coupled transcription and translation in vitro in the presence of [35S]cysteine. SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed a single major radioactive species migrating at 28 kDa in accordance with the predicted molecular mass of Csp (Fig.3 A, left panel). Furthermore radioactivity was immunoprecipitated by anti-Csp antibodies but not by non-immune immunoglobulins (Fig. 3 A, right panel). SDS-PAGE and protein staining indicated that the predominant forms of MBP-Csp1, MBP, GST-II-IIIA, and GST (Fig. 3 B) migrated at 70, 43, 48, and 27 kDa respectively, consistent with apparent molecular masses of 27 kDa for Csp1, and 21 kDa for a polypeptide from the calcium channel II-III linker region corresponding to residues 780–969 of the BI isoform of the α1A subunit. Binding experiments were then performed in which 35S-Csp1 was incubated with a range of concentrations of GST-II-IIIAor GST. Thus in this assay 35S-Csp1 is considered as being the binding site and the GST fusion protein as the ligand. Saturable binding of GST-II-IIIA occurred with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 700 nm (Fig.3 C). Interaction was specific as binding was not detected with an identical concentration range of GST. Furthermore the addition of a large molar excess of MBP-Csp1 inhibited the association of35S-Csp1 with the GST-II-III loop (Fig. 3 D). No significant binding to 35S-Csp1 was detected with GST fusion proteins containing VAMP 2, syntaxin 1A, domains from the I-II or III-IV linker regions (Fig. 3 D), or from the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions (not shown) of the α1A subunit. Surface plasmon resonance experiments using a Biacore apparatus to detect interactions between recombinant proteins also confirmed MBP-Csp1 binding to GST-II-IIIA immobilized on a sensor chip via covalently linked anti-GST antibodies (not shown). Binding monitored by this method was again specific for the II-III domain of the α1A subunit, as control experiments did not reveal interactions between MBP and GST-II-IIIA, nor between MBP-Csp1 and other cytoplasmic domains of the α1A subunit fused to GST. Preliminary surface plasmon resonance experiments indicated that the binding of Csp to the GST-II-IIIA fusion protein was diminished in the presence of CHAPS. The effect of a series of detergents (digitonin, cholate, Lubrol, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, CHAPS) on the interaction of 35S-Csp1 with the GST-II-IIIA was examined. All the detergents tested (at 1%, w/v) inhibited binding by 60–80% (not shown). As detergent concentrations within this range are required to solubilize native calcium channels from brain membranes, it is possible that dissociation of endogenous Csp/calcium channel complexes by detergents may account for our inability to detect interactions by co-immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 2). In order to examine this possibility the interaction of recombinant calcium channel domains with native Csp was studied. Detergent extracts of P2 membranes from rat brain were incubated with either GST-II-IIIA, GST-III-IVA, or GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing, beads were recovered by centrifugation, treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the eluted proteins analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Csp antibodies (Fig. 4 A). This approach demonstrated that endogenous Csp associated specifically with the GST-II-IIIA fusion protein despite the presence of CHAPS, Nonidet P-40, or Triton X-100. Similar experiments were performed to examine whether endogenous P/Q-type calcium channels interact with recombinant Csp. MBP-Csp1 and control proteins were immobilized on amylose beads and incubated under agitation with CHAPS extracts of synaptic membranes containing native calcium channels prelabeled with 125I-ω-conotoxin MVIIC. P/Q-type calcium channels were captured by immobilized anti-syntaxin 1 antibodies, but not by MBP-Csp beads. Furthermore the quantity of solubilized calcium channels trapped by MBP-Csp1 beads was not significantly different from that bound by beads linked to MBP alone or fused to synaptotagmin IV (Fig. 4 B). Evidence points to an essential role for Csps in the synaptic release of neurotransmitters (13Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Walter N. Benzer S. Science. 1994; 263: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 14Umbach J.A. Zinsmaier K.E. Eberle K.K. Buchner E. Benzer S. Gundersen C.B. Neuron. 1994; 13: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and suggests that they are involved in regulating the ability of presynaptic calcium channels to open in response to membrane depolarization (2Gundersen C.B. Umbach J.A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 16Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7203-7209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus asked whether Csps interact with components of the trimeric synaptic core complex and/or the P/Q-type calcium channel. The synaptic core (SNARE) complex is composed of a synaptic vesicle protein: synaptobrevin (VAMP) and two proteins that are predominantly expressed in the synaptic plasma membrane: syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (17Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). This complex is thought constitute the hub of a sequence of protein/protein interactions that lead up to calcium-dependent exocytosis (reviewed in Refs.23Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar and 24Bajjalieh S.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1971-1974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). SNARE complexes associate with P/Q-type calcium channels (22Martin-Moutot N. Charvin N. Leveque C. Sato K. Nishiki T. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. Seagar M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6567-6570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7363-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and co-expression of syntaxin 1 with P/Q-type channels inXenopus oocytes modulates channel gating properties (26Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that Csp may regulate both exocytosis and calcium channel function by interacting with components of the SNARE complex. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed complexes containing Csp and VAMP, but not syntaxin 1 or SNAP-25. Synaptophysin, which interacts with VAMP in synaptic vesicles (27Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), was not identified among proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-Csp antibodies (not shown). Direct binding between recombinant Csp1 and VAMP 2 was not detected. However in vitro translated and bacterially expressed Csps are not palmitoylated, and a direct interaction between Csps and VAMP could require fatty acylation. These data are thus consistent with either a direct interaction between native Csp and VAMP or an indirect association mediated by unidentified partners. The calcium-conducting pore of P/Q-type calcium channels is formed by the α1A subunit, which contains four homologous domains each composed of six helical transmembrane segments (19Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Homann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). A GST-fusion protein containing a domain located in the cytoplasmic loop linking homologous domains II and III of the α1A subunit displayed saturable binding to in vitro translated [35S]cysteine-labeled Csp. The affinity of this interaction is moderate with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 700 nm at 4 °C and pH 7.4. Csp thus binds an approximately 200 residue segment on the α1A subunit (residues 780–969 of the BI isoform). Specific interaction was confirmed using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, which indicated that MBP-Csp can bind to the same GST fusion protein immobilized on a sensor chip. In view of the molecular chaperone activity of Csp, it is important to underline the specificity of binding. Hsp70 and DnaJ-like proteins act as chaperones and bind polypeptides, but with different selectivity. Hsp70 binds unfolded proteins recognizing short stretches of amino acids with an extended conformation. In contrast, DnaJ-like proteins such as Csp generally bind substrates exhibiting secondary and tertiary structure, but exhibit very low affinity for polypeptides in extended conformations (reviewed in Ref. 28Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that recombinant Csp does not associate nonselectively with bacterially expressed proteins irrespective of their sequence, as Csp did not bind to GST alone, or GST fusion proteins containing syntaxin 1, VAMP 2, or other regions of the α1A subunit. Furthermore it is reasonable to assume that the folding of in vitro translated proteins provides a closer approximation to native conformation than bacterially expressed proteins fused to large tag sequences. Although the illustrated binding data were obtained using in vitrotranslated Csp and GST-II-IIIA, we have also verified thatin vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled II-IIIA interacts with MBP-Csp1 (not shown). Thus specific binding occurs irrespective of which partner is generated by in vitro translation and which is a fusion protein. Finally it is significant that Csp binds selectively to a calcium channel domain strongly implicated in excitation-secretion coupling. This region of the α1A subunit constitutes a binding site for syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (BI residues 722–1036, Ref. 25Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7363-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and synaptotagmin I (BI residues 780–969, Ref. 21Charvin N. Lévêque C. Walker D. Berton F. Raymond C. Kataoka M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. De Waard M. Seagar M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of these interactions is supported by evidence that injection of the equivalent synaptic protein binding domain from the α1B subunit (29Sheng Z-H. Rettig J. Cook T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) disrupts transmitter release in sympathetic neurons (30Mochida S. Sheng Z.-H. Baker C. Kobayashi H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 781-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and at the amphibian neuromuscular junction (31Rettig J. Heinemann C. Ashery U. Sheng Z.-H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6647-6656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to experiments with recombinant proteins, immunoprecipitation with anti-Csp antibodies failed to capture P/Q-type calcium channels from detergent extracts of nerve terminals. This could be due to the masking of Csp epitopes by protein/protein interactions or alternatively to the disruption of native complexes during membrane solubilization. All detergents tested inhibited GST-II-IIIAfusion protein binding to 35S-Csp. However the presence of detergents in membrane extracts did not prevent endogenous Csps from interacting with GST-II-IIIA fusion proteins. In contrast native calcium channels did not bind to immobilized MBP-Csp, suggesting that a limiting parameter may be the accessibility of the Csp binding site on the calcium channel. Syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin I bind to the same domain on the calcium channel as Csp, and these three proteins all display a higher affinity than Csp for binding to calcium channels (25Rettig J. Sheng Z.H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7363-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 21Charvin N. Lévêque C. Walker D. Berton F. Raymond C. Kataoka M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. De Waard M. Seagar M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore a large fraction of native P/Q-type channels are stably associated with complexes containing syntaxin I, SNAP-25, VAMP, and synaptotagmin I or II (21Charvin N. Lévêque C. Walker D. Berton F. Raymond C. Kataoka M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. De Waard M. Seagar M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Martin-Moutot N. Charvin N. Leveque C.

SNARE complexes associated with native calcium channels may therefore prevent interaction with endogenous or exogenous Csps. If Csps promote calcium channel opening by binding to the II-III linker region of the α1A subunit, how may intrinsic chaperone activity and cooperation with Hsp70 be involved? Apart from their role in protein folding during translation, chaperones contribute to the assembly and dissociation of multi-protein complexes. Hsp70 (DnaK) and J-domain proteins (DnaJ) promote the assembly and stabilization of glucocorticoid aporeceptor complexes (reviewed in Ref. 32Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the dissociation of complexes involved in bacteriophage λ DNA replication (reviewed in Ref. 33Georgopoulos C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and clathrin disassembly from coated vesicles (34Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that Csps act as chaperones to promote assembly or disassembly of synaptic protein complexes associated with the II-III linker region of the calcium channel. Co-expression of syntaxin 1 with Q-type calcium channels decreases their availability for opening by stabilizing an inactivated state (26Bezprozvanny I. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Csps could in principle facilitate channel activation by promoting the dissociation of syntaxin. Our data indicate that Csps can interact directly with the P/Q-type calcium channel and also suggest an association with VAMP. We can speculate that Csp may coordinate sequential protein/protein interactions between syntaxin and two of its binding partners, calcium channels and VAMP, and consequently modulate channel opening and calcium-dependent exocytosis. It is interesting to note that a strikingly similar pattern of evoked synaptic responses results from either the disruption of SNARE protein interaction with calcium channels in rat sympathetic neurons (30Mochida S. Sheng Z.-H. Baker C. Kobayashi H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 781-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or the deletion of the Csp gene in motoneurones of Drosophila larvae (15Heckmann M. Adelsberger H. Dudel J. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 228: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both manipulations produced a reduction in synchronous transmitter release, while asynchronous release and paired pulse facilitation were increased. The regulation by Csp of SNARE protein interactions with calcium channels may thus be necessary to ensure synchronous synaptic transmission. Further studies will be necessary to examine whether the assembly of syntaxin 1-SNAP-25-VAMP-synaptotagmin complexes at the synaptic protein interaction site on the calcium channel is regulated by the chaperone activity of Csp and Hsp70."
https://openalex.org/W2038072610,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor-6 (HNF-6) contains a single cut domain and a homeodomain characterized by a phenylalanine at position 48 and a methionine at position 50. We describe here two isoforms of HNF-6 which differ by the linker that separates these domains. Both isoforms stimulated transcription. The affinity of HNF-6α and HNF-6β for DNA differed, depending on the target sequence. Binding of HNF-6 to DNA involved the cut domain and the homeodomain, but the latter was not required for binding to a subset of sites. Mutations of the F48M50 dyad that did not affect DNA binding reduced the transcriptional stimulation of constructs that do not require the homeodomain for DNA binding, but did not affect the stimulation of constructs that do require the homeodomain. Comparative trees of mammalian, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins showed that HNF-6 defines a new class, which we call ONECUT, of homeodomain proteins. C. elegans proteins of this class bound to HNF-6 DNA targets. Thus, depending on their sequence, these targets determine for HNF-6 at least two modes of DNA binding, which hinge on the homeodomain and on the linker that separates it from the cut domain, and two modes of transcriptional stimulation, which hinge on the homeodomain. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-6 (HNF-6) contains a single cut domain and a homeodomain characterized by a phenylalanine at position 48 and a methionine at position 50. We describe here two isoforms of HNF-6 which differ by the linker that separates these domains. Both isoforms stimulated transcription. The affinity of HNF-6α and HNF-6β for DNA differed, depending on the target sequence. Binding of HNF-6 to DNA involved the cut domain and the homeodomain, but the latter was not required for binding to a subset of sites. Mutations of the F48M50 dyad that did not affect DNA binding reduced the transcriptional stimulation of constructs that do not require the homeodomain for DNA binding, but did not affect the stimulation of constructs that do require the homeodomain. Comparative trees of mammalian, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins showed that HNF-6 defines a new class, which we call ONECUT, of homeodomain proteins. C. elegans proteins of this class bound to HNF-6 DNA targets. Thus, depending on their sequence, these targets determine for HNF-6 at least two modes of DNA binding, which hinge on the homeodomain and on the linker that separates it from the cut domain, and two modes of transcriptional stimulation, which hinge on the homeodomain. The phenotype of multicellular organisms is determined in part by the cell type-specific expression of genes. Since the initial observation that expression of liver-specific genes is controlled at the level of transcription (1Derman E. Krauter K. Walling L. Weinberger C. Ray M. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1981; 23: 731-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), several liver-enriched transcription factors have been identified and extensively studied. These factors contain DNA-binding domains that have been conserved throughout evolution. Based on the structure of their functional domains, the liver-enriched transcription factors were classified into five families (2Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 3Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1992; 2: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These include the CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins and the proline acid-rich factors, which both contain a leucine zipper, the homeodomain proteins of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1The abbreviations used are: HNF-6, hepatocyte nuclear factor-6; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PFK-2, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; FCS, fetal calf serum; bp, base pair; oligo, oligonucleotide(s); TTR, transthyretin-1 family, the winged helix proteins HNF-3α, -β, and -γ, and the zinc finger orphan receptor HNF-4 family. These factors are expressed not only in liver but also in a restricted number of other tissues, where they control gene transcription both in the adult and during development (2Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We have recently cloned (4Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) a new type of liver-enriched transcription factor that we called HNF-6. This factor, which was originally characterized as a transcriptional activator of the liver promoter of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (pfk-2) gene, is expressed in liver, brain, spleen, pancreas, and testis. Moreover, the developmental pattern of expression of HNF-6 in the mouse and the demonstration that HNF-6 can control transcription of the hnf-3β andhnf-4 genes (5Landry C. Clotman F. Hioki T. Oda H. Picard J.J. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 15: 247-257Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) suggest a role of HNF-6 in several developmental programs. In adult rat liver, HNF-6 mediates sex-dependent effects of growth hormone (6Lahuna O. Fernandez L. Karlsson H. Maiter D. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Gustafsson J.-A. Mode A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12309-12313Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HNF-6 contains a cut domain and a homeodomain. Cut homeodomain proteins were originally described as the products of the Drosophila cutgene (7Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jack J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1988; 333: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and of its mammalian homologs, the mclox genes (8Andrés V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V.

Such cut repeats, which are well conserved sequences of 66–88 amino acids, function as DNA-binding domains, alone or in combination with the homeodomain (13Andrés V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V.

Moreover, its homeodomain differs by the nature of its residues 48 and 50 from the 400-odd homeodomains described so far (4Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Residue 48 of homeodomains, which is part of their hydrophobic core, is a phenylalanine in HNF-6, whereas it is invariably a tryptophan in the other homeodomain proteins, including the cut homeodomain proteins. Residue 50, which is located in the DNA recognition helix and is a key determinant of sequence-specific DNA binding (18, 19; for a review on homeodomain-DNA interactions, see Ref. 20Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), is a methionine in HNF-6, an amino acid never found at this position in other homeodomain proteins. These characteristics of the cut domain and of the homeodomain of HNF-6 have been evolutionarily conserved since we found them in theceh-21 and F22D3.1/ceh-38 genes ofCaenorhabditis elegans(4Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). 2T. R. Bürglin and G. Ruvkun, unpublished data. In proteins that contain two DNA-binding domains, the distance between these domains may be crucial for their proper function (21van Leeuwen H.C. Strating M.J. Rensen M. de Laat W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2043-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our preliminary data suggested the existence of an isoform of HNF-6 characterized by an additional sequence of 26 amino acids in the linker region between the cut domain and the homeodomain (4Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All these features of HNF-6 raised important questions that we have addressed in the present work, namely (i) does the putative isoform of HNF-6 differ from the bona fide HNF-6 only by the linker region? (ii) how does the linker sequence affect the DNA-binding properties of HNF-6? (iii) are the single cut domain and the peculiar homeodomain of HNF-6 involved in DNA binding and transcriptional stimulation? (iv) could HNF-6 dimerize on DNA? and (v) are the DNA-binding properties conserved among the cut homeodomain proteins related to HNF-6? To obtain the β isoform of HNF-6 we performed RT-PCR (Gene Amp kit from Perkin-Elmer) on rat liver RNA (200 ng) with primers whose 5′ ends correspond to positions 210 and 1374 of rat HNF-6 cDNA (4Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), namely the BGL primer (5′-gaagatctATGTTGCAGCCCGCTCACCC-3′) and the RKE primer (5′-CTTCCCGTGTTCTTGCTCTTTCC-3′), followed by Southern blotting of the PCR product with a primer (78S) specific for the β isoform (5′-ATGGGTGGCAGTGTGCCTTC-3′). pSPHNF6α and pSPHNF6β contain the rat HNF-6α and -β cDNA cloned in theBamHI and SacI sites of pSP72 (Promega). pSPcut-hd and pSPcut-78-hd code for amino acids 292–444 and 292–470 of HNF-6α and -β, respectively. The corresponding cDNA fragments were obtained by RT-PCR on rat liver RNA with the cut 5′ (5′-CCCAAGCTTACCATGGCAATCAATACCAAAGAGGTGCTC-3′) and hd 3′ (5′-CGGGATCCTCAGTCCAGACTCCTCCTTCTCGC-3′) primers and ligated in theHindIII and BamHI sites of pSP72. pSPHNF6αΔhd and pSPHNF6βΔhd code for amino acids 1–384 and 1–410 of HNF-6α and -β, respectively, and were obtained by anEcoNI-EcoRV deletion. pSPHNF-6αΔcut codes for amino acids 1–291 and 371–465 of HNF-6α and was generated by anXmnI-EcoNI deletion. In pSPHNF6βΔcut, which codes for amino acids 1–291 and 366–491 of HNF-6β, the cut domain was deleted by a BlpI-XmnI digestion. pSPHNF6Δ(cut + hd) codes for amino acids 1–291 and was made by deleting the portion 3′ of the XmnI site. The site-directed mutants pSPHNF6F48W, pSPHNF6M50H, and pSPHNF6F48W,M50H were made using a PCR-based strategy with the following primers: 5′-CTGTCAGCAACTGGTTCATGAATGCG-3′ (F48W), 5′-CAGCAACTTCTTCCACAATGCGAGAAG-3′ (M50H), and 5′-CAGCAACTGGTTCCACAATGCGAGAAGG-3′ (F48W,M50H); mutated codons are underlined. pHNF-6/HNF-3β (6×)-TATA-luc and pHNF-6/TTR (6×)-TATA-luc contain six HNF-6-binding sites from thehnf-3β promoter (−141 to −127) or from the transthyretin (TTR) promoter (−11 to −86) upstream of a TATA box and a luciferase gene. pECE-HNF6α, which is identical to pECE-HNF6 described in Lemaigre et al. (4Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and pECE-HNF6β contain the cDNA of HNF-6α and -β downstream of the SV40 early promoter in pECE72. pECE-HNF6αF48W, pECE-HNF6αM50H, and pECE-HNF6αF48W,M50H were generated by deleting a BstEII/XbaI fragment from pECE-HNF6α and replacing it by the correspondingBstEII/EcoRV fragment derived from pSPHNF6αF48W, pSPHNF6αM50H, and pSPHNF6αF48W,M50H. pRL-138 contains the rat pfk-2 liver promoter (−138 to +87,i.e. devoid of HNF-6-binding site) cloned upstream of the Renilla luciferase coding sequence. pGEM-3 was from Promega. The cDNA of F22D3.1/ceh-38 (yk34h2) andceh-21 (yk90c4) was excised from λ ZAPII (Stratagene) libraries by standard procedures. The fragments containing the cut domain plus the homeodomain of F22D3.1/ceh-38 and ofceh-21 were isolated by PCR from the corresponding cDNA with the F22D3.1/ceh-38 cut 5′ (5′-ACCATGGCAATAGACACAAAAGATCTTTGC-3′) andF22D3.1/ceh-38 hd 3′ (5′-TCAACCGAGTCGACTTCTACGACG-3′) primers and with the ceh-21 hd cut 5′ (5′-ACCATGGCACTCGACACTGTCGACATTGCTC-3′) and ceh-21 hd 3′ (5′-TCAGTCAATGCGAAGACGACGCGC-3′) primers, respectively. TheF22D3.1/ceh-38 and ceh-21 fragments were ligated in the HindIII and BamHI and in theXbaI and XhoI sites of pSP72 to yield pSPF22D3.1/ceh-38 and pSPceh-21, respectively. pGEXHNF6β, coding for a GST-HNF6β fusion protein, was obtained by subcloning a ClaI/HindIII fragment from pSPHNF6β into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pGEX-KG. To produce wild-type or mutant recombinant HNF-6α and -β proteins, 1 μg of the corresponding HNF-6 cDNA under the control of the SP6 promoter was combined with 25 μl of TNT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) in a 50-μl incubation mixture according to the supplier's instructions. To produce the DNA-binding domains of Ceh-38 and of Ceh-21, pSPF22D3.1/ceh-38 and pSPceh-21 were incubated with the wheat germ extract to yield translated products of 169 (Ceh-38) and of 157 (Ceh-21) amino acids. For EMSAs, 5 μl of the reaction mixture were incubated on ice for 20 min in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEGTA, 50 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), and the 32P-labeled probe (20,000 cpm, except for Scatchard analysis, see below). These solutions were loaded on an 8% acrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio was 29:1) in 0.25× TBE buffer and electrophoresed at 200 V. The sequence of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used as probes was as follows: oligo HNF-4, 5′-AGGATAGAAGTCAATGATCTGGGA-3′ (−394 to −371 of the mousehnf-4 promoter); oligo HNF-3β, 5′-AGCTTAAGGCCCGATATTGATTTTTTTTTCTCC-3′ (−150 to −118 of the rathnf-3β promoter); oligo phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, 5′-CAAAGTTTAGTCAATCAAACGTTG-3′ (−263 to −240 of the rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck) gene promoter); oligo TTR, 5′-GTCTGCTAAGTCAATAATCAGAAT-3′ (−110 to −87 of the mousetransthyretin promoter); oligo GRUc, 5′-AGCTTCAAACAAACAAAAAAAATCCATAACTTTCA-3′ (in the glucocorticoid response unit of the first intron of the rat pfk-2 gene A); oligo PFK-2, 5′-gatcGCTTTGAAATTGATTTCAAAGC-3′ (−195 to −216 of the pfk-2 L promoter); oligo CYP2C12, 5′-GCAAAATATTGATTTTTATGGTG-3′(−52 to −30 of the ratcyp2c12 gene promoter. For affinity constant (K D) determination, EMSAs were performed with a constant amount of recombinant protein and various concentrations of probe (1.3–20.8 nm) of decreasing specific radioactivity to avoid overlabeling of the gels. Incubations lasted 1 h on ice to reach equilibrium. Bound and free probe were quantified with an Instant Imager (Packard). The bound/free ratio was calculated, and the values were plotted against the concentration of bound probe (nm) to obtain Scatchard plots in which theK D = −1/slope. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells (8 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish) were transfected overnight in medium without FCS using DOTAP, 3 μg of pHNF-6/HNF3β(6×)-TATA-luc or pHNF-6/TTR(6×)-TATA-luc reporter construct, 400 ng of pECE-HNF6α, pECE-HNF6β, pECE-HNF6αF48W, pECE-HNF6αM50H, or pECE-HNF6αF48W,M50H, 500 ng of pRL-138 as internal control, and pGEM-3 to adjust plasmid amounts to 5 μg. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and further incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS before measuring luciferase activities with the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured with a Lumac Luminometer and expressed as the ratio of reporter activity (firefly luciferase) to internal control activity (Renilla luciferase). Cos-7 cells (6 × 105) were transfected for 6 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FCS using DOTAP and 10 μg of expression vector. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of 40 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.9), 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. After three freeze-thaw cycles, the lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants collected. 5 μl of supernatant was used in EMSA as described above. Data base searches were performed using BLAST at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

R07D10.x is an open reading frame found on the overlapping cosmids RO7D10 and C17H12. Besides the fully coding cDNA originally described for the 465-residue rat HNF-6 (HNF-6α), we had found a partial cDNA that was identical to the 3′-half of HNF-6α cDNA, except for a 78-bp insert within the spacer that separates the cut domain from the homeodomain (4Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To extend this partial sequence, we performed an RT-PCR reaction on rat liver RNA with a PCR primer (oligo RKE) located 3′ of the 78-bp insert and a PCR primer (oligo BGL) located 5′ of the HNF-6α ATG initiator codon. Southern blotting of the PCR products with an oligonucleotide (oligo 78S) specific for the 78-bp insert showed a 1130-bp band that corresponded to the missing portion of the cDNA (data not shown). Data base scanning with the sequence of this fragment revealed that it was identical to the corresponding HNF-6α cDNA fragment, with the exception of the 78-bp insert. This defined an isoform of HNF-6 (HNF-6β, 491 residues) that differs from HNF-6α (465 residues) only by the presence of an additional sequence of 26 amino acids in the linker between the cut domain and the homeodomain. Cloning of the rat HNF-6 gene indicated that the two isoforms originate from the same gene by alternative splicing. 5M. Rastegar, G. G. Rousseau, and F. P. Lemaigre, unpublished observations. HNF-6α stimulates the transcription of several genes. To test the transcriptional activity of HNF-6β, we cotransfected HepG2 cells with an HNF-6α (pECE-HNF6α) or HNF-6β (pECE-HNF6β) expression vector and a luciferase reporter construct driven by a TATA box and six copies of a HNF-6 site derived from the hnf-3β(pHNF-6/HNF-3β(6×)-TATA-luc) promoter. HNF-6α and HNF-6β had similar (15–30-fold) stimulatory effects (data not shown). HNF-6β differs from HNF-6α by the length of the linker region between the cut domain and the homeodomain. This suggested that the two HNF-6 isoforms may have distinct DNA-binding properties. We therefore compared the affinity of HNF-6α and -β for the hnf-3β promoter site (HNF3β probe). To do so, the corresponding HNF-6 cDNAs were transcribed and translated in a wheat germ extract. The integrity of the recombinant proteins was controlled by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after incorporation of [14C]leucine (data not shown). This showed a major band of the expected molecular weight and a band of lower molecular weight that was interpreted as a product of degradation or of initiation from an internal initiation codon. Accordingly, EMSAs with the synthesized proteins showed an upper major band and a lower minor band (Fig. 1 A). These bands were competed for by the cold probe and were not seen with unprogrammed extracts (Fig. 1 J). We excluded that the upper band was the result of dimerization of HNF-6 with the probe (see below). Scatchard plots were performed to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants (K D) of HNF-6α and -β. In these experiments, various amounts of probe were used with a fixed amount of protein. The K D determined in this manner is independent of protein concentration and of the proportion of active protein in the preparation. HNF-6β bound to the HNF-3β probe with a 12-fold higher affinity than HNF-6α (Fig. 1 I). Representative experiments are shown in Fig. 1, C andD. To determine whether this was due to a faster on-rate or to a slower off-rate of HNF-6β, we measured off-rate constants (k off) experimentally and deduced the on-rate constants (k on) from the relationshipk on =k off/K D (Fig. 1 I). As shown in Fig. 1 E, the k off of HNF-6β was actually 3-fold higher than that of HNF-6α, whereas itsk on (values calculated from theK D in Fig. 1, C and D) was 60-fold higher than that of HNF-6α. Thus, if HNF-6α and HNF-6β were to compete at identical concentrations for the HNF-3β probe, HNF-6β would leave little chance to HNF-6α for occupying this binding site.Figure 1The HNF-6α and HNF-6β isoforms differ in DNA-binding kinetics and site recognition.

In the experiments (A–D, F, G, and I), various amounts of probe were used with a fixed amount of in vitrosynthesized protein. For Scatchard plots the upper complex only (seeA and B) was taken into account to calculate the concentration of bound probe. E and H, rate of dissociation of HNF-6α and HNF-6β from the probes indicated. After 20 min of incubation (zero time) a 60-fold excess of cold probe was added, and binding was determined by EMSA at the time points indicated.J, the two slowest migrating complexes were not seen with unprogrammed (unpr.) extract (lanes 1 and 6 versus 2 and 7) and were inhibited by an excess of cold probe (lanes 3–5 and 8–10). Molar excess of competitor probe was 10-fold (lanes 3 and 8), 30-fold (lanes 4 and 9), and 70-fold (lanes 5 and 10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We had shown earlier that HNF-6 binds in the TTR promoter to a site whose sequence differs from that of the HNF-3β site (25Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Rousseau G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19896-19905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the differences in affinity of HNF-6α and HNF-6β reported above with the HNF-3β probe held true for the TTR probe. The data in Fig. 1, B, F, G, and I, show that this was not the case. The affinity of HNF-6β for the TTR probe was not higher but was in fact 3-fold lower than that of HNF-6α (Fig. 1 I). Representative experiments are shown in Fig. 1,F and G. The off-rate constants (Fig.1 H) for dissociation from the TTR probe showed that HNF-6β dissociates four times faster than HNF-6α from this probe also (Fig.1 I). It is noteworthy that both HNF-6α and -β dissociate 10 times faster from the TTR probe than from the HNF-3β probe. Thus, HNF-6β differed from HNF-6α not only in terms of affinity for a given binding site but also in exhibiting differences in affinity for different targets. We therefore compared the binding of the two recombinant isoforms to several of the known HNF-6 sites. Fig.2 shows an alignment of HNF-6 sites based on our observations and those of Samadani and Costa (26Samadani U. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and summarizes the relative affinities of HNF-6α and -β for these sites. As can be seen, the two isoforms bound to all sites but with different relative affinities. We concluded from these experiments that the two HNF-6 isoforms differ in their DNA binding kinetics and that this depends on both the amino acid linker region and the sequence of the target site. To delineate the DNA-binding region of HNF-6, and to gain insight into the respective roles of the cut domain and of the homeodomain, we constructed deletion mutants and synthesized them in vitro (Fig.3 A). The integrity of the recombinant proteins was controlled by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after incorporation of [14C]leucine (data not shown). The ability of the HNF-6 mutants to bind specifically to DNA was tested by EMSA with the HNF-3β probe (Fig. 3 C). Consistent with the presence of the 26-residue insert, the HNF-6β proteins migrated slower than the HNF-6α proteins. Deletion of the amino-terminal half (amino acids 1–291) of HNF-6α and -β (HNF-6 cut + hd) did not prevent binding (Fig. 3 C, lanes 9 and10 versus lanes 2 and 3). Deletion of the homeodomain (HNF-6 Δhd) was still compatible with binding (Fig.3 C, lanes 4 and 5). Deletion of the cut domain (HNF-6 Δcut) led to the loss of DNA binding (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that the homeodomain alone was unable to bind to the HNF-3β probe. Deletion of both the cut domain and the homeodomain (HNF-6 Δ(cut + hd)) also abolished DNA binding (Fig. 3 C, lane 8). An isolated cut domain or homeodomain could not be tested as they were very unstable in the wheat germ extracts (data not shown). Wheat germ extracts produced different quantities of recombinant HNF-6 depending on the mutant tested (hence the apparently poor binding of HNF-6 Δhd in Fig. 3 C, lanes 4 and 5). We therefore determined whether the differences in amount of complexes of HNF-6 proteins with the HNF-3β probe seen by EMSA reflected true differences in affinity of the HNF-6 proteins for DNA. TheK D values derived from Scatchard plots for wild-type HNF-6 and for its deletants are given in Fig. 3 B. These values indicate that the carboxyl-terminal half of HNF-6 (HNF-6 cut + hd) bound the probe with an affinity similar to that of wild-type HNF-6, thereby demonstrating that the entire DNA-binding domain is located within this portion of the protein. They also show that deletion of the homeodomain barely decreased the affinity of HNF-6 for the HNF-3β probe. The latter finding suggested that the homeodomain is not required for the binding of HNF-6 to a subset of sites that includes the HNF-6 site of the HNF-3β promoter. To address this possibility we tested the same HNF-6 deletion mutants of HNF-6 on the TTR probe, which was shown above to bind wild-type HNF-6α and -β. The same amount of HNF-6β yielded less complexes, relative to HNF-6α, with the TTR probe than with the HNF-3β probe (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 3 D versus C). Here again, the amino-terminal half of the HNF-6 proteins was dispensable for binding (Fig. 3 D, lanes 9 and10). The poor binding of HNF-6β cut + hd was in keeping with the low affinity of HNF-6β for the TTR probe. Deletion of both the cut domain and the homeodomain abolished binding (Fig. 3 D, lane 8). In contrast to what we had seen with the HNF-3β probe, both the cut domain and the homeodomain were required for binding to the TTR probe since deletion of either of the two domains abolished binding (Fig. 3 D, lanes 4–7). We concluded from these experiments that (i) the cut domain and the homeodomain constitute the DNA-binding region of HNF-6; (ii) the homeodomain of HNF-6 is unable to bind on its own; (iii) the homeodomain is nevertheless required for HNF-6 binding to a subset of sites that includes the HNF-6 site of the TTR promoter; and (iv) the homeodomain is not required for HNF-6 binding to a subset of sites that includes the hnf-3βpromoter.

By construction of a series of deletion mutants, the region of E6BP that is necessary and sufficient for complex formation with human papillomavirus type 16 E6 has been mapped to a 25-amino acid domain.

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) that infect the anogenital tract can be classified as either high or low risk.

Low risk types are also found in genital and cervical papillomavirus infections but rarely progress to cancer.The transforming properties of HPVs reside in two genes, E6and E7. The E6and E7genes are consistently expressed in HPV-positive cervical cancers and derived cell lines (5Schwarz E. Freese U.K. Gissman L. Mayer W. Roggenbuck B. Stremlau A. zur Hausen H.

HPV-16 E6 also cooperates with activated Ras in the transformation and immortalization of baby mouse kidney cells and baby rat kidney cells (14Storey A. Banks L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 919-924PubMed Google Scholar, 15Liu Z. Ghai J. Ostrow R.S. McGlennen R.C. Faras A.J. Virology. 1994; 201: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Independently of E7 or ras, HPV-16 E6 can transform NIH 3T3 cells (16Sedman S.A. Barbosa M.S. Vass W.C. Hubbert N.L. Haas J.A. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 3269-3279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of E6 in different biological assays implies it may influence diverse cellular pathways.The ability of E6 protein to associate with the cellular tumor suppressor p53 has been suggested as the mechanism by which the viral protein promotes cell growth and proliferation (19Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). Although binding of high risk HPV E6s with p53 appears to be mediated by another cellular protein, E6AP (20Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), direct in vitro association of E6 with p53 has also been observed (21Lechner M.S. Laimins L.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li X. Coffino P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex of E6 and E6AP functions as an ubiquitin-protein ligase that results in the specific ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53 (23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that E6 has functions independent of inactivating p53 in cellular transformation (24Schiller J.T. Vass W.C. Lowy D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar).We have recently identified a cDNA encoding a cellular protein that binds papillomavirus E6 (E6BP or ERC-55) (1Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). E6BP was identified as a calcium-binding protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (37Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of E6BP is consistent with the localization of E6 to nonnuclear membranes (38Androphy E.J. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Science. 1985; 230: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that E6BP interacted specifically with E6 proteins from cancer-related HPV types and the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1). The transforming activity of a set of previously characterized BPV-1 E6 mutants correlated well with their E6BP binding ability. These results suggest that the E6BP interaction plays an important role for BPV-1 E6-induced transformation. More recently, it was reported that BPV-1 E6 associated with paxillin (39Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as well as the trans-Golgi network-specific clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 (40Tong X. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 476-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that E6 proteins from some high risk HPVs interacts with the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein hDlg (41Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 42Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). These observations imply that E6 is capable of interacting with several cellular factors and participates in several pathways.In the present study, we mapped the region of the E6BP that is critical for complex formation with HPV16 E6 and examined the structure of a peptide corresponding to this region by NMR spectroscopy. The amino acid sequence of E6BP predicts homology to EF-hand proteins. The EF-hand coordinates calcium with high specificity. It is named for a helix-loop-helix motif originally found in the crystal structure of parvalbumin and is usually present in two to eight copies arranged in pairs of interacting domains (for review, see Refs. 43Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar and 44Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), although there are some exceptions (45Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W.

Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The prototype calcium binding loop comprises 12 amino acids (D1 X 2N3 X 4D5G6 X 7 X 8–11E12), where a single ligand is contributed to the calcium by each of the side chains of the first, third, and fifth positions in the sequence, one ligand is contributed by the backbone carbonyl of the 7th residue, and another two ligands are provided by the side chain of the 12th residue. In the NMR spectra of EF-hand-containing proteins, the NH of the invariant glycine residue at position 6 is observed to be greatly downfield-shifted (to ~10 ppm) on binding calcium and has been used as a reporter for the formation of a structured helix-loop-helix fragment (48Kay L.E. Forman-Kay J.D. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4324-4333Google Scholar). Different EF-hand motifs bind calcium with a wide range of affinities, with equilibrium dissociation constants from 10−9m to 10−5m. The binding of calcium often causes a conformational change that alters the interaction with target proteins (43Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe high risk HPV E6 proteins are consistently expressed in all HPV-positive cervical carcinomas. E6 is a small protein and is not known to possess intrinsic enzymatic activity. Similar to the oncoproteins of other tumor viruses, E6 is thought to exert multiple functions through interaction with cellular factors. Five proteins have been reported to associate directly with E6: E6AP (1Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), E6BP (1Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), paxillin (39Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), hDlg (41Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 42Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and AP-1 (40Tong X. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 476-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although association with E6AP is believed to be necessary for E6 to target p53 for degradation, interaction with the other proteins, including E6BP, represents a p53-independent property of E6.In the present study, we first mapped the region of the E6BP that is necessary and sufficient for complex formation with HPV16 E6 to a 25-amino acid residue domain. A peptide containing this E6 binding domain was synthesized and shown by NMR spectroscopy to bind calcium and fold into a classical dimeric helix-loop-helix conformation. Subsequently we determined that a smaller peptide of 13 amino acids containing the second α helix of the EF-hand retained the ability to bind E6. Smaller peptides have not been tested yet, so this may not be the minimal interaction domain.Comparison of the α helical E6 binding domain identified in this study with the E6 binding region of E6AP and paxillin revealed strong homology. Alanine replacement mutagenesis studies in E6BP clearly demonstrated the importance of these common amino acids. The greatest effects on E6 binding resulted from substitutions of the hydrophobic amino acids and the negatively charged amino acid on one side of the α helix (Fig. 7 B). Thus E6 can bind proteins bearing the sequence LhXφLs− (see above). Proteins that do not contain this sequence or ones that are not α helical do not bind E6 (Figs. 1 D, and 7 B). For example, in EF-hand 5 there is a proline at the s position of the consensus sequence, which is likely to disrupt the helical structure. In addition, a tryptophan occupies the negatively charged amino acid position of the consensus sequence.EF-hand-containing proteins interact with their target proteins in different ways (43Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In all cases, association is predominantly mediated through hydrophobic residues and is complemented by acidic side chains from the EF-hands interacting with basic amino acid residues of the target molecule. The consensus binding motif contains several hydrophobic residues and one negatively charged residue. We showed that the residues Leu-21, Phe-24, Leu-25, and Asp-27 were critical for E6 binding. The hydrophobic Phe-18 residue, although not essential, may enhance the interaction between E6 and E6 binding domain. Alternatively, it may contribute to dimerization of the domain. We observed that the E6bd domain peptide dimerizes on binding calcium, but the role of this dimerization on interaction with E6 is not understood. Since GST is dimeric, it is likely that the GST fusions to E6BP derivatives used in the binding experiments are also dimeric. The amino acid sequence of E6 itself predicts a pseudodimeric protein (59Ullman C.G. Haris P.I. Galloway D.A. Emery V.C. Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it could be that two E6 binding motifs simultaneously interact with E6. Our future experiments are aimed at examining the conformation of E6bd peptides while bound to E6.Despite bearing EF-hand motifs, the mutational data show that E6BP does not require calcium for binding E6. In addition, we find that the extent of binding is insensitive to the addition of calcium (data not shown). Other EF-hand-containing proteins, such as calmodulin and calcylin, have been observed to interact with some target proteins in the calcium-free state (reviewed in Ref. 43Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The other proteins that bind E6, E6AP, paxillin, and AP-1 have no known calcium binding motifs and are unlikely to bind calcium. We hypothesize that the E6·E6BP complex targets a regulatory protein in a calcium-dependent manner, although that protein has not yet been discovered.The fourth protein that binds E6, hDlg, appears to operate by using a different mechanism (41Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The hDlg protein does not contain the consensus motif. E6 binding has been mapped to interaction between its third PDZ domain and the C-terminal four-amino acid residues of HPV-16 E6. A PDZ domain is a protein recognition surface that recognizes peptides bearing the sequence Xaa-Thr/Ser-Xaa-Val-COO−. Although the C terminus of HPV-16 E6 contains theXTXL motif, BPV-1 E6 does not. Crystallographic analysis of a PDZ domain-peptide complex shows that the target peptide is bound in an extended conformation (60Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The most recently identified E6-binding protein, AP-1, does not contain all elements of the consensus sequence, although the exact region required for interaction has not been defined (40Tong X. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 476-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, based on our observations, we predict that E6AP, E6BP, and paxillin use an α-helical motif to bind E6. Identification of a conserved E6 binding motif provides a basis for structure-based drug design to block HPV-associated malignant transformation.

HPV-16 E6 also cooperates with activated Ras in the transformation and immortalization of baby mouse kidney cells and baby rat kidney cells (14Storey A. Banks L. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 919-924PubMed Google Scholar, 15Liu Z. Ghai J. Ostrow R.S. McGlennen R.C. Faras A.J. Virology. 1994; 201: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Independently of E7 or ras, HPV-16 E6 can transform NIH 3T3 cells (16Sedman S.A. Barbosa M.S. Vass W.C. Hubbert N.L. Haas J.A. Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4860-4866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), immortalize human mammary epithelial cells (17Band V. DeCaprio J. Delmolino L. Kulesa V. Sager R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6671-6676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and induce keratinocyte resistance to calcium and serum-induced differentiation (18Sherman L. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3269-3279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of E6 in different biological assays implies it may influence diverse cellular pathways. The ability of E6 protein to associate with the cellular tumor suppressor p53 has been suggested as the mechanism by which the viral protein promotes cell growth and proliferation (19Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). Although binding of high risk HPV E6s with p53 appears to be mediated by another cellular protein, E6AP (20Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), direct in vitro association of E6 with p53 has also been observed (21Lechner M.S. Laimins L.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Li X. Coffino P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex of E6 and E6AP functions as an ubiquitin-protein ligase that results in the specific ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53 (23Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that E6 has functions independent of inactivating p53 in cellular transformation (24Schiller J.T. Vass W.C. Lowy D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a cDNA encoding a cellular protein that binds papillomavirus E6 (E6BP or ERC-55) (1Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). E6BP was identified as a calcium-binding protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (37Weis K. Griffiths G. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19142-19150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of E6BP is consistent with the localization of E6 to nonnuclear membranes (38Androphy E.J. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Science. 1985; 230: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that E6BP interacted specifically with E6 proteins from cancer-related HPV types and the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1). The transforming activity of a set of previously characterized BPV-1 E6 mutants correlated well with their E6BP binding ability. These results suggest that the E6BP interaction plays an important role for BPV-1 E6-induced transformation. More recently, it was reported that BPV-1 E6 associated with paxillin (39Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as well as the trans-Golgi network-specific clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 (40Tong X. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 476-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that E6 proteins from some high risk HPVs interacts with the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein hDlg (41Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 42Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). These observations imply that E6 is capable of interacting with several cellular factors and participates in several pathways. In the present study, we mapped the region of the E6BP that is critical for complex formation with HPV16 E6 and examined the structure of a peptide corresponding to this region by NMR spectroscopy. The amino acid sequence of E6BP predicts homology to EF-hand proteins. The EF-hand coordinates calcium with high specificity. It is named for a helix-loop-helix motif originally found in the crystal structure of parvalbumin and is usually present in two to eight copies arranged in pairs of interacting domains (for review, see Refs. 43Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar and 44Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), although there are some exceptions (45Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W.

Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The prototype calcium binding loop comprises 12 amino acids (D1 X 2N3 X 4D5G6 X 7 X 8–11E12), where a single ligand is contributed to the calcium by each of the side chains of the first, third, and fifth positions in the sequence, one ligand is contributed by the backbone carbonyl of the 7th residue, and another two ligands are provided by the side chain of the 12th residue. In the NMR spectra of EF-hand-containing proteins, the NH of the invariant glycine residue at position 6 is observed to be greatly downfield-shifted (to ~10 ppm) on binding calcium and has been used as a reporter for the formation of a structured helix-loop-helix fragment (48Kay L.E. Forman-Kay J.D. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4324-4333Google Scholar). Different EF-hand motifs bind calcium with a wide range of affinities, with equilibrium dissociation constants from 10−9m to 10−5m. The binding of calcium often causes a conformational change that alters the interaction with target proteins (43Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONThe high risk HPV E6 proteins are consistently expressed in all HPV-positive cervical carcinomas. E6 is a small protein and is not known to possess intrinsic enzymatic activity. Similar to the oncoproteins of other tumor viruses, E6 is thought to exert multiple functions through interaction with cellular factors. Five proteins have been reported to associate directly with E6: E6AP (1Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), E6BP (1Chen J.J. Reid C.E. Band V. Androphy E.J. Science. 1995; 269: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), paxillin (39Tong X. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4412-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), hDlg (41Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 42Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and AP-1 (40Tong X. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 476-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although association with E6AP is believed to be necessary for E6 to target p53 for degradation, interaction with the other proteins, including E6BP, represents a p53-independent property of E6.In the present study, we first mapped the region of the E6BP that is necessary and sufficient for complex formation with HPV16 E6 to a 25-amino acid residue domain. A peptide containing this E6 binding domain was synthesized and shown by NMR spectroscopy to bind calcium and fold into a classical dimeric helix-loop-helix conformation. Subsequently we determined that a smaller peptide of 13 amino acids containing the second α helix of the EF-hand retained the ability to bind E6. Smaller peptides have not been tested yet, so this may not be the minimal interaction domain.Comparison of the α helical E6 binding domain identified in this study with the E6 binding region of E6AP and paxillin revealed strong homology. Alanine replacement mutagenesis studies in E6BP clearly demonstrated the importance of these common amino acids. The greatest effects on E6 binding resulted from substitutions of the hydrophobic amino acids and the negatively charged amino acid on one side of the α helix (Fig. 7 B). Thus E6 can bind proteins bearing the sequence LhXφLs− (see above). Proteins that do not contain this sequence or ones that are not α helical do not bind E6 (Figs. 1 D, and 7 B). For example, in EF-hand 5 there is a proline at the s position of the consensus sequence, which is likely to disrupt the helical structure. In addition, a tryptophan occupies the negatively charged amino acid position of the consensus sequence.EF-hand-containing proteins interact with their target proteins in different ways (43Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In all cases, association is predominantly mediated through hydrophobic residues and is complemented by acidic side chains from the EF-hands interacting with basic amino acid residues of the target molecule. The consensus binding motif contains several hydrophobic residues and one negatively charged residue. We showed that the residues Leu-21, Phe-24, Leu-25, and Asp-27 were critical for E6 binding. The hydrophobic Phe-18 residue, although not essential, may enhance the interaction between E6 and E6 binding domain. Alternatively, it may contribute to dimerization of the domain. We observed that the E6bd domain peptide dimerizes on binding calcium, but the role of this dimerization on interaction with E6 is not understood. Since GST is dimeric, it is likely that the GST fusions to E6BP derivatives used in the binding experiments are also dimeric. The amino acid sequence of E6 itself predicts a pseudodimeric protein (59Ullman C.G. Haris P.I. Galloway D.A. Emery V.C. Perkins S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it could be that two E6 binding motifs simultaneously interact with E6. Our future experiments are aimed at examining the conformation of E6bd peptides while bound to E6.Despite bearing EF-hand motifs, the mutational data show that E6BP does not require calcium for binding E6. In addition, we find that the extent of binding is insensitive to the addition of calcium (data not shown). Other EF-hand-containing proteins, such as calmodulin and calcylin, have been observed to interact with some target proteins in the calcium-free state (reviewed in Ref. 43Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The other proteins that bind E6, E6AP, paxillin, and AP-1 have no known calcium binding motifs and are unlikely to bind calcium. We hypothesize that the E6·E6BP complex targets a regulatory protein in a calcium-dependent manner, although that protein has not yet been discovered.The fourth protein that binds E6, hDlg, appears to operate by using a different mechanism (41Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The hDlg protein does not contain the consensus motif. E6 binding has been mapped to interaction between its third PDZ domain and the C-terminal four-amino acid residues of HPV-16 E6. A PDZ domain is a protein recognition surface that recognizes peptides bearing the sequence Xaa-Thr/Ser-Xaa-Val-COO−. Although the C terminus of HPV-16 E6 contains theXTXL motif, BPV-1 E6 does not. Crystallographic analysis of a PDZ domain-peptide complex shows that the target peptide is bound in an extended conformation (60Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The most recently identified E6-binding protein, AP-1, does not contain all elements of the consensus sequence, although the exact region required for interaction has not been defined (40Tong X. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 476-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, based on our observations, we predict that E6AP, E6BP, and paxillin use an α-helical motif to bind E6.

https://openalex.org/W2068184020,"Synapsins I and II are synaptic vesicle proteins essential for normal Ca2+ regulation of neurotransmitter release. Synapsins are composed of combinations of common and variable sequences, with the central C-domain as the largest conserved domain. The C-domain is structurally homologous to ATPases, suggesting that synapsins function as ATP-dependent phosphotransfer enzymes. We have now identified an unanticipated third synapsin gene that is also expressed in brain. The product of this gene, synapsin IIIa, shares with synapsins Ia and IIa three conserved domains that are connected by variable sequences: the phosphorylated A-domain at the amino terminus, the large ATP-binding C-domain in the center, and the E-domain at the carboxyl terminus. Like other synapsins, synapsin IIIa binds ATP with high affinity and ADP with a lower affinity, consistent with a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding to the different synapsins is directly regulated by Ca2+ in a dramatically different fashion: Ca2+activates ATP binding to synapsin I, has no effect on synapsin II, and inhibits synapsin III. Thus vertebrates express three distinct synapsins that utilize ATP but are specialized for different modes of direct Ca2+ regulation in synaptic function.

Synapsins are abundant phosphoproteins of synaptic vesicles (1Greengard P. Mol. Neurobiol. 1987; 1: 81-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Two genes for synapsins were described, the synapsin I gene, which produces alternatively spliced transcripts encoding synapsins Ia and Ib, and the synapsin II gene encoding synapsins IIa and IIb (2Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons revealed that synapsins are composed of a mosaic of domains. All synapsins share a short amino-terminal domain (A-domain) that is phosphorylated by CaM kinase I and protein kinase A, a linker sequence (B-domain) that is rich in short-chain amino acids (proline/alanine/glycine/serine), and a large central domain (C-domain) that comprises approximately one-half of the total synapsin sequences. After the C-domain, different combinations of domains are observed (the D-, E-, F-, and G-domains). Interestingly, at the very carboxyl terminus synapsins Ia and IIa contain an additional short common domain of 50 residues (the E-domain) despite distinct sequences between the C- and E-domains (2Südhof T.C.

The E-domain is absent from synapsins Ib and IIb. A synapsin homologue was described in Drosophila in which the C- and E-domains are the only conserved domains, suggesting that these domains are responsible for the function of synapsins (3Klagges B.R.E.

Based on the analysis of mouse knockouts, currently the best defined role of synapsins exists in the regulation of synaptic vesicle function in mature nerve terminals (16Rosahl T.W. Geppert M.

Synapsins I and II are phosphorylated at the amino terminus during stimulation, but the physiological consequences of this phosphorylation are unknown. Synapsins interact with a number of proteins with high affinity and stoichiometry (e.g.actin filaments, neurofilaments, microtubules, calmodulin, spectrin, annexin VI; Refs. 5De Camilli P. Cameron R.

Recently the crystal structure of the C-domain of synapsin I was solved, giving unexpected insights into its function (19Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The structure showed that the C-domain is an independently folding domain that forms a stable dimer. Data bank searches revealed that the C-domain is structurally closely related to five ATP-utilizing enzymes: glutathione synthetase, d-alanine:d-alanine ligase, biotin carboxylase α-chain, succinyl-CoA synthetase β-chain, and pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase. More than 80% of the Cα carbon atoms of the synapsin I C-domain can be superimposed on those of glutathione synthetase ord-alanine:d-alanine ligase with a root mean square deviation of 0.32 nm, suggesting a close structural and evolutionary similarity between these enzymes and synapsins (19Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The enzymes to which synapsin I is structurally related bind ATP and transfer phosphate from bound ATP to a substrate (20Matsuda K. Mizuguchi K. Nishioka T. Kato H. Go N. Oda J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Artymiuk P.J. Poirrette A.R. Rice D.W. Willett P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Synapsins also bind ATP with high affinity and ADP with a lower affinity, suggesting that synapsins also represent phosphotransfer enzymes (19Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,22Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, ATP binding to the C-domains of synapsins I and II was found to be differentially regulated: ATP binding to synapsin I required Ca2+ which was not necessary for ATP binding to synapsin II. We now report that a third unanticipated synapsin gene is expressed in vertebrates. Synapsin IIIa is closely homologous to synapsins Ia and IIa, with the highest similarity observed in the A-, C-, and E-domains. As in the other synapsins, the C-domain of synapsin IIIa binds ATP with high affinity. Different from synapsins I and II, however, Ca2+ inhibits ATP binding to synapsin IIIa at micromolar concentrations. As a consequence, Ca2+ has distinct regulatory effects on the three synapsins: it activates ATP binding in synapsin I, the most abundant synapsin; it is without effect with synapsin II; and it inhibits ATP binding to synapsin IIIa, the least abundant synapsin. Our data suggest an unexpectedly direct and diverse regulatory role of Ca2+ in a family of synaptic vesicle phosphoproteins. Data bank searches with the rat synapsin I and II sequences (2Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P.

A 0.24-kilobase fragment of the corresponding cDNA was cloned by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EST, expressed sequence tags; ATPγ35S, adenosine 5′-[35S](γ-thio)triphosphate.from human first-strand brain cDNA (obtained fromCLONTECH) and used as a probe for screening rat brain cDNA libraries (2Südhof T.C.

Multiple overlapping clones were isolated and sequenced. Data bank analyses were performed using DNA-Star and BLAST softwares. The synapsin III sequence was submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AF056704). RNA blotting experiments were performed using multiple rat tissue blots obtained fromCLONTECH and a rat synapsin III probe corresponding to amino acid residues 440–526. Synapsin expression vectors in pGEX-KG (24Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) with C-domain sequences were obtained by PCR with oligonucleotide primers containing flanking restriction sites essentially as described (22Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The following pGEX constructs were used in the current study: pGEXrSynI-C (residues 110–420 of rat synapsin I), pGEXrSynII-C (residues 113–421 of rat synapsin II), and pGEXrSynIII-C (residues 89–399 of rat synapsin III), together with control plasmids described previously (22Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins were purified using standard techniques, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining, and quantified using known amounts of bovine serum albumin examined on the same gel. Purified GST-fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were washed 3× with buffer A (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl) containing either 2 mm EGTA ± 2.1 mm calcium or 2 mm EDTA. Aliquots of the beads (5 pmol of recombinant protein) were used in 0.1-ml binding assays containing buffer A with 10 nm ATPγ35S and the indicated addition of nucleotides, Ca2+, Mg2+, and/or chelator. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, beads were washed 3× in the incubation buffer without ATPγ35S, and the radioactivity bound to the beads was determined by scintillation counting. For determination of the Ca2+ concentration dependence of ATP binding, Ca2+/EGTA buffers were used. Binding assays were performed essentially as described above except that all steps were performed in 75 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, and 4 mm EGTA. The concentration of free Ca2+ was calculated using the Chelator program. Data bank searches with synapsin sequences uncovered exonic sequences from a novel, unidentified synapsin gene on chromosome 22. These sequences were highly homologous to those of synapsins I and II and exhibited the same exon-intron structure as the synapsin I gene (23Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7849-7852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, two reasons led us to conclude that the chromosome 22 gene encodes a novel gene, named here synapsin III. Firstly, its predicted sequences differ at several positions from the human synapsin I and II sequences, and secondly the human genes for synapsins I and II map to the X-chromosome and to chromosome 3, respectively, whereas the new gene was localized on chromosome 22. The synapsin III exons were distributed over four distinct cosmids (N104C7, N80H12, E86D10, and N28H9), suggesting that the synapsin III gene is very large. We were unable to assemble a complete sequence for synapsin III from the cosmids and found no ESTs corresponding to synapsin III in the EST data banks. Therefore we were uncertain whether the synapsin III gene corresponds to an expressed gene or a pseudogene. To address this, we searched for a processed synapsin III transcript by PCR using human brain cDNA. We obtained a single major PCR product with a sequence predicted from the synapsin III gene, demonstrating that synapsin III is indeed an expressed gene (data not shown). We then used the PCR product to isolate rat cDNA clones encoding synapsin III from a brain cDNA library and isolated multiple overlapping cDNA clones that allowed us to assemble a complete synapsin III sequence that is similar to the “a” variants of synapsins I and II (Fig. 1). Alignment of the synapsin Ia, IIa, and IIIa sequences reveals a similar domain organization in all three synapsins. The sequence of the amino-terminal A-domain is nearly identical between synapsins and includes a phosphorylation site for CaM kinase I/cAMP-dependent protein kinase in all synapsins (arrow in Fig. 1). The B-domain that follows the A-domain is a less well conserved domain rich in prolines, glutamines, serines, and alanines. The central C-domain is the largest domain in all synapsins (308 residues) and highly conserved (62% invariant residues between all three synapsins). Following the C-domain, all synapsins again have a poorly conserved domain that is rich in prolines, glutamines, and alanines. This domain contains phosphorylation sites for multiple protein kinases in synapsin I. The phosphorylation sites are not conserved in the other synapsins, although it is possible that synapsin IIIa will also be a substrate for CaM kinase II (see arrows in Fig. 1). At the carboxyl terminus, synapsins Ia, IIa, and IIIa again have a highly homologous domain, the E-domain, that is absent from synapsins Ib and IIb. The E-domain consists of two blocks of conserved sequences separated by a short proline-rich loop. Overall, the sequence alignment reveals a common architecture for synapsins Ia, IIa, and IIIa. A large central conserved domain (the C-domain) is flanked by small amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains that are also very homologous. These conserved domains are connected to each other by linker sequences rich in prolines, glutamines, alanines, serines, and glycines, short side-chain amino acids characteristic of non-structured protein regions. Together with the crystallographic data characterizing the C-domain as an independently folding dimeric module, these data suggest that the central C-domain of synapsins is linked to the two other domains by flexible loops. To test which tissues express synapsin IIIa, an RNA blot was probed with a specific probe. A single band corresponding to the right size was detected in brain, indicating that synapsin IIIa is expressed primarily in brain similar to other synapsins (Fig. 2). The crystal structure of the C-domain of synapsin I and biochemical studies with the C-domains of synapsins I and II revealed that the C-domain constitutes an ATP-binding module related to several ATPases with functions as phosphotransfer enzymes (19Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The C-domain of synapsin III is highly homologous to that of the other synapsins, and most of the residues involved in ATP binding are conserved. This suggests that synapsin III may also be an ATP-utilizing protein. To test this, we measured ATPγ35S binding to the recombinant C-domain of synapsin III. ATPγ35S bound specifically and was displaced by ATP and, to a lesser degree, GTP (data not shown). To test the relative affinity of ATP and ADP, we performed displacement titrations of bound ATPγ35S with cold ATP or ADP. The half-maximal concentrations needed for competition were approximately 0.5 μm ATP and 12 μm ADP (Fig.3), suggesting that as in other synapsins, ATP is bound much more tightly than ADP. The half-maximal displacement concentrations indicate that synapsin III is a high-affinity ATP-binding protein, although its ATP affinity is slightly lower than that of the other synapsins. The difference in affinity for ATP and ADP are consistent with a catalytic role of the C-domain in which ADP would be dissociated by cellular ATP after bound ATP was hydrolyzed. A catalytic role as an enzyme of unknown specificity for synapsin III is also supported by the fact that the sequence in synapsins that corresponds to the catalytic loop in the structurally related enzymes is highly conserved, including the position of a catalytically active lysine residue (underlined in Fig. 1). Previous studies showed that ATPγS binding to the C-domain of synapsin I or to full-length synapsin I required Ca2+ whereas binding was Ca2+-independent for synapsin II (22Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Ca2+ inhibited ATPγS binding to the C-domain of synapsin III despite its high degree of sequence homology to synapsins I and II and despite their similar ATP affinity (data not shown). The inhibition of ATPγS binding to synapsin III was not an artifact caused by Ca2+-triggered proteolysis because analysis of proteins after the ATP incubations showed that Ca2+ did not change the amount of protein left (data not shown). These data suggest that despite their close similarity, synapsins I, II, and III are specialized for different types of synaptic regulation. Synapsin I is activated by Ca2+, synapsin II is not affected by Ca2+, and synapsin III is inhibited by Ca2+. To test whether the regulation of synapsins by Ca2+occurred at physiologically meaningful concentrations, we measured the Ca2+ concentration dependence of ATPγS binding (Fig.4). All three synapsin C-domains were compared in the same experiment. Ca2+ had no effect on ATP binding to synapsin II but regulated ATP binding to synapsins I and III with Ca2+ concentration dependences that were mirror image patterns. Whereas Ca2+-activated ATP binding to synapsin I with a half-maximal activation concentration (EC50) of ≈2 μm free Ca2+, it inhibited ATP binding to synapsin III with an almost identical EC50 of ≈3 μm free Ca2+. These data demonstrate that synapsins are similar to each other in structure and ATP binding but diverge dramatically in regulation. Synapsins I and II are abundant peripheral membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles that are phosphorylated in nerve terminals (reviewed in Refs. 1Greengard P. Mol. Neurobiol. 1987; 1: 81-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and 25Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Although synapsins bind to a number of proteins, the physiological functions of synapsins are unclear. Knockouts revealed that synapsins are essential for synaptic regulation but are not required for the establishment of synapses, clustering of vesicles, or long term synaptic plasticity (16Rosahl T.W. Geppert M. Spillane D. Herz J. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the C-domain of synapsin I uncovered an unexpected structural homology to a special class of ATPases (19Esser L. Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These ATPases transfer active phosphates to substrates and mediate ligations or syntheses of small molecules. In agreement with the possibility that synapsins belong to these ATPases, the C-domains of synapsins I and II bind ATP and, with much lower affinity, ADP. In addition, the flexible loop in the ATPases that is catalytically active is conserved in synapsins. The current study describes data suggesting that the function of synapsins in nerve terminal regulation may be more complex and interesting than previously envisioned. With the discovery of synapsin III, we now show that the synapsin family is larger than anticipated. The sequence of synapsin III allowed a further definition of the domain structure of synapsins, reinforcing and refining the previous model (2Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Wagner M. Kanazir S.D. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment confirms the role of the central C-domain of synapsins as their largest, conserved domain that presumably carries the activity of the protein. All C-domains of synapsins constitute high affinity ATP-binding modules that may function as phosphotransfer enzymes. In addition, the alignment demonstrates that the amino-terminal phosphorylation domain (the A-domain) is a fixture in synapsins. The fact that this phosphorylation domain is so highly conserved makes the necessity to elucidate the physiological importance of the amino-terminal phosphorylation site even more important. Finally, the structure also confirms the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain (the E-domain) as a constant part of synapsins, again of unknown function. The sequence alignment also highlights the high content of proline, glutamine, serine, and alanine residues in the two variable regions linking the three conserved domains. These variable regions are not conserved between synapsins, and the phosphorylation sites in synapsin I in these sequences are also not conserved. Nevertheless, these variable sequences are characterized by similar amino acid compositions in all synapsins. Our most surprising result, however, was the divergence in Ca2+ regulation of synapsins. Analysis of the synapsin I and II knockouts suggested a physiological role for synapsins in short term regulation of neurotransmitter release which is Ca2+-dependent (16Rosahl T.W. Geppert M. Spillane D. Herz J. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Therefore a direct regulation of synapsins by Ca2+ would agree very well with their essential functions. However, the fact that the three synapsins, despite their high homology and similar ATP affinity, are differentially regulated was unexpected. Synapsin I is Ca2+-activated, synapsin II Ca2+ independent, and synapsin III Ca2+-inhibited. For synapsins I and III, Ca2+ acts at concentrations that are similar and physiologically relevant. These data suggest that whatever the enzymatic function may be that is being performed by synapsins in nerve terminals, this function responds differently to increases in nerve terminal Ca2+ during an action potential. Such a difference in Ca2+ regulation for members of a closely related family of proteins is unprecedented and suggests that the three synapsin isoforms specifically evolved to allow different types of synaptic Ca2+ regulation.

Cholinephosphotransferase catalyzes the transfer of phosphocholine from CDP-choline to diacylglycerol (DAG) 1The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdGro, phosphatidylglycerol; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, poly- acrylamide gel electrophoresis; CPT1, cholinephosphotransferase gene of S. cerevisiae; Cpt1p, cholinephosphotransferase protein of S. cerevisiae;EPT1, ethanolaminephosphotransferase gene of S. cerevisiae.1The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdGro, phosphatidylglycerol; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, poly- acrylamide gel electrophoresis; CPT1, cholinephosphotransferase gene of S. cerevisiae; Cpt1p, cholinephosphotransferase protein of S. cerevisiae;EPT1, ethanolaminephosphotransferase gene of S. cerevisiae. thus forming phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and CMP. As the final step of the Kennedy pathway (1Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Weiss S.B. Smith S.W. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cholinephosphotransferase identifies both the site ofde novo PtdCho synthesis as well as the site from which PtdCho is transported to other organelles within the cell or assembled with proteins and other lipids for export from the cell during the genesis of lung surfactant, bile, and lipoproteins (3Rooney S.A.

Two genes coding for cholinephosphotransferase activities exist inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, CPT1, which encodes a cholinephosphotransferase (6Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1755-1764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and EPT1, which codes for a dual specificity choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase (7Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5094-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, Cpt1p and Ept1p contribute equally to measurable cholinephosphotransferase activity (8Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4357-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, in vivometabolic labeling analysis revealed that Cpt1p is responsible for 95% of the PtdCho-synthesizing cholinephosphotransferase activity with Ept1p contributing the final 5% (9McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28010-28016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both CPT1 andEPT1 predict proteins containing seven membrane spanning domains. The integral membrane bound nature of cholinephosphotransferase has prevented its purification from any source and has precluded the use of many standard structure/function approaches for analyzing S. cerevisiae Cpt1p and Ept1p enzymes. However, the uninterrupted similarity in predicted secondary structures and corresponding nucleic acid sequences allowed for the construction of a series of CPT1/EPT1-encoded chimeric enzymes (10Hjelmstad R.H. Morash S.A. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20995-21002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11McMaster C.R. Morash S.C. Bell R.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The difference in CDP-alcohol specificity between the parental Cpt1p and Ept1p enzymes was exploited to delineate the CDP-choline binding site. A region encompassing the first soluble loop, residues 79–186 of Cpt1p, was pinpointed. Data base searches for known proteins with homology to the CDP-choline binding region of Cpt1p identified sequences within: S. cerevisiaeethanolaminephosphotransferase (EPT1) (7Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5094-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) synthase (PIS1) (12Nikawa J. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each of these enzymes catalyzes the synthesis of a phospholipid by the displacement of CMP from a CDP-alcohol by a second alcohol to form a phosphoester bond. Alignment of the sequences within each of the above enzymes revealed a completely conserved motif, Asp-Gly-(X)2-Ala-Arg-(X)8-Gly-(X)3-Asp-(X)3-Asp, termed the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif. Data base searches revealed this motif was specific to the above enzymes and hence is predicted to be diagnostic for the reaction type catalyzed by each. To lend credence to this prediction, and to provide insight into catalytic mechanism, scanning alanine mutagenesis of the conserved residues within the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif of S. cerevisiae cholinephosphotransferase (CPT1) was performed. [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [methyl-14C]choline were products of NEN Life Science Products. [methyl-14C]CDP-choline was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Custom oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Dideoxy sequencing was performed utilizing the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Triton X-100 was purchased from Pierce. Hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Plasmid pRH150 (6Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

The T4 DNA polymerase-directed MORPH plasmid DNA mutagenesis protocol (5′ → 3′) was used with the appropriate mutagenic oligonucleotides (TableI) as directed by the manufacturer. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

HJ091 is devoid of detectable cholinephosphotransferase activity (10Hjelmstad R.H. Morash S.A. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20995-21002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11McMaster C.R. Morash S.C. Bell R.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes were prepared from HJ091 grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase in synthetic dextrose media containing the appropriate nutritional supplements to ensure plasmid maintenance (19Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Cholinephosphotransferase activity was assessed using 20 mmMgCl2 as cation cofactor, 10 mol % PtdCho (egg) as phospholipid cofactor, and 10 mol % dipalmitoleoylglycerol (di16:1DAG) and 500 μm [14C]CDP-choline (500–4000 dpm/nmol as dictated by the sensitivity required) as substrates in a Triton X-100 mixed micelle assay as described (9McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28010-28016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strain HJ091 ± parental and mutagenized plasmids were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic dextrose media containing the appropriate nutritional supplements. [14C]Choline (20 μm, 1 × 105 dpm/nmol) was added to the cultures for 30 min. Yeast cells were concentrated by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold water, and resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (1/1, v/v). Cells were disrupted using a BioSpec multibead beater containing 0.5 g of 0.5-mm acid washed glass beads on the homogenize setting for 1 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with CHCl3/CH3OH (2/1, v/v). A sample was removed from the total homogenate for determination of total choline uptake. To facilitate phase separation, water and CHCl3 were added to the remaining homogenate. Phospholipids in the organic phase were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on Whatman silica gel 60A plates using the solvent system CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H20 (70/30/4/2, v/v). PtdCho was the only radiolabeled lipid detected. Aqueous metabolites were concentrated under vacuum, resuspended in H2O, and separated by thin layer chromatography on Whatman silica gel 60A plates in a solvent system consisting of CH3OH/0.6% NaCl/NH4OH (50/50/5, v/v). Choline, phosphocholine, and CDP-choline were the only radioactive metabolites detected. Radiolabel was detected using a Bioscan System 200 imaging scanner and the radioactive bands were scraped into vials and subjected to scintillation counting. The CPT1 gene and site-directed mutants were subcloned from YEp352 (URA3, 2 μ ori] to pRS426 [URA3, 2 μ ori] to facilitate the elimination of a HindIII site within the multicloning site. A 3× repeat of the HA epitope was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid pGTEP (gift from Stephen Garrett, Duke University Medical Center) withHindIII sites added to the ends of each primer. The amplified 3× HA epitope was subcloned into a unique HindIII site within the CPT1 coding region corresponding to amino acids Tyr28 and Leu29. The insert was sequenced to ensure polymerase frame and fidelity. HJ091 cells were transformed with the constructs and microsomal membranes were isolated. Identical (10 μg) amounts of microsomal protein were incubated with equal volumes of 2 × SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS (w/v), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.05% bromphenol blue (w/v)) at 37 °C for 20 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel, 12.5% resolving gel), and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane utilizing the Bio-Rad minigel transfer apparatus at 30 volts for 18 h in 48 mm Tris, 30 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, 20% methanol (v/v) transfer buffer. The membrane was: blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% skim milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h; washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20; incubated for 1 h in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 with HA mAb (1:2,000); washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20; incubated for 1 h in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 with goat anti-mouse Ab coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000); washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20; and signal was detected using the ECL (Amersham) method as per the manufacturer's instructions. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. DAG was prepared from PtdCho by phospholipase C digestion, and yield was estimated using the method of Stern and Shapiro (21Stern I. Shapiro B. J. Clin. Pathol. 1953; 6: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Phospholipid phosphorus was determined by the method of Ames and Dubin (22Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scanning alanine site-directed mutagenesis of the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif (Asp113-Gly114-(X)2-Ala117-Arg118-(X)8-Gly127-(X)3-Asp131-(X)3-Asp135, the one Ala residue was converted to Gly) of S. cerevisiaeCpt1p was performed to lend credence to the prediction that this motif is diagnostic for the reaction type catalyzed by this class of enzymes, which also includes: S. cerevisiaeethanolaminephosphotransferase (EPT1) (7Hjelmstad R.H.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif of Cpt1p was chosen as the target motif for several reasons: (i) a well established mixed micelle assay exists enabling kinetic analysis of enzyme activity (8Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4357-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hjelmstad R.H. Morash S.A. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

TheCPT1 gene was carried on the high copy plasmid YEp352 and was used for all mutagenesis and expression experiments.CPT1 is utilizing its own promoter in all analyses. Mutagenesis of each Ala residue was represented by the preferred GCT codon to ensure against codon bias during mRNA translation (25Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3026-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific enzyme activities were determined using a Triton X-100 based mixed micelle assay (8Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Conversion of Asp113 to Ala did not appreciably effect enzyme activity; however, Ala117 to Gly, and Arg118 to Ala replacements decreased activity to 17.8% and 10.1% wild type levels. Separate conversion of Gly114 to Ala as well as each of the final three amino acids within the motif, Gly127, Asp131, and Asp135, to Ala eliminated detectable cholinephosphotransferase activity. Increasing the sensitivity of the assay by increasing the specific radioactivity of the substrate 8-fold coupled with 4-fold additional protein, a 32-fold total increase in activity detectability over standard assay conditions, did not result in radiolabeled PtdCho production, indicating these mutations effectively eliminated enzyme activity.Table IICholinephosphotransferase activity of Cpt1p CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif mutantsCpt1p mutationEnzyme activity2-aMean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate.nmol/min/mgWild type6.021 + 0.334Asp113 → Ala5.802 + 0.271Gly114→ AlaUndetectable2-bIncrease in specific radioactivity of 8-fold coupled with the addition of 4-fold excess protein over standard assay conditions did not reveal detectable activity.Ala117 → Gly1.022 + 0.168Arg118 → Ala0.576 + 0.072Gly127→ AlaUndetectableAsp131 → AlaUndetectableAsp135 → AlaUndetectableEnzyme activities were determined in the microsomal membrane fraction of strain HJ091 (cpt1::LEU2 ept1) harboring the high copy plasmid pRH150[CPT1] containing the indicated point mutations using the mixed micelle assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-a Mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments performed in duplicate.2-b Increase in specific radioactivity of 8-fold coupled with the addition of 4-fold excess protein over standard assay conditions did not reveal detectable activity.

Since the rate-limiting step for PtdCho synthesis is normally at the level of phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, alterations in cholinephosphotransferase activity do not generally affect the ability of cells to incorporate radiolabeled choline into PtdCho (9McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28010-28016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

V., Amsterdam1996: 153-182Google Scholar, 27Cornell R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, the metabolic labeling protocol is much more sensitive than the in vitro enzyme assay and does not rely on the ability of the various mutant enzymes to survive cell disruption and subcellular fractionation and hence provides a second level of confidence for determining if mutants with undetectable cholinephosphotransferase activity in vitro are indeed devoid of enzyme activity. The enzymatically active Asp113 to Ala, Ala117 to Gly, and Arg118 to Ala mutants incorporated labeled choline into PtdCho at a level similar to that of cells carrying the parental Cpt1p protein. The Gly114 to Ala, Gly127 to Ala, Asp131 to Ala, and Asp135 to Ala mutants, each of which was inactive in vitro, were unable to incorporate radiolabeled choline into PtdCho (Fig. 2 B). In agreement with a metabolic block at the level of cholinephosphotransferase in theS. cerevisiae cells used in this study (cpt1::LEU2 ept1 −), this yeast strain (and each of the inactive Cpt1p mutants) accumulated CDP-choline (Fig.2 C), while the wild type cells (and each of the mutants with detectable cholinephosphotransferase activity in vitro) did not accumulate CDP-choline due to its successful conversion to PtdCho (Fig. 2, B and C). As a first step in determining catalytic mechanism for cholinephosphotransferase, a kinetic analysis of each of the enzymatically active mutants was performed and compared with the parental enzyme. The mixed micelle assay employed revealed saturation kinetics for both substrates when the other was in excess (data not shown) implying surface dilution of the lipophilic substrate DAG occurs within the mixed micelle and hence the kinetic parameters reported here are reflective of true values. Assay buffer contained 500 μm CDP-choline and 10 mol % di16:1 DAG, and under these conditions wild type Cpt1p displayed an apparent K mof 66 μm for CDP-choline and 1.75 mol % for DAG (TablesIII and IV). Previous measurements of these same parameters for Cpt1p revealed apparent K mvalues of 110 μm and 8.0 mol % for CDP-choline and DAG, respectively (8Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4357-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the values obtained in the current study are predicted to be more accurate, since the DAG substrate used in the former study (8Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4357-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was di18:1 DAG, and it has since been discovered that di16:1 DAG is the preferred substrate for Cpt1p (10Hjelmstad R.H. Morash S.A. McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20995-21002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, di18:1 DAG is insoluble at concentrations above 10 mol % in the mixed micelle assay employed in both studies and hence was previously used at suboptimal levels for the accurate measurement of kinetic parameters. Di16:1 DAG does not present this problem as it is soluble up to 20 mol %. The measured apparent K m value of 1.75 mol % for di16:1 DAG is 5.7-fold lower than the concentration of di16:1 DAG (10 mol %) utilized in this study.Table IIIEffect of CDP-choline on the kinetics of Cpt1p CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif mutantsCpt1p mutationK m(app)V max (app)μmnmol min−1 mg−1Wild type666.24Asp113 → Ala556.48Ala117 → Gly1661.01Arg118 → Ala2490.60 Open table in a new tab Table IVEffect of diacylglycerol on the kinetics of Cpt1p CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif mutantsCpt1p MutationK m(app)V max (app)mol %nmol min−1 mg−1Wild type1.756.13Asp113 → Ala2.286.64Ala117 → Gly4.891.21Arg118 → Ala5.380.55 Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were also determined for the three mutants, Asp113 to Ala, Ala117 to Gly, and Arg118 to Ala, that possessed cholinephosphotransferase activity. The Asp113 to Ala mutant displayed specific activity and kinetic values similar to those of the parental enzyme with apparent K m values of 55 μm for CDP-choline and 2.28 mol % for DAG (Tables III and IV). Specific enzyme activity measured for Ala117 to Gly and Arg118 to Ala decreased from wild type levels of 6.021 nmol min−1 mg−1 down to 1.022 nmol min−1 mg−1 and 0.576 nmol min−1mg−1, respectively (Table II). The Ala117 to Gly mutation increased the apparent K m for CDP-choline 2.5-fold and for DAG 2.8-fold over those of the parental enzyme. The Arg118 to Ala mutation resulted in increased apparent K m values of 3.8-fold for CDP-choline and 3.1-fold for DAG. Predicted V max values were 1.01 and 1.21 nmol min−1 mg−1 for the Ala117 to Gly mutant, and 0.60 and 0.55 nmol min−1 mg−1 for the Arg118 to Ala mutant (Tables III and IV). In this study, parental and mutantCPT1 genes were expressed from high copy (URA3, 2 μ ori) plasmids using the endogenous CPT1 promoter. Western blot analysis was performed to ensure that the various mutations created within Cpt1p (with activities significantly different from wild type) were not affecting Cpt1p levels. A 3× repeat of the HA epitope was inserted into the coding region of the parental and site-directed mutant genes at a site between amino acids Tyr28 and Leu29. Plasmids were transformed into HJ091 cells and microsomal membrane proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using mAb specific for the HA epitope (Fig.3). The HA mAb recognized a protein of the expected size for Cpt1p+3× HA epitope (49 kDa) that was absent in cells expressing Cpt1p that did not contain the 3× HA epitope, demonstrating that the mAb was specific for epitope tagged Cpt1p proteins (the increased size of Ala117 is a function of the cloning strategy utilized that resulted in a 6× insertion of the HA epitope). Parental and mutant Cpt1p proteins Ala117 to Gly, Arg118 to Ala, Gly127 to Ala, Asp131 to Ala, and Asp135 to Ala were present in similar amounts (Fig. 3) confirming that the decreased cholinephosphotransferase enzyme activity associated with the amino acid substitutions of these residues was due to altered kinetic properties of the mutant proteins and not due to decreased protein levels. No Cpt1p protein was detected for the Gly114 to Ala mutant, indicating that the absence of cholinephosphotransferase activity associated with this amino acid substitution was due to increased protein lability. Scanning alanine site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved amino acid residues within the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif (Asp113-Gly114-(X)2-Ala117-Arg118-(X)8-Gly127-(X)3-Asp131-(X)3-Asp135) of S. cerevisiae cholinephosphotransferase was performed to lend credence to the prediction that this motif is diagnostic for the reaction catalyzed and to provide the first molecular investigation of the catalytic mechanism used by this class of enzymes which to date include: S. cerevisiae cholinephosphotransferase, ethanolaminephosphotransferase, PtdSer synthase, PtdIns synthase, prokaryotic PtdSer synthases, PtdGro phosphate synthases, and rat PtdIns synthase. Each of these enzymes catalyzes the formation of a phospholipid via the displacement of CMP from a CDP-alcohol by a second alcohol with concomitant formation of a phosphoester bond. The ability of each mutant to catalyze the cholinephosphotransferase reaction was assessed in vitro using a mixed micelle enzyme assay andin vivo by determining the capacity of each mutant to incorporate radiolabeled choline into PtdCho in a S. cerevisiae strain containing null mutations in its cholinephosphotransferase genes. One mutant, Asp113 to Ala, displayed wild type characteristics both in vitro and in vivo. This is intriguing in that this, the first Asp residue within the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif, is completely conserved over a wide range of species and hence has not drifted evolutionarily implying it is essential; however, its function is not apparent from the above analyses. Two mutants, A117 to G and R118 to A, displayed reduced in vitro catalytic activity due to 5.0–10.4-fold decreased V max(app) and 2.5–3.8-fold increased K m(app) values for both CDP-choline and DAG. These results imply Ala117 and Arg118 play a role in substrate binding or positioning with Arg118 predicted to be coordinated with one of the phosphate groups within the CDP-alcohol. Interestingly, in vivo the Ala117 to Gly and Arg118 to Ala mutants incorporated radiolabeled choline into PtdCho in cholinephosphotransferase null cells at levels similar to that of the parental enzyme. These data support two further conclusions: (i) the concentration of both CDP-choline and DAG at the intracellular site of cholinephosphotransferase must be sufficient to overcome the increase in K m(app) demonstrated by the Ala117 to Gly and Arg118 to Ala mutants, and (ii) cholinephosphotransferase is not rate-limiting, since large decreases in V max(app) did not affect the level with which labeled choline was incorporated into PtdCho. The latter conclusion is consistent with many other metabolic studies (24McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14776-14783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1996: 153-182Google Scholar). Mutations at Gly114, Gly127, Asp131, and Asp135, completely ablated detectable activity bothin vitro and in vivo. The absence of cholinephosphotransferase activity in cells expressing Cpt1p carrying a Gly114 to Ala substitution correlated with an absence of detectable protein, indicating this residue is required for protein stability or folding. Since Gly residues do not possess a functional group, the lack of activity in the Gly127 to Ala mutant suggests a steric role within the active site. The elimination of cholinephosphotransferase activity by mutating either Asp131 or Asp135 (the last two residues within the motif) to Ala implies one of these is the catalytic residue. Several members of the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif family of enzymes have been subjected to kinetic analyses; pure enzyme preparations of S. cerevisiae PtdSer synthase and E. coli PtdGro phosphate synthase, as well as microsomal mammalian cholinephosphotransferase, predicted sequential bi-bi reaction mechanisms (28Pontoni G.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An in depth kinetic analysis of purified E. coli PtdGro phosphate synthase was consistent with a reaction mechanism that did not utilize an enzyme bound intermediate. A general acid-catalyzed reaction utilizing an Asp residue at its catalytic center would favor an enzyme bound intermediate, while a general base reaction would not, hence, CDP-alcohol phosphotransferases most likely utilize general base catalysis via nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the free alcohol directly on the phosphoester bond of the CDP-alcohol through one of the final two Asp residues within the motif without passing through an enzyme-bound intermediate. From the above results it is clear that the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif, Asp-Gly-(X)2-Ala-Arg-(X)8-Gly-(X)3-Asp(X)3-Asp, is diagnostic for the reaction catalyzed. However, it should be noted that this motif is not essential for this reaction type. E. coli PtdSer synthase catalyzes the formation of PtdSer via formation of a phosphoester bond utilizing CDP-DAG and serine as substrates with subsequent release of CMP in a manner similar to that of the Bacillus subtilus and S. cerevisiae PtdSer synthases (31Raetz C.R.H.

The latter two possess the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif while the E. coli enzyme possesses a separate motif, HxK(U)4D(X)4UUGO, that also appears capable of the formation of the identical phosphoester bond (34Koonin E.V. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 242-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 35Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This second motif is also found in prokaryotic cardiolipin synthase, as well as enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a phosphoester bond including phospholipase D and some nucleases. Studies of E. coli and S. cerevisiae PtdSer synthases provide two further lines of evidence that are consistent with two distinct motifs catalyzing the same reaction via different mechanisms: (i) kinetic analysis of E. coli PtdSer synthase predicted a ping-pong reaction type that utilized an enzyme-bound intermediate (31Raetz C.R.H.

This study is the first molecular characterization of a CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif and results indicate the motif plays an intimate role in catalysis. Several lines of evidence point to this conclusion: (i) the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif is completely conserved in enzymes that catalyze the same reaction type; (ii) the conservation is observed across a wide range evolutionary range implying the preserved residues are essential for enzyme function; (iii) FASTAPAT and Motif searches of nonredundant data bases revealed only the above enzymes indicating its specificity; (iv) mutations within specific residues of the S. cerevisiaecholinephosphotransferase CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif abolish or reduce activity. The integral membrane-bound nature of all of the members of the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif enzymes has precluded their purification from most sources, including any mammalian cell type, thus many of their respective cDNAs have yet to be isolated. The verification of a conserved motif diagnostic for the reaction type catalyzed by each of these enzymes will allow for the rapid identification of cDNAs coding for these proteins from expressed sequence tag data bases. These new molecular tools will allow for a precise dissection of the many biological and pathophysiological roles currently postulated for each of these enzymes.

The nature of the SLPI-polysaccharide interaction, explored with affinity chromatography, indicated that this interaction was sensitive to the charge and type of polysaccharide. Dextran and chondroitin had the lowest affinity for SLPI, followed by dermatan, heparan, and dextran sulfates.

Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine the thermodynamics of SLPI interaction with a low molecular weight heparin, an undersulfated decasaccharide and a tetrasaccharide.

Biochem. 1993; 218: 951-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The biological function of SLPI is believed to be the inhibition of elastase, cathepsin G, and other proteases, thereby protecting tissue from self-degradation by these enzymes (2Gruetter M.G.

SLPI is composed of two homologous domains and contains many positively charged amino acid residues (15 lysine and 5 arginine residues) (2Gruetter M.G. Fendrich G. Huber R. Bode W EMBO J. 1988; 7: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is within clusters of these positively charged amino acid residues that the heparin polyanion probably interacts (5Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M.

On isolation and purification from tissue, such as lung, heparin is released from its protein core and isolated as a GAG. GAG heparin is a polydisperse, highly sulfated, linear polysaccharide comprised of repeating 1→4 linked uronic acid and glucosamine residues, with a molecular weight range of 5,000–40,000 and an average molecular weight (M r(avg)) of 14,000 (9Linhardt R.J.

While it has as many as 10 different saccharide residues that comprise its sequence, not all sequences are biosynthetically favored. The major sequence in heparin is →4)-α-l-IdoAp2S(1→4)-α-d-GlcNpS6S(1→ (where IdoAp is idopyranosyluronic acid, GlcNp is 2-amino-2-deoxyglucopyranose and S is sulfate) comprising from 75 to 90% of its structure (Fig. 1) (9Linhardt R.J.

Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin has an M r(avg) ~5,000 and is prepared from heparin by chemical or enzymatic treatment as a clinical antithrombotic agent (11Pineo G.F. Hull R.D Annu. Rev.

Homogeneous heparin oligosaccharides, ranging in molecular weight from 665 to 4655, have also been prepared from heparin using heparin lyase I (12Linhardt R.J. Varki A.

Frommherz K. Bieth J.G Arzneim. Forsch. Drug. Res. 1992; 73: 503-508Google Scholar). Heparin also increases inhibition of chymotrypsin by SLPI (14Mellet P. Ermolieff J. Bieth J.G Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recent studies by Ying et al. (15Ying Q.-L. Kemme M. Saunders D. Simon S.R Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L533-L541PubMed Google Scholar) showed that heparin could restore the elastase inhibition by SLPI after the inactivation of SLPI through the oxidation of a critical methionine residue. Faller et al. (16Faller B. Mely Y. Gerard D. Bieth J.G Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8285-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have shown that SLPI interacts with heparin through seven ion pair interactions and have inferred that 85% of the binding energy is electrostatic in nature.We report the further characterization of the interaction between SLPI and heparin by using affinity chromatography. Heparin-derived oligosaccharides with high affinity for SLPI were isolated and their structure identified. The interaction of heparin and heparin-derived oligosaccharides with SLPI was assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (17Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J.M.

Finally, thein vivo activation of SLPI by heparin was studied using a sheep bronchoprovocation model for late asthmatic response (19Abraham W.M. Reedam D.

Birkhauser Verlag, Basil, Switzerland1996: 171-189Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPorcine heparin (M r(avg) 14,000), low molecular weight heparin (M r(avg) 4,800), and heparan sulfate (M r(avg) 11,000) were obtained from Celsus Laboratories (Cincinnati, OH). Chondroitin (M r(avg) 25,000) and dermatan sulfate (M r(avg) 11,000–25,000), sodium salts, and heparin/heparan sulfate disaccharide standards for capillary electrophoresis were purchased from Seikagaku America, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Dextran (M r(avg) 1,000), dextran sulfate (M r(avg) 5,000), heparin-Sepharose 4B prepacked columns, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4BN-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA and MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA were purchased from Sigma. Heparin lyase I (heparinase I, EC 4.2.2.7), heparin lyase II, (heparinase II, no EC number), and heparin lyase III (heparinase III, EC 4.2.2.8) were a gift from IBEX (Montreal, Canada). Recombinant human SLPI was expressed and purified as described previously (20Eisenberg S.P Hale K.K. Heimdal P. Thompson R.C J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was >99% pure as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography and contained <0.72 enzyme unit lipopolysaccharide/mg of protein. Bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Human neutrophil elastase and human neutrophil cathepsin G were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA. Dialysis tubing was purchased from Spectrum Laboratory Products (Houston, TX).MethodsAffinity Chromatography StudiesHeparin-Sepharose Affinity Chromatography of SLPISLPI (100 μg in 10 μl buffer) was loaded onto a 2.5-ml heparin-Sepharose column (1 mg/ml) was first washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, buffer and a 50-ml linear salt gradient of 0–1.5m NaCl in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was used to elute the column. The eluent was monitored at 280 nm, and the salt concentration was determined using a conductivity meter and fractions were collected.Preparation of SLPI-SepharoseCNBr-activated Sepharose (300 mg) was washed with 75 ml of 1 mm hydrochloric acid and swollen for 15 min at room temperature. The swollen beads were suspended in coupling buffer (100 mm sodium bicarbonate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.4) containing 10 mg ofN-acetylated heparin (21Kazatchkine M.D. Fearon D.T. Metcalfe D.D. Rosenberg R.D. Austen K.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (to protect SLPI's interacting lysine residues), SLPI (1 mg) was added slowly to avoid precipitation, and the slurry was mixed at 4 °C for 12 h. The gel was then washed with coupling buffer, 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, resuspended in 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.9, to block remaining reactive sites on the beads, and the slurry was again mixed at 4 °C for 12 h. The gel was subsequently poured into a column (0.5 × 2 cm) and thoroughly washed with 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 m NaCl and stored at 4 °C until used. A control column was also prepared using the same method but without adding the SLPI-N-acetylated heparin mixture. All affinity chromatography was performed at 4 °C.SLPI-Sepharose Affinity Chromatography of PolysaccharidesThe SLPI-Sepharose column was equilibrated in 5 mm, pH 7.4, sodium phosphate buffer. In separate experiments, heparin (500 μg), heparan sulfate (500 μg), dermatan sulfate (500 μg), chondroitin (600 μg), dextran (600 μg), or dextran sulfate (1.2 mg) were affinity fractionated on this column. After loading the polysaccharide, the column was washed with 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and a 20-ml linear salt gradient (from 0 to 1.75 m NaC1) in the same buffer was used to elute the column and fractions were collected. GAGs were detected by carbazole assay (22Bitter T. Muir H.M Anal. Chem. 1962; 4: 330-334Google Scholar), dextran and dextran sulfate by phenol-sulfuric acid assay (23Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39868) Google Scholar), and salt concentrations were determined by measuring the conductivity.Individual fractions from the SLPI-Sepharose affinity-fractionated heparin were exhaustively dialyzed against distilled water (500 molecular weight cutoff membranes) and freeze-dried. Each fraction (10–50 μg) was enzymatically depolymerized for 10 h at 30 °C using 1 milliunit of heparin lyase I, II, and III in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 100 mmNaCl and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min to inactivate the heparin lyases and analyzed immediately using reverse polarity capillary electrophoresis as described previously (24Linhardt R.J. Toida T. Smith A.E. Hileman R.E. Biomethods. 1997; 9: 183-197Google Scholar). Briefly, a normal fused silica capillary (75 μm inner diameter, 70 cm long) was used with 20 mmphosphoric acid adjusted to pH 3.5 by 1 m dibasic sodium phosphate as the running buffer. Each sample (~10 nl) was applied by vacuum injection and separated using 20 kV. Samples were detected by absorbance at 232 nm and the peaks identified by co-migration of disaccharide standards.SLPI-Sepharose Affinity Chromatography of Partially Depolymerized OligosaccharidesHeparin was digested to 30% reaction completion using heparin lyase I and fractionated by Sephadex G50 gel exclusion chromatography into sized oligosaccharide mixtures as previously reported (13Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandick K.A. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Two size-fractionated oligosaccharide mixtures were chosen for these studies, one in which the average oligosaccharide size was a hexasaccharide and the other in which the average oligosaccharide size was a hexadecasaccharide. The hexasaccharide mixture (50 and 500 μg) was loaded onto the SLPI-Sepharose column equilibrated with 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, the column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted in the same buffer with 20 ml of linear 0–1.5 m NaCl. The eluent was monitored by conductivity and at 232 nm. Fractions corresponding to the interacting peak were collected, exhaustively dialyzed (500 molecular weight cutoff membranes) and lyophilized. The hexadecasaccharide mixture was similarly fractionated. Fractions from the affinity chromatography experiments were subjected to gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (25Al-Hakim A. Linhardt R.J Electrophoresis. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Google Scholar). Sample (5–10 μg) were dissolved in 10–15 μl of distilled water and 15 μl of a 50% (w/v) sucrose solution and subjected to electrophoresis on a 20-cm-long linear gradient (12–22% total acrylamide) gel for 5 h at 400 V or through a 32-cm-long gradient gel for 18 h at 400 V. The gels were stained with Alcian blue (0.5% in 2% acetic acid) for 30 min, destained by washing with distilled water for 24 h, and silver-strained as described previously (25Al-Hakim A. Linhardt R.J Electrophoresis. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Google Scholar).Binding, Inhibition, and Rate StudiesITCITC of SLPI with LMW heparin and the homogeneous heparin-derived tetrasaccharide and decasaccharide (13Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandick K.A. Han X.-J. Linhardt R.J Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously (17Fromm J.R. Hileman R.E. Caldwell E.E.O. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Titrations of SLPI (1 ml at 100–200 μm) with tetrasaccharide (10 10-μl injections at 8–9 mm) were in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10–150 mm NaC1 to vary ionic strength. Titrations of LMW heparin (1 ml at 100 μm) or decasaccharide (1 ml at 142 μm) with SLPI (20 5-μl injections at 853 μm) were in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, containing 100 mm NaC1.Effect of Polysaccharides on Proteinase Inhibition by SLPIThe effect of heparin and other polysaccharides on the inhibition of three proteases by SLPI was determined by reacting a fixed concentration of protease and substrate with a series of SLPI concentrations in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml polysaccharide. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, residual enzymatic activity was measured as the rate of change in absorbance at 405 nm caused by formation of pNA on a SpectraMAX 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Human neutrophil elastase was assayed in a reaction mixture with 7.5 nm enzyme and 0.3 mmMeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA (26Nakajima K. Powers J.C. Ashe B.M. Zimmerman M J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4027-4032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin. Human cathepsin G was assayed in a reaction mixture with 16 nm enzyme and 0.4 mm N-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (27Groutas W.C. Brubaker M.J. Venkatraman R. Epp J.B. Stanga M.A. McClenahan J.J Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in 625 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.125% Brij 35. Bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin was assayed using 13 nm enzyme and 100 μm N-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (28DelMar E.G. Largman C. Brodrick J.W. Geokas M.C Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm CaCl2. TheK m for each substrate was determined by iteratively fitting the initial velocities to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Data were visualized by plotting according to the Lineweaver-Burk transformation. The concentration of elastase, cathepsin G, and chymotrypsin were determined by active site titration with human SLPI (29Thompson R.C. Ohlsson K Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6692-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The inhibition constant (K i) of recombinant human SLPI for each protease was determined as described previously (30Zitnik R.J. Zhang J. Kashem M.A. Kohno T. Lyons D.L. Wright C.D. Rosen E. Goldberg I. Hayday A.C Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Determination of Rates of InhibitionThe association rate constant for inhibition of proteases by SLPI was determined using the progress curve method (31Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T Adv. Enzymol. Related Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme containing heparin or heparin-derived oligosaccharide (120 μl) was added to a mixture (120 μl) of SLPI and substrate, and the concentration of product (absorbance at 402 nm) was measured as a function of time at 25 °C using stopped-flow apparatus (Biologic SFM-3, Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA). Human neutrophil elastase (10 nm) containing heparin or heparin-derived oligosaccharide (10 μg/ml) was added to a mixture of SLPI (50 to 100 nm) and substrate MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA (1.0 mm) in 50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl. Human neutrophil cathepsin G (30 nm) containing heparin or heparin-derived oligosaccharide (10 μg/ml) was added to a mixture of SLPI (150–350 nm) and substrate N-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (1.0 mm) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl. Bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin (40 nm) containing heparin or heparin-derived oligosaccharide (10 μg/ml) was added to a mixture of SLPI (250 to 500 nm) and substrateN-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (500 μm) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2. The observed pseudo-first order rate constant (k obs) for the approach to the steady state was obtained by nonlinear regression analysis of the progress curves using Biokine software (Biologic Instruments de Laboratories). The apparent second-order association rate constant (ka) for proteinase-SLPI complex formation was calculated fromk obs using the following relationship (14Mellet P. Ermolieff J. Bieth J.G Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar),ka=kobs(1−vs/vo)(1+[S]/Km)[I0]Equation 1 where v s is the steady state velocity,vo is the initial velocity, [I0] is the SLPI concentration, K m is the Michaelis constant for the specific substrate, and [S] is the substrate concentration. We have calculated ka using the following relationship.ka=kobs(1+[S]/Km)[I0]Equation 2 To account for the effect of the factorv s/v o on theka in Eq. 1, we have estimated the values ofv s and v o from the progress curve using the Biokine software. In most cases the corrected values were within the experimental error of the method (i.e. v s/v o = 0.1–0.2).Antigen-induced Airway Responses in SheepAirway MechanicsAdult ewes (median weight ≈ 30 kg) were instrumented as described previously (32Abraham W.M. Ahmed A. Cortes A Sielczak M.W. Hinz W. Bouska J. Lanni C. Bell R.L Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 217: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mean pulmonary flow resistance (R L) was calculated from an analysis of 5–10 breaths by dividing the change in transpulmonary pressure by the change in flow at midtidal volume. Immediately afterR L determination, thoracic gas volume (V tg) was measured in a constant volume body plethysmograph to calculate specific lung resistance (SR L) by the equation SR L= R L × V tg).A Raindrop jet nebulizer (Puritan-Benett, Lenexa, KS), operated at a flow rate of 6 liters/min, was used to generate droplets with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.6 ± 1.9 μm. Aerosol delivery was controlled using a dosimetry system (32Abraham W.M. Ahmed A. Cortes A Sielczak M.W. Hinz W. Bouska J. Lanni C. Bell R.L Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 217: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which was activated for one second at the onset of the inspiratory cycle of a piston respirator (Harvard Apparatus Co., South Natick, MA). Aerosols were delivered at a tidal volume of 500 ml and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min.Sheep with airway hypersensitivity to Ascaris suum antigen which exhibited both early and late phase bronchoconstriction were used for these studies. Sheep were challenged with Ascaris suumextract (82,000 protein nitrogen units/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) (Greer Diagnostics, Lenoir, NC) delivered as an aerosol at a rate of 20 breaths/min for 20 min. Changes inSR L were monitored for 8 h after antigen challenge. A paired t test (two-tailed) was used to compare peak early and late phase bronchoconstriction responses.Airway HyperresponsivenessBase-line airway responsiveness was determined by measuring the SR L immediately after saline inhalation and consecutive administration of 10 breaths of increasing concentrations of carbachol (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0%, w/v). Airway responsiveness was estimated by determining the cumulative carbachol breath units required to increase SR Lby 400% over the post-saline value (PC400). One breath unit was defined as 1 breath of an aerosol containing 1% w/v carbachol (32Abraham W.M. Ahmed A. Cortes A Sielczak M.W. Hinz W. Bouska J. Lanni C. Bell R.L Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 217: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness was determined by repeating the carbachol dose response 24 h after antigen challenge. A paired t test (one-tailed) was used to evaluate hyperresponsiveness studies.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAffinity chromatography experiments were performed on SLPI-Sepharose using various polysaccharides (TableI). Affinity for SLPI increased with the increasing negative charge of the polysaccharides studied. Dextran, an uncharged 1→6-linked polymer of α-d-glucopyranose, failed to bind. Chondroitin, containing one carboxylate group and ~0.15 sulfate groups/disaccharide unit, bound weakly to the column, eluting as a sharp peak at 0.04 m NaCl. Heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, both containing one carboxylate group and ~1 sulfate per disaccharide unit, bound with moderate affinity eluting with 0.12 and 0.24 m NaCl, respectively. Heparin and dextran sulfate (Fig. 1) bound with high affinity to SLPI both eluting from the SLPI-Sepharose column with peaks at 0.26 m NaCl. Heparin contained chains having a higher affinity for SLPI (eluting at 0.74 m NaC1) than the highest affinity chains in dextran sulfate (eluting at 0.65 mNaC1). This is surprising as heparin has a lower negative charge density (−3.7/disaccharide, one carboxylate and ~2.7 sulfate groups) than dextran sulfate (−4.5/ disaccharide). These results suggest that while SLPI-polysaccharide interaction increases with increased anionic character of the polysaccharide, this interaction is not strictly dependent on charge density. The glycosidic linkage, type of saccharide present, and molecular weight may also be important in displaying the interacting groups of the polysaccharide in a productive manner.Table ISLPI-Sepharose affinity chromatography of polysaccharidesPolysaccharideCharge per disaccharideSodium chloride concentrationpeakHighest affinity chainsmDextran00.000.01Chondroitin−1.150.040.20Dermatan sulfate−20.240.46Heparan sulfate−20.120.59Dextran sulfate−4.50.260.64Heparin−3.70.260.74 Open table in a new tab Heparin eluting from SLPI-Sepharose gives a broad peak with significant trailing (up to 0.74 m) (Table I). However, when SLPI is fractionated on heparin-Sepharose, it gives a sharp and symmetric peak at 0.26 m (not shown). These data suggest that affinity fractionation of heparin is taking place on SLPI-Sepharose and that tightly binding chains might contain structurally unique SLPI-binding sites. In contrast, dextran sulfate fractionated on a SLPI-Sepharose column gave a much sharper symmetrical peak, suggesting that fractionation was the result of ion-exchange with the most highly charged chains binding with the highest avidity. Previous studies report that SLPI elutes from heparin-Sepharose at 0.7 m(16Faller B. Mely Y. Gerard D. Bieth J.G Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8285-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and 0.5 m (14Mellet P. Ermolieff J. Bieth J.G Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) NaC1, while the current study shows a lower affinity (0.26 m NaC1) between heparin and SLPI. These previous studies used Hitrap columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) having a significantly higher concentration of heparin (10 mg/ml of beads) compared with a 0.75–1 mg/ml ligand density in the column used in the current study. The increased ligand density may cause an increase in both binding strength and nonspecific interactions (33Mohr P. Pommerening K. Affinity Chromatography: Practical and Theoretical Aspects. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1985Google Scholar).To study the structural differences of heparin affinity-fractionated on SLPI-Sepharose, the disaccharide composition of selected heparin fractions was depolymerized using a mixture of heparin lyases I, II, and III, and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The disaccharide composition of heparin eluting at 0.26 m NaC1 (the peak fraction) was compared with heparin eluting at 0.58 m NaC1 (the highest affinity fraction). The disaccharide analysis of both fractions afforded a predominant peak at 7 min assigned to the trisulfated disaccharide (Fig. 2,peak 1), ΔUA2S(1"

The rate of reduction is strongly enhanced by ascorbate or dehydroascorbate. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism by which ascorbate and dehydroascorbate accelerate ferricyanide reduction in HL-60 cells. Addition of ascorbate or dehydroascorbate to cells in the presence of ferricyanide led to the intracellular accumulation of ascorbate. Control experiments showed that extracellular ascorbate was rapidly converted to dehydroascorbate in the presence of ferricyanide. These data suggest that intracellular ascorbate originates from extracellular dehydroascorbate. Accumulation of ascorbate was prevented by inhibitors of dehydroascorbate transport into the cell. These compounds also strongly inhibited ascorbate-stimulated ferricyanide reduction in HL-60 cells. Thus, it is concluded that the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction is dependent on intracellular accumulation of ascorbate. Changing the α-tocopherol content of the cells had no effect on the ascorbate-stimulated ferricyanide reduction, showing that a nonenzymatic redox system utilizing α-tocopherol was not involved.p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid strongly affected ferricyanide reduction in the absence of ascorbate, whereas the stimulated reaction was much less responsive to this compound. Thus, it appears that at least two different membrane redox systems are operative in HL-60 cells, both capable of reducing ferricyanide, but through different mechanisms. The first system is the ferricyanide reductase, which uses NADH as its source for electrons, whereas the novel system proposed in this paper relies on ascorbate.

The first system is the ferricyanide reductase, which uses NADH as its source for electrons, whereas the novel system proposed in this paper relies on ascorbate. Many eukaryotic cells contain a redox system in their plasma membrane capable of reducing extracellular substrates using electrons from intracellular NADH (1Crane F.L. Sun I.L. Clark M.G. Grebing C. Low H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The system efficiently reduces the impermeable substrate ferricyanide. This is not the natural substrate for the redox system, but as yet, there has been no conclusive evidence for the substrates of this system or for its primary function. It has been suggested that the system is involved in the maintenance of the redox state of sulfhydryl residues in membrane proteins (1Crane F.L. Sun I.L. Clark M.G. Grebing C. Low H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), the neutralization of oxidative stressors outside the cell (2May J.M. Qu Z. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10577-10582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), or the uptake of iron through a non-transferrin pathway (3Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Inman R.S. Coughlan M.M. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11850-11857Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This redox system deserves special attention because of its possible involvement in regulation of growth and differentiation. Activation of the redox system results in stimulation of growth in serum-limited HeLa cells (5Sun I.L. Crane F.L. Low H. Grebing C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and HL-60 cells (6Alcain F.J. Buron M.I. Rodriguez-Aguilera J.C. Villalba J.M. Navas P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5887-5891PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of differentiation in HL-60 cells has been associated with transient changes in reductase activity (7Buron M.I. Rodriguez-Aguilera J.C. Alcain F.J. Navas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In other cells, activation of the redox system has been shown to modulate protein kinase C activity (8Malviya A.N. Anglard P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 200: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These findings raise an interest in the role of the plasma membrane reductase in these cells and the mechanisms through which it operates. The reduction of ferricyanide by the plasma membrane reductase can be greatly stimulated by the addition of ascorbate and the oxidized form of ascorbate, dehydroascorbate (DHA). 1The abbreviations used are: DHA, dehydroascorbate; AFR, ascorbate free radical; pCMBS,p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. This has been found both in K562 cells (9Schweinzer E. Goldenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a leukemic cell line, and in human erythrocytes (10May J.M. Qu Z. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although several mechanisms have been proposed, the exact mechanism of this enhancement by ascorbate and DHA remains to be elucidated. For K562 cells, it was suggested that the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate was due to a plasma membrane-localized ascorbate free radical (AFR) reductase (9Schweinzer E. Goldenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This enzyme is supposed to catalyze the reduction of external ascorbate free radical using intracellular NADH. It was proposed that ferricyanide reacts with ascorbate to ferrocyanide and the ascorbate free radical. The latter would then be regenerated by the AFR reductase to ascorbate, which can subsequently again react with ferricyanide. Another mechanism is based on studies on erythrocytes and involves the accumulation of ascorbate in cells, where it may serve as an intracellular electron donor for a plasma membrane reductase (10May J.M. Qu Z. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In many cells, accumulation of ascorbate is achieved through a facilitative glucose transporter, GLUT-1 (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Guaiquil V.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This transporter efficiently transports DHA into the cell, but not ascorbate itself. Inside the cell, DHA is reduced to ascorbate. This metabolic trapping mechanism enables the cell to accumulate ascorbate at concentrations far exceeding that of its environment. However, recently, it was found that, in erythrocytes, the enhancement of ferricyanide reduction by DHA was not affected by an inhibitor of the GLUT-1 transporter (13Himmelreich U. Kuchel P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that ascorbate was closely involved in the redox reaction, but that it acted both intra- and extracellularly. It was concluded that DHA could be regenerated to ascorbate independent of its cellular location. Thus, controversy exists on the mechanism of enhancement of ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate and DHA. We have studied the effect of DHA and ascorbate on ferricyanide reduction by HL-60 cells. It has been reported that HL-60 cells contain a ferricyanide reductase and an AFR reductase (14Rodriguez-Aguilera J.C. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Sun I.L. Sun L.E. Crane F.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 175-180PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the possible role of both enzymes in the enhanced ferricyanide reduction was investigated. It is concluded that ascorbate-stimulated ferricyanide reduction does not involve an AFR reductase. Rather, it involves a mechanism where ascorbate is internalized and where intracellular ascorbate is involved in the reduction of extracellular ferricyanide by a novel redox system, different from the NADH-driven ferricyanide reductase. l-Ascorbic acid and l-dehydroascorbic acid were purchased from Aldrich, and potassium ferricyanide andp-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (pCMBS) were from Fluka. Cytochalasin B and α-tocopherol were from Sigma;l-buthionine-(RS)-sulfoximine was from Acros Chimica; and phloretin was from ICN. HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 3 mml-glutamine. Culture flasks were kept in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were harvested when the culture had reached a density of ~9 × 105 cells/ml and were washed twice in 20 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.4 (Tris/NaCl). Subsequently, the cells were suspended in this buffer for further use. Ferricyanide reduction was determined as follows. Cells (4 × 106/ml) in Tris/NaCl were incubated at 37 °C in a closed shaking water bath. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm ferricyanide and various concentrations of ascorbate or DHA and was followed for at least 60 min. Aliquots were centrifuged, and supernatants were assayed for ferrocyanide using the bathophenanthroline-disulfonic acid assay (16Avron M. Shavit N. Anal. Biochem. 1963; 6: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The rate of ferrocyanide generation was used as a measure for the activity of the reductase. Accumulation of ascorbate in cells was determined by incubating 4 × 106 cells/ml in Tris/NaCl in the presence of ascorbate or DHA, with or without 1 mm ferricyanide. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C in a closed shaking water bath, and 1-ml aliquots were taken at set time points. After centrifugation, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Tris/NaCl containing a 100 μm concentration of the GLUT-1 inhibitor phloretin (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Himmelreich U. Kuchel P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was extracted with 600 μl of methanol, which was diluted to 1 ml with water and 1 mm EDTA (end concentration). After centrifugation, the supernatants were analyzed for ascorbate on an HPLC system with a Partisil SAX column (10 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm), eluting with a gradient starting at 7 mm potassium phosphate (pH 4.0) and changing to 0.25m potassium phosphate and 0.5 m KCl (pH 5.0). Ascorbate was detected at 265 nm using a Jasco 870-UV detector. Extraction and HPLC analysis were validated using [14C]ascorbate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The extraction yielded over 95% of the cell-associated radioactivity, and HPLC analysis revealed that 90% of the intracellular radioactivity corresponded with ascorbate. The stability of ascorbate and DHA was tested by incubating a 25 μm concentration of either compound with 4 × 106 cells/ml in Tris/NaCl, with or without 1 mmferricyanide, at 37 °C in a closed shaking water bath. At set times, 100-μl aliquots were mixed with 50 μl of 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 600 μl of methanol, and 250 μl of water. The extracts were spun down, and the ascorbate concentration in the supernatant was determined by HPLC. Glutathione (GSH/GSSG) depletion was achieved by incubating cells withl-buthionine-(RS)-sulfoximine (17Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at a density of 3.5 × 105/ml in growth medium supplemented with 0 or 500 μml-buthionine-(RS)-sulfoximine. After 2 days at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged and washed twice in Tris/NaCl. Glutathione levels in cells, i.e. the total amount of GSH/GSSG, were measured using an enzyme cycling assay (18Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). α-Tocopherol depletion was achieved by growing cells for at least six generations in culture medium in which fetal bovine serum was replaced by 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (19Breitman T.R. Collins S.J. Keene B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). α-Tocopherol supplementation of cells was achieved by growing cells for 2 days at 37 °C in culture medium supplemented with 0, 30, or 100 μm α-tocopherol at an initial cell density of 3.5 × 105 cells/ml. α-Tocopherol was extracted and analyzed essentially as described by Thurnham et al. (20Thurnham D.I. Smith E. Flora P.S. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106cells were spun down and lysed with 10 mm SDS and ethanol containing α-tocopherol acetate as an internal standard. The lysate was extracted using heptane, which was subsequently evaporated under N2. The samples were dissolved in the mobile phase of the HPLC system (methanol/acetonitrile/chloroform, 47:47:6 (v/v)), injected onto a Spherisorb ODS-2 column (250 × 4.6 mm), and eluted isocratically. Both α-tocopherol and α-tocopherol acetate were detected at 292 nm. ESR spectra were recorded on a JEOL-RE2X spectrometer operating at 9.36 GHz with a 100-kHz modulation frequency and equipped with a TM110 cavity. Samples were transferred to a quartz flat cell using a sampling device, which allowed sampling within seconds after mixing. ESR spectrometer settings were as follows: microwave power, 40 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 1 G; time constant, 0.1 s; and scan rate, 6 G/min. Several reports mention the rapid irreversible degradation of DHA in solution (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Winkler B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), yielding 2,3-diketo-l-gulonic acid (22Bode A.M. Cunningham L. Rose R.C. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 1807-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, the stability of ascorbate and DHA in cell suspensions was first determined. DHA can be measured by the addition of dithiothreitol, which converts DHA to ascorbate, after which the ascorbate concentration can be determined by its absorbance at 256 nm. Samples were mixed with dithiothreitol and methanol to determine the total, i.e. intra- and extracellular, amount of ascorbate and DHA. As expected, it was found that DHA was rapidly degraded in a suspension at pH 7.4 (Fig.1), with a half-life of 8–9 min. Ascorbate remained stable for at least 90 min. Ferricyanide had no effect on the rate of DHA degradation (Fig. 1). Addition of ferricyanide to ascorbate, on the other hand, resulted in a rapid decrease in ascorbate, with similar kinetics as found for DHA. The data in Fig. 1 show that a residual amount of ascorbate or DHA can be observed after 45 min and remains relatively stable. HPLC analysis revealed that this residue was ascorbate (data not shown) and corresponded with ascorbate accumulated in the cells (Fig.2 A). Cells incubated with ascorbate alone accumulated only a small amount of ascorbate. However, cells incubated with DHA, DHA and ferricyanide, or ascorbate and ferricyanide rapidly accumulated ascorbate, reaching maximum levels after 20 min of incubation (Fig. 2 A). The maximum of ~0.8 nmol/106 cells corresponded with an intracellular concentration of 1.5 mm (assuming a cell diameter of 10 μm). After 45 min, the levels of ascorbate showed a slight decrease, although most of it remained in the cells. The accumulation of ascorbate proved to be dependent on the concentration of DHA in the incubation mixture (Fig. 2 B). Subsequently, the effect of ascorbate and DHA on ferricyanide reduction by HL-60 cells was investigated. Without ascorbate and DHA, the reduction of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide was linear for at least 90 min (Fig.3). In the presence of ascorbate and DHA, the rate of reduction was higher, and the same linear kinetics were found for both compounds. It should be noted that, with ascorbate, a sudden increase in ferrocyanide levels could be observed within seconds after mixing of ferricyanide and ascorbate (Fig. 3). This increase, which also occurred in the absence of cells, had a stoichiometry of two ferrocyanide molecules formed per molecule of ascorbate added and resulted from the direct reaction between ascorbate and ferricyanide, generating DHA and ferrocyanide. In Fig. 4, the dependence of the ferricyanide reduction on the concentrations of ascorbate and DHA is shown. In the case of ascorbate, the dose-response curve could not be extended to concentrations above 50 μm: the immediate reaction of ascorbate with ferricyanide caused excessive depletion of ferricyanide from the system at higher concentrations. The concentration range for DHA was limited to 1 mm, as higher concentrations of DHA interfered with the bathophenanthroline assay. The data in Fig. 4 show that the rate of ferricyanide reduction is dependent on the extracellular ascorbate or DHA concentration and that it behaved in a saturable manner, with a maximum rate of 0.41 nmol/106 cells/min and an apparent K m of 30 μm. pCMBS, a sulfhydryl reagent, can be an effective inhibitor of the plasma membrane ferricyanide reductase (23Vaillant F. Larm J.A. McMullen G.L. Wolvetang E.J. Lawen A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24del Castillo-Olivares A. Medina M.A. Nunez de Castro I. Marquez J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).pCMBS inhibited the reduction of ferricyanide in the absence of ascorbate, causing a 50% inhibition at 5.6 μm (Fig.5). It also inhibited the ascorbate-stimulated reaction, although to a lesser extent, with 50% inhibition estimated at 180 μm. This number was obtained through extrapolation of the data from Fig. 5. Concentrations above 100 μm pCMBS were not used, as they affected the intracellular accumulation of ascorbate. The ascorbate free radical has been proposed as an intermediate in the accelerated reduction of ferricyanide by K562 cells (9Schweinzer E. Goldenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is relatively stable and results from the one-electron oxidation of ascorbate. To test its involvement in the accelerated reduction of ferricyanide, the formation of the radical was measured under various experimental conditions (Fig.6). The ascorbate free radical can readily be observed in a 25 μm ascorbate solution in buffer, with an ESR spectrum consisting of a doublet with hyperfine splitting, a H4 = 1.8 G (Fig. 6 A). Transition metal ions, which are always present in buffer solutions, mediate this formation of the ascorbate free radical (25Buettner G.R. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm ferricyanide, no radical signal could be detected (Fig. 6 B). The ascorbate free radical was also detected in the presence of HL-60 cells, although the signal intensity was lower than in the absence of cells (Fig. 6 C). This may be caused by a decreased ascorbate degradation, due to chelation of transition metal ions, or by an increased regeneration by an AFR reductase. However, this was not further investigated, as it was considered to be outside the scope of this paper. Again, in the presence of ferricyanide, no radical signal could be detected (Fig.6 D). Extracellular DHA is taken up by HL-60 cells through a facilitative process, catalyzed by the GLUT-1 glucose transporter (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Guaiquil V.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test whether the activity of the GLUT-1 transporter was also involved in ascorbate- or DHA-mediated ferricyanide reduction, the effect of several GLUT-1 substrates and inhibitors was studied. Table I shows that glucose and its analogs 2-deoxyglucose and 6-deoxyglucose strongly inhibited the ascorbate-stimulated ferricyanide reduction as well as the accumulation of ascorbate. Cytochalasin B, which inhibits GLUT-1 (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was also an effective inhibitor. Ferricyanide reduction in the absence of ascorbate was hardly affected by these compounds, showing that they did not have an effect on the ferricyanide reductase.Table IRole of the GLUT-1 transporter in ferricyanide reduction and ascorbate accumulationInhibitorFerricyanide reductionAscorbate accumulation0 μm ascorbate25 μmascorbateNone3820666720 mm d-glucose287814920 mm2-DOG1-aDOG, deoxyglucose.31702920 mm6-DOG239496Cytochalasin B Added before3950<10 Added after38221674Cells (4 × 106/ml) were incubated with the compounds listed for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 1 mmferricyanide and 25 μm ascorbate.

For cells incubated in the presence of ascorbate, its accumulation in HL-60 cells was measured after 20 min of incubation and is expressed as picomoles of ascorbate/106 cells.

Open table in a new tab Cells (4 × 106/ml) were incubated with the compounds listed for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 1 mmferricyanide and 25 μm ascorbate. In some experiments, cytochalasin B was added 20 min after the addition of ferricyanide and ascorbate (i.e. added after). For cells incubated in the presence of ascorbate, its accumulation in HL-60 cells was measured after 20 min of incubation and is expressed as picomoles of ascorbate/106 cells. Cells incubated in the absence of ascorbate did not contain any measurable ascorbate. Ferricyanide reduction (picomoles of ferrocyanide/106 cells/min) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Previous studies on erythrocytes suggest that ascorbate may serve as an intracellular electron donor for the plasma membrane reductase (26May J.M. Qu Z.C. Whitesell R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1238: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The accumulation of ascorbate in HL-60 leads to a similar concept, in which the reduction of ferricyanide and the oxidation of ascorbate are coupled. Comparison of the data in Figs. 2 A and 3 shows that the amount of ferrocyanide formed exceeded the amount of ascorbate in the cells: after 60 min, 12 nmol of ferricyanide was converted by 106 cells, whereas they contained 0.8 nmol of ascorbate. As one molecule of ascorbate can reduce two molecules of ferricyanide, this amount of ascorbate accounted only for the reduction of 1.6 nmol of ferricyanide. Thus, the presence of a recycling mechanism for ascorbate is required to explain the amount of ferricyanide reduced. There are several ways by which intracellular ascorbate can reduce ferricyanide. It can either remain inside the cell and donate electrons to a redox system for ferricyanide reduction or, alternatively, leave the cell to react with ferricyanide directly. In the latter case, DHA will be formed outside the cells and has to re-enter the cell to be recycled to ascorbate. Thus, with a reuptake step being essential, the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction should remain sensitive to GLUT-1 inhibitors throughout the entire incubation period. As shown in TableI, this was not the case. Cytochalasin B inhibited only when added before the addition of ascorbate. When 5 μm cytochalasin B was added 20 min after ascorbate, no inhibition was observed. This indicates that ascorbate remains in the cell and that intracellular ascorbate mediates the accelerated reduction of ferricyanide. Replotting the data in Figs. 2 B and 4 results in Fig.7, which shows the relation between the intracellular concentration of ascorbate and the rate of ferricyanide reduction. This rate correlated to the intracellular concentration in a saturable manner, resembling Michaelis-Menten kinetics. A fit of the data resulted in an apparent K m of 0.29 nmol/106 cells, which corresponds to 0.55 mm(assuming a cell diameter of 10 μm). Glutathione is believed to be involved in the conversion of DHA to ascorbate inside the cell (27Wells W.W. Xu D.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether glutathione depletion has an effect on the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate or DHA. Treatment of cells withl-buthionine-(RS)-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis (17Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused a dramatic reduction in the cellular GSH/GSSG level, from 2.3 nmol/106 cells in the control to 0.07 nmol/106 cells. However, ferricyanide reduction rates were hardly affected by the depletion of glutathione. Also, ascorbate uptake measurements showed that intracellular ascorbate accumulation was not significantly affected by glutathione depletion (data not shown). There have been reports suggesting a role for α-tocopherol in assisting the transport of electrons over the membrane (2May J.M. Qu Z. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10577-10582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Ilani A. Krakover T. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Under standard culture conditions, cells have a very low α-tocopherol content due to the low level of this compound in serum (29Leist M. Raab B. Maurer S. Rosick U. Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To achieve α-tocopherol levels even lower than those in control cells, HL-60 cells were cultured for several generations in the absence of serum. Without this exogenous source of α-tocopherol, the α-tocopherol levels dropped below the detection limit of ~1 pmol/106cells (Table II). Supplementation, on the other hand, caused at least a 20-fold increase in cellular α-tocopherol levels. Ascorbate-stimulated ferricyanide reduction was not significantly affected by supplementation or depletion of α-tocopherol.Table IIEffect of α-tocopherol on ferricyanide reductionα-Tocopherol added to mediumα-Tocopherol in cellsFerricyanide reduction0 μm ascorbate25 μmascorbateμmGrown with serum 01033229 3020339232 10039347214Grown serum-free 0029242 3020245292Ferricyanide reduction (picomoles of ferrocyanide/106cells/min) and intracellular α-tocopherol levels (picomoles/106 cells) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells grown with serum were cultured under standard conditions, whereas cells without serum were cultured in a medium with serum replaced by transferrin, insulin, and bovine serum albumin. Open table in a new tab Ferricyanide reduction (picomoles of ferrocyanide/106cells/min) and intracellular α-tocopherol levels (picomoles/106 cells) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells grown with serum were cultured under standard conditions, whereas cells without serum were cultured in a medium with serum replaced by transferrin, insulin, and bovine serum albumin. Ascorbate and DHA strongly increased the rate of ferricyanide reduction in HL-60 cells, as has previously been found for K562 cells and erythrocytes (9Schweinzer E. Goldenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10May J.M. Qu Z. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For K562 cells, it was suggested that the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate was due to a plasma membrane-localized AFR reductase (9Schweinzer E. Goldenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it is highly unlikely that this mechanism explains our results. The reaction between ferricyanide and ascorbate is very fast, and the stoichiometry of the reaction amounted to 2 mol of ferrocyanide formed per mol of ascorbate (Fig. 3). This indicates that the oxidation of ascorbate does not stop at the level of the ascorbate free radical, but that it continues to DHA. This was confirmed by ESR spectroscopy (Fig. 6). Addition of excess ferricyanide to a solution of ascorbate, as used in our experiments, resulted in the formation of DHA, not the ascorbate free radical. In the experiments with K562 cells, a similar excess of ferricyanide was used, and it is therefore also unlikely that, in K562 cells, the enhanced reduction of ferricyanide by ascorbate is mediated by an AFR reductase (9Schweinzer E. Goldenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another mechanism that has been proposed was based on studies on erythrocytes and involves the accumulation of ascorbate in cells, where it may serve as an intracellular electron donor for the plasma membrane reductase (10May J.M. Qu Z. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper also strongly suggest that intracellular accumulation of ascorbate in the cell is an essential part of the mechanism by which ascorbate or DHA has its effect on ferricyanide reduction. We found that only conditions that allowed the accumulation of ascorbate resulted in an accelerated reduction of ferricyanide (Fig. 2). In many cells, DHA is transported by a facilitative process, which is mediated by the GLUT-1 glucose transporter (11Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1628-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ascorbate, on the other hand, is not transported over the plasma membrane of HL-60 cells. Our experiments corroborate this view, as ascorbate was accumulated in the cells only when DHA was present in the extracellular medium (Fig. 2). Several substrates and inhibitors of the GLUT-1 transporter blocked the accumulation of ascorbate, showing the involvement of this transport system (TableI). Intracellularly, DHA is reduced to ascorbate, as followed from control experiments using 14C-labeled ascorbate. This conversion was also found in erythrocytes incubated with DHA (10May J.M. Qu Z. Whitesell R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12721-12728Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, on incubation with ferricyanide, erythrocytes showed an efflux of DHA. As DHA is transported by the facilitative GLUT-1 transporter, it can be transported in both directions following a concentration gradient. Apparently, in erythrocytes, ferricyanide induced the formation of intracellular DHA from ascorbate, which could subsequently leave the cell. However, no significant efflux of DHA from HL-60 cells could be observed, indicating the presence of an efficient regenerating system (Fig. 2). The major part of the DHA generated inside the cells was thus recycled to ascorbate, before it had a chance to be transported or hydrolyzed. Recently, Guaiquil et al. (12Guaiquil V.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reported that HL-60 cells have an efficient ascorbate-regenerating system that does not require intracellular glutathione. The lack of effect of glutathione depletion on ascorbate accumulation found in our study corroborates this view. It was concluded that uptake of DHA into the cell and its accumulation in the cell as ascorbate are essential steps in the enhancement of ferricyanide reduction. The stimulation of ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate was inhibited by GLUT-1 inhibitors or competing substrates (Table I). This is in clear contrast to data recently obtained for erythrocytes, where it was found that inhibition of DHA transport by cytochalasin B did not impair the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate (13Himmelreich U. Kuchel P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that ascorbate was closely involved in the redox reaction, but that it acted both intra- and extracellularly. It was supposed that DHA could be regenerated to ascorbate independent of its cellular location. In HL-60 cells, this is clearly not the case. In these cells, the GLUT-1 transporter is involved in the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate and DHA. The redox equivalents represented by intracellular ascorbate were exceeded many times (at least by a factor 8) by the total amount consumed by ferricyanide. This shows that ferricyanide reduction only lasts because ascorbate is continuously regenerated. Once ascorbate was accumulated in the cells, the addition of GLUT-1 inhibitors no longer had any effect on the rate of ferricyanide reduction (Table I). Thus, the effect of ascorbate or DHA on ferricyanide reduction cannot be explained by an excretion and reabsorption of ascorbate from the medium. Instead, the data show that ascorbate has its effect inside the cell, serving either as a direct substrate for a redox system or as an activator of such a system. What redox system is responsible for the effect of ascorbate? It is possible that ascorbate-stimulated ferricyanide reduction uses the same system as the basal reduction of ferricyanide. However, when the effect of the inhibitor pCMBS on both the basal and ascorbate-stimulated reductions is compared, this seems to be unlikely. The basal reduction is much more sensitive to inhibition bypCMBS than the accelerated reduction (Table I). This indicates that the basal and accelerated reductions of ferricyanide are actually two separate processes, resulting in an additive reduction of extracellular ferricyanide. Summarizing our data, a model for the reduction of ferricyanide by HL-60 cells is proposed in Fig.8. At least two membrane redox systems are present in HL-60 cells, both capable of reducing ferricyanide. The first system is the ferricyanide reductase, which is thought to use NADH as its source for electrons. The second system is the one proposed in this paper, and it relies on ascorbate for its reducing equivalents. It is interesting to note that, under normal cell culture conditions, there is only a limited supply of ascorbate to feed this system since serum contains very low levels of ascorbate (30Hoffman K.E. Yanelli K. Bridges K.R. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 1188S-1192SCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, however, ascorbate is present at much higher concentrations. Therefore, this redox system may be a formidable addition to the capability of the cell to counter oxidative processes at its surface, far exceeding the capacity of the NADH-dependent reductase. The proteinaceous character of the basal ferricyanide reductase seems well established (24del Castillo-Olivares A. Medina M.A. Nunez de Castro I. Marquez J. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Medina M.A. Nunez de Castro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Int. 1997; 41: 75-81PubMed Google Scholar), but the nature of the ascorbate-dependent system is not clear. It could involve either direct chemical reactions or a membrane-based enzyme (2May J.M. Qu Z. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10577-10582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Ilani A. Krakover T. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There have been reports in the literature suggesting a nonenzymatic route of electron transport. In liposomes, it was found that α-tocopherol, a natural antioxidant present in membrane lipids, mediated ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate without intervention of an enzyme system (2May J.M. Qu Z. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10577-10582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, for erythrocytes, it was observed that α-tocopherol could augment ascorbate-induced ferricyanide reduction, but the involvement of a membrane-localized enzyme system could not be excluded (2May J.M. Qu Z. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10577-10582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conversely, the present results show that, in HL-60 cells, the supplementation or depletion of α-tocopherol had no significant effect on the efficacy of ascorbate in the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction (Table II). Even in the total absence of α-tocopherol, HL-60 cells remain fully responsive to the addition of ascorbate. This unequivocally shows that α-tocopherol does not play a significant role in the stimulation of ferricyanide reduction by ascorbate and DHA in HL-60 cells. The intracellular level of ascorbate appeared to have a saturable dose-response relation with the observed rate of ferricyanide reduction, indicating that the reaction has Michaelis-Menten kinetics toward ascorbate. pCMBS inhibitor studies suggest the involvement of a protein since this compound is well known to interfere with protein functions through its reactivity toward sulfhydryl groups. Thus, these experiments support the view that ascorbate-driven ferricyanide reduction proceeds through a redox system containing a proteinaceous component. However, further experiments will be needed to establish the exact nature of the system by which intracellular ascorbate can donate electrons to extracellular ferricyanide."

Malignant glioma tumors are characterized by cytoplasmic bundles of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a protein normally expressed in mature astrocytes. Establishment of malignant glioma cell lines often results in loss of GFAP. The subset of malignant glioma cell lines that express GFAP mRNA also express B-FABP mRNA. Co-localization experiments in cell lines indicate that the same cells produce both GFAP and B-FABP.

Moreover, compared with monolayers, cells grown as spheroids or cell aggregates failed to express matrix metalloproteinase-9 in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression was also inhibited by calphostin-C, a protein kinase inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase C in matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced invasion of SNB19 cells through Matrigel was inhibited by cytochalasin-D and calphostin-C. These results suggest that the actin polymerization transduces signals that modulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression and the subsequent invasion of human glioma cells. Basement membrane and extracellular matrix degradation by proteolytic enzymes is the critical event that takes place during tumor cell invasion and metastasis (1Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Several proteases are secreted by invading tumor cells, such as serine proteases, plasminogen activators, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP(s), matrix metalloproteinase(s); PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PKC, protein kinase C.

Among the proteases, elevated levels of MMPs have been shown in many tumors (3Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar,4Vassalli J.D.

Trans. 1994; 22: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The role of MMPs has been noted in a number of astrocytic tumors (6Lund-Johansen M. Rucklidge G.J. Milne G. Bjerkvig R.

Seiki M. Hayakawa T. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1994; 12: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and our own results of glioblastoma studies suggest that both MMP-2 (also known as gelatinase-A) and MMP-9 (also known as gelatinase-B) are elevated significantly at both the mRNA and protein levels in malignant glioblastomas (9Rao J.S. Steck P.A. Mohanam S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Liotta L.A. Sawaya R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2208-2211PubMed Google Scholar) and contribute to the invasive ability of gliomas both in vivo (9Rao J.S.

However, in vitro culturing of primary gliomas results in the loss of MMP-9 expression (13Rossi M. Rooprai H.K. Maidment S.L. Rucklidge G.J. Pilkington G.J. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 121-128PubMed Google Scholar) 2S. K. Chintala, R. Sawaya, and J. S. Rao, unpublished observation.; MMP-9 is re-expressed when these glioma cells are injected intracerebrally into nude mouse brain.2 The production of MMPs is influenced by many factors. Physiologically relevant cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α have been shown to induce the expression of MMPs (14Brenner D.A. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 337: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 15Ito A. Sato T. Iga T. Mori Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that a number of pharmacological agents including 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate induce procollagenase, MMP, and stromelysin expression (16Chin J.R. Murphy G.

Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). Alteration of cell shape by growing cells on biological matrices also results in dramatic changes in the phenotypes of a number of cell types (20Bissell M.J. Hall H.G. Parry G. J. Theor. Biol. 1982; 99: 31-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), and a strong correlation has been shown with a change in cell morphology; it has been speculated that cell shape plays a major role in chondrogenesis (21Benya P.D.

Moreover, growth of cells in three-dimensional collagen matrices alters the cytoskeleton organization (25Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, 26Tomasek J.J. Hay E.D. Fujiwara K. Dev. Biol. 1982; 92: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Recent studies reported that changes in the cytoskeleton activate MMP-2 (28Tomasek J.J. Halliday N.L. Updike D.L.

Kerbel R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although the above studies have shown that cell shape changes result in modulation of various phenotypic changes and MMP expression, studies on extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton organization and the associated changes in gliomas are of special importance because these tumors are more highly infiltrative than all other tumor types. Despite a number of studies on the role of MMPs and invasive phenotypes, the activation of MMPs which contributes significantly to glioma invasiveness is not clearly understood. In this study, we show that cell shape changes, particularly those resulting from inhibition of actin polymerization, suppress the activation of MMP-9 and the invasion properties of human gliomas. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cytochalasin-D, colchicine-B, dexamethasone, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and TRITC-phalloidin were obtained from Sigma. Calphostin-C, genistein, HA1004, and 8-bromo-cAMP were purchased from Calbiochem. PolyHema (poly[2-hydroxyethylmethylacrylate], also called Cellform Polymer) was obtained from ICN biochemicals (Aurora, OH). Agar was obtained from Difco Laboratories. Tissue culture plates were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). An established human glioma cell line SNB19 (30Chintala S.K. Fueyo J. Gomez-Manzano C. Venkaiah B. Yung W.K.A. Sawaya R. Kyritsis A.P. Rao J.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2049-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was used in the current study. Cells were routinely grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2at 37 °C. Cells were passaged every 3–5 days. After being tested in preliminary experiments, reagents were used at concentrations that have maximal inhibitory or stimulatory effect on MMP-9 expression without affecting cell viability (by 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay): 50 ng/ml PMA, 1 μmdexamethasone, 40 μm genistein, 1 μm8-bromo-cAMP, 5 μm cytochalasin-D, 5 μmcolchicine-B, 10 μm HA1004, and 300 nmcalphostin-C. SNB19 cells grown in chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) for 24 h at 37 °C were washed with PBS, fixed by adding 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Where indicated, TRITC-phalloidin (200 nm/ml in PBS) was applied for 30 min to Triton X-100-permeabilized cells to stain for F-actin. Invasion of the glioma cellsin vitro was measured by the invasion of cells through Matrigel-coated (Collaborative Research, Inc., Boston) Transwell inserts (Costar, Cambridge, MA) according to a procedure described previously (30Chintala S.K. Fueyo J. Gomez-Manzano C. Venkaiah B. Yung W.K.A. Sawaya R. Kyritsis A.P. Rao J.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2049-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, Transwell inserts with an 8-μm pore size were coated with a final concentration of 0.78 mg/ml Matrigel in cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12. Cells were treated with trypsin, and 200 μl of cell suspension (1 × 106 cells/ml) from each treatment was added in triplicate wells. After 48 h of incubation, the cells that passed through the filter into the lower wells were stained with Hema-3 (CMS, Inc., Houston) and photographed under a microscope. Analysis of MMP-2/MMP-9 was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels impregnated with 0.1% gelatin (w/v) and 10% polyacrylamide (w/v) as described elsewhere (30Chintala S.K. Fueyo J. Gomez-Manzano C. Venkaiah B. Yung W.K.A. Sawaya R. Kyritsis A.P. Rao J.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2049-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 100-mm2 tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum until they reached 80% confluence. Cells were washed and replaced with serum-free medium, and the conditioned medium was collected after 48 h. Four parts of medium containing equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were mixed with one part of Laemmli sample buffer (minus reductant) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) before electrophoresis. Gels were run at a constant current and then washed twice for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% NaN3. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and then destained. Western blotting for p125FAK was performed by lysing the cells with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/liter aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates were washed with cold PBS before the addition of RIPA buffer and incubated for 10 min. Cells were scraped and pipetted into Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, and protein was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). 20 μg of this initial lysate was loaded onto gels for electrophoresis and Western blotting. After reduction in the sample buffer, samples were loaded onto a 10% resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a 4.5% stacking gel. Samples were electrophoresed at a constant current (40 mA) for 2–4 h at 4 °C and then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 4 °C at a constant current of 80 mA. Western blotting was performed with a 1:2500 dilution anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Immunoreactive bands for FAK were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Film was analyzed with a scanning densitometer, and the images were reproduced by UMAX scanner with an Adobe Photoshop imaging system on a Macintosh computer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed according to the procedures described previously (32Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Scheffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were washed with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 20 min followed by the addition of 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40. The tubes were then vortexed vigorously for 10 s, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine) and incubated on ice for 30 min with intermittent vortexing. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was either used immediately or stored at −70 °C. The protein content was measured by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 4 μg of nuclear extract with 16 fmol of32P-labeled 45-mer double-stranded nuclear factor (NF)-κB oligonucleotide from the HIV long term repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (35Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), for 15 min at 37 °C. The incubation mixture included 2–3 μg of poly(dI·dC) in a binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl) (36Collart M.A. Bacuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complex thus formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel using buffer containing 50 mmTris, 200 mm glycine, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA (37Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and the gel was then dried. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. Visualization and quantitation of radioactive bands were carried out by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using IMAGEQUANT software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). SNB19 cells were treated with trypsin, and a single-cell suspension was obtained. Cell suspensions containing 1 × 105cells/ml were plated in six-well tissue culture plates and treated with 50 ng/ml PMA. PMA was added during the plating, after plating, or during and after plating. Fig. 1 shows that treatment of SNB19 cells with PMA resulted in the induction of MMP-9, which is normally absent in this cell line, irrespective of the time of the addition of PMA, although long term treatment resulted in reduced expression of MMP-9 (results not shown). MMP-2 expression was largely unaltered, although activation into the 66-kDa form resulted occasionally. To understand the role of actin polymerization, we treated SNB19 cells with PMA during the initial plating and then treated them with cytochalasin-D (actin polymerization inhibitor) during plating, after plating, and during and after plating. SNB19 cells treated with PMA expressed MMP-9, and the expression of this enzyme was lost by the addition of cytochalasin-D, provided it was added during or during and after plating (Fig. 2). However, there was no change in the expression of MMP-9 when cytochalasin-D was added after spreading (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in another malignant glioma cell line, UW5 (results not shown). Treatment of the cells with colchicine-B (tubulin inhibitor) had no effect on the expression of MMP-9, induced by PMA treatment (Fig. 3). To rule out a nonspecific effect of actin polymerization inhibition on MMP-9 expression, similar experiments were conducted using the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line, which constitutively expresses both MMP-2 and MMP-9. HT1080 cells treated with cytochalasin-D lost the ability to express MMP-9 provided the agent was added during or during and after spreading (Fig. 4); the ability to express proMMP-2 was unaltered by the addition of cytochalasin-D. On the other hand, treatment of HT1080 cells with colchicine-B had no effect on either MMP-2 or MMP-9 expression (Fig. 4). These results show that the induced expression of MMP-9 in SNB19 cells and constitutive expression of MMP-9 in HT1080 cells are lost by alterations in the actin cytoskeleton.Figure 3Colchicine-B treatment does not alter MMP-9 induction. SNB19 cells were plated as described in Fig. 2 and treated with PMA (50 ng/ml). Cells were also treated with colchicine-B during plating and after washes (+/+), added during plating (+/−), added after plating (−/+), or not treated (−/−). Conditioned medium containing an equal amount of protein was run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin. No alteration in PMA-induced MMP-9 expression was observed, and cytochalasin-B had no effect on MMP-2 expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Cytochalasin-D inhibits constitutive expression of MMP-9 in HT1080 cells. HT1080 cells were plated (1 × 105 cells/well) in six-well tissue culture plates and treated with cytochalasin-D or colchicine-B during and after plating (+/+), added during plating (+/−), added after plating (−/+), or not treated (−/−), in the absence of PMA. Additionally, in a separate set of experiments HT1080 cells were also treated with PMA alone. Conditioned medium was collected and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin. HT1080 cells constitutively expressed both MMP-2 and MMP-9; however, expression of MMP-9 but not of MMP-2 is inhibited significantly in the presence of cytochalasin-D. The addition of PMA has no significant effect on the expression of both MMP-2 and MMP-9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because inhibitors of actin polymerization resulted in MMP-9 inhibition, we performed cell spreading assays where changes in cell shape and actin polymerization were observed during spreading by staining the cells with TRITC-phalloidin. Fig.5 shows that treatment of cells with cytochalasin-D resulted in changes in the cell shapes as observed both by light microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Treatment with cytochalasin-D resulted in the loss of actin cytoskeleton, provided the agent was added during spreading or during and after spreading. Although treatment with cytochalasin-D after spreading resulted in some changes in cell shape, most of the cells were spread and retained stress-fiber formation. However, colchicine-B had no effect on actin polymerization in SNB19 cells. We treated SNB19 cells further with dexamethasone, which induces a rapid change of nonpolymerized actin to polymerized actin. Cells treated with PMA followed by dexamethasone showed induction of MMP-9 as expected (Fig. 9). Interestingly, cells treated with PMA and dexamethasone followed by cytochalasin-D retained the ability to express MMP-9, whereas cells treated with cytochalasin-D in the presence of PMA invariably lost the ability to express MMP-9, as observed in earlier experiments (see Fig.2). Treatment with dexamethasone alone did not result in the induction of MMP-9 and had no effect on the constitutive expression of MMP-2 in SNB19 cells. These results suggest that polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton induced by dexamethasone is resistant to disruption by cytochalasin-D treatment.Figure 9MMP-9 induction is inhibited by the PKC inhibitor calphostin-C. Cells were plated (1 × 105 cells/well) in six-well tissue culture plates and treated with PMA (50 ng/ml) during spreading. Cells were also treated with calphostin-C, cAMP, genistein, and HA1004 for 1 h before the addition of PMA. In a separate set of experiments, cells were also treated with dexamethasone after PMA treatment, or cells were treated with PMA and dexamethasone followed by cytochalasin-D. Conditioned medium was collected, and samples containing an equal amount of protein (20 μg) from each treatment were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin. PMA-induced expression of MMP-9 and to some extent MMP-2 was inhibited by calphostin-C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the cells treated with cytochalasin-D lost their cytoskeletal organization, we were interested to see the changes in the expression of FAK where stress fibers terminate. Cells were plated as described above and treated with cytochalasin-D or colchicine-B; after the treatments, cells were extracted in RIPA buffer, and FAK protein was examined by Western blotting. The Western blot for FAK in Fig.6 shows that SNB19 cells without any treatment or with PMA treatment expressed FAK protein. However, treatment of cells with cytochalasin-D during or during and after treatment resulted in the loss of FAK expression. On the other hand, similar levels of FAK were expressed in colchicine-B-treated cells compared with levels expressed by control and PMA-treated cells. These observations show that both the actin cytoskeleton and the expression of FAK are lost when cells are treated with cytochalasin-D. This in turn results in altered cell shape and consequent loss of ability to express MMP-9. Because cell “rounding” in the presence of cytochalasin-D resulted in the loss of MMP-9 expression, we grew cells on PolyHema or on agar-coated plates; this prevents the cells from attaching to the tissue culture plastic and results in cell aggregation or spheroid formation. Cells are then treated with 50 ng/ml PMA. Gelatin zymography of the conditioned medium from cells grown as spheroids (Fig. 7, left panel,lane B) and cell aggregates (Fig. 7, lane C) failed to express MMP-9 in the presence of PMA, whereas cells grown as monolayers expressed MMP-9 in response to PMA (Fig. 7, lane A), indicating that cell spreading and subsequent actin polymerization are necessary for MMP-9 expression. MMP-2 expression was unaltered by growing the cells on PolyHema or on agar-coated plates. It is speculated that cell shape changes exert specific effects on gene expression by modulating the activity of transcriptional factors that reside in the cytoplasm of the unstimulated cells in an inactive form and migrate to the nucleus in response to various stimuli. One such factor is NF-κB, a dimeric complex that activates transcription of a variety of genes, including MMP-9 expression, activation of cell surface receptors, and activation of cell adhesion molecules. SNB19 cells were treated with PMA in the presence and absence of cell shape modulators, cytochalasin-D and colchicine-B as described above. As shown in Fig. 8, untreated cells have no DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Stimulation of NF-κB was observed when the cells were treated with PMA. Subsequently, PMA-induced NF-κB binding was decreased in the presence of cytochalasin-D, whereas significant binding of NF-κB was observed in colchicine-B-treated cells. These observations suggest that PMA-induced NF-κB binding was inhibited by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. It has been shown that MMP induction in glioma cells is dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) expression. To understand the role of actin cytoskeleton in PKC-dependent MMP expression, cells were treated with PMA and incubated with various PKC and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. MMP-9 expression was induced by PMA as expected (Fig. 9), and the PMA-induced MMP-9 expression (and to some extent MMP-2 expression) was inhibited by calphostin-C, a specific inhibitor of PKC, but not by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and HA1004 (Fig. 9). This showed that induction of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 is dependent on PKC expression in SNB19 human glioma cells. MMP-9 plays an important role in tumor cell invasion, and thus, experiments were performed to examine the effect of actin polymerization inhibitors on in vitro SNB19 cell invasion. Invasion of SNB19 cells through Matrigel was induced 2–3-fold by PMA, and this induction was inhibited subsequently by the addition of cytochalasin-D (Fig.10). However, treatment of cells with colchicine-B had no significant effect on invasion. Treatment of cells with calphostin-C resulted in significant loss of invasion capacity of SNB19 cells (Fig. 10), whereas other tyrosine kinase inhibitors had no effect (results not shown). Calphostin-C-inhibited invasion of SNB19 cells was only minimally reversed by PMA treatment (Fig. 10). Changes in cytoskeletal architecture reflected in cell shape changes are well known to accompany changes in gene expression in a number of cell types such as mammary epithelium (38Emmerman J.T.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) reported that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton stimulated procollagenase and stromelysin secretion in rabbit synovial fibroblasts, which led to the speculation that perturbation of the actin microfilaments might be linked to the expression of genes involved in the initiation of extracellular matrix degradation. In addition, two recent reports demonstrating that MMP-9 was suppressed by an alteration in cell shape in melanoma cells (29MacDougall J.R. Kerbel R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and that MMP-2 activation was regulated by organization of the polymerized actin in human palmar fascial fibroblasts (28Tomasek J.J. Halliday N.L. Updike D.L. Ahern-Moore J.S. Vu T.-K.H. Liu R.W. Howard E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7482-7487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) show that an alteration in cell shape influences MMP-9 and as well as MMP-2 in different cell types. In the current study, we performed experiments to understand whether changes in cytoskeleton polymerization, a dynamic process that occurs during tumor cell invasion, modulate the expression of MMPs using agents that change the cell shape in vitro. Gelatin zymographic analysis of medium from the SNB19 glioma cell line revealed that the expression of MMP-9 is induced by PMA, which is normally absent in this cell line (Fig. 1). Treatment of the cells with cytochalasin-D, which causes disruption of actin stress fibers, resulted in decreased or loss of MMP-9 expression (Fig. 2). In contrast, treatment of cells with colchicine-B, an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization, had no effect on the expression of MMP-9 or MMP-2 (Fig.3). To understand whether the constitutive expression of MMP-9 in other cell types is altered by cell shape changes, we used HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, which constitutively express both MMP-2 and MMP-9, because glioma cells do not express constitutive MMP-9 in in vitro culturing conditions. Cytochalasin-D inhibited constitutive expression of MMP-9 in HT1080 cells (Fig. 4), similar to the results observed in SNB19 glioma cells (Fig. 2), whereas colchicine-B treatment had no effect on the expression of either MMP-9 or MMP-2. These results confirm that induced production of MMP-9 in SNB19 cells and constitutive expression of MMP-9 in HT1080 cells were lost when the cytoskeletal organization was altered, suggesting that the loss of MMP-9 could be caused by the alteration in actin polymerization and subsequent shape modulation of SNB19 cells. Total actin content by fluorescent estimation of rhodamine phalloidin showed that the total quantity of the actin is not changed during the treatment conditions (results not shown), ruling out the idea that the observed effects are caused by changes in actin content. Cells grown as three-dimensional spheroids were treated with PMA to find out whether these cells (which do not spread and do not form polymerized actin) respond to PMA and express MMP-9. Interestingly, these spheroids failed to express MMP-9 (Fig. 7), unlike monolayer cultures. Because cytochalasin-D is known to alter the polymerization of actin, experiments were performed to examine the changes in cell spreading and actin polymerization by TRITC-phalloidin staining. Cytochalasin-D-treated cells showed inhibition of actin polymerization when the cells were treated during spreading, whereas cells treated after spreading retained efficient cytoskeleton. In contrast, colchicine-B-treated cells, although showing some morphological changes, expressed organized cytoskeleton efficiently (Fig. 5). Actin cytoskeletons terminate at focal adhesion contacts in fully spread cells, and it has been shown that expression of FAK, phosphorylation of FAK, or both modulate the expression of a variety of events including migration and invasion (41Akasaka T. van Leeuwen R.L. Yoshinaga I.G. Mihm M.C. Byers H.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 104-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 6 show that control cells as well as PMA-treated cells expressed FAK protein as observed on Western blots. Interestingly, FAK expression was lost completely in cytochalasin-D cells only when the cells were treated during spreading, whereas cells allowed to spread and then treated with cytochalasin-D retained FAK expression. On the other hand, colchicine-B-treated cells always expressed FAK irrespective of when colchicine-B was added. These results suggest that cytoskeletal organization and FAK expression are essential for the induction of MMP-9 but not of MMP-2 as MMP-2 is always expressed in these cells, including HT1080 cells. To understand whether NF-κB (an upstream regulator that induces the expression of MMP-9) was altered by changes in actin polymerization, nuclear extracts prepared from various treatment conditions were examined for the NF-κB expression by gel mobility shift assays. Interestingly, PMA-induced NF-κB expression was reduced to some extent in cytochalasin-D-treated cells but not in colchicine-B-treated cells, showing that NF-κB expression also is regulated by actin polymerization. Although the exact biochemical process by which depolymerization of actin leads to activation of NF-κB remains to be elucidated, the present findings establish a role for NF-κB in sensing the changes in the state of the cytoskeleton and converting them to changes in gene activity. Because cytoskeletal changes are likely to be induced by cell-substrate and cell-cell interaction, this process would provide signal transduction pathways by which these physical interactions can modulate gene expression and thereby affect glioma tumor cell invasion. PKC, an enzyme essential to the cellular response of phorbol ester (19Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar), plays an important role in MMP signal transduction. In previous studies by other investigators, abnormally high levels of PKC activity in glioblastomas were reported compared with those of nontransformed glia (42Couldwell W.T. Uhm J.H. Antel J.P. Yong W.W. Neurosurgery. 1990; 29: 880-887Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 43Couldwell W.T. deTribolet N. Antel J.P. Gauthier T. Kuppner M.C. Neurosurgery. 1991; 76: 782-791Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, PKC also plays an important role in cell migration, invasion (44Szaniawska B. Maternicka K. Kowalczyk D. Miloszewska J. Janik P. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 45Schwartz G.K. Jiang J. Kelsen D. Albino A.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and metastatic spread of tumors (46Isakov N. Gopas J. Priel E. Segal S. Altman A. Invasion Metastasis. 1991; 11: 14-24PubMed Google Scholar), and glioma cell invasion (47Uhm J.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.-G. Yong V.W. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In our study, treating cells with calphostin-C (a highly specific inhibitor of PKC) led to a decrease in MMP-9 and to some extent in MMP-2 in SNB19 cells (Fig. 9) with a concomitant decrease in invasion through Matrigel (Fig. 10). Other highly selective inhibitors of tyrosine kinase and cAMP-dependent kinase inhibitors had no effect on MMP expression (Fig. 9). These results are similar to the earlier reports wherein phorbol ester induced the expression of MMP with a concomitant increase in glioma cell invasion (47Uhm J.H. Dooley N.P. Villemure J.-G. Yong V.W. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, earlier studies showed that PMA-induced PKC also controlled actin polymerization by maintaining the cell shape and F-actin levels (48Trachsel S. Keller H.U. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our results show that cell shape alteration, particularly inhibition of actin polymerization, results in inhibition of MMP-9 but not MMP-2 in glioblastomas; this indicates that these two enzymes are activated by distinct signaling mechanisms."

The C/EBPε protein is highly conserved between rodents and humans, and its domain structure is very similar to C/EBPα.

Within the hematopoietic system, C/EBPε is expressed primarily in myeloid cells, including promyelocytes, myelomonocytes, and their differentiated progeny. To identify potential functions of C/EBPε, cell lines over-expressing the C/EBPε protein were generated in the P388 lymphoblastic cell line. In contrast to the parental cell line, C/EBPε-expressing cell lines displayed lipopolysaccharide-inducible expression of the interleukin-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) genes as well as elevated basal expression of the MIP-1α and MIP-1β chemokine genes. In the EML-C1 hematopoietic stem cell line, C/EBPε mRNA levels increased as the cells progressed along the myeloid lineage, just preceding activation of the gene encoding the receptor for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSFR). M-CSFR expression was stimulated in C/EBPε-expressing P388 cell lines, when compared with either the parental P388 cells or P388 cell lines expressing either C/EBPα or C/EBPβ. These results suggest that C/EBPε may be an important regulator of differentiation of a subset of myeloid cell types and may also participate in the regulation of cytokine gene expression in mature cells.

Williams S.C. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). The C/EBP proteins are basic region/leucine zipper transcription factors that bind to the consensus sequence 5′ ATTGCGCAAT 3′ and variants thereof (2Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6919-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Individual members of this family have been implicated as regulators of differentiation in multiple cell types, including hepatocytes, adipocytes, and certain blood cell types. In the hematopoietic system, C/EBPs are expressed primarily in myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and their precursors (3Natsuka S. Akira S. Nishio Y. Hashimoto S. Sugita T. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1992; 79: 460-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPα mRNA has been detected in primitive (CD34+ and CD38−) progenitor cells, and its expression is specifically up-regulated when these cells are induced to differentiate along the granulocytic lineage but not the monocytic lineage (5Cheng T. Shen H. Gere J. Tenen D.G. Scadden D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13158-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Analysis of granulocytic differentiation of the 32DCl.3 hematopoietic progenitor cell line suggested that C/EBPα acts prior to the terminal stages of differentiation in this cell lineage (4Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, C/EBPα nullizygous mice lack mature granulocytes and contain large numbers of immature myeloid blast cells in their blood (6Zhang D.-E. Zhang P. Wang N. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Expression of both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is up-regulated during terminal differentiation of cells in both the granulocytic and monocytic lineages, and C/EBPβ appears to be the predominant C/EBP protein in mature granulocytes and macrophages (3Natsuka S. Akira S. Nishio Y. Hashimoto S. Sugita T. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1992; 79: 460-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiation-specific functions for C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ have not been clearly defined as yet, although both are capable of collaborating with wild type and oncogenic forms of the Myb transcription factor to activate macrophage-specific genes in heterologous cell types (7Ness S.A. Kowenz-Leutz E. Casini T. Graf T. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The primary functions of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ within the hematopoietic system appear to be in the regulation of a number of cytokine and other genes during inflammatory responses (3Natsuka S. Akira S. Nishio Y. Hashimoto S. Sugita T. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1992; 79: 460-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T.

Mice carrying a null mutation in the C/EBPβ gene display essentially normal myeloid development but exhibit marked defects in bacterial killing and cytostatic functions (12Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V.

Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that C/EBPβ has been proposed to be a critical regulator of cytokine gene expression in activated macrophages, LPS-dependent induction of cytokine gene expression was essentially identical in macrophages isolated from wild type and mutant mice. The relatively normal pattern of cytokine gene expression in C/EBPβ null mice is likely to be due to functional redundancy among family members (14Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). A detailed molecular analysis of the roles of individual C/EBP proteins over the entire spectrum of myeloid differentiation has been hampered by technical difficulties in isolating and culturing progenitor cells from bone marrow and by the transformed phenotype of most immortalized cell lines. An alternative approach is now possible with the recent establishment of an immortalized hematopoietic progenitor cell line, named EML-C1 (15Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The EML-C1 cell line was derived by infecting mouse bone marrow cells with a retrovirus expressing a dominant negative retinoic acid receptor α molecule and proliferates in culture in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF). The dominant negative retinoic acid receptor molecule specifically blocks differentiation along the myeloid lineage; however, the addition of relatively high levels of retinoic acid (10−5m) overcomes this block and induces granulocytic and monocytic differentiation. Consequently, using the EML-C1 cell line, it is possible to determine the temporal pattern of expression of any gene over the entire myeloid differentiation process and to predict functions for genes of interest based on this information. We previously reported the cloning and partial characterization of a gene encoding rat C/EBPε, then named C/EBP-related protein 1 (CRP1) (16Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We have now completed the characterization of the C/EBPε gene and report that it encodes a 281-amino acid transcriptional activator that binds to the same DNA target as other C/EBPs. C/EBPε is expressed almost exclusively in hematopoietic tissues in mouse, specifically in myeloid cells, and its expression is up-regulated during myeloid differentiation of the EML-C1 cell line. Ectopic expression of C/EBPε confers novel transcriptional properties on a heterologous, lymphoid cell line, including the ability to support LPS-stimulated expression of multiple cytokine genes and activation of the gene encoding the receptor for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. Isolation of the rat C/EBPε genomic clone was described previously (16Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A mouse C/EBPε cDNA was isolated by PCR amplification of cDNA generated from total RNA isolated from the P388D1(IL-1) macrophage cell line using the amplimers CRP1 ATG-4 (GACGGCCCATGGCCCACGGGACCTAC) and S1PCRp1 (GACGGCAAGCTTGGCTCAGCTGCAGCCCCC). This PCR product was subsequently used to screen a mouse 129SV genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and nine positive clones were isolated which together spanned 18 kilobase pairs of the C/EBPε locus, including the complete coding sequence. DNA sequencing was carried out using the Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under standard conditions, except that in double-stranded sequencing reactions, nonspecifically terminated fragments were extended by incubation in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and all four nucleotides prior to addition of the stop solution. DNA sequences were analyzed using the SEQED, BESTFIT, PILEUP, and GELASSEMBLE programs of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group package. The 5′ end of C/EBPε mRNA molecules was mapped by 5′-RACE using Marathon-Ready cDNA from mouse spleen (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The first round of PCR reactions (see below for details) was carried out using 0.1 ng of cDNA and 150 ng of a C/EBPε gene-specific primer (CRP1 100–80, CTTCAGGCGTTGGCTTCATGG) and adaptor primer 1 provided with the cDNA. A second round of PCR was then carried out on an aliquot of the first reaction using two nested primers (CRP1 64–44, TAGCTGTTCTTCCCCAGACTC and AP2), and the products were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and positive subclones were sequenced. Although several potential cap sites were identified by this procedure, only those that appeared in several (n >3) independent clones were considered to represent bona fide transcriptional start sites. Total RNA was prepared from tissues and cells using a modified guanidine isothiocyanate/phenol extraction procedure and analyzed by Northern blotting and hybridization as described previously (17Nalbant D. Williams S.C. Stocco D.M. Khan S.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The C/EBPε probe was an 850-bp NcoI/HindIII fragment containing the complete murine cDNA, and the MCP-1 probe was a 580-bp murine cDNA (18Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was carried out essentially as described (19Tan S.S. Weis J.H. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 0.2 μg of oligo(dT)18 and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 50 μl for 1 h at 37 °C. 3 μl of the RT reaction was then mixed with 1 μl of 10× Buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2.5 mg/ml crystalline bovine serum albumin, and MgCl2 at 10, 20, or 30 mm (Idaho Technology Inc., Idaho Falls, ID)), 0.2 mm each dNTP, 150 ng of each primer, and 1.25 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Fisher) in a total volume of 10 μl. Reactions were loaded into a capillary tube, and PCR cycles were carried out using the Rapidcycler Thermal cycler (Idaho Technology). Annealing temperatures and Mg2+ concentrations were initially optimized for each primer pair. In most cases, PCR was carried out at 2 mm MgCl2 with the following cycle parameters: 94 °C, 15 s, 1 cycle; 94 °C, 0 s, 60 °C, 0 s, 72 °C, 25 s, 30 cycles; 72 °C, 30 s, 1 cycle. Reaction products were visualized in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, and images were captured as PICT files using UVP ImageStore 7500 Gel Documentation software, cropped in Adobe Photoshop version 3.0.4, and annotated using Macromedia Freehand version 7.0. Accuracy and linearity of RT-PCR results was confirmed by varying input cDNA concentration, cycle number, and by comparing results with those from quantitative Northern blots (see Fig. 2 for example).

Supershift assays were carried out by preincubating the nuclear extract with a rabbit polyclonal C/EBPε-specific antiserum directed against amino acids 266–279 of the rat polypeptide. The complete C/EBPε coding sequence, including the intron, was amplified from the rat genomic clone by PCR using two oligonucleotide primers (CRP1 ATG-4 and S1PCRp1, see above) that overlap the initiation codon and termination codon, respectively. The resultant PCR product was digested with NcoI andHindIII (incorporated as part of the amplimers) inserted into the pMEX eukaryotic expression vector (16Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) to generate pMEXC/EBPεp34. The amplified region was sequenced to check for errors and was shown, after transient transfection into a number of cell types, to direct the synthesis of a 34,000 molecular weight protein that was recognized by a C/EBPε-specific antiserum (data not shown). pMEXC/EBPεp34 was digested with HindIII, and the 5′ overhangs were made blunt using Klenow, and a BamHI linker was added. This construct was then digested with BamHI, and the full coding sequence was inserted into the pSV(x) expression vector (20Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to generate pSV(x)C/EBPεp34. Inserted genes in pSV(x) are expressed from the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat with a subgenomic splicing product expressing the neomycin resistance gene for selection of stably transfected cell lines. 106 P388 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pSV(x)C/EBPεp34 expression vector using 40 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously for the generation of C/EBPβ expressing P388 cell lines (20Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Selection was carried out at three concentrations of G418 (150, 250, and 350 μg/ml), and four independent pools of resistant cells (named P388-Cε-1 to Cε-4) were established. Expression of the C/EBPε transgene was confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and EMSA. The sequence of 2391 bp of a rat C/EBPε genomic clone is presented in Fig.1 A along with the predicted peptide sequence of the C/EBPε protein. The C/EBPε gene contains a single intron with two potential splice acceptor sites (indicated as underlined AG dinucleotides). Sequencing of RT-PCR products generated using C/EBPε-specific primers confirmed that the more 5′ splice acceptor sequence is apparently exclusively utilized, at least in hematopoietic cells (see below). Examination of the 5′ end of the C/EBPε coding sequence revealed an in frame translation initiation codon located 96 bp upstream of the AUG codon described previously (16Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Consequently, conceptual translation of the longest open reading frame predicts that the full-length C/EBPε protein is 281, rather than 249, amino acids in length. The 5′ end of C/EBPε mRNA was determined by sequencing of 5′-RACE products generated from adult mouse spleen cDNA. Several potential start sites were identified; however, only three of these appeared in multiple subclones and are included in Fig. 1 A. These sites are likely to be bona fide start sites as they map close to start sites identified for the Pβ promoter of the human C/EBPε gene (21Yamanaka R. Kim G.-D. Radomska H.S. Lekstrom-Himes J. Smith L.T. Antonson P. Tenen D.G. Xanthopoulos K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The sequences around the cap sites are purine-rich and lack common promoter elements such as TATA and CCAAT boxes, a feature shared with many genes expressed in myeloid cells. The complete coding sequence of the C/EBPε gene has now been determined in three species, rat, mouse, and human, and the sequences of these three proteins are compared in Fig. 1 B. The sequence of the C/EBPε protein is highly conserved, displaying 98% identity between rat and mouse and 93% between rat and human. The most highly conserved regions are the first 50 amino acids, which contain sequences that function as a transcriptional activation domain (22Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal sequences that contain the DNA-binding domain (16Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A structural comparison of the four members of the C/EBP family is shown in Fig. 1 C, with regions of significant similarity indicated by shading. The structure of C/EBPε displays greatest similarity to C/EBPα and C/EBPδ, containing an N-terminal tripartite activation domain and a second activation domain close to the center of the protein. Previously, we were unable to detect C/EBPε mRNA in a number of adult mouse tissues, suggesting that C/EBPε is expressed in a limited temporal or spatial pattern or in tissues omitted from our original survey. In an expanded Northern blot survey, we detected a strong signal at approximately 1.8 kilobase pairs in RNA prepared from adult bone marrow (Fig. 2 A, lane 5), with weak signals in embryonic liver and adult spleen (lanes 1 and3). Because C/EBPε appears to be expressed at low levels, even in positive tissues, we used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to carry out a more extensive survey. Primers were chosen to flank the single intron within the C/EBPε gene to ensure that PCR products generated from cDNA could be distinguished from products synthesized from a genomic template. In agreement with the Northern analysis, C/EBPε mRNA was detected in embryonic liver and adult bone marrow and spleen, each of which are hematopoietic tissues. C/EBPε mRNA was essentially absent from all other tissues analyzed although low levels were detected in adult lung, which may be due to infiltration of this tissue with blood cells. In this and all subsequent RT-PCR assays, a single amplified product was observed which corresponds to a spliced mRNA utilizing the 5′ splice acceptor site described above. By having shown that C/EBPε is expressed in hematopoietic tissues, and at highest levels in bone marrow, RNA from a panel of rodent cell lines was analyzed by RT-PCR to determine which cell types within the hematopoietic system express C/EBPε (Fig.3). C/EBPε mRNA was detected in 12 out of 13 cell lines of myeloid origin, the lone exception being the immature myeloid FDCP-1 cell line (Fig. 3 A). The highest level of C/EBPε mRNA was detected in cell lines arrested at the promyelocyte stage of myeloid development (EPRO and MPRO) and two IL-3-dependent myeloid cell lines (NFS-58 and DA-3), whereas lower levels were detected in two myelomonocytic leukemic cell lines (M1 and WEHI-3). C/EBPε mRNA was also detected in five monocytic/macrophage cell lines including M-CSF-dependent M-NFS-60 cells and the factor-independent cell lines WEHI-274.1, GG2EE, P388D1(IL-1), and IC-21. C/EBPε mRNA was not detected in cell lines representative of erythroid, mast cell, basophil, or T cell lineages and was present in only one cell line (P388) derived from the B cell lineage (Fig. 3 B). As further confirmation of the restricted pattern of expression of C/EBPε, RNA was prepared from purified populations of primary murine blood cells (Fig.3 C). High levels of C/EBPε mRNA were detected in granulocytes and macrophages but not in B cells, T cells, or erythrocytes. We next performed Western blot analysis to examine the expression of C/EBPε at the protein level in selected rodent cell lines. Whole cell protein extracts from a subset of the cell lines described above were analyzed by Western blotting using a C/EBPε-specific antiserum (Fig.4). A single M r34,000 protein was detected in M1 myelomonocytic cells, and P388D1(IL-1) macrophage cells but not in other cell lines, including some that contain C/EBPε mRNA. The inability to detect C/EBPε protein in all cell lines containing C/EBPε mRNA may simply be due to the fact that the amount of C/EBPε protein in these samples is below the level of sensitivity of our Western blotting procedure or may indicate that C/EBPε expression is regulated at a post-transcriptional stage. Comparison of the size of the C/EBPε protein detected in P388D1(IL-1) cells with recombinant C/EBPε proteins confirmed that the methionine residue indicated as amino acid 1 in Fig. 1 A is the primary site of translational initiation (data not shown). P388 is a murine B lymphoblastic cell line that does not express detectable levels of any C/EBP proteins, despite the presence of C/EBPε mRNA (see Fig. 4 and below). This cell line was previously used to analyze the functions of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ (14Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bretz J.D. Williams S.C. Baer M. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7306-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We established four G418-resistant lines using a C/EBPε-expression vector. C/EBPε mRNA levels in three of the four cell lines (P388-Cε-1, Cε-3, and Cε-4) were elevated compared with those in the control P388-Neo cell line as assessed by RT-PCR (Fig.5 A) and Northern blotting (data not shown). In addition, C/EBPε mRNA levels were unchanged in C/EBPβ-expressing P388-Cβ cells (Fig. 5 A, comparelanes 1 and 2) or in P388 cell lines expressing either C/EBPα or C/EBPδ (data not shown), consistent with our previous findings that overexpression of one C/EBP protein in P388 cells does not activate expression of other family members (14Hu H.-M. Baer M. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. Schwartz R.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2334-2342PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the elevated mRNA levels resulted in expression of C/EBPε protein in these cell lines, an EMSA was performed using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a consensus C/EBP-binding site, and a representative result showing P388-Cε-3 is shown in Fig.5 B.

https://openalex.org/W2332042630,"The RHO1 gene encodes a homolog of mammalian RhoA small G protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have shown that Bni1p is one of the downstream targets of Rho1p and regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through the interaction with profilin, an actin monomer-binding protein. A Bni1p-binding protein was affinity purified from the yeast cytosol fraction and was identified to be Tef1p/Tef2p, translation elongation factor 1alpha (EF1alpha). EF1alpha is an essential component of the protein synthetic machinery and also possesses the actin filament (F-actin)-binding and -bundling activities. EF1alpha bound to the 186 amino acids region of Bni1p, located between the FH1 domain, the proline-rich profilin-binding domain, and the FH2 domain, of which function is not known. The binding of Bni1p to EF1alpha inhibited its F-actin-binding and -bundling activities. The BNI1 gene deleted in the EF1alpha-binding region did not suppress the bni1 bnr1 mutation in which the actin organization was impaired. These results suggest that the Rho1p-Bni1p system regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through the interaction with both EF1alpha and profilin."

Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Cleavage of these and other possible caspase targets is likely to result in changes that occur in a cell undergoing apoptosis by mediating events that are required further downstream, such as abrogation of the repair mechanisms, detachment of the apoptotic cell from surrounding cells/tissue, disruption of the cytoskeleton, initiation of DNA fragmentation, and the formation and engulfment of apoptotic bodies (4Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is not accompanied by random cleavage of a large number of proteins and electrophoresis patterns of proteins from early apoptotic cells do not significantly differ from nonapoptotic cells (12Waterhouse N. Kumar S. Song Q. Strike P. Sparrow L. Dreyfuss G. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Lavin M.F. Watters D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29335-29341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additionally, the specificity of caspases involved clearly argues against a large number of proteins being degraded during apoptosis. Thus the proteins that are targeted specifically for degradation by caspases are likely to play some vital role in the apoptotic process. Therefore, it is necessary to identify all caspase substrates that are cleaved during apoptosis so that a clearer picture can emerge about the significance of caspase-mediated proteolysis in apoptosis. In the present study we describe a novel target, Nedd4, for caspase-mediated cleavage during apoptosis. Nedd4 was initially identified as a developmentally regulated gene in the mouse (33Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Nedd4 is widely expressed in many tissues and cell types and encodes an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin-protein ligase (34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C1871-C1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a ubiquitin-protein ligase domain, Nedd4 protein contains multiple WW domains and a calcium/lipid-binding (CaLB) domain (34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Through its WW domains, Nedd4 has been shown to interact with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits (35Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), hematopoietic transcription factor p45/NF-E2, and RNA polymerase II (38Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M. Shen C.-K.J.

Here we show that in cells undergoing apoptosis in response to various agents, Nedd4 is specifically cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner. The kinetics of Nedd4 cleavage are similar to that of caspase activation and the cleavage of another caspase substrate, PARP. The Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines BL29, BL30A, BM13674, and BL30K were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing either 20% (BL30A) or 10% (BL30K, BL29, and BM13674) fetal calf serum. Jurkat and Daudi cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, while HeLa, NIH-3T3, and COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with 200 ng/ml anti-APO-1/Fas antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) or by exposure to either tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (10 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), etoposide (40 μm), C-8 ceramide (20 μm), or 20 gray of γ-radiation from a137Cs source. The extent of apoptosis was monitored by microscopic examination of cellular nuclei stained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole. Etoposide or Fas antibody-treated Jurkat cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mmPIPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 20 min then lysed by freeze/thawing. Lysates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were then centrifuged at 9000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored in aliquots at −70 °C until used. A polyclonal antibody (N4ab1) raised against the region of Nedd4 encompassing amino acids 210–720 of mouse Nedd4 has been described previously (34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An additional polyclonal rabbit serum (N4ab2) was raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the three WW domains (amino acid residues 235–511) of mouse Nedd4. 2A. Dinudom, K. F. Harvey, P. Komwatana, J. A. Young, S. Kumar, and D. I. Cook, submitted for publication. Escherichia coli cultures were induced for 3–5 h with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and glutathioneS-transferase-WW fusion protein purified by affinity chromatography according to the instructions provided by Pharmacia Biotech Inc. To raise rabbit antisera, 300 μg of affinity purified glutathione S-transferase-WW protein mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant were inoculated subcutaneously at multiple sites. Boosters, at monthly intervals, consisted of 200 μg of the fusion protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant introduced subcutaneously. Rabbits were bled 6–10 days post-booster, and antibody titers were determined by immunoblotting. All injections and animal handling were carried out according to approved protocols. N4ab2 was affinity-purified on an antigen-coupled Sepharose column. Cell extracts (10–20 μg of protein) were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue) for 5 min then centrifuged at 9000 ×g for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride (Dupont) or nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. Blots were probed with either N4ab1 (total serum) at 1/5000 dilution for 1 h, affinity-purified N4ab2 at 1/1000 for 1 h, an anti-ICH-1L rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at a 1/500 dilution for 4 h, an anti-PARP polyclonal antiserum (Boehringer Mannheim) at a dilution of 1/2000 for 1 h or an anti-CPP32 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) at a dilution of 1/1000 for 4 h, at room temperature. Following incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). Recombinant caspases were expressed inE. coli as described previously (9Song Q. Lees-Miller S.P. Kumar S. Zhang N. Chan D.W. Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing bacteria carrying the protease expression plasmids were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–6 h and lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, and 0.1% CHAPS. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and clear bacterial extracts were collected and stored at −20 °C. To confirm the activity of proteases, aliquots of the extracts were incubated with 100 μm DEVD-AFC [Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-(7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin)] for caspase-2, -3, -6, and -7 or 100 μm YVAD-AFC [Z-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-(7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin)] for caspase-1, for 30 min at 37 °C and release of AFC was measured by spectrofluorometry at excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 505 nm, respectively (39Harvey N.L. Butt A.J. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13134-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both substrates and caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (California). N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chrolomethyl ketone (YVAD-cmk) and N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp aldehyde (DEVD-CHO) were from Bachem (Switzerland). Site-directed mutagenesis of mouse Nedd4 cDNA in a pBluescript vector (Stratagene) was carried out according to a published protocol (40Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Asp residues at position 237 (DQPD237), 288 (DLTD288), 293 (DNDD293), and 316 (DGPD316) of mouse Nedd4 (34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) were replaced with Gly. Various wild-type and mutant Nedd4 cDNA constructs in pBluescript (SK+) were used as templates for coupled transcription/translation using a T7 kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine (ICN). In addition to full-length mouse Nedd4, modified versions of wild-type and mutant cDNAs encoding carboxyl-terminally truncated proteins were generated by removing a 1.0-kilobase pair HindIII fragment from the 3′-end of the coding frame. 35S-Labeled Nedd4 protein was incubated with the appropriate recombinant caspase or extract from apoptotic Jurkat cells for 3 h at 37 °C. Approximately equivalent amounts of caspases (as determined by active site titration usingZ-VAD-fmk) or up to 50 μg of cell extracts were used. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and exposed to x-ray film. For cell death assays, NIH-3T3 cells were plated at 2.5 × 105/well in 6-well dishes the day before transfection. For each well, we used 2 μg of the Nedd4 or Nedd2 cDNA cloned into pCXN2 expression plasmid (41Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst .). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) mixed with 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pEF-β-galactosidase). All transfections were carried out using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were fixed, stained with X-gal 18–24 h post-transfection, and observed by light microscopy as described previously (42Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The pCXN2-Nedd2 construct was used as a positive control and has been described previously (42Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). To check whether Nedd4 cleavage occurs in vivoduring apoptosis mediated by a physiological stimulus, we exposed Jurkat T cells to an apoptosis-inducing Fas antibody and monitored the cleavage of Nedd4 by immunoblotting. For immunoblotting we employed two different polyclonal Nedd4 antibodies (N4ab1 and N4ab2), both of which detect the mouse and the human Nedd4 protein of 120~,130 kDa. Although the predicted size of mouse Nedd4 is 103 kDa, while human Nedd4 is approximately 5 kDa larger than the mouse protein due to the presence of an additional WW domain, in SDS-polyacrylamide gels these proteins migrate more slowly, giving a larger apparent molecular weight (34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In some human cell lines, a smaller band of approximately 110 kDa is also detected by both antibodies, which we believe is derived from alternative splicing or represents a proteolytic fragment of Nedd4 (Fig. 1). This smaller band has also been noted in rat tissues using two independently raised antibodies against rat Nedd4 protein (37Staub O. Yeger H. Plant P.J. Kim H. Ernst S.A. Rotin D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1871-C1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both antibodies detected identical Nedd4 cleavage products during Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells, therefore data with N4ab2 only are shown (Fig. 1). Within 2 h of Fas antibody treatment, disappearance of both Nedd4 bands was clearly visible concomitant with the appearance of a 95-kDa band. By 4 h no intact Nedd4 protein was visible. The time course of cleavage of Nedd4 was similar to that of PARP cleavage in these cells (Fig. 1). Both the cleavage of Nedd4 and PARP was completely inhibited when Jurkat cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody in the presence of the general cell-permeable caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1). We further investigated whether cleavage of Nedd4 correlated with the activation of caspases. As revealed by the appearance of caspase subunits and disappearance of precursors, both caspase-2 and caspase-3 were rapidly activated following antibody ligation. The time course of activation of both these caspases was similar to the time course of Nedd4 and PARP cleavage, suggesting that cleavage of Nedd4 is dependent on the onset of apoptosis and is likely to be mediated by caspases. To check whether Nedd4 cleavage occurs in response to treatment by other apoptosis inducing agents, we subjected Jurkat T cells to 40 μm etoposide treatment. Cleavage of Nedd4 protein, similar to that seen when Jurkat cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody was evident, although the kinetics of cleavage were slower reflecting slower apoptotic induction (Fig.2). For example at 8 h after treatment with etoposide, 43% of cells showed apoptotic morphology, as compared with 72% observed for Fas antibody treated cells at the same time point. Again, the time course of Nedd4 cleavage was identical to PARP cleavage and the appearance of caspase-2 and caspase-3 subunits, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). We further analyzed whether other cell types undergoing apoptosis also show cleavage of Nedd4 protein. In the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL30A treated with either C-8 ceramide or γ-radiation, BM13674 cells treated with γ-radiation, and HeLa cells treated with TNF-α, Nedd4 cleavage similar to that seen in Jurkat cells was clearly evident (Fig. 3,A and B). Although the major cleavage product in all cases was a 95-kDa band, in BM13674 cells, and to some extent BL30A cells, intermediate size bands were also visible (Fig. 3 A). In HeLa cells treated with TNF-α, significant Nedd4 cleavage was evident by 4 h when only a fraction of cells (<15%) appeared apoptotic as assessed by nuclear staining (Fig. 3 B). In three Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines that are resistant to apoptosis induced by γ-radiation (43Khanna K.K. Wie T. Song Q. Burrows S.R. Moss D.J. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Lavin M.F. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar) no cleavage of Nedd4 was evident (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that Nedd4 cleavage is a general apoptosis-related phenomenon and not restricted to a particular cell type or to a specific apoptosis-inducing agent. An examination of Nedd4 protein sequence showed that it contains several DXXD (consensus sequence for cleavage by downstream caspases such as caspase-3 and -7, Ref. 44Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) sequences which are conserved in mouse, rat and human proteins (34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Nedd4 protein can be cleaved by caspases in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4, indeed both human and mouse Nedd4 proteins were cleaved by caspase-1, -3, -6, and -7, and extracts from apoptotic cells, but not by caspase-2. The major cleavage products in all cases were roughly similar in size suggesting that the recombinant caspases, and caspases activated in apoptotic Jurkat cells cleave Nedd4 either at the same sites or in the same vicinity. Mouse Nedd4 generated fragments of 90 kDa and a doublet of around 25 kDa when treated with caspase-1, -7, and apoptotic cell extracts, while caspase-3 and -6 produced a single band around 25 kDa in addition to the 90-kDa fragment (Fig. 4 A). Cleavage of mouse Nedd4 by caspases and cell extracts also generated a cleavage intermediate of around 115 kDa. With human Nedd4, the main cleavage products were approximately 95 and 20 kDa in size (Fig. 4 B). The intermediate corresponding to the 115-kDa mouse Nedd4 product was not evident and a doublet of around 20 kDa was seen with caspase-1 and caspase-6. These results showed that there is at least one caspase cleavage site common to both mouse and human proteins. Incubation of apoptotic cell extracts with 100 nm DEVD-CHO, but not 100 nm YVAD-cmk abolished their Nedd4 cleaving activity, suggesting that a caspase-3-like protease in cell extracts mediates the cleavage of Nedd4. The two antibodies used in this study were raised against residues 210–720 (N4ab1) and residues 235–511 (N4ab2) of the Nedd4 protein (Fig.5). Both detected the same 95-kDa human Nedd4 cleavage product which was identical in size to that seen inin vitro cleavage experiments. The smaller fragments of Nedd4 (20–25 kDa) seen in in vitro cleavage assays were not detected by either antibody. Therefore we predicted that the major cleavage site may be located 20–25 kDa from either the amino or carboxyl terminus of the Nedd4 protein. Although there are three DXXD sequences conserved in mouse, human and rat Nedd4 sequences (Fig. 5), only one (DQPD237 in mouse or DQPD206 in known human sequence) would generate the expected size fragments. We therefore generated a truncated form of mouse Nedd4 protein lacking the two carboxyl-terminal DXXD sites (DVND774 and DGVD887). When subjected to digestion by recombinant caspases, the truncated Nedd4 protein was cleaved generating fragments of about 25 kDa, possibly representing the amino terminus of the protein, and 55 kDa from the region downstream of the 25-kDa fragment (Fig. 6). In the mouse Nedd4 sequence, besides the DQPD237, three other DXXD sequences DLTD288, DNDD293, and DGPD316 are located in the vicinity of the putative cleavage site (Fig. 5). We altered all four putative cleavage sites by replacing the P-1 Asp with a Gly. While D288G, D293G, and D316G had no effect on cleavage of mouse Nedd4 by various caspases (data not shown), the D237G mutation in mouse sequence abolished the generation of both 55- and 25-kDa fragments by caspase-1, -3, -7, and apoptotic cell extracts, without affecting cleavage by caspase-6 (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that in vitro cleavage by caspases-1, -3, and -7 occurs at Asp237↓ in mouse protein (Asp238 in rat and Asp206 in the incomplete human sequence lacking the amino terminus, Ref. 34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In all mutants, the generation of the 75-kDa intermediate (equivalent to the 115-kDa intermediate of full-length Nedd4) was not affected (Fig.6 B). We believe that this fragment arises due to cleavage of mouse Nedd4 at the DVTD41↓ site. No corresponding site is present in the known human sequence, and accordingly, the intermediate product is not seen in human Nedd4 incubated with various caspases or apoptotic cell extracts (Fig. 4 B).Figure 6Mapping of the caspase cleavage sites in Nedd4 protein. Truncated versions of the wild type (A) or D237G mutant (B) Nedd4 proteins were translated from cDNA constructs lacking the coding region for the carboxyl-terminal 352 residues of the mouse Nedd4 protein. 35S-Labeled proteins were exposed to various caspases and extracts from apoptotic Jurkat cells (CE) as described in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To check whether Nedd4 cleavage can alter the apoptotic response in cells, we attempted to generate mammalian cells stably expressing high levels of transfected wild-type and D237G mutant Nedd4. Despite several attempts, we were unable to generate such cells which led us to conclude that constitutively high level expression of Nedd4 may be cytotoxic and such cells are progressively deleted during G418 selection of transfectants. In further experiments to understand the significance of Nedd4 cleavage in apoptosis, we analyzed whether full length Nedd4 or its cleavage fragments can induce cell death. The rationale for this was based on the knowledge that caspase cleavage of proteins such as PAK-2 and Bcl-2 can generate products which are able to promote apoptotic changes (25Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat.

Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). We transiently transfected NIH-3T3 cells with various Nedd4 expression constructs. While a Nedd2 (caspase-2) expression construct efficiently killed transfected cells, neither the wild-type, mutant, or a truncated Nedd4 showed any significant cell killing activity (Fig.7). Several proteins have recently been shown to be cleaved during apoptosis by caspases. Here we have discovered Nedd4 as another target of caspases. Nedd4 was first identified as a developmentally down-regulated gene in the mouse central nervous system (33Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It contains a region homologous to the E6AP carboxyl terminus (thehect domain), three WW domains (four in the human protein) and a CaLB domain (34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Recently, Nedd4 was shown to have ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (36Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rat Nedd4 binds to all three subunits (α, β, and γ) of the ENaC via its WW domains (35Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Nedd4 binds to the ENaC by contacting the proline rich PY motifs, located in the C-terminal region of the subunits of ENaC shown to be mutated in Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of hypertension (35Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In mandibular gland duct cells, Nedd4 mediates the down-regulation of ENaC activity in response to increased intracellular sodium.2 A recent study shows that the WW domains of Nedd4 also interact with RNA polymerase II and the hematopoietic transcription factor p45/NF-E2in vitro (38Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M. Shen C.-K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24105-24108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although Nedd4 is widely expressed in many tissues (34Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C1871-C1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its expression is temporally and spatially regulated during embryonic development and it is likely that it interacts with other as yet undiscovered proteins. 3S. Kumar and K. F. Harvey, unpublished data. Therefore, it is predicted that Nedd4 is involved in regulating a number of cellular proteins through ubiquitination. From the mutagenesis studies, one of the cleavage sites in Nedd4 protein was mapped as a DQPD↓ sequence, present in both mouse and human proteins. This sequence is also conserved in rat Nedd4 (35Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). As DXXD is the preferred cleavage sequence for caspase-2, -3, and -7 (44Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar), it would appear that in vivo one or more of these caspases mediate the cleavage of Nedd4 during apoptosis. In vitro cleavage data suggest that both mouse and human Nedd4 proteins are cleaved by caspase-1, -3, -6, and -7, but not caspase-2. Caspase-2 is an upstream protease based on its ability to autoprocess following homodimerization (45Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6763-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and thus it was not surprising that it did not cleave Nedd4. Inhibitor studies indicated that caspase-1 is unlikely to be involved, at least in Jurkat cells, and one or more caspase-3-like proteases are involved (Fig. 4). Caspase-6 does not appear to cleave at the DQPD↓ sequence as the D237G mutation did not affect cleavage by this caspase (Fig. 5). Moreover, DXXD is not a preferred cleavage sequence for caspase-6 (44Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Caspase-6 may thus cleave Nedd4 at another aspartate residue in the vicinity of Asp237. One likely candidate is Asp216 in mouse Nedd4 (or the corresponding Asp186 in human protein), cleavage at which would generate a fragment slightly smaller than 25 kDa, which is indeed the case (Fig.4). Based on in vitro cleavage and inhibitor studies, most of the proteins known to be degraded in apoptotic cells are predicted to be cleaved by the downstream “effector” caspases which include caspase-3, -6, and -7 (3Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 255-267PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 5Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). It is thus reasonable to assume thatin vivo cleavage of Nedd4 is also mediated by one or more of these caspases. Interestingly, the cleavage of Nedd4 removes the amino-terminal CaLB domain from the rest of the protein without disrupting the WW domains and the ubiquitin-protein ligase domain of Nedd4. As evident from ENaC studies, the WW domains in Nedd4 are responsible for binding to the target protein, while a region between the WW domains and thehect domain binds the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (36Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This would suggest that cleavage of Nedd4 by caspases during apoptosis is unlikely to disrupt substrate recognition and enzymatic activity of Nedd4. The CaLB domain of Nedd4 expressed in E. coli binds phospholipid vesicles in a calcium dependent manner (46Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In vivo, the CaLB domain is responsible for the Ca2+-dependent redistribution of Nedd4 from cytoplasm to membrane in canine kidney cells, possibly bringing it near its membrane associated targets, such as ENaC (46Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, the removal of CaLB domain during apoptosis would render Nedd4 protein unable to redistribute and bind to some of its physiological targets. We notice that in later stages of apoptosis, the 95-kDa Nedd4 cleavage product is also degraded. Thus it is also possible that removal of the amino-terminal region of Nedd4 makes it unstable and the cleaved product is degraded, perhaps by a proteasome-mediated pathway. Abrogation of Nedd4 function in apoptosis may be an energy-saving exercise, or alternatively, Nedd4 may normally be required to mediate the turnover of a protein(s) which is required for the apoptotic function. Although the significance of Nedd4 cleavage during apoptosis is not entirely clear at present, this report shows for the first time that an enzyme of the ubiquitin pathway is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. We are grateful to Dr. N. Nomura for providing the human Nedd4 cDNA."

In metabolically intact mouse anterior pituitary corticotrope (AtT20) cells glucocorticoid-induced proteins render large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels insensitive to inhibition by protein kinase A (PKA). In this study we have addressed whether this action of glucocorticoids is mediated via protein phosphatase activity at the level of single BK channels. In isolated inside-out patches from control AtT20 cells BK channels (125 pS) were inhibited by activation of closely associated PKA. Pretreatment (2 h) of cells with 1 μm dexamethasone before patch excision did not modify the intrinsic properties or expression levels of BK channel α-subunits in AtT20 cells. However, PKA-mediated inhibition of BK channel activity in isolated patches from steroid-treated cells was severely blunted. This effect of steroid was not observed using adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) as phosphate donor or on exposure of the intracellular face of the patch with 10 nm of the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A but was mimicked by application of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to the intracellular face of patches from control cells. Glucocorticoids did not modify total PP2A activity in AtT20 cells, suggesting that modified PP2A-like phosphatase activity closely associated with BK channels is required for glucocorticoid action. Adrenal glucocorticoids exert powerful effects on cellular excitability in neuroendocrine cells and neurons, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.

Glucocorticoid hormones exert profound effects on cellular excitability in endocrine and nerve cells through regulation of ion channel activity that requires the rapid induction of new proteins (1Joe¨ls M.

In turn, glucocorticoids rapidly (within 2 h) inhibit corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated secretion through the induction of new proteins (9Dayanithi G. Antoni F.A.

We have previously demonstrated in metabolically intact AtT20 D16:16 corticotropes that glucocorticoid-induced proteins render BK channels insensitive to inhibition by protein kinase A and that the action of the steroid is central for the early inhibition of adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion in this system (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Intriguingly glucocorticoids also block protein kinase A-mediated inhibition of calcium-activated potassium channels underlying the slow after-hyperpolarization in hippocampal neurons (1Joe¨ls M. De Kloet E.R. Science. 1989; 245: 1502-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 11Pedarzani P. Storm J.F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1023-1035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), suggesting that calcium-activated potassium channels are common targets for reciprocal regulation of cellular excitability by glucocorticoid-induced proteins and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. In corticotropes, glucocorticoid-induced proteins may modulate other signaling pathways to regulate BK channel activity or may directly modulate BK channel function themselves. Increasing evidence suggests that the activity of BK channels are dynamically regulated by the interaction of protein kinases and phosphatases intimately associated with the channel complex (12Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 13Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14White R.E.

Because glucocorticoids specifically antagonize PKA-mediated regulation of BK channels but notL-type calcium channels in AtT20 D16:16 cells (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that glucocorticoids may exert their effects through protein phosphatase activity at the level of the BK channel complex itself. Indeed increasing evidence from other systems suggests that glucocorticoids mediate some of their effects through regulation of serine/threonine as well as tyrosine-protein phosphatase activity (16Paliogianni F. Hama N. Balow J.E. Valentine M.A. Boumpas D.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1809-1817PubMed Google Scholar, 17Singer K.L. Stevenson B.R. Woo P.L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol.

Ang K.L. Antoni F.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and glucocorticoid receptor function in many cell types (21De Franco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) thus precluding definitive analysis of the mechanism of glucocorticoid action at the level of BK channels themselves in intact cells. Thus to directly address whether protein phosphatases are involved in the ability of glucocorticoids to block PKA-mediated inhibition of BK channel activity we have examined the regulation of BK channel activity in excised inside-out patches from control and glucocorticoid-pretreated AtT20 D16:16 corticotropes. The data in this report demonstrate that glucocorticoid regulation of BK channel activity requires protein phosphatase 2A activity closely associated with the BK channel complex. Clonal mouse anterior pituitary (AtT20 D16:16, passage 18–32) cells were maintained as described previously (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and used 3–7 days post-plating on glass coverslips. Cells were treated with 1 μm of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone or vehicle (<0.01% Me2SO) for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4, buffered with 25 mm HEPES and containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then transferred to the bath solution (dexamethasone-free) outlined below for electrophysiological recording. Regulation of single channel events in isolated inside-out patches from control or dexamethasone-treated cells was performed in parallel on the same passage of cells to avoid potential intra-passage variations in responsiveness. Single BK channel events were recorded in the inside-out patch configuration of the patch clamp technique using physiological potassium gradients. The bath (intracellular face of patch) solution contained in (mm): 140 KCl, 1 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetracetic acid, 10 HEPES, 30 glucose, 1 ATP, pH 7.35, and the respective concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ as indicated in the figure legends. The patch pipette (extracellular face of patch) contained in (mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 20 glucose, pH 7.4, containing 0.002 tetrodotoxin. Single channel events were recorded for 20–30 s every 2–5 min at the voltages indicated in the figure legends. Preliminary stability plot experiments demonstrated that BK channel activity was stable for >1 h under the recording conditions used (data not shown). Data acquisition and voltage protocols were controlled by an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). Pipettes were manufactured from Garner 7052 glass, sylgarded, with resistances of 1–3 MΩ in physiological saline after fire polishing. BK channel modulators were applied in bath solution to the intracellular face of the patch using 10 volumes of the recording bath solution (bath volume, 0.5 ml) by gravity driven perfusion at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min. For experiments with purified PP2A catalytic subunits, agents were added directly to the bath. In preliminary experiments, application of purified catalytic subunits of PKA to the intracellular face of the patch resulted in highly variable inhibitory effects on BK channel activity in this system. As such, the highly reproducible effect of cAMP was used to monitor PKA-mediated BK channel activity in subsequent experiments (see “Results”). In experiments examining regulation of single BK channel mean open channel probability (Po), change in Po (expressed as a percentage of pretreatment Po) was determined from the Po calculated before and 10 min after the application of the respective agent(s) to the intracellular face of the patch (see “Results” and “Discussion”). Crude membrane homogenates from AtT20 D16:16 cells were prepared by homogenizing ~107 cells on ice in homogenization buffer (in mm): 50 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 KCl, 1 EGTA, 1 MgCl2 containing 12 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, and 4 mm pepstatin A followed by two freeze thaw cycles. After centrifugation for 5 min 1000 × g at 4 °C the resultant supernatant was pelleted at 20,000 × g to give the crude membrane fraction. Protein samples (15 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS gel and electroblotted to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with PBS containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, (PBS-TE) and 5% (w/v) low fat milk (Marvel). Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:2000 dilution of the affinity purified antibody αslo(913–926) (directed toward residues 913–926 of the pore-forming α-subunit of mouse brain BK channels; Ref. 22Knaus H.G. Eberhart A. Koch R.O.A. Munujos P. Schmalhofer W.A. Warmke J.W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol.

Blots were washed five times with PBS-TE and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:5000 final dilution) in PBS-TE containing 5% (w/v) Marvel. After five washes in PBS-TE, blots were incubated with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol, and blots were exposed to ECL film in the linear response range (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein phosphatase activity of crude cytosolic and membrane fractions were determined by using the molybdate:malachite green:phosphate complex assay using the synthetic phosphopeptide RRA(pT)VA as substrate essentially as described by the manufacturer (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Cytosolic and crude membrane fractions were prepared from control and dexamethasone-treated AtT20 D16:16 cells as for Western blotting in homogenization buffer (in mm): 50 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 KCl, 1 EGTA, 1 MgCl2 containing 12 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 6 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzensulfonylfluoride, and 4 mm pepstatin A. To remove endogenous phosphate, cytosolic fractions were passed twice through a 10-ml bed volume of Sephadex G-25, resuspended membrane fractions were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with 10 volumes of Sephadex G-25, and the 200 ×g supernatant was washed and pelleted twice at 20,000 × g in Tris-HCl as above. Phosphatase assays were performed in a volume of 50 μl in imidazole buffer (in mm: 50 imidazole, pH 7.2, containing 0.2 EGTA, 0.02% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 30 °C using 100 μm of RRA(pT)VA as substrate. PP2A activity was determined as the difference in total phosphatase activity and phosphatase activity in the presence of 10 nm okadaic acid. Under the conditions used >80% of phosphatase activity was sensitive to 10 nm okadaic acid. Reaction was terminated by addition of the molybdate dye buffer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and absorbance was determined at 600 nm. Purified protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit and reagents for PP2A activity assay were from Promega Corporation (Southampton, UK). Calyculin A, okadaic acid, and norokadone were from LC Laboratories (Alexis Corporation Ltd., Nottingham, UK). The specific protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (PKI(5–24)) was from Sigma or Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). Tetrodotoxin was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. (Nottingham, UK). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Ltd. (Hertfordshire, UK). All other reagents were from Sigma or BDH-Merck (Poole, Dorset, UK). Dexamethasone was stored at −20 °C at 10 mm in Me2S0. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test for paired and unpaired data as appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. In inside-out patches from control AtT20 D16:16 corticotropes single BK channel events were characterized by their slope conductance (125 ± 3 pS in physiological potassium gradients and 2 mm intracellular magnesium, reduced to 80 ± 4 pS with 10 mm internal magnesium) and sensitivity to voltage and calcium (Fig.1 A–C). Over the physiological voltage range of AtT20 D16:16 cells, more than 75% (not shown) of single BK channels are half-maximally activated at positive (20–30 mV) potentials at “resting” 0.1 μmintracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i levels (Fig.1 B). At levels of intracellular free calcium observed during secretagogue stimulation (1 μm) BK channels are maximally activated (Fig. 1 B, half-maximal activation < −40 mV, not shown). Pretreatment of AtT20 D16:16 cells with a maximally effective concentration (1 μm) of the synthetic glucocorticoid agonist, dexamethasone (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Woods M.D. Shipston M.J. Mullens E.L. Antoni F.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2873-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), had no significant effect on single channel slope conductance (125 ± 2 and 80 ± 3 pS with 2 and 10 mm internal magnesium, respectively, Fig. 1 A) or sensitivity to voltage or calcium in inside-out patches (Fig. 1, A–C). Half-maximal activation of BK channels in 0.1 μm [Ca2+]i in greater than 70% of patches was observed between 20–30 mV (Fig.1 B). Immunoblotting of crude plasma membrane fractions from control and dexamethasone-treated AtT20 D16:16 corticotropes using an affinity purified antibody (αslo(913–926)) directed toward residues 913–926 (22Knaus H.G. Eberhart A. Koch R.O.A. Munujos P. Schmalhofer W.A. Warmke J.W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22434-22439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) of the α-subunit (pore-forming subunit) of BK channels revealed a single immunoreactive band at approximately 125 kDa (Fig. 2). No significant difference in level of expression was observed between control and dexamethasone-treated AtT20 D16:16 corticotropes (Fig. 2) in agreement with our previous electrophysiological analysis of whole cell BK currents (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In eight of eight control patches application of cAMP (0.1 mm) to the intracellular face of the patch in the presence of 1 mm Mg-ATP and 0.5 μm [Ca2+]i resulted in a significant inhibition of mean channel open probability, Po (expressed as the percentage of change of pretreatment Po, −72.9 ± 9.5%p < 0.01 t test, determined 10 min after cAMP application compared with pretreatment Po, n = 8, Fig. 3, A–C) that was maximal within 10 min and was maintained for more than 30 min. On washout of cAMP mean channel open probability gradually returned toward pretreatment levels; this reversal was accelerated by removal of ATP from the intracellular face of the channel (not shown). The inhibitory action of cAMP was mediated through protein kinase A-like activity closely associated with the channel in the patch because no significant inhibition of Po was observed on application of cAMP in the presence of the specific protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, PKI(5–24)(percentage of change in Po, 0.9 ± 5.3%; n = 4) or in the absence of ATP (percentage of change in Po, 7.0 ± 10.1%; n = 4) (Fig. 3 C). In parallel experiments, application of cAMP to the intracellular face of inside-out patches from dexamethasone-treated cells resulted in a significantly attenuated inhibition of mean channel open probability compared with inhibition observed in patches from control cells (Fig.3, B and C). In patches from dexamethasone-treated cells the percentage of change in Po was −22.4 ± 7.1%, n = 9 (compared with −72.9 ± 9.5%, n = 8, in control patches, p< 0.01 t test, Fig. 3 C). The blockade of PKA-mediated inhibition was not a result of delayed responsiveness to cAMP (Fig. 3 B); in addition the effect of cAMP was mediated through activation of endogenous PKA (Fig.4 B). The thiophosphate of ATPγS can be used by protein kinases to phosphorylate target proteins, but the resultant phosphoprotein is largely resistant to dephosphorylation. Using ATPγS as the phosphate donor in place of ATP in patches from dexamethasone-treated cells, cAMP inhibited Po to the same extent as that observed in control cells (percentage of change in Po, −60.8 ± 12.3%, Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that a closely associated protein phosphatase is responsible for the attenuation of PKA-mediated inhibition of single BK channels in isolated patches from dexamethasone-treated cells. In support of this, application of 10 nm okadaic acid or 10 nm calyculin A to the intracellular face of isolated patches from dexamethasone-treated cells resulted in cAMP-mediated inhibition of BK channel Po to the same extent as that seen in control patches with cAMP alone or in conjunction with the phosphatase inhibitors (Figs. 3 C and 4 B). For okadaic acid cAMP-mediated inhibition in patches from control cells expressed as the percentage of change in pretreatment Po was −69.8 ± 6.9% (n = 6) for dexamethasone cells −70.2 ± 13.2% (n = 6). The effect of cAMP in the presence of okadaic acid was completely blocked by PKI(5–24) in patches from both control (percentage of change in Po, 5.9 ± 6.6%) and dexamethasone-treated (percentage of change in Po, 0.2 ± 14.0%) cells (Fig. 4 B). The inactive okadaic acid analogue norokadone was without effect in dexamethasone-treated cells (percentage of change in Po after cAMP + 100 nm norokadone was −8.4 ± 6.6%, n = 3). For cAMP + calyculin A, the percentage of change in pretreatment Po in patches from control cells was −56.9 ± 3.4% (n = 5), and for dexamethasone-treated cells it was −70.1 ± 11.9% (n = 4). Moreover, application of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (1 unit/ml) to the intracellular face of patches from control cells resulted in a complete blockade of PKA-mediated inhibition of BK channel activity (Fig. 4 B; percentage of change in pretreatment Po by cAMP in presence of PP2A catalytic subunit was 4.9 ± 4.6%, n = 5). Because the above data suggest a role for PP2A in mediating the action of dexamethasone, we determined whether pretreatment of cells with dexamethasone enhances PP2A activity per se in AtT20 D16:16 cell extracts. PP2A activity in crude cytosolic or membrane fractions prepared from dexamethasone-treated (1 μm, 2 h at 37 °C pretreatment) AtT20 D16:16 cells was not significantly different from that in vehicle control treated cells (Fig.5), suggesting that a global induction of PP2A-like activity is not responsible for the effects of dexamethasone in this system. This study demonstrates that (i) BK channels in AtT20 D16:16 corticotropes are dynamically regulated by protein kinase A and protein phosphatase 2A-like activity closely associated with the BK channel complex and (ii) glucocorticoid regulation of BK channels is dependent upon protein phosphatase 2A activity at the level of the BK channel complex. Importantly, this action of glucocorticoids is context-sensitive because glucocorticoids do not modify the intrinsic properties (calcium or voltage sensitivity) of the BK channel; rather they block PKA-mediated inhibition of BK channel activity. These data support our previous electrophysiological and secretion studies in metabolically intact AtT20 D16:16 cells (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that glucocorticoid-induced proteins render BK channels insensitive to inhibition by PKA and that this action of steroids is central to the mechanism of early inhibition of adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion in this system. Furthermore, these data support a growing body of evidence that suggests that reversible phosphorylation of ion channels acts as a dynamic process to finely tune ion channel behavior (12Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 13Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14White R.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9902-9906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In order to directly examine the effects of PKA activation and protein phosphatases on BK channel behavior in this paper, we examined regulation in isolated patches of membrane from cells that had been pretreated with a maximally effective dose of glucocorticoid so that the full effects of steroid-induced proteins could be exerted on the channel complex. Because PKA-mediated inhibition of BK channel activity was significantly attenuated in isolated patches of membrane, as we previously observed in whole cell current recordings (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), these data strongly suggest that glucocorticoid-induced proteins exert their effect through pathways that are tightly associated with the BK channel complex. Thus it is reasonable to exclude effects of steroid that require the maintained presence of a diffusible mediator. For example, arachidonic acid metabolites and cGMP exert powerful activation of BK channels in pituitary cells through activation of protein phosphatases (14White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbakto A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); however, glucocorticoids inhibit arachidonic acid release (24Pompeo A. Luini A. Buccione R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and have no effect on cGMP levels in AtT20 D16:16 cells. 2M. J. Shipston, unpublished data. Several lines of evidence suggest that the blockade of PKA-mediated inhibition of BK channel activity by dexamethasone is a result of modified PP2A-like activity closely associated with the BK channel complex. Firstly, cAMP inhibited BK channel activity in patches from dexamethasone-treated cells when endogenous phosphatase activity was blocked by 10 nm calyculin A or okadaic acid. Secondly, using thiophosphate (ATPγS) as the phosphate donor, which allows phosphorylation of proteins, although the resultant phosphoprotein is not readily reversible by protein phosphatases, resulted in cAMP-mediated inhibition of BK channels from dexamethasone-treated cells. Thirdly, application of exogenous PP2A catalytic subunit to the intracellular face blocked cAMP-mediated inhibition of BK channels in patches from control cells. Finally, although analysis of protein phosphatase action in intact cells is hampered by the multiple effects on signaling pathways (for example, inhibition of serine threonine phosphatase activity in AtT20 D16:16 cells modifies cAMP accumulation and glucocorticoid receptor function (20Antaraki A. Ang K.L. Antoni F.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21De Franco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol.

Tian and M. J. Shipston, unpublished data. Taken together, these data suggest that glucocorticoid-induced proteins exert their effects by modulating the association and/or activation of PP2A in the BK channel complex. Moreover, the effect of glucocorticoids is unlikely to be a result of modulation of PKA activity because cAMP inhibits BK channel activity in patches from dexamethasone-treated cells when ATPγS is used as the phosphate donor, and previous studies have reported that glucocorticoids do not block cAMP activation of PKA in AtT20 cells (25Miyazaki K. Reisine T. Kebabian J.W. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1933-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). How may glucocorticoids modulate the association and/or activation of PP2A in the BK channel complex? In other systems, glucocorticoids have been reported to induce serine/threonine as well as tyrosine phosphatase activity (16Paliogianni F. Hama N. Balow J.E. Valentine M.A. Boumpas D.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1809-1817PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cambillau C. Rauly I. Sarfati P. SaintLaurent N. Esteve J.P. Fanjul M. Svoboda M. Prats H. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Susini C.

Commun. 1997; 232: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) through elevation of protein phosphatase levels. However, we observe no significant change in PP2A activity in cytosolic or crude plasma membrane fractions from dexamethasone-treated AtT20 D16:16 cells compared with control precluding a role for a global de novo induction of PP2A. In intact AtT20 D16:16 cells dexamethasone blockade of cAMP-mediated inhibition of BK channel activity is dependent on de novomRNA and protein synthesis (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus the recent reports of signaling molecules including serine/threonine phosphatases (26Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Chen M.-S. Owens-Grillo J.K. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16224-16230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) directly associated with the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor complex and potentially mediating nongenomic actions of glucocorticoids are unlikely to play a significant role in the mechanism of regulation reported here. In addition, because the effect of glucocorticoids is retained in excised patches, it is unlikely that a soluble mediator is involved as discussed above. This suggests that glucocorticoid-induced proteins regulate the function of protein phosphatases specifically associated with the BK channel complex; indeed PKA-mediated inhibition of L-type calcium channels in this system is not blocked by dexamethasone (3Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S. Antoni F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9197-9200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), further suggesting specificity of the response. Increasing evidence suggests that ion channels and cognate protein kinases and phosphatases regulating their function are co-localized at the plasma membrane through the interaction of anchoring, targeting, and regulatory intermediary proteins, the interactions of which are themselves dynamically regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions (27Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 28Sheng M.

Thus glucocorticoids, through induced proteins, may exert their effects through modification of the level, or activity, of PP2A in the ion channel complex itself rather than de novo induction of PP2A per se. Identification of the BK channel complex as a target for glucocorticoid action should allow us to define the molecular mechanisms leading from glucocorticoid receptor activation to modulation of protein phosphatase and ion channel activity. The data in this report demonstrate that glucocorticoid inhibition of BK channel activity is dependent upon protein phosphatase 2A activity closely associated with the BK channel complex. Such a mechanism may be a common determinant to allow the reciprocal regulation of calcium-activated potassium channels by glucocorticoid-induced proteins and cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation in excitable cells. Identification of the BK channel complex as a target for glucocorticoid action should allow us to characterize glucocorticoid-induced proteins involved in ion channel regulation and provide further insights into the mechanism and role of rapid glucocorticoid regulation of excitability in neuroendocrine and neuronal cells."

Here we demonstrate using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay that TR4 binds specifically to DR with a spacing of 1 and 5 base pairs (DR1 and DR5), which are the response elements for retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), respectively. A reporter gene assay using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase demonstrated that TR4 repressed RA-induced transactivation in a TR4 dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of the retinoid signal pathway also occurs through natural response elements found in CRBPII and RARβ genes. Our data suggest that the mechanism of repression may not involve the formation of functionally inactive heterodimers between TR4 and RAR or RXR. Instead, we show that TR4 may compete for hormone response elements with RAR and RXR due to its higher binding affinity. Furthermore, treatment of F9 murine teratocarcinoma (F9) cells with 10−6m all-trans-retinoic acid increased TR4 mRNA levels, and this change was accompanied by an increased amount of endogenous TR4 protein that can bind to RXRE in electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Our data therefore strongly suggest that the retinoid signal pathway can be regulated by TR4 in a negative feedback control mechanism, which may restrict retinoic acid signaling to certain elements in a cell-specific fashion.

The steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily is a large group of related transcriptional factors that control cellular differentiation, development, and homeostasis by direct interaction with distinct cis-elements in target genes (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar). This superfamily includes receptors for steroids, thyroid, vitamin D3, retinoids, and a large number of orphan receptors whose cognate ligands are still unknown (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether transcriptional activity is controlled by ligand binding, each of these proteins is able to bind to specific DNA sequences called hormone response elements (HREs) 1The abbreviations used are: HRE, hormone response element; TR4, TR4 orphan receptor; AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; T3R, thyroid receptor; VD3R, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3receptor; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor; atRA, all-trans-retinoic acid; 9cRA, 9-cis-retinoic acid; RARE, retinoic acid receptor response element; RXRE, retinoid X receptor response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CHO cell, Chinese hamster ovary cell; DBD, DNA binding domains; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IPTG,isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. in their target genes. The sequence-specific DNA binding properties of nuclear receptors are determined by their highly conserved DNA binding domains (DBD). The P box of the DBD formed by three amino acids at the C-terminal base of the first zinc finger is responsible for the recognition of response elements. Based on the sequence within the P box and the generic recognition sequence of the P box for the HRE, the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily can be divided into the GR and ER/TR subfamilies (3Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 4Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The GR group, which includes GR, MR, PR, and AR, prefers to bind to the glucocorticoid response element (5′-AGAACAnnnTGTTCT-3′) palindromic consensus sequence. Other receptors that have glutamic acid and glycine at the first two positions of the P box are assigned to the ER/TR subfamily. This subfamily, which includes ER, T3R, VD3R, RARs, RXRs, and most of the orphan receptors, recognize the AGGTCA direct repeat or palindromic motif. However, some members prefer to bind to the single half-site of AGGTCA as a monomer, such as the steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1)(4), TR3 orphan receptor/NGFI-B/nur77 (5Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and the thyroid receptor (T3R) (6Schrader M. Becker-Andre M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6444-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human and rat TR4 were originally isolated from human prostate, testis, and hypothalamus cDNA libraries (7Chang C. Da Silva S.L. Ideta R. Lee Y. Yeh S. Burbach J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of human TR4 encodes a protein of 615 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 67.3 kDa. Based on the modular structure and presence of a conserved DBD, which includes two zinc fingers that have a high degree of nucleotide sequence homology (65%) with the TR2 orphan receptor (7Chang C. Da Silva S.L. Ideta R. Lee Y. Yeh S. Burbach J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Chang C. Kokontis J. Acakpo-Satchivi L. Liao S. Takeda H. Chang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Chang C. Kokontis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), TR4 belongs to the subfamily of TR2 orphan receptors within the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization studies reveal that TR4 is widely expressed in the adult rat brain (10Lopes da Silva S. Van Horssen A.M. Chang C. Burbach J.P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2276-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and most intense labelings for TR4 transcripts are detected within the granule cells of the hippocampus and cerebellum. On the basis of the sequence in the P box, TR4 has been speculated to belong to the ER/TR subfamily because of its ability to bind to AGGTCA direct repeats. In our previous studies, we found that TR4 may repress the expression of SV40 major late promoter, which contained an imperfect AGGTCA motif with a spacing of 2 bp between the half-sites (DR2) (11Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By contrast, TR4 may also induce transcription of a thyroid receptor-regulated gene with a DR4 motif (12Lee Y.-F. Pan H.-J. Burbach J.P. Morkin E. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12215-12220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The retinoid signaling pathway is mediated by retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs) through interaction with their HREs. This happens by formation of either a RXR-RAR heterodimer, a RXR-RXR homodimer, or heterodimers with other orphan receptors, such as LXR or NGFI-B. The RXR-RAR heterodimer mediates the effects of atRA and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) through interaction with DR5. In this complex, RXR functions as a silent partner that occupies the 5′ half-site of DR5-RE (13Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Alternatively, RXR may become an active ligand-binding heterodimer partner with LXR or NGFI-B and mediate the response of target genes to 9cRA (14Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 15Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Finally, RXR can mediate 9cRA action by binding through a DR1 element under the form of an RXR-RXR homodimer (16Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that TR4 can bind strongly to response elements for RXR (RXRE-DR1) and RAR (RARE-DR5). The consequence of TR4 interaction with DR1-RXRE and DR5-RARE in the promoter context was then determined by using a transfection gene assay. The molecular mechanism for this regulation was further examined by Northern blotting analysis and EMSA. Together these results strongly suggest that TR4 is a central regulator in the retinoic acid signal transduction pathway. The chimera receptor TR4-AR-TR4 was constructed by PCR site-directed mutagenesis to create two restriction enzyme sites, one is in front of DBD (BglII), the other is right after the DBD (XhoI), in both TR4 and AR. The DBD of AR was then removed by cutting pSG5AR with BglII and XhoI and ligated into pCMX-TR4, which had also been digested with these two enzymes. To obtain a large amount of TR4 for use as an antigen in raising specific monoclonal antibodies, the Escherichia colipET expression system was used. The expression of TR4 from the pET system was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Novagen) with the addition of six consecutive histidine residues at the N-terminal TR4. The lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The cellular extraction was then either analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining or purified by a one-step metal chelating chromatography (Novagen). For the production of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, the antigen was prepared by directly cutting from the SDS-PAGE and emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant. Four expression vectors, pCMX-TR4, pCMX-4A4, pSG5-RARα, and pCMX-RXRα, were utilized to produce in vitro transcribed and translated proteins in a rabbit reticulocyte-based transcription/translation kit (TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system; Promega, Madison, WI). Nuclear extracts were prepared following the mini-extract procedure (17Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Analysis Techniques. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In short, the cells, either with or without treatment of RA for 24 h, were harvested and lysed by pushing through a 25-gauge hypodermic needle. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer C (500 mm NaCl, 20 mmHepes, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4 °C. The nuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min, and supernatant was dialyzed for 2 h against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Two μg of nuclear extracts were used in each 20-μl DNA-protein interaction. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were routinely maintained in DMEM with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). CHO cells (3 × 105) were seeded in 6-cm culture dishes 24 h before transfection. The medium was changed to DMEM with 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS at least 1 h before transfection. The cells were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method previously described (18Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25655-25659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F9 (106) cells were seeded in DMEM containing 5% charcoal dextran-treated FBS. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 10−6matRA and harvested at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 h, and even longer to 6 days after atRA treatment. Total RNA from the RA-treated F9 cells was prepared by the ultracentrifugation method as described previously (19Chao Y.C. Wood H.A. Chang C.Y. Lee H.J. Shen W.C. Lee H.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1442-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A probe covering the N-terminal of TR4 was released by the digestion of EcoRI and AatII and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using a random primer DNA labeling system (Life Technologies Inc.). Embryo collection, section preparation, and in situ hybridization were performed as described previously (20Young W.-J. Smith S.M. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3109-3116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). EMSA, DNA-protein binding assay, and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (21Lin T.-M. Young W.-J Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Cooney A.J. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using anE. coli expression system, we were able to generate large quantities of the N-terminal domain of TR4 to use as an antigen for the production of monoclonal antibodies. The reason we used the N-terminal domain of TR4 as an antigen is that this domain is the least conserved domain compared with other members of steroid/thyroid receptors. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the N-terminal domain of TR4 encoded a 21-kDa IPTG-inducible protein (Fig.1 A, lane 1 versus 2). This induced protein, which was tagged with six N-terminal His residues, was further purified by one-step affinity chromatography and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1 A, lane 3, a major band of the right size was detected. For the production of the monoclonal antibody, the purified N-terminal of the TR4 peptide was cut from the gel and used for monoclonal antibody production. After screening, at least 40 monoclonal antibodies showed positive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and most of them were IgG or IgM subtypes. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that monoclonal antibody G232-151.4 can specifically recognize endogenous TR4 in CHO cell extract with a much lower intensity (Fig. 1 B, lane 3, co-transfection of the expression vector only) than the cell extract from the co-transfection of TR4 (lane 1). There are no further enhanced TR4 bands that can be detected in CHO cell extract, which was transfected with TR2, indicating that the antibody does not cross-react with TR2 (lane 2). Previously we were able to identify a DNA response element for TR4 (TR4RE-SV40) containing an imperfect direct repeat of the AGGTCA consensus motif with a 2-base pair spacing (DR2) in the transcriptional initiation site of the SV40 major late promoter (11Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because the RXRE and RARE in the 5′ promoter region of CRBPII and RARβ were similar to TR4RE-SV40, we were interested in determining if TR4 might also bind specifically to these HREs and if it plays a role in the regulation of the retinoid signal pathway. Wild-type TR4 and chimera 4A4 were in vitro translated to produce proteins of the expected molecular mass of 67.3 kDa as shown in Fig.2 A. To characterize the binding specificity for TR4 and 4A4 to RXRE-CRBPII-DR1, EMSA was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 B, a specific DNA-protein complex was revealed when 1 μl of in vitro translated TR4 was incubated with 0.1 ng of 32P end-labeled CRBPII oligonucleotides (lane 2, arrow) which was different from mock-translated control protein (lane 1). This complex could be eliminated in the presence of a 10- and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled RXRE-CRBPII oligonucleotides (lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, the monoclonal anti-TR4 antibody (G232-151.4) could supershift this DNA-protein complex (lane 5,arrowhead). In contrast, there is no specific interaction between the probe and the chimera receptor 4A4 protein (lanes 6-9). Similar results were detected when we replaced the 32P-CRBPII-DR1 with 32P-RARβ-DR5 oligonucleotide (data not shown). These data demonstrated that TR4 can specifically bind to and form a single complex with RXRE-CRBPII-DR1, and also the DNA binding domain of TR4 is essential for the DNA binding. To examine the expression level of both wild type and chimera TR4 proteins after transfection, polyclonal antibody against both proteins was produced and examined. As shown in Fig. 2C, a single band with 67.3 kDa was detected in both TR4 and 4A4 overexpressed CHO cell lysates with an equal expression level. These data clearly demonstrated that either wild type TR4 or chimera receptor 4A4 can be equally transfected into cells. Therefore, it can further support our following transfection experiment. Transient transfection in CHO cells of CAT genes driven by promoters with retinoid response elements were then used to study the potential roles of TR4 in regulating RXR/RAR transcriptional activation. atRA (10−6m) induced the expression of both pRARE-CAT (a CAT expression vector with insertion of RARE oligonucleotides) and pRXRE-CAT (a CAT expression vector with insertion of RXRE oligonucleotides) nearly 7-fold (Fig.3, lanes 4 and10). This induction was repressed to basal levels when the TR4 expression vector (pCMX-TR4) was co-transfected into the CHO cells (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 11). However, the TR4-mediated repression could not be detected when we replaced TR4 with the chimera receptor TR4-AR-TR4 (4A4), in which the DNA binding domain of TR4 is exchanged with that of androgen receptor (Fig. 3,lanes 6 and 12). The effects of TR4 and 4A4 expression on the basal promoter activity levels were also tested, and there is no significant change (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8). Moreover, our data suggested that TR4-mediated suppression of pRARE-CAT and pRXRE-CAT was TR4 dose-dependent both in the presence and absence of exogenous RAR or RXR (by co-transfection with pSG5-RARα or pCMX-RXRα (Fig. 4)).Figure 4Dose-dependent suppression of RA-induced pRARE-CAT and pRXRE-CAT reporter activity by TR4.Increasing amounts of pCMX-TR4 (1–3 μg) were co-transfected with 3 μg of pRARE-CAT (panels A and B) or pRXRE-CAT (panels C and D) in the presence (panels A and C) or absence (panels B and D) of their cognate expression vectors (2 μg of pSG5-RARα and pCMX-RXRα). Cells were treated with 10−6m tRA for 24 h after transfection. The percentage of the CAT activity was determined relative to the CAT activity in the absence of TR4.

Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and CRBPII genes (16Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), respectively. We therefore determined if TR4 could also bind to these elements in the context of their own natural promoters and affect their transcription. DNA fragments containing the promoter regions of these respective genes, with and without RARE or RXRE, were inserted in front of CAT expression vectors (named as pRARβ-CAT and pCRBPII-CATversus pΔRARβ-CAT and pΔCRBPII-CAT, respectively). atRA (10−6m) induced CAT expression from the pRARβ-CAT and pCRBPII-CAT (approximately 2.5-fold and 8-fold, respectively), but not pΔRARβ-CAT and pΔCRBPII-CAT (Fig.5). Furthermore, this RA-dependent induction was repressed to basal levels when the TR4 expression vector was co-transfected into CHO cells. These results clearly demonstrate that TR4 can repress the retinoid-RAR/RXR signal transduction system. To explore the direct interaction between TR4 or RAR/RXR upon binding to the RARE or RXRE, we performed a series of studies using an EMSA. As shown in Fig. 6, in vitro translated TR4 binds specifically to RXRE with one clear band shift (lane 3). As expected, no visible band shifts were obtained when in vitro translated TR4 was replaced by either in vitro translated RARα (lane 1) or RXRα (lane 2). However, a clear band appeared (lane 4) when both in vitro translated RARα and RXRα were added. This band migrated differently from that of the TR4, which migrated more slowly (lane 3 versus 4). Whenin vitro translated TR4 was added together with in vitro translated RARα/RXRα, two distinct bands could be observed, one for TR4 and another one for RARα/RXRα. There was clearly no intermediate band between TR4 and the RARα/RXRα heterodimer (lane 5), even when the amount ofin vitro translated RXRα in the assay was increased (lanes 6 and 8). Similarly, no intermediate band could be visualized between TR4 and the RARα/RXRα heterodimer when RXRE-CRBPII was replaced with RARE-RARβ (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that there is no significant heterodimer formation between TR4 and RAR or RXR. Clearly, these results suggest that TR4 functions as a competitor for RARE/RXRE binding. To explore the affinity between these receptors and HREs, we performed EMSA to determine the dissociation constant by Scatchard plot analysis. Scatchard plot analysis of the DNA-protein complexes in the EMSA demonstrated that the dissociation constants (K d) for TR4 to RXRE-CRBPII and RARα/RXRα for RXRE-CRBPII were 0.5 nm and 10.0 nm, respectively (Fig. 7). Therefore, TR4 has an affinity for RXRE-CRBPII that is 20-fold greater than that of the RARα/RXRα heterodimer. Our data suggest that a simple competition between TR4 and RXRα/RARα for the same HRE may be the potential mechanism for the TR4-mediated suppression of the retinoid-RAR/RXR pathway. To explore the mechanism for TR4-mediated repression of the retinoid signal pathway, we checked to see whether retinoids can regulate TR4 in F9 cells that are sensitive to the RA treatment. To investigate expression of TR4 during differentiation of F9 cells, 25 μg total RNA from untreated F9 cells, or after treatment with 10−6m atRA at different times, was analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 8 A, an inducible band, which corresponds to the size of TR4 mRNA (9 kilobases), was visible in atRA-treated F9 cells. The induction increased gradually from 30 min to 2 h after RA treatment (Fig.8 A, lanes 1–4) and reached a plateau 2 h after treatment (Fig. 8 A, lanes 5–8). Induction of TR4 by the treatment of atRA also occurred at the protein level. As shown in Fig. 8 B, the F9 nuclear extracts give a shifted band with 32P-RXRE-CRBPII that migrated at a similar position as compared with the in vitro translated TR4 (lane 1 versus 2). This specific DNA-protein complex was enhanced by culturing F9 cells with atRA for 24 h (lane 3). Furthermore, this enhanced band was partially supershifted by anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody (G232-151.4). Quantitation of the specific band supershifted by anti-TR4 antibody indicated an increase of nearly 4-fold after atRA treatment for 24 h (lane 5 versus 6). These data clearly demonstrate that RA can induce TR4 expression both at RNA and protein levels and therefore may represent a negative feedback system that controls RA-mediated modulation of gene expression. To prove this hypothesis, the effects of TR4 induction on endogenous gene expression after a longer RA treatment was investigated. As shown in Fig. 8 C, the expression level of TR4 in protein level was gradually increased after 2 days of 10−6m atRA treatment. However, the expression level declines gradually after 5 days of treatment and continues to decrease to the basal after 7 days of treatment. We also checked the expression of RARβ, a retinoic acid-induced gene. Its protein expression was increased at the beginning of treatment and decreased after 6–7 days of exposure to atRA (Fig. 8 D). All these data demonstrated that induction of TR4 expression down-regulated both its own expression and that of RA-induced target gene and that further supports the feedback control mechanism. It is well accepted that retinoic acids affect differentiation in various developmental systems via nuclear RA receptors. To analyze whether the interaction between TR4 and RA receptors could occur in vivo, we examined the TR4 expression pattern by in situ hybridization and compared it to that of RA receptors. As shown in Fig.9, TR4 transcripts were intensively accumulated in the paraventricular brain area, retina, vestibular epithelium, perichondrium, kidney, and hair follicles of an embryo at gestation day 14 (Fig. 9 A). The TR4 labeling was also detectable in tooth bud and whisker follicles at gestation day 16 (Fig.9, B and C). It is worth noting that sense TR4 riboprobe did not detect any specific signal. Thus, this TR4 distribution pattern appears to be specific. This pattern does not directly follow expression patterns reported for any RA receptors. When comparing the TR4 expression patterns to those of RA receptors, we noticed that TR4 was co-localized with RA receptor members to various extent. For example, RARγ and TR4 transcripts were clearly seen at embryo day 14 in the perichondrium and the roots of the developing whisker follicles (24Ruberte E. Dolle P. Krust A. Zelent A. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 108: 213-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RARβ was co-localized with TR4 in regions where teeth develop as epithelial invaginations into the underlying mesenchyme (25Dolle P. Fraulob V. Kastner P. Chambon P. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 26Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the development of sensory epithelia of the eye, inner ear, and olfactory system, the expression of RARα, RARγ, and RXRγ was detected together with TR4 (25Dolle P. Fraulob V. Kastner P. Chambon P. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 26Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the RA receptors, only RXRγ transcripts were detected in brain areas that express TR4. Interestingly, the TR4 labeling pattern in kidney is very similar to that of CRBP and highly overlaps with RARβ, suggesting co-expression of these three factors in kidney (25Dolle P. Fraulob V. Kastner P. Chambon P. Mech. Dev. 1994; 45: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 26Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our in situ data therefore support the idea that modulation of retinoic acid signaling by TR4 could occur in physiological conditions. The data reported here suggest an important biological role of TR4 as a negative feedback regulator for the retinoid signaling pathway. Because the level of RA-induced transactivation can be repressed by co-transfection of TR4, but not the chimera receptor, TR4-AR-TR4 (Fig.3), the DBD of TR4 is essential for repression. This result also argued against the possibility that TR4 may compete with RAR or RXR for the co-factors needed for the RA activation. Moreover, our data (Fig. 5) suggested that the repression of RA-induced transactivation by TR4 is RARE- and RXRE-dependent. Together, these results indicate that both the DNA sequence in HRE and the promoter context may contribute to the repression of RA-induced transactivation by TR4. There are two possible mechanisms to explain how nuclear receptors can repress the RA-induced transactivation pathway. The first one is through protein-protein interaction by formation of heterodimer with RXR. For example, COUP-TF has been demonstrated to repress RA-induced transactivation by forming a heterodimer with RXR (22Cooney A.J. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results from the EMSA demonstrated that the mechanism of repression by TR4 may be different from that displayed by COUP-TF. Our data showed that both TR4 and RXR/RAR heterodimer can bind to RARE or RXRE probes specifically but failed to show any unique bands formed between TR4 and RXR/RAR when these three receptors were combined in EMSA analysis. This strongly suggests that TR4 may repress RAR/RXR without heterodimerization with either RARα or RXRα. The second mechanism for repression is competition with these receptors for binding to a common response element. In this regard, we compared the binding affinity between TR4 and RXR/RAR to the RXRE-CRBPII DNA fragment in EMSA. TR4 binds to RXRE-CRBPII with a 20-fold higher affinity than RXR/RAR. The strong correlation observed between effective binding of TR4 to a response element and its repressing effect provides convincing evidence that TR4 represses the retinoid signaling pathway by a simple competition mechanism. Therefore, TR4 can compete with and displace the RXR/RAR heterodimer from the DNA binding site to achieve effective repression. Our data further confirmed that this repression of RA-mediated transactivation is TR4-dose dependent, as increasing levels of transfected TR4 led to a stronger inhibition of RA-mediated transactivation. Such a finding is similar to our previous results for the TR2 orphan receptor, a closely related subclass member (21Lin T.-M. Young W.-J Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Lee H.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5434-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,28Ideta R. Yeh S. Lee Y. Adachi K. Takeda H. Su C. Saltzman A. Chang C. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both TR2 and TR4 can potentially function as repressors for the retinoid-RAR/RXR signal transduction pathway by competition with the HRE. A similar example of the dose-dependent regulation of gene expression in this steroid/thyroid superfamily is the repression of OCT3/4 gene by COUP-TFs. It has been demonstrated that COUP-TFs can repress the OCT3/4 gene by binding to the RAREoct site with much higher affinity than the RXR/RAR heterodimer (29Ben-Shushan E. Sharir H. Pikarsky E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1034-1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the above conclusions, it is possible that gene regulation can be controlled by different ratios and relative affinities of a gene's inducers and repressors. In F9 cells that differentiated upon treatment of RA, we noted that TR4 mRNA was increased nearly 4-fold by adding RA. This inducibility was also supported by EMSA results. Although many nuclear hormone receptors may bind to RXRE-CRBPII in differentiating F9 cells (Fig. 8 B, lanes 2 and 3), TR4 may represent one of the very few proteins that can also be induced during the RA treatment. It may indicate that retinoid pathways involve a very complicated and balanced control between TR4 expression and RA concentration. Taken together, the repressive effects of TR4 on RA-induced transactivation suggest that TR4 may play a role in a negative feedback system, which controls RA-mediated modulation of gene expression. Moreover, TR4 may represent a master regulator in the retinoid signal pathway due to the dominant effects it exerts with higher affinity to the HREs and the potential amplification of this repression effect by its increasing expression during RA treatment. In summary, the discovery of negative feedback control regulation of RA-mediated gene induction by TR4 provides evidence that TR4 is a regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. Further studies of TR4 in retinoid systems may provide us with clues as to their physiological role in humans and other systems. We thank Dr. R. M. Evans for pRARβ-CAT, pΔRARβ-CAT, pCMX-RXRα, pCRBPII-CAT, and pΔCRBPII-CAT plasmids, Drs. T.-M. Lin and H.-J. Lee for their valuable discussions. We also thank Dr. A.

Germline mutations within the WT1 tumor suppressor gene predispose to WT and are associated with congenital malformations of the urogenital system, and somatic mutations are associated with initiation of transformation in WTs. In DSRCT, a recurrent translocation, t(11;22)(p13;q12), fuses the amino terminal domain of the EWS1 gene product to three of the four WT1 zinc fingers. Two EWS/WT1 isoforms are generated as a result of an alternative splicing event between zinc fingers III and IV, inserting or removing three amino acids (±KTS). We demonstrate that introduction of EWS/WT1(−KTS) into NIH3T3 cells causes their tumorigenic transformation as determined by: formation of transformed foci on a monolayer of cells; anchorage-independent growth; and tumor formation in nude mice. EWS/WT1(+KTS) showed no transforming potential in these assays. These results indicate the oncogenic effect of the t(11;22) translocation is mediated by the EWS/WT1(−KTS) isoform and that fusion of the EWS amino terminal domain to the WT1 DNA binding domain produces a chimeric product showing a gain of function."
https://openalex.org/W2006298768,"To determine how an oncogenic tyrosine kinase disturbs cell cycle control we examined expression of cell cycle proteins and growth of fibroblasts reversibly transformed by a temperature sensitive mutant of v-Src (ts LA 29). ts LA 29 Rat-1 cells and normal Rat-1 cells had similar growth rates but the transformed cells traversed the G1 phase of the cell cycle more rapidly and failed to exit cycle efficiently in response to serum starvation and cell confluence. Cyclin D1 and cyclin E levels were not elevated in growing ts LA 29 Rat-1 cells and the abbreviated G1 was further accelerated by overexpression of cyclin E. A fall in cyclin E and cyclin A dependent kinase activities in Rat-1 cells in response to inhibitory growth conditions was abrogated in ts LA 29 Rat-1 cells and correlated with lack of p27 accumulation or cyclin A down regulation, the latter due to sustained cyclin A promoter activity. The expression of p27 mRNA was lower in ts LA 29 Rat-1 cells than Rat-1 cells and was elevated following v-Src inactivation concurrent with an increase in p27 promoter activity and temporary cell cycle exit. The suppression of mRNA or transcription is a novel way an oncoprotein can induce down regulation of p27 and contributes to the G1 shortening and perturbed cell cycle regulation of the v-Src transformed cells."

Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). The somewhat overlapping spectrum of cellular responses elicited by SPP and LPA has led to the hypothesis that these mediators might activate the same receptors (14Durieux M.E. Carlisle S.J. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1360-C1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Durieux M.E. Lynch K.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 249-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by other investigators, who found that SPC not only activated similar cellular responses and signal transduction pathways as LPA but that these two lipids also showed heterologous desensitization, suggesting that they activated the same receptor (16Xu Y. Fang X.J. Casey G. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 17Xu Y. Casey G. Mills G.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several reports have found no evidence for heterologous desensitization between sphingolipid mediators and glycerolipid mediators, leading to a controversy in the field (18Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Mulder S. Postma F.R. Simon M.F. Chap H. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We report that part of this controversy appears to be due to a glycerolipid that has been present in a commercially available SPC preparation used by many investigators. The impurity was identified as 1-O-cis-alk-1′-enyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (alkenyl-GP), an analog of LPA. Alkenyl-GP is generated in the manufacturing process of SPC from ethanolamine-containing lysoplasmalogen (alkenyl-GPE), which is present in the sphingomyelin (SM) fraction, the precursor used to manufacture SPC. We provide a method of purification and the full structural elucidation of this novel LPA analog using NMR, FT, IR, and mass spectrometry (MS) and also enzymatic and chemical analytical methods. We also describe a high yield, semi-synthetic method for the production of alkenyl-GP. Alkenyl-GP, like its acyl counterpart, activates the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 and acts as a strong mitogen in Swiss 3T3 cells. Alkenyl-GP has recently been described as an injury-induced component of the anterior chamber fluid of the eye (19Liliom K. Guan Z. Tseng H. Desiderio D.M. Tigyi G. Watsky M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1065-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this novel lipid is a naturally occurring member of the acidic phospholipid autacoid (APA) family. SPC was obtained either from Sigma or Matreya Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). SM and polar brain phospholipid extracts were purchased from Sigma, Matreya, and Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Oleoyl-LPA was from Avanti Polar Lipids. RO56 (1-O-cis-alk-1′-enyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, ethanolamine-containing lysoplasmalogen, alkenyl-GPE) was obtained from Matreya Inc. or was prepared as described below. Phosphorous was determined according to Ames and Dubin (20Ames B.N. Dubin R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acidic methanolysis was carried out according to Gaver and Sweeley (21Gaver R.C. Sweeley C.C. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1965; 42: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This procedure is the same one that Sigma uses to manufacture SPC. Briefly, the reaction mixture was prepared by adding 8.6% (v/v) concentrated hydrochloric acid and 9.4% water to methanol (MeOH). Either SM or brain polar lipids dissolved in the reaction mixture at a 2.5 mg/ml final concentration was hydrolyzed at 65 °C in pressure-sealed vials with stirring for up to 18 h. The lower phase (60 g) of the Folch (22Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) extract from bovine brain was dissolved in 500 ml of 0.5 mmethanolic sodium hydroxide that contained a small amount (~2%) of H2O, in which the sodium hydroxide was initially dissolved. After a 4-h incubation at room temperature, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7.0–7.5 by the addition of 6 nHCl, and the cloudy mixture was filtered. The solvents were evaporated, and the solid was extracted (3 ×) with a mixture of CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (400:200:150, v/v); the bottom layer was retained. The lipids present in the bottom layer were concentrated to a small volume (~10 ml) by evaporation and were applied to a column of 180 g of silica gel 60 (Merck). Lipids were eluted under 12 p.s.i. N2 pressure in three steps, starting with 2 liters of CHCl3:MeOH (90:10, v/v), followed by 4 liters of CHCl3:MeOH (87:13, v/v), and finally by 3 liters of CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (87:13:1, v/v). After evaporation of the solvents from the last elution step, the residue was dissolved in 10 ml of CHCl3, to which 100 ml of acetone was added. SM remained in solution, whereas the precipitate after an overnight incubation at −20 °C from this mixture was isolated by filtration and was designated RO56. This procedure yielded 1.5 g of the RO56 compound, which was later identified as alkenyl-GPE. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on K6 60-Å silica gel plates (Whatman Inc., Fairfield, NJ, 20 × 20 cm, thickness 250 μm), and lipids were visualized by primuline staining (23Wright R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 220-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) before eluting the lipids for bioassay. Spots marked with a pencil were scraped off the plate into glass vials, and the lipids were extracted (3 ×) from the silica gel with a large excess (10 × v/w) of methanol. The methanol-soluble material was filtered through a 0.2-μm Teflon syringe filter and was dried under a stream of N2. TLC separations used four different solvent systems as follows: solvent 1 consisted of BuOH:HAc:H2O (3:1:1); solvent 2 of CHCl3:acetone:MeOH:HAc:H2O (10:4:3:2:1); solvent 3 of CHCl3:MeOH:H2O, 28% NH4OH (20:30:4:1), and solvent 4 of CHCl3:MeOH:H2O (60:30:5, all v/v). In some experiments, for the detection of primary amine and phosphate moieties, lipids were stained with ninhydrin (Sigma) or molybdenum blue (Sigma) spray reagents, respectively. The HPLC purification of the SPC stereoisomers was performed according to Buenemann et al. (24Buenemann M. Brandts B.K. Pott L. Liliom K. Tseng J.-L. Desiderio D.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5524-5537Google Scholar), with a 5-μm silica-packed Microsorb column (250 × 4.6 mm, Rainin Instruments, Woburn, MA). Solvent delivery and injection were done by a Waters HPLC system controlled by the Millennium 2010 version 2.1 software package (Waters Instruments, Milford, MA). Elution of the lipids was monitored by a Varex Evaporative Light-Scattering Detector (Burtonsville, MD) through a metering valve; the effluent was split (1:4) between the detector and a fraction collector, respectively. HPLC-grade solvents were from J. T. Baker Inc. 1H, 13C, and31P NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker model 300 MHz ARX (Brueker Instruments Inc., Billerica, MA) spectrometer.1H chemical shifts (δ in ppm) were calibrated against CD3OD at δ = 3.30 ppm and 13C chemical shifts against CD3OD at δ = 49.00 ppm. 31P chemical shifts were calibrated against 0.0485 m triphenylphosphate in CDCl3 at δ = 0 ppm. Interpretation of NMR spectra was accomplished with the assistance of ACD/HNMR and CNMR v2.03 software package (Advanced Chemistry Development Inc., Toronto, Canada). Infrared spectra were recorded in CHCl3 on a Perkin-Elmer model 2000 FTIR (50/60 Hz) spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were obtained from an AutoSpec Q (E1BE2qQ) tandem mass spectrometer (VG Fisions, Altrincham, UK) with fast atom bombardment (FAB) ionization, using a glycerol matrix (1 μl). Spectra were analyzed with the VG Opus level 1.7f software package, and CsI was used for the mass calibration of the instrument. Alkenyl-GP was prepared by a two-step procedure, using PLD followed by PLA2digestion of 1-O-cis-alk-1′-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (alkenyl-acyl-GPE) obtained from Serdary Research (London, Ontario, Canada). Six μmol of alkenyl-acyl-GPE were digested with 250 units of cabbage PLD (Type V, Sigma) that was suspended in 1 ml of 0.2m acetate diethyl ether buffer, pH 5.6, according to Kates (25Kates M. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Techniques in Lipidology. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 405-409Google Scholar). After 4 h, the ether was removed with a stream of N2 gas, and the lipids were extracted by phase separation after adding 3 volumes of CHCl3:MeOH (3:2, v/v) to the aqueous reaction mixture. Phospholipase A2 (from Naja naja, Sigma)-catalyzed removal of the fatty acid side chain from thesn-2 position was carried out in a non-aqueous medium, according to Kates (25Kates M. Burdon R.H. van Knippenberg P.H. Techniques in Lipidology. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 405-409Google Scholar). After a 4-h digestion at room temperature, the solvents were evaporated with a stream of N2, and the reaction products were analyzed by TLC, and the plate was developed in solvent 2. Alkenyl-GP (100 μg/reaction) was digested with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP, EC 3.1.3.1, Worthington) with a specific activity of 37 units/mg, as described by Blank and Snyder (26Blank M.L. Snyder F. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5034-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Control reactions received equal amounts of heat-inactivated enzyme. After 2 h, the reaction was terminated, and the lipids were extracted (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42865) Google Scholar). SPC (1 mg, Sigma) and alkenyl-GP (50 μg) were spotted onto a TLC plate, which was placed into a chromatography tank that contained concentrated HCl at the bottom. The HCl vapor was allowed to react with the vinyl-ether bond for 15 min. Subsequently, the lipids were scraped off, extracted with large excess of methanol, dried under a stream of N2at 40 °C, and dissolved in 200 μl of methanol. As a control, the same lipids were processed the same way without the exposure to HCl vapor. Oocytes were obtained from xylazine-anesthetized adult Xenopus laevis frogs (Carolina Scientific, Burlington, NC) under aseptic conditions and were prepared for experiments as described previously (33Desai N.N. Carlson R.O. Mattie M.E. Olivera A. Buckley N.E. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Lipids for bioassay were always complexed with fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma, for complexing procedure see below), diluted in frog Na+-Ringer's solution (120 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.0), and were applied through superfusion to the oocyte, at a flow-rate of 5 ml/min. Membrane currents were recorded with a NIC-310 digital oscilloscope (Nicolet, Madison, WI). DNA synthesis induced by the different lipids was determined using [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 185 GBq/mmol) incorporation into confluent cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, as described by Desai and Spiegel (6Desai N.N. Spiegel S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Lipids, dissolved in methanol, were complexed with fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) in Ca2+-free Hanks' basal salt solution at a 1:1 molar ratio and were applied to the cells at a 10 μmfinal concentration. After an 18-h incubation in the presence of the lipids, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well; cells were harvested 6 h later to quantify the amount of acid-insoluble radioactivity (27Tigyi G. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The combined activity of the ERK1 and ERK2 was determined by a method described elsewhere (28Cook S.J. Beltman J. Cadwallader K.A. McMahon M. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13309-13319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Cadwallader K. Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cultures (75%) of Swiss 3T3 cells were serum-starved for 6 h and were treated with a 1 μm concentration of each lipid for 10 min. The total protein concentration of the supernatant was determined according to Bradford (30Bradford M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Total cell protein (200 μg) was used for each assay. Samples were treated with ERK1 and ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antisera at a 1:100 dilution for 1 h before incubation with 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2). The kinase reactions were started by adding 30 μl of kinase buffer that contained 10 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 370 GBq/mmol), and 7 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) to each sample and were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. MBP was separated on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Blue, and dried. MBP bands were excised, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Results represent the mean (n = 3) of enzyme assays and are representative of three experiments. In Xenopus oocytes, APA mediators elicit Ca2+-activated oscillatory Cl− currents through the activation of multiple APA receptor subtypes, which couple to the inositol trisphosphate-Ca2+ signaling system (7Tigyi G.

To confirm its LPA-like effects, SPC was applied to oocytes that were voltage-clamped at −60 mV, and membrane currents were recorded. The SPC preparation obtained from Sigma, which is used by many of the investigators who reported its LPA-like effects (6Desai N.N. Spiegel S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Because this particular brand of SPC is only 85% pure, according to the manufacturer, we also purchased SPC (nominal purity = 99%) from Matreya Inc. Surprisingly, the Matreya brand of SPC was inactive in the oocyte bioassay (Fig. 1). To eliminate batch-to-batch variations, we tested multiple batches of SPC from Sigma (Fig. 1) and Matreya. All Sigma SPC samples tested to date activated oscillatory Cl− currents in the oocyte, whereas none of the Matreya brand SPCs was active up to 100 μm (data not shown). Due to the consistent differences between the two brands of SPC, HPLC was applied to test the purity of the different SPCs and to determine whether any difference in the l-threo- andd-erythro stereoisomeric composition of the two preparations could account for the difference in their biological activity. Of the two SPC stereoisomers, we have previously shown that only the d-erythro-SPC isomer (eSPC) activated the sphingolipid receptors in atrial myocytes, whereas thel-threo isomer was inactive (24Buenemann M. Brandts B.K. Pott L. Liliom K. Tseng J.-L. Desiderio D.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5524-5537Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, HPLC separation of the Sigma brand SPC, using the solvent system originally developed for the separation of SPC stereoisomers (24Buenemann M. Brandts B.K. Pott L. Liliom K. Tseng J.-L. Desiderio D.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5524-5537Google Scholar), showed several impurities that eluted before d-erythro- (R t= 32 min) and l-threo-SPC (R t= 41 min). Bioassays of the 1-min fractions collected during the elution showed that the compound(s) responsible for eliciting oscillatory Cl− currents did not co-purify with either SPC stereoisomer but did correspond to a small peak in the impurities that eluted between 10 and 13 min.Figure 2HPLC purification of Sigma brand SPC.SPC (1 mg) was injected onto a 250 × 4.6-mm silica analytical column and was eluted using a gradient described by Buenemann et al. (24Buenemann M. Brandts B.K. Pott L. Liliom K. Tseng J.-L. Desiderio D.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5524-5537Google Scholar). This method has been used to separated-erythro-SPC (R t ~32 min) from the biologically inactive stereoisomer,l-threo-SPC (R t ~41 min). The eluting material was monitored by an evaporative light-scattering detector through a metering valve that split the effluent in a 4:1 ratio between a fraction collector and the detector, respectively. Fractions (1 min) were collected and were tested in the oocyte bioassay at 100-fold dilution. The compound(s) that activated oscillatory Cl− currents eluted with the impurities with an apparent peak retention time of ~11.5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both companies produce SPC by the acidic methanolysis of SM; this process can lead to the generation of several by-products besides SPC, depending on the conditions of the hydrolysis reaction and on the amount of water included in the reaction mixture (21Gaver R.C. Sweeley C.C. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1965; 42: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Purified SM and brain-derived phospholipids were obtained from Sigma, Matreya, and Avanti Polar Lipids and were subjected to acid semi-aqueous methanolysis using the conditions originally described by Gaver and Sweely (21Gaver R.C. Sweeley C.C. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1965; 42: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) that are used to manufacture SPC by Sigma. After an 18-h aqueous acidic hydrolysis, the reaction mixtures were neutralized, and SPC was extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42865) Google Scholar). The extracted lipids were dissolved in methanol and were tested in the oocyte bioassay for the generation of compounds capable of eliciting oscillatory Cl− currents. None of the SM preparations from the different suppliers elicited oscillatory Cl− currents in the oocyte. However, only the hydrolysate from the Sigma brand SM elicited oscillatory Cl− currents (data not shown). Although the brain phospholipid extracts contained traces of biological activity, after 18 h of acidic hydrolysis all brain phospholipid hydrolysates were highly active and contained titers of the active compound(s) that were substantially (~10-fold) higher than that titer prior to hydrolysis. These observations suggested that a contaminating phospholipid precursor might be present in the Sigma SM, which, upon acid methanolysis, would lead to the generation of the active compound(s). To test this hypothesis, we turned our attention to a previously unidentified lipid fraction that co-elutes with SM in the manufacturing process. This lipid, which is removed by careful low pressure chromatography and cold acetone precipitation from the SM fraction in the manufacturing process by Matreya, could potentially contaminate the Sigma brand SM. This particular fraction, designated RO56 by Matreya, migrated as a single spot (R f 0.36) ahead of SM, when developed by TLC solvent 1, and stained positive with ninhydrin and molybdenum blue (Fig.3 A). Acid methanolysis of RO56, carried out the same way as in the manufacturing of SPC, led to the generation of an even faster migrating product (R f 0.42) that was no longer positive with ninhydrin but remained positive with molybdenum blue (Fig. 3 B). The bioassay of RO56 showed that the R f 0.36 compound was inactive, whereas the hydrolysate was highly potent in activating oscillatory Cl− currents (Fig. 3 C). A major problem of this reaction was the low yield (<1%) of the active compound; this prevented the collection of a sufficient quantity of the active material for IR and NMR analysis. However, the FAB−-MS spectra from the active lipid isolated from the hydrolysate of RO56 and of that lipid found in the active fraction isolated by HPLC from the Sigma SPC were both identical, which showed two deprotonated molecular anions, (M − H)−, atm/z 419 and 421, respectively. The ninhydrin and molybdenum blue staining of RO56 suggested that this lipid was a phospholipid with a free amino group, possibly with an ethanolamine moiety. Moreover, the poor yield of the acid methanolysis reaction was presumed to be due to RO56 being a plasmalogen-like substance. Because we had milligram amounts of RO56, we first focused on determining its structure. A FTIR spectrum of RO56 was obtained in CHCl3: 732 cm−1 (cis-CH=CH-), 1076 cm−1(P-O-C), 1222 cm−1 (=CH-O, P=O), 1664 cm−1(C=C), 2550–3500 cm−1 (CH2, CH3, and NH3+). 1H NMR in CD3OD: δ 0.89 (t, J = 6.7 Hz, 3H), 1.20–1.45 (m, 30H), 1.90–2.20 (m, 4H), 3.13–3.16 (t,J = 4.9 Hz, 2H), 3.65–3.80 (m, 2H), 3.82–3.98 (m, 4H), 4.00–4.10 (m, 2H), 4.31 (dt, J 1 = 6.3 Hz;J 2 = 7.3 Hz, 1H), 5.25–5.41 (m, 1H), 5.99 (dt,J 1 = 6.2 Hz, J 2 = 1.4 Hz, 1H). 1H NMR of RO56 in CD3OD showed the presence of a vinyl-ether linkage, on which the two hydrogen atoms are in a cis-configuration (δ 5.99 ppm,J 1 = 6.2 Hz) since the trans-isomer would have a coupling constant greater than 10 Hz. The 1H NMR also showed the presence of an ethanolamine moiety (3.13–3.16 and 4.00–4.10 ppm in CD3OD). 13C NMR in CD3OD: δ 14.42, 23.73, 24.94, 28.12, 30.04, 30.33, 30.44, 30.65, 30.69, 30.79, 30.84, 30.97, 32.93, 33.07, 41.67 (d, J = 6.6 Hz), 62.91 (d,J = 5.2 Hz), 67.91 (d, J = 5.8 Hz), 70.95 (d, J = 7.6 Hz), 73.90, 108.01, 130.85, and 146.33. 13C NMR of RO56 in CD3OD confirmed the presence of the vinyl-ether linkage (δ 130.85 and 146.33 ppm). A single peak at 108.01 ppm indicated the existence of a second double bond in the hydrocarbon chain, which was non-conjugated with the vinyl-ether bond. The lack of a peak above 160 ppm confirms the absence of carbonyl groups in the molecule; that conclusion is consistent with the FTIR data. 31P NMR of RO56 in CD3OD appears at δ 18.17.

A significant increase in the maximal binding capacity for a κ opioid receptor ligand was observed in myocardial nuclei from BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters, as compared with nuclei obtained from normal myocytes of the F1B strain. The exposure of isolated nuclei to dynorphin B, a natural agonist of κ opioid receptors, markedly increased opioid peptide gene transcription. The transcriptional effect was mediated by nuclear protein kinase C activation and occurred at a higher rate in nuclei from cardiomyopathic myocytes than in nuclei isolated from normal cells. Thus, a nuclear endorphinergic system may play an intracrine role in the regulation of gene transcription under both normal and pathological conditions.

Myocardial nuclei were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μmleupeptin, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. 90 μl of the nuclear preparation were added with 100 μl of 2× reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, and 5 μl of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. DNA was digested by incubating the transcription mixture for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μl of 20,000 units/ml RNase-free DNase. Nuclear RNA was isolated by using guanidine thiocyanate and acid phenol extraction (17Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal.

Briefly, equal counts of 32P-labeled RNA (about 5 × 106cpm) were hybridized for 12 h at 55 °C in the presence of unlabeled antisense prodynorphin mRNA that was synthesized following transcription of an EcoRI-linearized pGEM3 plasmid bearing a 400-base pair HindIII-BamHI fragment of the main exon of rat genomic prodynorphin clone. Finally, samples were incubated with a combination of RNase A and T1 and exposed to proteinase K. The protected fragments were recovered after phenol chloroform extraction and electrophoretically separated in a polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel. Autoradiographic exposure was for 48 h. 32P-Labeled nuclear RNA was also hybridized with unlabeled antisense cyclophilin mRNA synthesized from aNcoI-linearized pBS vector containing a 270-base pair fragment of plB15, a cDNA clone encoding for rat cyclophilin (18Danielson P.E.

In the presence of PKC activators, maximum fluorescence is measured at 480 nm with excitation at 370 nm. In the course of phosphorylation by PKC, the intensity of the fluorescence decreases about 20% (23McIlroy B.K. Walters J.D. Johnson J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 90 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 μm ATP, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.5 μg of phosphatidylserine, 0.1 μg of 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, and 75 nmacrylodan-labeled MARCKS peptide. The phosphorylation of the acrylodan-labeled peptide was followed at 37 °C and was started by adding 10 μg of nuclear protein.Opioid Binding Assay[3H]U-69,593 (55.0 Ci/mmol) was used as a selective κ opioid receptor ligand in binding assays. Each sample (300 μg of protein) was incubated with the radiolabeled ligand (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 nm) in 0.25 ml of a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μmleupeptin, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The specific binding was measured as the difference between binding in the absence and binding in the presence of 10 μm of the unlabeled ligand (The Upjohn Co.). The binding reactions were allowed to run for 45 min at 25 °C and stopped by diluting five times with ice-cold binding buffer. The incubation media were then filtered over vacuum on Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters, followed by three washes with 10 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Filters were finally counted for radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry.K d and Bmax values were calculated with the LIGAND program (24Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar).ProteinsProtein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Data AnalysisThe statistical analysis of the data was performed by using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keul's test and assuming a p value less than 0.05 as the limit of significance.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA 4-h exposure of isolated myocardial nuclei obtained from normal hamster myocytes to increasing concentrations of dyn B produced a dose-dependent stimulation of prodynorphin gene transcription (Fig. 1 A). Such an effect was evident at a concentration as low as 0.1 μmand reached a maximum when the isolated nuclei were incubated in the presence of concentrations of dyn B ranging between 1 and 10 μm. Similar to dyn B, 1 μm U-50 markedly stimulated prodynorphin gene transcription in these control nuclei (Fig. 1 A). Basal prodynorphin gene transcription was considerably increased in nuclei isolated from cardiomyopathic myocytes as compared with nuclei obtained from control cells (Fig.1 B). As it has been described in detail elsewhere (4Ventura C. Pintus G. Fiori M.G. Bennardini F. Pinna G. Gaspa L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6685-6692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Ventura C. Pintus G. Tadolini B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6693-6698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), such an increase was related both to a rise in nuclear PKC activity and to intracellular Ca2+ overload occurring during the cardiomyopathic process. Here we show that the direct exposure to dyn B or U-50 of nuclei isolated from cardiomyopathic myocytes led to a further increase in the transcription rate of the prodynorphin gene (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 shows that both dyn B and the synthetic κ opioid receptor ligand failed to affect prodynorphin gene transcription when nuclei isolated from either normal or cardiomyopathic cells were exposed to 1 μm Mr-1452 (Mr), a selective κ opioid receptor antagonist (26Panerai A.E. Martini A. Sacerdote P. Mantegazza P. Brain Res. 1984; 304: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Opioid-mediated stimulation of prodynorphin gene transcription was also suppressed by chelerythrine or calphostin C, two highly selective PKC inhibitors (27Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar, 28Ko F.N. Chen I.S. Wu S.J. Lee L.G. Haung T.F. Teng C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, in cardiomyopathic nuclei these inhibitors down-regulated prodynorphin gene transcription at a rate below that observed under basal conditions (Fig. 1 B). Such a result is consistent with previous observations (4Ventura C. Pintus G. Fiori M.G. Bennardini F. Pinna G. Gaspa L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6685-6692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) showing that inhibition of nuclear PKC activity in nuclei from cardiomyopathic myocytes resulted in a decrease in the basal rate of prodynorphin gene transcription. In the current investigation, we show that a 30-min exposure to 1 μm dyn B of nuclei isolated from normal hamster myocytes induced a significant increase in nuclear PKC activity, as revealed by the analysis of the phosphorylation rate of the acrylodan-labeled MARCKS peptide (Fig. 2). Confirming our previous investigations (4Ventura C. Pintus G. Fiori M.G. Bennardini F. Pinna G. Gaspa L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6685-6692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), nuclear PKC activity was increased in nuclei from cardiomyopathic myocytes compared with nuclei isolated from normal cells. The current experimental data show that the exposure to dyn B of nuclei isolated from cardiomyopathic cells elicited a further increase in the phosphorylation rate of the fluorescent PKC substrate (Fig. 2). The opioid-induced stimulation of nuclear PKC activity could be abolished by the κ opioid receptor antagonist Mr as well as by the exposure of the isolated nuclei to chelerythrine (Fig. 2) or calphostin C (not shown). To further investigate whether the opioid agonists may have exerted their effects through specific nuclear κ opioid receptors, nuclei isolated from both normal and cardiomyopathic myocytes were incubated in the presence of [3H]U-69,593 (U-69), a highly selective radiolabeled κ opioid receptor ligand (31Lahti R.A. Mickelson M.M. McCall J.M. VonVoigtlander P.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 109: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Receptor binding parameters for this opioid agonist were then compared with those determined in a sarcolemmal membrane-enriched fraction (F40) obtained from both groups of myocytes. The presence of κ opioid receptors in myocardial cells has been demonstrated in our previous studies performed in isolated cardiac sarcolemma (32Ventura C. Bastagli L. Bernardi P. Caldarera C.M. Guarnieri C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 987: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and has been extensively confirmed in subsequent investigations (33Tai K.K. Bian C.F. Wong T.M. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Wittert G. Hope P. Pyle D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Circulation. 1996; 93: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The binding experiments performed in the current study revealed the presence of highly specific κ opioid-binding sites in myocardial nuclei (Fig.3). The specific binding in nuclei and F40 membranes ranged between 75 and 85% of the total bound. The Scatchard plots of [3H]U-69 binding in each subcellular fraction were linear and were characterized by a single dissociation constant (K d) in the low nanomolar range (Fig. 3). A marked increase in the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) for [3H]U-69 was evident in nuclei isolated from cardiomyopathic myocytes, as compared with nuclei from normal cells (Fig. 3). Similarly, in F40 membranes isolated from cardiomyopathic myocytes the Bmax value was significantly higher than that detected in the F40 fraction from normal cells. On the whole, the Bmax values in F40 membranes isolated from either normal or cardiomyopathic myocytes were about 4-fold higher than the values observed in nuclei obtained from the corresponding group of cells (Fig.3). No significant difference in the K d values was found among nuclear and F40 fractions obtained from normal or cardiomyopathic cells (Fig. 3). The cellular mechanisms regulating the expression of various neurotransmitter receptors in the myocardium are mostly enigmatic. It is presently unknown whether the observed increase in the amount of κ-binding sites may reflect changes in opioid receptor turnover and/or gene expression occurring during the cardiomyopathic process.Figure 2PKC activity in myocardial nuclei exposed to dyn B. Nuclei were obtained from myocytes of 60-day-old normal or cardiomyopathic hamsters. Nuclear PKC activity was measured in the presence of the acrylodan-labeled MARCKS peptide. Peptide phosphorylation was started by the addition of 10 μg of nuclear protein (arrow) and was followed at 37 °C. As the acrylodan peptide becomes phosphorylated, it undergoes a time-dependent decrease in its fluorescence at 480 nm. ♦ and •, nuclei were isolated from normal myocytes and exposed for 30 min in the absence or presence of 1 μm dyn B, respectively; ⋄ and ○, nuclei were isolated from cardiomyopathic cells and exposed for 30 min in the absence or presence of 1 μm dyn B, respectively. ▴ and ▾, nuclei were isolated from untreated cardiomyopathic cells and incubated for 30 min with 1 μm dyn B in the presence of 5 μmchelerythrine or 1 μm Mr, respectively.

Interestingly, the myocardial nuclei were isolated from the myocytes of cardiomyopathic animals of 60 days, an age that corresponds to an early phase in the development of the cardiomyopathy and precedes the onset of heart failure (11Forman R.

It is also noteworthy that opioid peptides regulate crucial determinants of the myocardial cell function (8Ventura C. Capogrossi M.C. Spurgeon H.A. Lakatta E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1671-H1674PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ventura C. Spurgeon H.A. Lakatta E.G. Guarnieri C. Capogrossi M.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 66-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Hence, the nuclear system described here may be part of a signaling mechanism triggering the activation of nuclear PKC and PKC-mediated gene transcription under both normal and pathological conditions. The present data appear to disclose a previously undefined intracrine role for an endorphinergic system and may abet future investigations on the biological role of nuclear opioid-binding sites in both myocardial and nonmyocardial cells. It is increasingly becoming evident that cell nuclei harbor the potential for intrinsic signal transduction pathway(s), as indicated by the presence of nuclear enzymes and substrates associated with the synthesis of diacylglycerol and inositol phospholipids (1Smith C.D.

Recently, we observed that PKC-δ and -ε and PKC activity were increased in nuclei from myocytes of cardiomyopathic hamsters (4Ventura C. Pintus G. Fiori M.G. Bennardini F. Pinna G. Gaspa L. J. Biol.

Goldstein A. Science. 1982; 215: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) elicited a tonic feed-forward stimulation of the expression of its coding gene (7Ventura C. Pintus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6699-6705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, κ opioid receptor stimulation modified both cytosolic Ca2+ and pH homeostasis and remarkably affected myocardial contractility (8Ventura C. Capogrossi M.C. Spurgeon H.A. Lakatta E.G. Am. J.

Thus, nuclear PKC-mediated activation of opioid gene transcription may be part of an autocrine circuit of regulation of cellular homeostasis under normal or pathological conditions.

Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agent of a spectrum of human diseases. Leishmaniahave a digenetic life cycle that encompasses the extracellular promastigotes in the digestive tract of the parasite-transmitting insect vector, the sandfly, and the disease-causing intracellular amastigotes living in parasitophorous vacuoles of mammalian macrophages.The parasites produce unusual glycoconjugates, which are thought to play crucial roles for survival, development, and virulence in both developmental stages of the parasite. The best characterizedLeishmania glycoconjugate is the promastigote cell-surface glycolipid, lipophosphoglycan (LPG). 1The abbreviations used are: LPG, lipophosphoglycan; PG, phosphoglycan; pPPG, promastigote proteophosphoglycan; aPPG, amastigote proteophosphoglycan; sAP, secreted acid phosphatase; GC-MS, combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; SABG, sweet almond β-glucosidase; BTBG, bovine testes β-galactosidase; AP, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase; HPAE-HPLC, high pH anion exchange HPLC; TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HF, hydrofluoric acid; ES-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; ES-MS-MS, electrospray mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation.1The abbreviations used are: LPG, lipophosphoglycan; PG, phosphoglycan; pPPG, promastigote proteophosphoglycan; aPPG, amastigote proteophosphoglycan; sAP, secreted acid phosphatase; GC-MS, combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; SABG, sweet almond β-glucosidase; BTBG, bovine testes β-galactosidase; AP, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase; HPAE-HPLC, high pH anion exchange HPLC; TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HF, hydrofluoric acid; ES-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; ES-MS-MS, electrospray mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation. The structure of LPG from five different Leishmania species has been determined. LPG contains a conserved lyso-alkylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor linked to a phosphohexasaccharide core structure, a conserved backbone of up to 40 phosphodiester-linked disaccharide repeats (PO4-6-Galβ1–4Manα1-), and species-, strain-, and stage-specific components linked to the core and repeats as well as terminating neutral (cap) glycans at the non-reducing end of the molecule (reviewed in Refs. 1McConville M.J.

J. 1995; 310: 807-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the sandfly, LPG serves as a ligand for the attachment of non-infectious procyclic promastigotes to the midgut wall lining and may protect the parasites against the hydrolytic environment of the insect's digestive tract. A stage-specific form of LPG confers complement resistance to the highly infectious metacyclic promastigotes, which are injected by the sandfly into the skin of the mammalian host. LPG also acts as a receptor for the invasion of macrophages by metacyclic promastigotes and may protect this transient mammalian parasite stage against the initial microbicidal response of the host cell by acting as a radical scavenger and by modulating signal transduction and gene expression of the macrophage (reviewed in Refs. 3Sacks, D.

Recently, it has been shown that protein-bound phosphoglycans are also present in the amastigote stage of L. mexicana (22Bahr V. Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Demar M. Quinten M. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 35Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. McConville M.J. Overath P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). This amastigote proteophosphoglycan (aPPG) is secreted by the parasites in large amounts into the phagolysosomes of host macrophages, where it may accumulate to mg/ml concentrations (35Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. McConville M.J. Overath P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). The massive secretion of aPPG by amastigotes may contribute to the expansion of the phagolysosomes to huge parasitophorous vacuoles, which are the hallmark of L. mexicana infections (36Peters C. Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated thatL. mexicana aPPG is an activator of the complement cascade via the lectin pathway. This property may contribute to lesion development and pathology caused by L. mexicana (37Peters C. Kawakami M. Kaul M. Ilg T. Overath P. Aebischer T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A preliminary analysis of aPPG showed that it is immunologically and chemically related to the promastigote phosphoglycan antigens LPG and sAP but also exhibits distinct properties (35Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. McConville M.J. Overath P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study we describe the structural analysis of the glycans from L. mexicana aPPG purified from infected mouse lesion tissue. We demonstrate that, in addition to oligosaccharides also present in L. mexicana promastigote phosphoglycan antigens, aPPG contains a variety of stage-specific neutral and phosphorylated glycans. These glycans are linked together by phosphodiester bonds and are most likely connected to the protein backbone via phosphoserine residues. We also show that a large proportion of aPPG glycans is modified by two, three, or even four phosphate groups in diester linkages to other glycans.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown that Leishmaniapromastigotes synthesize lipid-bound (LPG), free (PG), and protein-bound (sAP, pPPG) phosphoglycan antigens, which may play crucial roles for virulence and transmission of this parasite life stage (1McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 3Sacks, D. L., Saraiva, E. M., Rowton, E., Turco, S. J., and Pimenta, P. F.

Science. 1995; 269: 1869-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the amastigote form, which causes disease in the mammalian host, LPG expression is strongly down-regulated (23Glaser T.A. Moody S.F. Handman E. Bacic A. Spithill T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Turco S.J. Sacks D.L. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1993; 58: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However,L. mexicana amastigotes do synthesize large amounts of a stage-specific proteophosphoglycan (aPPG) (22Bahr V.

Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have elucidated the main structural features of this novel parasite antigen; aPPG consists of a defined polypeptide backbone, which is modified by a variety of carbohydrate structures via Ser(P) residues. We demonstrate that aPPG contains all glycans previously identified inL. mexicana promastigote phosphoglycan antigens LPG and sAP (33Ilg T. Overath P. Ferguson M.A.J. Rutherford T. Campbell D.G.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6834-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which include mannose, the manno-oligosaccharide series N2a-6a and N2b, P2 and P3c (Table IV). However, the majority of the glycans (Tables II and IV) have not been detected previously inL. mexicana (N3b, P3b, P4c) or represent completely novel structures (N4b, N4c, P3c′, P4b′, P4c′, P5d, Di-P4b, Di-P4c, Di-P5b, Di-P5d, Tri-P4c, Tri-P5b, Tri-P5c, Tri-P5d, Tri-P6b, Tri-P6c, and Tetra-P7, Tables II and IV). Another surprising feature of aPPG is the presence of phosphoisomers of some monophosphorylated glycans (P3c′versus P3c and P4c′ versus P4c) and the presence of novel multiphosphorylated glycans. These glycans are phosphorylated at the 6-position of either Gal or Glc residues, or both. To our knowledge, Glc-6-P has not been previously observed in glycoconjugates from any source. Neither the promastigote phosphoglycan antigens fromL. mexicana (LPG and sAP, this study; PG and pPPG) 8T. Ilg, unpublished results. nor from promastigotes of other Leishmania species (L. major LPG, PG, pPPG and L. donovani LPG, PG, sAP)8 contain the novel structure elements described above. The neutral and phosphorylated glycans are linked by phosphodiester bonds of the conserved structure R-Manα1-PO4-6-Gal-R and the newly identified linkage R-Manα1-PO4-6-Glc-R (compare Fig.11). Taken together, our results suggest that the aPPG glycans could be highly branched chains as proposed in the structure model shown in Fig. 11. This structural arrangement is quite distinct from promastigote phosphoglycans like LPG or sAP (compare Refs. 33Ilg T. Overath P. Ferguson M.A.J. Rutherford T. Campbell D.G. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24073-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 39Ilg T. Etges R. Overath P. McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Thomas J. Homans S.W. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6834-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the results shown in TableIV, it can be calculated that, on average, each aPPG glycan chain contains approximately six phosphorylated oligosaccharides, which are capped by four neutral oligosaccharides. These glycan chains are linked to the protein backbone most likely via the basic structure R-Manα1-PO4-Ser (compare Fig. 11). However, the sequence, length, and branching of the glycan chains on individual glycosylation sites remain to be determined.In contrast to conventional N- andO-glycosylation via glycosidic linkages to Asn and Ser/Thr, respectively (49Lis H. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), glycosylation of proteins via phosphoamino acids is much less common. This type of protein-glycan linkage has only been reported in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (via Ser(P) (50Gustafson G.L. Gander J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) and in the parasitic protozoa Leishmania (via Ser(P) (33Ilg T. Overath P. Ferguson M.A.J. Rutherford T. Campbell D.G.

Phosphodiester linkages of the type Manα1-PO4-6-Man-R are common in cell wall mannoproteins as well as in vacuolar and secreted enzymes of several yeast species (52, 53 and references therein), whereas similar linkages in glycans of vertebrates are very rare (54Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10847-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Balsamo J. Pratt R.S. Lilien J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5402-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 56Hayes B.K. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16170-16178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphodiester-linked glycan structures of Leishmania aPPG are different and far more complex. Therefore, the biosynthetic enzymes involved in the formation of aPPG glycan structures, in particular the phosphodiester linkages between the glycans and between Ser and the glycan chains, could be attractive targets for the development of specific anti-parasite drugs.It has been shown recently that aPPG may contribute to the formation of the huge parasitophorous vacuoles (36Peters C. Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are rapidly formed after infection of macrophages (57Antoine J.C. Prina E. Jouanne C. Bongrand P. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 779-787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and COS cells (58Peters C. Aebischer T. Stierhof Y.-D. Fuchs M. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 108: 3715-3724Google Scholar) by L. mexicana. In these parasite-harboring vacuoles, aPPG is present in mg/ml concentrations (36Peters C. Stierhof Y.-D. Ilg T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L. mexicana aPPG is most likely released from the parasitophorous vacuole upon rupture of infected macrophages and possibly also by vesicular traffic and exocytosis from the living infected host cell (35Ilg T. Stierhof Y.-D. McConville M.J. Overath P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar). Released aPPG activates the complement cascade via the lectin pathway. This unusual complement activation by a soluble parasite product may contribute to the pathology in the lesion (37Peters C. Kawakami M. Kaul M. Ilg T. Overath P. Aebischer T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The structural basis for this property of aPPG is most likely the abundance of potential mannose-binding lectin binding sites (Manα1-PO4- and (Manα1–2)1–5Manα1-PO4-, compare Table IV) on the surface of this macromolecule. Other effects of intra- and extracellular aPPG on the immune functions of infected mice are currently being investigated. In particular, it appears possible that some of the modulating activities on signal transduction, lymphokine production, and gene expression in macrophages described for promastigote LPG (8Proudfoot L. Nikolaev A.V. Feng G.J. Wei W.Q. Ferguson M.A. Brimacombe J.S. Liew F.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10984-10989Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Ho J.L. Kim H.K. Sass P.M.

Signals from the macrophage appear to be essential for the developmental regulation of aPPG expression, since this antigen is not detected in the culture supernatant of axenic amastigotes. 9T. Ilg and A. Aebischer, unpublished observations. The stage-specific expression of aPPG is another example of the profound biochemical changes occurring during the L. mexicanatransformation of promastigotes into amastigotes, previously documented for the expression of lysosomal cysteine proteinases (59Pupkis M.F.

These distinctive stage-specific variations most likely reflect an adaptation to the different and more hostile environment of the phagolysosomal compartment of macrophages. Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agent of a spectrum of human diseases. Leishmaniahave a digenetic life cycle that encompasses the extracellular promastigotes in the digestive tract of the parasite-transmitting insect vector, the sandfly, and the disease-causing intracellular amastigotes living in parasitophorous vacuoles of mammalian macrophages. The parasites produce unusual glycoconjugates, which are thought to play crucial roles for survival, development, and virulence in both developmental stages of the parasite. The best characterizedLeishmania glycoconjugate is the promastigote cell-surface glycolipid, lipophosphoglycan (LPG). 1The abbreviations used are: LPG, lipophosphoglycan; PG, phosphoglycan; pPPG, promastigote proteophosphoglycan; aPPG, amastigote proteophosphoglycan; sAP, secreted acid phosphatase; GC-MS, combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; SABG, sweet almond β-glucosidase; BTBG, bovine testes β-galactosidase; AP, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase; HPAE-HPLC, high pH anion exchange HPLC; TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HF, hydrofluoric acid; ES-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; ES-MS-MS, electrospray mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation.1The abbreviations used are: LPG, lipophosphoglycan; PG, phosphoglycan; pPPG, promastigote proteophosphoglycan; aPPG, amastigote proteophosphoglycan; sAP, secreted acid phosphatase; GC-MS, combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; SABG, sweet almond β-glucosidase; BTBG, bovine testes β-galactosidase; AP, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase; HPAE-HPLC, high pH anion exchange HPLC; TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HF, hydrofluoric acid; ES-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; ES-MS-MS, electrospray mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation. The structure of LPG from five different Leishmania species has been determined. LPG contains a conserved lyso-alkylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor linked to a phosphohexasaccharide core structure, a conserved backbone of up to 40 phosphodiester-linked disaccharide repeats (PO4-6-Galβ1–4Manα1-), and species-, strain-, and stage-specific components linked to the core and repeats as well as terminating neutral (cap) glycans at the non-reducing end of the mol"

We report here that ligation of the α2M signaling receptor also causes a 1.5–2.5-fold increase in wortmannin-sensitive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity as measured by the quantitation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 formation was α2M* concentration-dependent with a maximal response at ~50 pm ligand concentration. The peak formation of PIP3 occurred at 10 min of incubation. The α2M receptor binding fragment mutant K1370R which binds to the α2M signaling receptor activating the signaling cascade, increased PIP3 formation by 2-fold. The mutant K1374A, which binds very poorly to the α2M signaling receptor, did not cause any increase in PIP3 formation. α2M*-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited by wortmannin. 1,2Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acetoxymethylester a chelator of intracellular Ca2+, drastically reduced α2M*-induced increases in PIP3 formation.

Since many of the cellular responses elicited upon ligation of α2MSR with receptor-recognized forms of α2M are similar to those elicited upon binding of growth factors to their receptors, we studied the activity of PI3K by measuring the formation of PtdIns 3,4,5- trisphosphate (PIP3), in murine macrophages stimulated with α2M*. Ligation of α2MSR increases the wortmannin-sensitive formation of PIP32–3-fold in a concentration-dependent manner and that the agonist-induced formation of PIP3 is influenced by [Ca2+]i levels. Human α2M, α2M-methylamine (α2M*), RBF and its mutants K1370A and K1374R were prepared as described (13Howard G.C. Yamaguchi Y. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Nelson A. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

PtdIns 4-phosphate (PIP), PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and PtdIns 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Insulin, wortmannin, thapsigargin, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and molybdenum blue spray were from Sigma. Fura 2/AM and BAPTA/AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [3H]Thymidine (specific activity 70 Ci/mmol) and [3H]myoinositol (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Silica gel G plates were from Analtech (Dover, DE). All other reagents used were of analytical grade. PIP3 formation in murine peritoneal macrophages was measured essentially according to the method of Okadaet al. (29Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that [3H]myoinositol was used to label inositol lipids in place of 32Pi. Briefly thioglycollate-elicited macrophages (~8 × 106/well) were collected in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HHBSS) containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and were allowed to adhere for 2 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mmglutamine, 12.5 units of penicillin/ml, and 6 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2(5%) incubator. Nonadherent cells were removed with cold HHBSS, and a volume of RPMI 1640 medium was added containing the additions listed above except that 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA was substituted for the serum. To each well [3H]myoinositol, 30 μCi/ml, was added, and the cells were incubated as above for 20 h. The monolayers were washed four times with the above RPMI 1640 medium, a volume of the medium added to each well, and the cells preincubated for 3 min at 37 °C before stimulation with different agonists for 10 min. In experiments where the effect of wortmannin on agonist-induced formation of PIP3 was studied, it was incubated (30 nm) with samples for 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition of agonists. In experiments where the effects of modulation of intracellular Ca2+ by thapsigargin (100 nm) and BAPTA/AM (10 μm) were to be studied on PIP3formation, the former was added 10 min and the latter 30 min before the addition of the agonist. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium, a volume of chilled methanol was added to each well, and the lipids were extracted and separated on oxalate-impregnated silica gel G plates as described by Okada et al.

Authentic standards of PIP, PIP2, and PIP3 were co-chromatographed with each run. The chromatoplates were air-dried and phospholipid spots detected by lightly spraying with molydenum blue spray (30Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RF values obtained under the experimental conditions for PIP, PIP2, and PIP3were 0.63, 0.23, and 0.12, respectively. Gel areas corresponding inRF values to PIP3 were scraped into scintillation vials and the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. In preliminary experiments, the identity of3H-labeled PIP, PIP2, and PIP3 on chromatoplates was established by 1) autoradiography of developed chromatoplates on Kodak BioMax film using BioMax TranScreen-LE intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C for 10 days and comparing the RF values of radioactive spots with authentic standards co-chromatographed and (2Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 792-812PubMed Google Scholar) by adding authentic standards of PIP, PIP2, and PIP3 (15 μg each) to samples prior to chromatography and spraying the developed chromatoplates with molydenum blue spray (30Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was measured according to Charlesworth and Rozengurt (11Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys.

Briefly, 2-h-adhered macrophages (4 × 105 cells/well) were incubated in a volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 0.2% fatty acid-free BSA. To each well [3H]thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added followed by the addition of different ligands to the respective wells and the incubations continued as above for 20 h. In experiments where the effects of wortmannin (30 nm) were examined on RBF-induced DNA synthesis, it was added 30 min before adding the ligand, and the incubations were performed as above. The incubations were terminated by aspirating the medium, a volume of 5% trichloroacetic acid was added to each well, and plates were left on ice for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid was aspirated and cells washed once more with trichloroacetic acid followed by washing three times with cold HHBSS. The cells were lysed in 1 N NaOH and radioactivity determined by liquid scintillating. For protein measurement, identically incubated, but untreated, cells were lysed in 0.1 N NaOH and protein estimated according to Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal.

IP3 and [Ca2+]i elicited upon exposure of murine peritoneal macrophages to α2M* were measured as described (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem.

In experiments where the effects of wortmannin (30 nm) on α2M*-induced changes in [Ca2+]i and IP3 were studied, it was added 30 min before the agonist. The effect of α2M* on the synthesis of PIP3 in macrophages is shown in Fig.1. The maximum synthesis of PIP3 occurred at a ligand concentration of ~50 pm (Fig. 1 A). The kinetics of PIP3synthesis is similar to that noted previously for p21RASGTP formation (24Misra, U. K., and Pizzo, S. V. (1998) Cell. Signalling, in pressGoogle Scholar) in macrophages stimulated with α2M*. Since wortmannin treatment had no effect on α2M*-stimulated p21RASGTP synthesis (24Misra, U. K., and Pizzo, S. V. (1998) Cell. Signalling, in pressGoogle Scholar), PI3K is downstream of RAS, consistent with the report that PI3K is a substrate for activated RAS (32Rodriguez-Vielana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). The synthesis of PIP3 stimulated with 100 pm of α2M* was maximal after a 10-min period of incubation but declined at longer periods of incubations (Fig. 1 B). The α2M*-induced synthesis of PIP3 was comparable with the effect of insulin (20 nm) (Fig.2 A), a potent activator of PI3K (33Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 16: 117-142Google Scholar). That the increase in PIP3 formation occurs due to the binding of α2M* to α2MSR was confirmed by using a RBF of α2M and its mutants (Fig.2 B).

We also tested the effect of 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002)on α2M*-induced PIP3 synthesis.

The present studies in conjunction with these previous observations show that like established tyrosine kinase receptors, cellular responses elicited upon ligation of α2MSR involve several signaling cascades, including p21RAS, PI3K, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. A number of signal transduction pathways have been implicated in regulating cell growth and differentiation in response to G-protein-coupled receptor agonists that activate protein tyrosine kinase receptors (see Ref. 40Malarkey K.

PI3K has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth in a variety of cell types (25Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 26Carpenter C.L.

The lipid product of PI3K is not broken down by phospholipase C but seems to act as second messenger playing a role in Ca2+ mobilization, actin arrangement, and activation of Ser/Thr kinases such as isoforms of PKC and protein kinase B (PKB also known as cAKT). The latter are activated consequent to PI3K activation in cells treated with growth factors and mitogens, overexpression of PI3K, and inhibited by wortmannin and by dominant negative subunit mutants of PI3K (25Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 26Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar, 27Klarlund J.K.

Downstream targets of PKB include p70 ribosomal kinase S6 involved in up-regulation of transcripts for ribosomal proteins and elongation factors (43Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J.

We have assessed the involvement of PI3K in RBF-induced DNA synthesis in macrophages by using wortmannin (Fig.3 A). Incubation of cells with wortmannin (30 nm/30 min/37 °C) prior to stimulation with RBF (100 pm) nearly abolished RBF-induced DNA synthesis (Table II), which shows that the PI3K signaling pathway is involved in DNA synthesis in cells stimulated with receptor-recognized forms of α2M. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also nearly abolished DNA synthesis induced by RBF or α2M* (data not shown).Table IIEffect of wortmannin and RBF on DNA synthesisAdditionDNA synthesizedfmol/mg proteinNone473.32 ± 32.002-aValues are mean ± S.E. from two independent experiments performed in quadruplicates.RBF (100 pm)1147.70 ± 144.00Wortmannin (30 nm/30 min) + RBF542.71 ± 48.002-a Values are mean ± S.E. from two independent experiments performed in quadruplicates. Open table in a new tab We have previously reported the dependence of protein and DNA synthesis on intracellular Ca2+ levels in macrophages stimulated with α2M* (11Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have now examined the role of [Ca2+]i on PIP3 synthesis in macrophages stimulated with α2M* in several ways: 1) by modulating [Ca2+]i with thapsigargin (100 nm/10 min/37 °C), an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor that raises [Ca2+]i by releasing Ca2+ from both IP3-dependent and IP3-independent internal Ca2+ pools and 2) by use of BAPTA/AM (10 mm/30 min/37 °C) that chelates [Ca2+]i. Thapsigargin alone increased PIP3 synthesis comparable with that seen with α2M* or with thapsigargin plus α2M* (Fig.2 C). By contrast, BAPT/AM nearly abolished α2M*-induced PIP3 synthesis (Fig.2 C). We have reported previously that manipulating IP3 and [Ca2+]i profoundly alters agonist-induced increases in protein and DNA synthesis (10Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M.G. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 497-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In light of the importance of [Ca2+]i in α2M-induced DNA synthesis, and inhibition of DNA synthesis by wortmannin (Fig. 2C) we evaluated the effect of wortmannin on α2M*-induced synthesis of IP3 and changes in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3). Wortmannin by itself showed no effect on IP3 synthesis in macrophages, and when administered before α2M*, it only slightly attenuated IP3 synthesis (about 10–15%) compared with α2M*-treated cells (Fig. 3 A). As expected, treatment of cells with wortmannin before α2M* only slightly attenuated both the IP3-induced increase in [Ca2+]i as well as Ca2+ entry from the medium (Fig. 3 B). The tyrosine kinase class of receptors, which include growth factor receptors, upon activation, induce mitogenesis via a series of downstream steps that may show cellular variance and include signaling proteins Grb2, Sos, Ras, Raf, MEK, and MAPK (40Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Pelvin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We show here, for the first time, that like insulin and other growth factors, receptor-recognized forms of α2M, upon binding to the α2MSR, also induce the activation of wortmannin-sensitive PI3K.

The activation function-2 (AF-2) domain in SF-1 is a short α-helix in the C terminus that is conserved with respect to other nuclear receptors and is important for transactivation of target genes. In order to investigate the possible role of the AF-2 domain of SF-1 in cAMP-dependent transcriptional regulation of the bovine steroid hydroxylase gene CYP17, mutations were introduced and the effects were characterized. The mutant SF-1 proteins were expressed at comparable levels in nonsteroidogenic Cos-1 cells that lack SF-1, and their abilities to bind an SF-1 site from the CYP17 gene were not affected. Transient transfections of wild-type and mutant SF-1 in Cos-1 cells showed that the capacity to transactivate a reporter gene under the control of the SF-1 site from CYP17 was reduced by the mutations in the AF-2 domain of SF-1. A point mutation in the AF-2 region, E454A, resulted in a relative reporter gene activity that was 21% of that observed with wild-type SF-1. Co-transfections of adrenocortical Y-1 cells, which express endogenous SF-1, with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA-C) and the SF-1-dependent reporter gene showed on average a 16-fold increase in activity in the presence of PKA-C. Introduction of the AF-2 mutants of SF-1 into Y-1 cells completely abolished the PKA-C-mediated stimulation of the reporter gene.

Steroid hormone biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex, testis, and ovary is under the control of the trophic hormones adrenocorticotropic hormone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone from the pituitary (1Miller W.L. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar, 2Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27783-27786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through signaling via G-protein coupled cell surface receptors, these hormones increase intracellular cAMP levels and activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; SF-1, steroidogenic factor-1; hGR, human glucocorticoid receptor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; PKA-C, catalytic subunit of PKA; CRS2, cAMP-responsive sequence 2; AF-2, activation function-2; Ad4BP, adrenal 4-binding protein. As a consequence, steroidogenesis is stimulated through a rapid mobilization and movement of the substrate cholesterol to the enzymes, which convert it to biologically active hormones. In addition, cAMP and PKA increase the transcription of the genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes, including the steroid hydroxylases which belong to the cytochrome P-450 superfamily of enzymes (2Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27783-27786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) or Ad4BP is a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which appears to be crucial for not only the expression of essentially all components of the steroidogenic pathways but also for the development of the steroidogenic tissues per se (3Morohashi K.I. Omura T. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 4Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 5Luo X. Ikeda Y. Schlosser D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1233-1239PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, disruption of the SF-1 gene in mice leads to complete agenesis of the adrenals and gonads (6Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested that SF-1 may be directly involved in the cAMP-dependent regulation of steroid hydroxylase gene expression. Often SF-1-binding sites in target genes reside within regions that have been functionally assigned cAMP-responsiveness and require an intact PKA to be active (7Morohashi K. Iida H. Nomura M. Hatano O. Honda S. Tsukiyama T. Niwa O. Hara T. Takakusu A. Shibata Y. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 643-653PubMed Google Scholar, 8Parissenti A.M. Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar). Also, mutations that interfere with SF-1 binding often attenuate cAMP responsiveness (9Bakke M. Lund J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 327-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, SF-1 contains a putative PKA phosphorylation site (10Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (11Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and is immunoprecipitated as a phosphoprotein from adrenocortical cells grown in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate (12Lund J. Bakke M. Mellgren G. Morohashi K. Doskeland S.O. Steroids. 1997; 62: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 2A. L. Jacob and J. Lund, unpublished observations. However, the exact role of SF-1 in mediating the cAMP response is not well understood, and results in the literature are in part conflicting. In the bovine CYP17 gene, which encodes the cytochrome P-450 17α-hydroxylase, an SF-1 site is present within cAMP-responsive sequence 2 (CRS2) (13Lund J. Ahlgren R. Wu D.H. Kagimoto M. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3304-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations that interfere with SF-1 binding correlate with decreases in cAMP-stimulated transcription of a linked reporter gene (9Bakke M. Lund J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 327-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfection of SF-1 into a nonsteroidogenic cell lacking this transcription factor activates an otherwise inactive CRS2-dependent reporter construct, and co-transfection of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C) increases the activity severalfold. In order to determine whether this response relies on structures within SF-1 itself, amino acid substitutions and deletions were introduced. Here we show that mutations within a conserved core region of a putative C-terminal activation function-2 (AF-2) domain of SF-1 compromises its transactivating ability. Furthermore, such mutant SF-1 proteins are able to dominantly suppress the activity of wild-type SF-1 in adrenocortical tumor cells transfected with PKA-C. Cell culture media and sera were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. 32 The ECL (chemiluminescence) kit for Western blotting was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the luciferase assay kit was from BIO Thema AB (Luciferase Assay kit, production number 484-001, Dalaro, Sweden). All other chemicals were from Sigma or Merck. Y-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 units penicillin/ml, and 10 μg streptomycin/ml. The day before transfection, Y-1 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106cells/well. Before transfection, the standard growth medium was replaced by fresh medium, and the cells were incubated for a minimum of 2 h. The calcium phosphate co-precipitation method was used to transfect Y-1 cells as described previously (13Lund J. Ahlgren R. Wu D.H. Kagimoto M. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3304-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 3 μg of total DNA was added per well. Cos-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium (low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 units penicillin/ml, and 10 μg streptomycin/ml. The day before transfection, Cos-1 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well. Cos-1 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method according to standard procedures (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with transfection medium containing 3 μg of DNA for 1 h. After removing the transfection medium, 52 mg/liter of chloroquine was added in culture medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 5 h. The culture medium containing chloroquine was removed, and the cells were incubated for another 18 h with culture medium before they were harvested. After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 200 μl of lysis buffer was used to harvest the cells by scraping. 40 μl of the cell extracts were used for luciferase determinations on a LUCY-1 luminometer (Anthos, Austria). Preparation of lysis buffer and the luciferase enzyme assay was according to the procedures of a commercial kit (BIO Thema AB, Luciferase Assay kit, production number 484-001 Dalaro, Sweden). Constructions of the reporter plasmid pT81-4CRS2 and the expression plasmid pCMV5-SF-1 are as described (15Bakke M. Lund J. Endocr. Res. 1995; 21: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For mutagenesis of the AF-2 domain, the QuickChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. Briefly, the double-stranded plasmid pCMV5-SF-1 and two synthetic oligonucleotide primers with the desired mutations, each complementary to opposite strands, were annealed and extended by means of Pfu DNA polymerase. Following temperature cycling, the products were treated with DPN I in order to digest the parental plasmid. The DNA vectors with desired mutations were transformed into Escherichia coli(Epicurian Coli® XL1-supercompetent cells), and the mutations were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method (USB™, Sequenase, version 2.0). To determine expression levels, Cos-1 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type SF-1 and AF-2 mutants. After 24 h, cells were lysed, and extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Western blot analysis of SF-1 proteins was carried out with a polyclonal antiserum to Ad4BP/SF-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Ken Morohashi), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing the SF-1-binding site in CRS2 of the bovine CYP17 gene (15Bakke M. Lund J. Endocr. Res. 1995; 21: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was labeled with γ-32P and purified by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 10 μg of nuclear extracts from transfected Cos-1 cells containing wild-type and mutant SF-1 protein were incubated with the 32P-labeled probe. The reaction conditions were as described previously (13Lund J. Ahlgren R. Wu D.H. Kagimoto M. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3304-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes and unbound probe were separated by nondenaturing electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (0.045 m Tris borate, 0.001m EDTA). Several lines of evidence suggest that the nuclear receptor SF-1 may be directly involved in cAMP-dependent transcriptional regulation of steroid hydroxylase genes (see the Introduction). However, direct evidence of functionally important structures in SF-1 for the cAMP effect is lacking. The ligand-binding domain of nuclear receptors is located in the C-terminal region and consists of approximately 225 amino acids involved not only in ligand binding but also in homo-heterodimerization, hormone-dependent transcriptional activa-tion, as well as hormone-reversible transcriptional repression (16Oba K. Yanase T. Nomura M. Morohashi K. Takayanagi R. Nawata H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). The C-terminal activation function domain (AF-2) is common to all ligand-activated members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, and SF-1 has been shown to be activated by 25-hydroxy cholesterol in an AF-2-dependent manner (18Lala D.S. Syka P.M. Lazarchik S.B. Mangelsdorf D.J. Parker K.L. Heyman R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The AF-2 region in SF-1 and the alignment with various nuclear receptors are shown in Fig.1 A. The AF-2 sequence is LLIEML represented as ΦΦXEΦΦ (Fig. 1 B), where Φ represents hydrophobic residues and where E (glutamic acid) is common to most of the nuclear receptors. In order to test the possible importance of this region with respect to cAMP-dependent transactivation via SF-1, a series of mutations and deletions were introduced in the AF-2 domain. In mutants 1–3, the nonpolar Leu451 and Leu452were changed either to the small nonpolar residue alanine or deleted. The conserved glutamic acid at position 454 was substituted for alanine in mutant 4. The entire AF-2 core was deleted in mutant 5, whereas in mutant 6, the arginine and the two asparagine residues N-terminal to the AF-2 core were also deleted (Fig. 1 C). Wild-type and mutant plasmids were transfected into Cos-1 cells together with the reporter plasmid pT81-4CRS2Luc containing the SF-1-binding site from the proximal promoter region of the bovine CYP17 gene. Proper expression from wild-type and mutant plasmids was analyzed by Western blot analysis and EMSA. Using a polyclonal antiserum to SF-1, whole cell extracts from transfected Cos-1 cells show the expression of both wild-type and mutant SF-1 proteins at comparable levels (Fig.2 A). 10 μg of nuclear extracts of transfected Cos-1 cells were also used in EMSA, and no significant differences in DNA binding were observed when comparing wild-type and mutant SF-1 proteins (Fig. 2 B). It was therefore concluded that wild-type and mutant SF-1 proteins are expressed at comparable levels and that the proteins carrying mutations in their AF-2 core domain have retained their ability to bind DNA. To positively identify the mobility of SF-1, steroidogenic H295 cell extracts incubated in the presence or absence of antibodies against SF-1 before loading on the gel are also shown (Fig. 2 B,right-hand two lanes). To determine the effect of mutations in the AF-2 core domain of SF-1 with respect to its ability to stimulate the expression of pT81-4CRS2LUC, wild-type and mutant plasmids were transfected into Cos-1 cells. After 24 h of transfection, cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was determined. No activity was observed in extracts from cells transfected with the empty expression vector and the reporter plasmid (data not shown). Significant differences in transactivation were obtained when comparing wild-type and mutant SF-1 (Fig. 3). All the six mutants showed decreased ability to transactivate pT81-4CRS2LUC. In mutants 4, 5, and 6, the relative luciferase activity obtained was 21, 32, and 14% of that obtained with wild-type SF-1, respectively. The α-helical region of AF-2 is strongly hydrophobic and direct contact with ligand has been shown in the thyroid receptor (T3Rα) and the retinoic acid receptor (RARγ) (19Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 20Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). According to the crystal structures of T3Rα and RARγ, the leucine residues Leu451 and Leu452as well as Glu454 in SF-1 are predicted to be surface exposed in the helical core and form part of an interaction surface recognized by cofactors or ligand. Leu451 and Glu454 are among the most conserved residues in other nuclear receptors, and Glu454 is not only surface exposed but also extends into the solvent. The dramatic effect of mutating Glu454 in SF-1 supports the notion that this is an essential residue for transactivation by nuclear receptors. In Y-1 cells (mouse adrenocortical tumor cells), which express endogenous SF-1, transfection with the reporter plasmid pT81-4CRS2LUC resulted in clearly detectable levels of luciferase activity (Fig. 4). When the mutant SF-1 proteins were expressed, a significant reduction in the level of basal activity was observed. Transfection of the mutants 5 and 6, which carry deletions of the AF-2 domain, gave rise to relative luciferase activities that were 44 and 32%, respectively, of the activities obtained when the empty expression vector was used for transfection. These results show that the basal activity of the pT81-4CRS2LUC is attenuated through transfection with plasmids encoding SF-1 proteins deleted in the AF-2 core region. SF-1 is an activator of CRS2-mediated transcription, and this activity has previously been shown to be stimulated in the presence of forskolin and PKA-C (9Bakke M. Lund J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 327-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, co-transfection of Y-1 cells with pT81-4CRS2LUC and 100 ng of plasmid encoding PKA-C plasmid led to a highly significant increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 4). However, the transcriptional activation by endogenous SF-1 was drastically reduced (up to 90% inhibition) when the AF-2 mutants were expressed in the presence of PKA-C. These results suggest that the AF-2 mutants of SF-1 compete with the endogenous SF-1 for transactivation in a dominant negative fashion. In contrast, transfection of Y-1 cells with a plasmid encoding the fusion protein between green fluorescent protein and the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) did not affect the activity of pT81-4CRS2LUC either in the presence or absence of PKA-C (Fig. 5). The mechanism(s) underlying the transdominant negative effect by these AF-2 mutants of SF-1 could theoretically involve dimerization of the mutant SF-1 proteins and endogenous SF-1. However, heterodimer formation is not supported by evidence from the literature, which indicates that SF-1 binds DNA as a monomer (21Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Other possible explanations might be the competition for binding of DNA and co-activators such as steroid receptor co-activator-1 and CREB-binding protein. Interaction of steroid receptor co-activator-1 in an AF-2-dependent manner with SF-1 has been recently demonstrated (22Crawford P.A. Polish J.A. Ganpule G. Sadovsky Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have noticed up to a 40-fold increase in luciferase activity by co-transfection of Y-1 cells with pT81-4CRS2LUC and PKA-C. The results from the AF-2 mutations suggest that the increased activity relies on this domain in SF-1. What could therefore be the possible site(s) of cAMP regulation? Previous studies show that the activation of the PKA signaling pathway does not increase the mRNA levels for SF-1 in Y-1 and MA-10 cells (11Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) nor does it affect SF-1 protein levels in Y-1 cells. 3M. Bakke and J. Lund, unpublished observations. So the enhanced transactivation observed in PKA-stimulated Y-1 cells should not be the consequence of a change in the abundance of SF-1. It is possible that PKA-C expression in Y-1 cells increases the levels or the availability of a possible ligand for SF-1. 25-Hydroxy cholesterol has been shown to activate SF-1 (18Lala D.S. Syka P.M. Lazarchik S.B. Mangelsdorf D.J. Parker K.L. Heyman R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of this ligand is induced by PKA in adrenocortical cells. Studies on other nuclear receptors have shown that phosphorylation can lead to conformational changes in the proteins and can effect DNA binding and protein-protein interactions as well as nuclear translocation (24Weigel N.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of SF-1 by PKA-C has been reported (11Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This could suggest that PKA-dependent phosphorylation would be a possible mechanism for activation of SF-1. However, increased phosphorylation led to a decreased DNA binding affinity of SF-1 (11Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This is analogous to NGFI-B (Nur77), another nuclear receptor, where increased levels ofin vivo phosphorylation of NGFI-B protein correlated with decreased DNA binding affinity (25Hirata Y. Kiuchi K. Chen H.C. Milbrandt J. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24808-24812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to envision how PKA-dependent inhibition of DNA binding by SF-1 could lead to increased transactivation of target genes and why an intact AF-2 domain would be required. Whether SF-1 protein can be phosphorylated in vivo by PKA and whether such phosphorylation achieves receptor activation via the AF-2 domain should therefore be experimentally tested. It is also possible that activated PKA does not directly phosphorylate SF-1 to regulate its transactivation capacity but that it instead elicits a change in the phosphorylation status by other mechanisms. There is precedence in the literature for phosphorylation-dependent activation of nuclear receptors that appears to be direct and not dependent on the presence of ligand (23El-Tanani M.K. Green C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 928-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), e.g. the estrogen receptor can be activated in the absence of ligand by cAMP treatment of cells (23El-Tanani M.K. Green C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 928-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results clearly show that even a single point mutation in the AF-2 core domain of SF-1 had a significant effect on transactivation and transformed SF-1 into a dominant negative mutant with respect to PKA-C-dependent activation of a SF-1-regulated reporter gene. Co-activators or ligands involved in transactivation by SF-1 in an AF-2-dependent manner in the presence of PKA-C remain to be determined. We are grateful to Dr. K. Morohashi for antibodies against SF-1/Ad4BP and Dr. K. Umesono for the plasmid encoding the hGR/green fluorescent protein fusion protein."
https://openalex.org/W2049135087,"The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiological agent of two different human pathologies, chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (zoster). This alphaherpesvirus is believed to acquire its lipidic envelope in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This is consistent with previous data showing that the most abundant VZV envelope glycoprotein gE accumulates at steady-state in this organelle when expressed from cloned cDNA. In the present study, we have investigated the intracellular trafficking of gI, another VZV envelope glycoprotein. In transfected cells, this protein shows a very slow biosynthetic transport to the cell surface where it accumulates. However, upon co-expression of gE, gI experiences a dramatic increase in its exit rate from the endoplasmic reticulum, it accumulates in a sialyltransferase-positive compartment, presumably the TGN, and cycles between this compartment and the cell surface. This differential behavior results from the ability of gE and gI to form a complex in the early stages of the biosynthetic pathway whose intracellular traffic is exclusively determined by the sorting information in the tail of gE. Thus, gI provides the first example of a molecule localized to the TGN by means of its association with another TGN protein. We also show that, during the early stages of VZV infection, both proteins are also found in the TGN of the host cell. This suggests the existence of an intermediate stage during VZV biogenesis in which the envelope glycoproteins, transiently arrested in the TGN, could promote the envelopment of newly synthesized nucleocapsids into this compartment and, therefore, the assembly of infective viruses.

The trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; BFA, brefeldin A; BHV, bovine herpesvirus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FHV, feline herpesvirus; HSV, herpes simplex virus; PRV, pseudorabies virus; ST, sialyltransferase; VZV, varicella-zoster virus; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetrahodamine isothiocyanate; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G. is a tubuloreticular compartment located on the trans-most side of the Golgi complex (1Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar). This organelle houses different proteins that are involved in adding post-translational modifications to polypeptides traveling along the secretory pathway. In addition, this organelle constitutes the main sorting station in the secretory pathway (2Mellman I. Simons K. Cell. 1992; 68: 829-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The TGN can undergo rapid tubularization and mixing with endosomal compartments in the presence of the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) (4Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Scwharz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The TGN has also been used by certain viruses as a membrane donor for their lipidic envelope (envelopment or budding process), as it happens in the case of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (5Gershon A.A. Sherman D.L. Zhu Z. Gabel C.A. Ambron R.T. Gershon M.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6372-6390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zhu Z. Gershon M.D. Gabel C. Sherman D. Ambron R. Gershin A. Neurology. 1995; 45: S15-S17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VZV is a human alphaherpesvirus causing chickenpox (varicella), as a result of the primary infection, and shingles (zoster) upon reactivation of the latent virus (7Weller T.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Weller T.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1434-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As it occurs in other alphaherpesviruses, the VZV nucleocapsids are assembled in the nuclei of the infected cells. These nucleocapsids are then released into the periplasmic space by budding through the inner nuclear membrane, thereby acquiring a transient envelope that is lost upon fusion with the outer nuclear membrane. In this way, the nucleocapsids are released in the cytosol, where they acquire a second and definitive envelope. This envelope is derived from the TGN, as initially demonstrated by Gershon et al. (5Gershon A.A. Sherman D.L. Zhu Z. Gabel C.A. Ambron R.T. Gershon M.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6372-6390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by examining VZV-infected cells at the ultrastructural level. Mature viruses accumulate finally in an intracellular endosomal compartment (9Gabel C.A. Dubey L. Steinberg S.P. Sherman D. Gershon M.D. Gershon A.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4264-4276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As happens in other cases of viruses that undergo intracellular assembly, envelopment of VZV in the TGN requires that the corresponding envelope glycoproteins have to be delivered to this compartment during viral infection (10Zhu Z. Gershon M.D. Hao Y. Ambron R.T. Gabel C.A. Gershon A.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7951-7959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhu Z. Hao Y. Gershon M.D. Ambron R.T. Gershon A.A. J.

This implies that sorting signals must exist within these glycoproteins to ensure their correct targeting, making these molecules very useful tools for analyzing the mechanisms involved in TGN localization. We and others have recently shown that the most abundant envelope glycoprotein of VZV (gpI or gE) accumulates in the TGN when expressed from cloned cDNA and that this accumulation results, at least partially, from its ability to be rapidly retrieved form the cell surface (10Zhu Z. Gershon M.D. Hao Y. Ambron R.T. Gabel C.A. Gershon A.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7951-7959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhu Z. Hao Y. Gershon M.D. Ambron R.T. Gershon A.A. J.

The sorting information in the sequence of gE has been mapped to its cytoplasmic tail, and shown to consist of two tyrosine-containing tetrapeptides related to endocytosis motifs (11Zhu Z. Hao Y. Gershon M.D. Ambron R.T. Gershon A.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6563-6575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and a more C-terminal acidic cluster that contains casein-kinase II- phosphorylatable residues (11Zhu Z. Hao Y. Gershon M.D. Ambron R.T. Gershon A.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6563-6575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These signals are similar to those found in other molecules known to be localized in the TGN at steady state, such as TGN38 or furin (13Jones B.G. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Thulin C.D.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22853-22862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to gE, there are at least five additional glycoproteins in the envelope of VZV (gB, gH, gI, gC, and gL, formerly known as gpII, gpIII, gpIV, gpV, and gpVI, respectively) (20Davidson A.J. Edson C.M. Ellis R.W. Forghani B. Gilden D. Grose C. Keller P.M. Vafai A. Wroblewska Z. Yamanishi K. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1195-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose sequences are apparently devoid of TGN-sorting information. If VZV indeed acquires its final envelope in the TGN, then mechanisms must exist to ensure that all these molecules reach this compartment in order to promote infective VZV formation. In the present article, we have focused our attention on another type I glycoprotein of the viral envelope, the glycoprotein gI (or gpIV). This molecule has been shown to physically interact with gE in VZV (21Yao Z. Jackson W. Forghani B. Grose C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) (22Johnson D.C. Feenstra V. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) (23De Mijnes J.D.F. van der Horst L.M. van Anken E. Horzinek M.C. Rottier P.J.M. de Groot R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5466-5475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pseudorabies virus (PRV) (24Whealy M.E. Card J.P. Robbins A.K. Dubin J.R. Rziha H.-J. Enquist L.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3786-3797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), three other members of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Our results indicate that gI, which is found in the cell surface when expressed alone, accumulates in the TGN when expressed together with gE. This accumulation of gI in the TGN also relies on its rapid internalization from the cell surface. Our data indicate that gE and gI precursors can form a stoichiometric complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which results in an increased maturation rate of gI. We have also found that, in VZV-infected cells, both gE and gI can be found shortly after infection in a perinuclear compartment that most likely corresponds to the TGN. Monoclonal antibodies SG1 and SG4, against VZV gE and gI, respectively, were obtained from Viro Research Inc. (Rockford, IL). The polyclonal serum against the cytoplasmic tail of furin was generously provided by Dr. W. Garten (University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany). The SA48 HeLa clone stably expressing VSVG-tagged sialyltransferase (ST-VSVG) was a generous gift of Dr. Tommy Nilsson (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). All secondary antibodies against the Fc of mouse or rabbit IgGs coupled to FITC or rhodamine were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Construction of the gE expression vector has been previously described (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In order to clone VZV gI, the complete open reading frame was amplified from a lysate of VZV (Dumas strain)-infected cells using the Expand High Fidelity kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). The resulting fragment was digested withXbaI and HindIII and was cloned into the same sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pSFFV6 (25Chen H.J. Remmler J. Delaney J.C. Messner D.J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22338-22346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or downstream the T7 promoter in pGEM1. The gE mutants containing the cytoplasmic tail of the yeast protein Wbp1p with either the C-terminal KKXX or the SSXX signals were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based amplification using reverse primers in which the corresponding sequences of the wild-type or mutated Wbp1p cytoplasmic tails had been introduced as translational fusions with the sequence of the gE transmembrane domain. The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with XbaI and HindIII and cloned into the same sites in the pSFFV6 vector. The sequences of both mutants were verified using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method. The antibody 1667 against the full-length gE was obtained by cloning a cDNA fragment coding for the mature VZV gE open reading frame with a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus into the NcoI/BamHI sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen, Wiesbaden, Germany). The protein was expressed in BL21 cells and the insoluble fraction (containing most of the recombinant gE) was solubilized in 8 m urea and loaded on a Talon metal-affinity column (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany). After extensive washing, the bound protein was eluted with SDS-loading buffer, and approximately 50 μg were loaded on a 7.5% preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The part of the gel containing the recombinant protein was excised, homogenized using a Teflon-glass homogenizer, mixed with either Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant, and used to immunize rabbits following standard procedures. To produce the 2679 antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of gI, a fragment comprising amino acids 314–354 of the gI precursor form was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) as a fusion to glutathione S-transferase. The glutathioneS-transferase-gI fusion was expressed in XL-1 Blue cells and purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. After elution, the fusion protein was loaded on a preparative 7.5% preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel fragment containing the band was excised, homogenized, mixed with Freund's adjuvant, and used to inoculate rabbits following a standard immunization schedule. The serum was affinity-purified by incubation with a nitrocellulose strip onto which the recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-gI had been previously bound (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For the internalization assays, a continuous uptake was performed in which transfected cells seeded on coverslips were washed with prewarmed α-MEM and overlaid with 200 μl of complete α-MEM in which the antibodies had been diluted as specified in the figure legends. After 1-h incubation, the internalization medium was removed and the cells were immediately fixed and processed for immunofluorescence using fluorescein or rhodamine-coupled secondary antibodies. Due to the cell-associated nature of VZV, infections were carried out as described previously (27Defechereux P. Debrus S. Baudoux L. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M.-P. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), by co-culture of VZV (Ellen strain)-infected Vero cells with noninfected either Vero or HeLa cells. For the immunofluorescence experiments, infected and noninfected cells were plated on coverslips at a 1:4 ratio and grown in complete α-MEM for different times as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were subsequently fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Published procedures were used for vaccinia T7 infection (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), metabolic labeling of the cells and immunoprecipitation (28Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and for calcium-phosphate transient transfection and indirect immunofluorescence (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To address the subcellular localization of the VZV-envelope glycoprotein gI (gpIV), we have cloned the complete gI open reading frame in the mammalian expression vector pSFFV6 (25Chen H.J. Remmler J. Delaney J.C. Messner D.J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22338-22346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have used this construct to perform transient transfection assays in HeLa cells followed by immunofluorescence using anti-gI-specific antibodies. This experiment revealed that, in every transfected cell, gI was exclusively found at the cell surface (Fig.1 b). As a control, we also performed transient transfections with an analogous construct in which the complete gE (gpI) open reading frame had been inserted into the same expression vector (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous data (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), in cells transfected with the gE expression vector, this protein was exclusively localized in the perinuclear region of the cell (Fig.1 c), in a compartment that has been previously identified as the TGN, based on its co-localization at the light microscopy level with the TGN markers TGN38, furin, and sialyltransferase (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), at the electron microscopic level with galactosyltransferase, 2A. Alconada, S. Ro¨ttgers, and B. Hoflack, unpublished observations. and by its sensitivity to BFA and nocodazole, two drugs that affect the morphology of this compartment (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We next looked at the localization of gI in HeLa cells that had been simultaneously transfected with gE and gI expression constructs. In these cells, expression of gI was mainly restricted to the perinuclear region of the cell, largely colocalizing with gE, and almost absent from the cell surface (Fig. 1, e and f). We also performed an analogous double-transfection experiment using gI and an unrelated TGN marker (the convertase furin), whose intracellular traffic closely resembles that of gE (13Jones B.G.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4961-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this case, whereas expression of furin was restricted to the perinuclear region of the cell (Fig. 1 g), gI was exclusively detected at the cell surface (Fig. 1 h), therefore excluding the possibility that the perinuclear localization of gI in gE-expressing cells was simply due to an inability of the cell to properly sort gI at the TGN in the presence of another highly expressed molecule in this compartment. It has been previously suggested that gE and gI might share common antigenic determinants (29Vafai A. Wroblewska Z. Mahalingan G. Cabirac G. Wellish M. Cisco M. Gilden D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2544-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vafai A. Jensen K. Kubo R. Virus Res. 1989; 13: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which could explain the perinuclear signal attributed to gI in cells expressing gE if the antibodies used in this study would recognize any of these shared epitopes. However, this does not seem to be the case, since in cells expressing gI, no signal was detected with the anti-gE antibody (Fig. 1 a) and, conversely, no signal was observed with anti-gI antibodies in cells exclusively transfected with gE (Fig. 1 d). To exclude that the strong cell surface gI-staining observed in cells expressing gI alone or gI and furin could mask any labeling of intracellular compartments, we analyzed the single or double-transfected cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy. As expected, no gI-staining could be detected intracellularly (data not shown). The same distribution was observed when polyclonal antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of gI were used (data not shown). From all these results, we concluded that the localization of gI in transfected cells can be shifted from the cell-surface to the perinuclear region by the simultaneous co-expression of gE. The colocalization experiments shown above indicate that, when expressed together, gE and gI are localized to the same cellular compartment, but they do not prove that this compartment is indeed the TGN, the organelle where gE accumulates when expressed alone (10Zhu Z. Gershon M.D. Hao Y. Ambron R.T. Gabel C.A. Gershon A.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7951-7959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhu Z. Hao Y. Gershon M.D. Ambron R.T. Gershon A.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6563-6575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have previously used the rapid tubularization in response to BFA as a hallmark of the TGN to distinguish it from other membrane-bound compartments clustered in the perinuclear region of the cell (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). When HeLa cells expressing gE and gI were treated for 5 min with 10 μg/ml BFA, fixed and decorated with anti-gE and anti-gI antibodies, both molecules were found to colocalize in thin tubules that emanated from the perinuclear region into the cell periphery (Fig.2, a and b), strongly suggesting that the TGN is the compartment where gE and gI accumulate upon co-expression. Another property of certain TGN markers (gE, furin, and TGN38) is their ability to constantly cycle between the TGN and the cell surface (16Voorhoes P. Deignan E. van Donselaar E. Humphrey J. Marks M. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4961-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,18Bos K. Wraight C. Stanley K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2219-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Since gI is found mainly in the TGN in the presence of gE, we wanted to investigate whether this also involves cycling of gI between these two compartments. To address this question, anti-gE and anti-gI antibody uptake experiments were performed on HeLa cells that had been double-transfected with gE and gI expression constructs. As shown in Fig. 2 c and in agreement with our previous findings (12Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), after 1 h of incubation, the anti-gE antibodies were mainly concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell, as a result of their internalization bound to the luminal domain of the recycling gE molecules. Interestingly, the anti-gI monoclonal antibody, when incubated with the cells for the same time, was also found in the perinuclear region, colocalizing with the anti-gE antibodies (Fig.2 d). In contrast, when the same experiment was performed on cells transfected exclusively with the pSFFV-gI construct, only cell surface bound anti-gI antibody could be detected (data not shown). These data indicate that gI, when simultaneously co-expressed with gE, cycles between the TGN and the cell surface, and that its accumulation in the TGN most likely depends on its rapid internalization from the cell surface together with gE, suggesting that the distribution of gI when co-expressed with gE is indistinguishable from that observed for gE when expressed alone. The results presented so far suggest that gE and gI are found within a complex in the cell whose traffic and distribution is solely determined by the sorting information in the cytoplasmic tail of gE. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed a modified version of gE in which its cytoplasmic tail had been replaced by that of the yeast protein Wbp1p, a type-I membrane protein that forms part of the ER resident oligosaccharyl-transferase complex (32Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The tail of Wbp1p, which contains a consensus KKXX ER retention motif, has been shown to be sufficient to confer ER localization to reporter molecules both in mammalian and yeast cell systems (33Cosson P. Letorneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 34Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). When the gE-KKXX and the gI expression constructs were simultaneously transfected into HeLa cells and the localization of both molecules was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, both the gE-KKXXchimera and gI were found in a cytoplasmic reticular compartment showing all the morphological features of the ER (Fig.3, a and b). As a control, we also constructed a gE-SSXX expression plasmid, in which the two lysines at positions −3 and −4 in the KKXX signal have been replaced by serines. This mutation is known to abolish the ER retention capacity of the KKXX motif (33Cosson P. Letorneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). As expected, in cells co-expressing the gE-SSXX mutant and gI, both molecules were only detected at the cell surface (Fig. 3,c and d). These result confirms our prediction that the intracellular traffic of gI is exclusively determined by the sorting information on the tail of gE, presumably as a reflect of their association in the early secretory pathway. We then asked whether the expression of one given protein could influence the maturation of the other. In order to address this question, gE and gI were expressed either alone or simultaneously in HeLa cells with the help of a T7 RNA-polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus. The cells were metabolically labeled with radioactive methionine, chased for increasing periods of time, and lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-gE- and anti-gI-specific antibodies. To identify the precursor and mature forms of gE and gI, both molecules were immunoprecipitated from cells lysates that were obtained either immediately after the labeling period or after 6 h of chase. The results showed that gE was initially synthesized as a 70-kDa band that was converted during the chase to a 100-kDa polypeptide, and gI was initially found as a 50-kDa band that matured to yield a fuzzy 65-kDa band (Fig.4 a). These values are in agreement with those found by other groups, either in transfected (21Yao Z. Jackson W. Forghani B. Grose C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,35Litwin V. Jackson W. Grose C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3643-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in VZV-infected cells (36Montalvo E.A. Parmley R.T. Grose C. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 761-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for both the precursor and mature forms of gE and gI. When gE was expressed alone, immunoprecipitation with anti-gE antibodies revealed that maturation of the protein occurred rather rapidly, since as early as 20 min after initiation of the chase, almost 50% of the labeled 70-kDa precursor molecule was converted to the mature 100-kDa form (Fig. 4, b andc). When gI was expressed alone and immunoprecipitated with anti-gI antibodies under analogous conditions, its processing occurred very slowly, requiring more than 1 h to convert only 20% of the precursor to the mature form (Fig. 4, b and c). However, when gE and gI were expressed together, processing of gI was considerably enhanced, because 50% of the mature form could be detected after only 40 min of chase (Fig. 4, b andc). Under the same conditions, no difference was observed in the maturation of gE, when compared with the results obtained when this protein was expressed alone (Fig. 4 b). In addition, the anti-gE- and anti-gI-specific antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate any gI and gE, respectively (data not shown). It is worth mentioning that, when both proteins were expressed together, processing of gI occurred almost with identical kinetics as the processing of gE (Fig. 4 c). However, under these conditions, we reproducibly observed a decrease in the amounts of gE and gI that could be immunoprecipitated with their cognate antibodies when compared with the single transfections (Fig. 4 b).

We have previously reported an indirect mechanism by which c-Jun is able to regulate transcription by stimulating androgen receptor transactivation in the absence of c-Fos or any apparent DNA binding. A series of c-Jun mutants were tested in order to characterize the domains of c-Jun responsible for this effect. The studies reported here indicate that a functional bZIP region and a portion of the N-terminal activation functions is necessary for c-Jun stimulation of androgen receptor transactivation. Testing c-Jun/v-Jun chimeras, we show that v-Jun is unable to stimulate androgen receptor transactivation and the effect is dependent on the c-Jun activation functions. c-Jun exhibits a bell-shaped activity on androgen receptor-mediated transactivation which appears to be distinct from c-Jun's transactivation ability. A c-Jun mutant deficient in transactivation is able to stimulate androgen receptor activity. These results indicate that c-Jun's transactivation ability can be separated from c-Jun's ability to stimulate the androgen receptor transactivation."

A highly diverse (1.5 x 10(10) members) phage-displayed library of peptides containing 40 random amino acids was used to identify the PAb1620 binding site on p53. Panning this library against PAb1620 resulted in three unique peptides which have statistically significant sequence identities with p53 sufficient to identify the binding site as being composed of amino acids 106-113 and 146-156. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism by which PAb1620 can allosterically inhibit p53 binding to DNA through an indirect interaction between the antibody binding site and the L1 loop (amino acids 112-124) of p53, which is a component of the DNA binding region."
https://openalex.org/W2330259671,"The inactivation of certain tumor suppressor genes is thought to play an important role in the genesis of a number of tumor types. For example, inactivation of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor is frequently observed in a proportion of sporadic human breast cancers. While these studies suggest that inactivation of key tumor suppressor genes may play an important role in the induction of mammary cancers, direct evidence supporting this contention is lacking. Because polyomavirus (PyV) Large T (LT) antigen is known to associate with and inactivate certain members of the Rb family (p105Rb, p107, p130), we have derived transgenic mice which express PyV LT antigen in the mammary epithelium. As expected mammary epithelial-specific expression of PyV LT antigen resulted in the induction of mammary tumors which correlated with their capacity to associate with Rb family members. In addition to mammary carcinomas, female transgenic mice expressing the PyV LT transgene frequently develop uterine leiomyomas. Because loss of heterozygosity involving the human CUTL1 (Cut like 1) gene located at chromosomal position 7q22 has been recently implicated in sporadic human uterine leiomyomas, we tested the hypothesis that PyV LT antigen may also form specific complexes with CUTL1. The results of these analyses revealed that specific complexes of CUTL1 and PyV LT antigen could be detected in both leiomyomas and mammary tumors. Taken together, these observations suggest that PyV LT antigen may be involved in inducing these tumors by sequestering both CUTL1 and Rb growth regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2093152209,"Abstract Guinea pig intestinal phospholipase B is a calcium-independent phospholipase hydrolyzing sequentially the acyl ester bonds at sn-2 and sn-1 positions of glycerophospholipids, promoting the formation ofsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine from phosphatidylcholine. This 140-kDa glycoprotein from the brush border membrane of differentiated enterocytes contributes to lipid digestion as an ectoenzyme. The cDNA coding for guinea pig phospholipase B was revealed to be the homologue of AdRab-B, an mRNA appearing in rabbit upon intestine development. The sequence predicts a polypeptide of 1463 amino acids displaying four homologous repeats, two of them containing the lipase consensus sequence GXSXG. A 5-kilobase transcript was particularly abundant in mature ileal and jejunal enterocytes but was also detected in epididymis, where phospholipase B displayed a higher molecular mass (170 kDa versus 140 kDa in intestine), with no obvious evidence for enzyme activity. Trypsin treatment of phospholipase B immunoprecipitated from epididymal membranes reduced its size to 140 kDa, coinciding with the appearance of a significant phospholipase A2 activity. The same results were obtained in COS cells transfected with phospholipase B cDNA. Since sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine present at high concentrations in seminal plasma mainly stems from epididymis, this suggests a possible role of phospholipase B in male reproduction. This novel localization also unravels a mechanism of phospholipase B activation by limited proteolysis involving either trypsin in the intestinal lumen or a trypsin-like endopeptidase in the male reproductive tract."
https://openalex.org/W2151652128,"Abstract Nuclear factor-I (NFI) binds to the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK) gene promoter immediately 5′ to the cAMP regulatory element (CRE). This suggests an interaction between NFI and factors that bind the CRE. Of the four NFI isoforms expressed in mammalian tissues, NFI-A and -B stimulate basal transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter in HepG2 cells, while NFI-C and -X are slightly inhibitory. All four NFI isoforms abrogate the 20-fold protein kinase Ac (PKAc)-mediated induction of transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter. Normal PKAc-mediated induction was noted when the CRE was moved 10 base pairs 3′ of its original location. However if the CRE was moved 5 base pairs 3′, placing it out of phase with the other elements in the promoter, or moved 5′ to −285 (the P3(I) site in the promoter), some PKA-mediated stimulation was lost. The NFI-C isoform effectively inhibited PKAc induction regardless of the relative positions of the CRE and the NFI binding sites. NFI-C also abrogated cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB)-induced activity of wild type and mutant PEPCK promoters. There was some cooperativity in the binding of CREB and NFI to their respective binding sites but this did not appear to be physiologically important."

The present study describes a second mutation, D520N, in the same MPS VI cat colony, which is inherited independently of L476P and is associated with a clinically mild MPS VI phenotype in D520N/L476P compound heterozygous cats. Biochemical and clinical assessment of L476P homozygous, D520N/L476P compound heterozygous, and D520N homozygous cats demonstrated that the entire range of clinical phenotypes, from severe MPS VI, to mild MPS VI, to normal are clustered within a narrow range of residual 4S activity from 0.5% to 4.6% of normal levels. When overexpressed in CHO-KI cells, the secreted form of D520N 4S was inactivated in neutral pH conditions. In addition, intracellular D520N 4S protein was rapidly degraded and corresponded to 37%, 14.5%, and 0.67% of normal 4S protein levels in the microsomal, endosomal, and lysosomal compartments, respectively. However, the specific activity of lysosomal D520N 4S was elevated 22.5-fold when compared with wild-type 4S. These results suggest that the D520N mutation causes a rapid degradation of 4S protein. The effect of this is partially ameliorated as a result of a significant elevation in the specific activity of mutant D520N 4S reaching the lysosomal compartment."
