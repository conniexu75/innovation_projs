https://openalex.org/W2000170431,"To understand the normal, physiological role of the c-src proto-oncogene, a null mutation was introduced into the gene by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. Two independent targeted clones were used to generate chimeras that transmitted the mutated allele to their offspring. Intercrossing of heterozygotes gave rise to live born homozygotes, but most of these mice died within the first few weeks of birth. Histological and hematological examination of the homozygous mutants did not reveal detectable abnormalities in the brain or platelets, where src is most highly expressed. However, these mutants were deficient in bone remodeling, indicating impaired osteoclast function, and developed osteopetrosis. These results demonstrate that src is not required for general cell viability (possibly because of functional overlap with other tyrosine kinases related to src) and uncover an essential role for src in bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2163035954,"We are studying mice that carry a targeted disruption of the gene encoding insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). Transmission of this mutation through the male germline results in heterozygous progeny that are growth deficient. In contrast, when the disrupted gene is transmitted maternally, the heterozygous offspring are phenotypically normal. Therefore, the difference in growth phenotypes depends on the type of gamete contributing the mutated allele. Homozygous mutants are indistinguishable in appearance from growth-deficient heterozygous siblings. Nuclease protection and in situ hybridization analyses of the transcripts from the wild-type and mutated alleles indicate that only the paternal allele is expressed in embryos, while the maternal allele is silent. An exception is the choroid plexus and leptomeninges, where both alleles are transcriptionally active. These results demonstrate that IGF-II is indispensable for normal embryonic growth and that the IGF-II gene is subject to tissue-specific parental imprinting."
https://openalex.org/W2088658701,"A row of mesectodermal cells separates the two lateral neurogenic regions in the Drosophila embryo and generates a discrete set of glia and neurons. Most CNS growth cones initially head straight toward the midline, suggesting that these midline cells play a key role in the formation of the axon commissures. We have used antibodies that stain the first axons, beta-galactosidase enhancer trap lines that selectively stain the different midline cells, and electron microscopic studies to elucidate the cells and interactions that mediate the normal formation of the two major commissures in each segment. This analysis has led to a model that proposes a series of sequential cell interactions controlling the development of the axon commissures. A genetic test of this model has utilized a number of mutations that, by either eliminating or altering the differentiation of various midline cells, perturb the development of the axon commissures in a predictable fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2002341882,"SEC14p is the yeast phosphatidylinositol (PI)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer protein, and it effects an essential stimulation of yeast Golgi secretory function. We now report that the SEC14p localizes to the yeast Golgi and that the SEC14p requirement can be specifically and efficiently bypassed by mutations in any one of at least six genes. One of these suppressor genes was the structural gene for yeast choline kinase (CKI), disruption of which rendered the cell independent of the normally essential SEC14p requirement. The antagonistic action of the CKI gene product on SEC14p function revealed a previously unsuspected influence of biosynthetic activities of the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis on yeast Golgi function and indicated that SEC14p controls the phospholipid content of yeast Golgi membranes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2169492321,"The most common genetic cause of mental retardation after Down's syndrome, the fragile X syndrome, is associated with the occurrence of a fragile site at Xq27.3. This X-linked disease is intriguing because transmission can occur through phenotypically normal males. Theories to explain this unusual phenomenon include genomic rearrangements and methylation changes associated with a local block of reactivation of the X chromosome. Using microdissected markers close to the fragile site, we have been able to test these hypotheses. We present evidence for the association of methylation with the expression of the disease. However, there is no simple relationship between the degree of methylation and either the level of expression of the fragile site or the severity of the clinical phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1795265328,"Abstract At least 50% of the actin in resting human platelets is unpolymerized, and the bulk of this unpolymerized actin is complexed with a recently identified acidic, heat-stable 5-kDa peptide, named Fx. Purified Fx binds stoichiometrically to muscle G-actin, forming a complex identifiable by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Formation of the complex inhibits salt-induced polymerization of G-actin. Here we report that Fx is indistinguishable from thymosin beta 4, an acidic, heat-stable 5-kDa peptide first isolated from calf thymus and thought to be a thymic hormone. The complete amino acid sequence of Fx was determined and was found to be identical with that of thymosin beta 4. Authentic thymosin beta 4 is functionally equivalent to Fx, forming a 1:1 complex with actin monomers and inhibiting polymerization. The widespread distribution and high intracellular concentration of thymosin beta 4 (Fx) strongly suggest that it plays a significant role in regulating actin polymerization in many cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2089813569,"A key protein component (CBF3) of the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) centromere/kinetochore has been purified and characterized. CBF3 is a 240 kd multisubunit protein complex that binds specifically to the yeast wild-type centromere DNA (CEN), but not to nonfunctional CEN DNA containing a single base substitution in the critical CDEIII consensus sequence. When purified by affinity chromatography, CBF3 contains three protein components: CBF3A (110 kd), CBF3B (64 kd), and CBF3C (58 kd). Highly purified CBF3 requires the presence of a separate assembly factor or chaperone activity to bind to CEN DNA. Treatment with phosphatase inactivates CBF3, indicating that at least one of the CBF3 subunits must be phosphorylated for DNA binding to occur. A 56 bp region including the 26 bp CDEIII consensus is protected from DNAase I cleavage in the CBF3-CEN DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W2046570924,"The mammalian transcription factor AP-2 is a retinoic acid inducible sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that is developmentally regulated. In this report, the functional domains necessary for AP-2 DNA binding were studied. AP-2 required a dimerization domain and an adjacent region of net basic charge to achieve a sequence-specific protein:DNA interaction. The sequences responsible for dimerization consisted of two putative amphipathic alpha helices separated by a large intervening span region. This helix-span-helix (HSH) domain was unable to bind DNA when separated from the basic region, but was still capable of dimerization. The ability of the HSH domain to function as a module that promotes DNA binding through dimerization was further demonstrated by attaching it to the heterologous basic region of the c-Jun proto-oncogene product. The resulting chimeric protein specifically recognized an AP-1 DNA-binding site in the absence of an intact c-Jun leucine repeat and in a manner that was dependent on the presence of a functional AP-2 dimerization domain."
https://openalex.org/W2076567606,"Expression of the differentiated neuronal phenotype is typically manifest in several properties: distinct morphologies and organizations of the underlying cytoskeleton; appearance of specific macromolecules; and cessation of cell division. All of these properties are induced in undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma cells exposed to retinoic acid. We show here that the mRNA and protein for the microtubule component MAP2 is also induced by retinoic acid. Stable transfectants of undifferentiated cells, constitutively expressing MAP2 antisense RNA, show significantly reduced levels of MAP2 antisense RNA, show significantly reduced levels of MAP2 protein upon induction compared with controls. These cells do express other neuronal markers, but they do not undergo normal morphological differentiation nor do they withdraw from the cell cycle. The results suggest that MAP2 expression may be necessary for both neurite extension and cessation of cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1929791435,"The reductive products of several nitroaromatic compounds have been found to be toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. The nitroreductases present in intestinal microflora have been implicated in the biotransformation of these compounds to their deleterious metabolites. A classical nitroreductase has been purified from Enterobacter cloacae 587-fold using a protocol which yields approximately 1 mg of purified nitroreductase from 10 liters of cell culture. An analysis of the physical properties of the nitroreductase indicates that the enzyme is active as a monomer with a calculated molecular mass of 27 kDa. FMN has been identified as a required flavin cofactor and is present at a stoichiometry of 0.88 mol of FMN bound/mol of active enzyme. The enzyme was found capable of reducing nitrofurazone under aerobic conditions indicating that the mechanism involves an obligatory two-electron transfer. Thus, this enzyme can be classified as an oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase. The purified nitroreductase can utilize either NADH or NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents and can reduce a variety of nitroaromatic compounds including nitrofurans and nitrobenzenes as well as quinones. Studies in which the rates of nitroreduction for a series of para substituted nitrobenzene derivatives were determined suggest that a linear free energy relationship exists between the rate and the redox midpoint potential of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1491721575,"Abstract By using a photoactivatable analog of 11-cis-retinal in rhodopsin, we have previously identified the amino acids Phe-115, Ala-117, Glu-122, Trp-126, Ser-127, and Trp-265 as major sites of cross-linking to the chromophore. To further investigate the amino acids that interact with retinal, we have now used site-directed mutagenesis to replace a variety of amino acids in the membrane-embedded helices in bovine rhodopsin, including those that were indicated by cross-linking studies. The mutant rhodopsin genes were expressed in monkey kidney cells (COS-1) and purified. The mutant proteins were studied for their spectroscopic properties and their ability to activate transducin. Substitution of the two amino acids, Trp-265 and Glu-122 by Tyr, Phe, and Ala and by Gln, Asp and Ala, respectively, resulted in blue-shifted (20-30 nm) chromophore, and substitution of Trp-265 by Ala resulted in marked reduction in the extent of chromophore regeneration. Light-dependent bleaching behavior was significantly altered in Ala-117----Phe, Trp-265----Phe, Ala, and Ala-292----Asp mutants. Transducin activation was reduced in these mutants, in particular Trp-265 mutants, as well as in Glu-122----Gln, Trp-126----Leu (Ala), Pro-267----Ala (Asn, Ser), and Tyr-268----Phe mutants. These findings indicate that Trp-265 is located close to retinal and Glu-122, Trp-126, and probably Tyr-268 are also likely to be near retinal."
https://openalex.org/W1551914341,"The cDNA and gene for mouse mast cell protease-6 (MMCP-6) have been sequenced and show MMCP-6 to be translated as a prepro-enzyme with a 21-amino acid hydrophobic leader peptide, a 10-amino acid activation peptide, and a 245-amino acid mature enzyme. The mature form of the enzyme has 73% amino acid sequence identity with human and dog mast cell tryptases. The MMCP-6 gene includes 6 exons, with a total span of 1.8 kilobases. A 208-base pair intron was defined which separates the 5'-untranslated sequence of MMCP-6 from the translation initiation codon, thereby presenting a gene organization which distinguishes tryptic serine proteases from chymotryptic serine proteases of the mast cell secretory granule. By RNA blot analysis with a gene-specific probe, MMCP-6 has a unique subclass distribution in being transcribed in mouse connective tissue mast cells but undetectable in mucosal mast cells. MMCP-6 is the first serine protease of any class to be shown to be significantly transcribed in progenitor, bone marrow-derived mast cells, which can reconstitute both mucosal mast cell and connective tissue mast cell populations in mast cell-deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2086737372,"We have tested the role of different charged residues flanking the sides of the signal/anchor (S/A) domain of a eukaryotic type II (N(cyt)C(exo)) integral membrane protein in determining its topology. The removal of positively charged residues on the N-terminal side of the S/A yields proteins with an inverted topology, while the addition of positively charged residues to only the C-terminal side has very little effect on orientation. Expression of chimeric proteins composed of domains from a type II protein (HN) and the oppositely oriented membrane protein M2 indicates that the HN N-terminal domain is sufficient to confer a type II topology and that the M2 N-terminal ectodomain can direct a type II topology when modified by adding positively charged residues. These data suggest that eukaryotic membrane protein topology is governed by the presence or absence of an N-terminal signal for retention in the cytoplasm that is composed in part of positive charges."
https://openalex.org/W1572145162,"Rat adipose cells treated with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin are permeable and retain their ability to respond to insulin after hormone treatment. The GLUT 4 glucose transporter isoform, specific to fat and muscle cells, is translocated normally from low density microsomes to the plasma membrane in permeabilized cells. Addition of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), guanylyl imidodiphosphate, or guanylyl beta, gamma-methylenediphosphate to permeabilized adipocytes induces an insulin-like translocation of GLUT 4 to the plasma membrane; GTP or adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate has no effect. No translocation of GLUT 4 is observed when GTP analogs are added to intact adipocytes. These results suggest the involvement of a GTP-binding protein in insulin-triggered recruitment of GLUT 4 to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2051727868,"FIVE small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are required for nuclear pre-messenger RNA splicing: Ul, U2, U4, U5 and U61,2. The yeast Ul and U2 snRNAs base-pair to the 5′ splice site and branch-point sequences of introns respectively1. The role of the U5 and U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) in splicing is not clear, though a catalytic role for the U6 snRNA has been proposed3. Less is known about yeast splicing factors, but the availability of genetic techniques in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has led to the identification of mutants deficient in nuclear pre-mRNA splicing (prp2-prp27)4,5. Several PRP genes have now been cloned and their protein products characterized. The PRP8 protein is a component of the US snRNP and associates with the U4/U6 snRNAs/snRNP to form a multi-snRNP particle believed to be important for spliceosome assembly6. We have isolated extragenic suppressors of the prp8–l mutation of S. cerevisiae and present here the preliminary characterization of one of these suppressors, spp81. The predicted amino-acid sequence of the SPP81protein shows extensive similarity to a recently identified family of proteins thought to possess ATP–dependent RNA helicase activity. The possible role of this putative helicase in nuclear pre-mRNA splicing is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1608379071,"Triacsins A, B, C, and D are new inhibitors of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.3) and possess different inhibitory potencies against the enzyme (Tomoda, H., Igarashi, K., and Omura, S. (1987) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 921, 595-598). Acyl-CoA synthetase activity in the membrane fraction of Raji cells was also inhibited by triacsins. The same hierarchy of inhibitory potency as that against the enzyme from other sources, triacsin C greater than triacsin A much greater than triacsin D greater than or equal to triacsin B, was observed. When Raji cells were cultivated in the presence of triacsins, cell proliferation was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion. The drug concentrations required for 50% inhibition of cell growth at day 2 were calculated to be 1.8 microM for triacsin A, much greater than 20 microM for triacsin B, 1.0 microM for triacsin C, and much greater than 15 microM for triacsin D, demonstrating a hierarchy for inhibitory potency of triacsins similar to that against the acyl-CoA synthetase activity. To understand the role of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase in animal cells, the effect of triacsins on the lipid metabolism of Raji cells was studied. When intact Raji cells were incubated with [14C]oleate in the presence of individual triacsins, the incorporation of [14C]oleate into each of the lipid fractions such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol was inhibited to an analogous extent. A common hierarchy, triacsin C greater than triacsin A much greater than triacsin D greater than triacsin B, was shown for the inhibition in each synthesis of the three lipids, which was identical with that for acyl-CoA synthetase. These findings indicate that the inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase is well correlated with the inhibition of lipid synthesis. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that the inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase by triacsins leads to the inhibition of lipid synthesis and eventually to the inhibition of proliferation of Raji cells."

The resulting oligosaccharides were fractionated by a combination of fast protein liquid chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The major acidic compounds are mono- and disialylated, fucosylated diantennary compounds terminated with alpha(2-6)-linked sialic acid on the Man alpha(1-3) branch. The Man alpha(1-6) branch shows a large heterogeneity. It can be terminated with Man-4', GlcNAc-5', or Gal-6', whereas the Gal-6' residue may be extended with Gal alpha(1-3), NeuAc alpha(2-3), or Sia alpha (2-6). In the major structures 8% of alpha(2-6)-linked sialic acid was found as NeuGc instead of NeuAc. The main compounds have sulfated homologues bearing a sulfate group (6-20%) at C-3 of Gal-6' or at C-6 of GlcNAc-5 as follows. [formula: see text]"
https://openalex.org/W1966633247,Picosecond phase-grating spectroscopy is highly sensitive to density changes and provides a new holographic approach to the study of protein dynamics. Photodissociation of carbon monoxide from heme proteins induces a well-defined transition from a ligated to a deoxy structure that is important to hemoglobin and myoglobin functionality. Grating spectroscopy was used to observe protein-driven density waves on a picosecond time scale after carbon monoxide dissociation. This result demonstrates that global tertiary structure changes of proteins occur on an extremely fast time scale and provides new insight into the biomechanics of deterministic protein motion.
https://openalex.org/W1543105845,"All prokaryotic and eukaryotic thioredoxins contain a conserved tryptophan residue, exposed at the active site disulfide/dithiol. The role of this W31 in Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx) was studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Four mutant Trx with W31Y, W31F, W31H, and W31A replacements were characterized. Very low tryptophan fluorescence emission from the remaining W28 was observed in all mutant Trx; reduction resulted in large, but variable increases (up to 11-fold) of fluorescence, to levels higher than in native or denatured wild-type Trx, demonstrating a previously postulated change involving W28. All W31 mutant Trx were good substrates for E. coli thioredoxin reductase. Compared with wild type, the apparent Km values were increased less than 2-fold for the W31A, W31H, and W31F Trx and the W31Y Trx showed even slightly higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km value). Functions of reduced Trx with ribonucleotide reductase and in reduction of insulin disulfides were more strongly influenced by the W31 replacements, in particular at low pH for A and H residues. T7 DNA polymerase activity generated by T7 gene 5 protein and reduced Trx was lowered by large factors for W31Y, W31A, or W31H compared with W31F or the wild-type protein. The in vivo function of Trx was studied by using pUC118-trxA expression in an E. coli trxA- background. The trxA genes with W31Y and W31F substitutions restored, fully and partly, the methionine sulfoxide utilization of a trxA-, metE- test strain; W31A and W31H mutations resulted in no growth. Propagation of M13 was moderately impeded by W31Y and W31F or severely by W31A and W31H replacements. Growth of a phage T3/7 hybrid was possible only with the W31Y and W31F substitutions reflecting the in vitro results for T7 DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1544138281,"Over 400 supposedly biochemically and genetically distinct variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) have been described in the past. In order to investigate these variants at the DNA sequence level we have now determined the relevant sequences of introns of G6PD and describe a method which allows us to rapidly determine the sequence of the entire coding region of G6PD. This technique was applied to six variants that cause G6PD deficiency to be functionally so severe as to result in nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Although the patients were all unrelated, G6PD Marion, Gastonia, and Minnesota each had identical mutations, a G→T at nucleotide (nt) 637 in exon 6 leading to a Val→Leu substitution at amino acid 213. The mutations of Nashville and Anaheim were identical to each other, viz. G→A at nt 1178 in exon 10 producing a Arg→His substitution at amino acid 393. G6PD Loma Linda had a C→A substitution at nt 1089 in exon 10, producing a Asn→Lys change at amino acid 363. The results confirm our earlier results suggesting that the NADP-binding site is in a small region of exon 10 and suggest the possibility that this area is also concerned with the binding of glucose-6-P."
https://openalex.org/W1543414397,"Fragments of 5'-flanking sequences of the human insulin receptor gene were analyzed in transient expression assays after transfection of cell lines with expression assays after transfection of cell lines with an improved low background chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase vector system pSVOOCAT (Araki, E., Shimada, F., Shichiri, M., Mori, M., and Ebina, Y. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 1627). Transfection of chimeric chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids containing various deletions and insertions of the promoter of HIR gene into CHO and COS cells indicated that the region between -629 and -1 (initiator ATG is +1) is sufficient for maximal promoter activity. The DNA element of the cluster of four G-C boxes (-593 to -618) enhanced the transcription, examined by the low background pSVOOCAT vector system in vivo. DNase I footprinting and gel retardation experiments using partially purified LacZ-Sp1 hybrid proteins showed that the transcription factor Sp1 can bind to the cluster of the four G-C boxes of the promoter. Thus, the efficient expression of the human insulin receptor gene possibly requires the binding of transcriptional factor Sp1 to four G-C boxes located -593 to -618 base pairs upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon."

https://openalex.org/W98330716,"The biological recognition of trigonal pyramids has been studied in a statistical analysis of the Cambridge Structural Data Base. The preferential stereochemistry of pyramidal anion-Lewis acid interactions is easily described for the phosphonyl dianion (R-PO3(2-), as found in the phosphate group) and the sulfonyl monoanion (R-SO3-, as found in the sulfate group) by trans/gauche conformational terminology. Interactions between these pyramidal anions and metals generally prefer gauche geometry (as defined by the R-X = O-Mn+ torsion angle, X = P or S). Interactions between phosphonyls and hydrogen bond donors likewise display a preference for gauche orientation. Interactions between sulfonyls and hydrogen bond donors exhibit a preference for gauche stereochemistry and also cluster in eclipsed regions. These hydrogen bond motifs provide a greater understanding of the function of pyramidal anions in biological structure and function. For example, interactions of the sulfate monoanion are important for the binding of heparin, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, to antithrombin III."
https://openalex.org/W1586547644,"The classical nitroreductases of enteric bacteria are flavoproteins which catalyze the reduction of a variety of nitroaromatic compounds to metabolites which are highly toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic. The gene for the nitroreductase Enterobacter cloacae has now been cloned using an antibody specific to this protein. The nucleotide sequence of the structural gene and flanking regions are reported. Sequence analysis indicates that this gene belongs to a gene family of flavoproteins which have not been previously described. Analysis of the 5'-untranslated region reveals the presence of putative regulatory elements which may be involved in the modulation of the expression of this enzyme. The cloned gene was placed under the control of a T7 promoter for overexpression of the protein in Escherichia coli. The expressed recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity and exhibited physical, spectral, and catalytic properties identical to the protein isolated from E. cloacae."
https://openalex.org/W1604181713,"Abstract Three independently isolated clathrin-associated proteins have been reported that have molecular weights of approximately 155,000-185,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: the 155K protein (Keen, J. H., and Black, M. M. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 1325-1333), AP 180 (Ahle, S., and Ungewickell, E. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 3143-3149), and NP185 (Kohtz, D. S., and Puszkin, S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7418-7425). Using two-dimensional isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and one- and two-dimensional immunoblots with two different monoclonal antibodies, we show that these three proteins are identical. The term AP-3 is used to denote this protein. A preliminary analysis of the domain structure of AP-3 was done by controlled proteolysis. Trypsin treatment of AP-3 yields two distinct classes of products. The larger fragments obtained (100,000-135,000 apparent Mr) are acidic and behave anomalously on gel electrophoresis, yielding aberrantly high Mr and exhibiting poor dye binding; these characteristics are shared with intact AP-3. Trypsin also generates a smaller neutral species of approximately 30,000 Da which migrates appropriately on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, binds dye comparatively strongly, and behaves as a monomeric globular species in solution. In addition, this species, which is also released by a variety of other proteases, binds specifically and reversibly to clathrin-Sepharose, identifying it as a clathrin recognition domain."
https://openalex.org/W1524447588,"Derivation of the bamhIR sequence (Brooks, J. E., Nathan, P.D., Landry, D., Sznyter, L.A., Waite-Rees, P., Ives, C. C., Mazzola, L. M., Slatko, B. E., and Benner, J. S. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res., in press), the gene coding for BamHI endonuclease, has facilitated construction of an Escherichia coli strain that overproduces BamHI endonuclease (W. E. Jack, L. Greenough, L. F. Dorner, S. Y. Xu, T. Strezelecka, A. K. Aggarwal, and I. Schildkraut, submitted for publication). As expected, low-level constitutive expression of the bamhIR gene in E. coli from the Ptac promotor construct is lethal to the host unless the bamHIM gene, which encodes the BamHI methylase, is also expressed within the cell. We identified four classes of BamHI endonuclease variants deficient in catalysis by selecting for survival of a host deficient for bamHIM gene, transformed with mutagenized copies of the bamhIR gene, and then screening the surviving cell extracts for DNA cleavage and binding activities. Class I variants (G56S, G91S/T153I, T114I, G130R, E135K, T153I, T157I, G194D) displayed 0.1-1% of the wild-type cleavage activity; class II variant (D94N) lacked cleavage activity but retained wild-type DNA binding specificity; class III variants (E77K, E113K) lacked cleavage activity but bound DNA more tightly; class IV variants (G56D, G90D, G91S, R122H, R155H) lacked both binding and cleavage activities. Variants with residual cleavage activities induced the E. coli SOS response and thus are presumed to cleave chromosomal DNA in vivo. We conclude that Glu77, Asp94, and Glu113 residues are essential for BamHI catalytic function."
https://openalex.org/W1555451001,"The allele scd 1 is a recessive chromosomal mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that eliminates Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) activity. SOD-1- strains are unable to grow in 100% O2 in rich medium and are methionine and lysine auxotrophic when grown in air (Bilinski, T., Krawiec, Z., Liczmanski, A., and Litwinska, J. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130, 533-539). In this report, scd1 was genetically mapped to the right arm of chromosome X, 11 centimorgans proximal to cdc11. The gene for SOD-1 (SOD1) was physically mapped by Southern blot to restriction fragments containing CDC11. scd1 failed to complement a complete deletion of SOD1. Thus, scd1 maps to the SOD1 locus and is designated sod1-1. The molecular basis for the lack of SOD-1 activity in sodl-1 carrying strains has also been established. The size and amount of SOD-1 mRNA in the mutant were essentially the same as in wild type cells. Western blot analysis showed that the SOD-1 dimer and 16-kilodalton subunit that co-migrated electrophoretically with wild type yeast SOD-1 were abundant in mutant cell extracts. However, two additional SOD-1 immunoreactive polypeptides were detected in these extracts in both denaturing and nondenaturing gels. None of the SOD-1 immunoreactive species in the mutant extracts exhibited superoxide dismutase activity. Transformants of the mutant strain carrying episomal, wild type SOD1 expressed wild type, active SOD-1 protein, indicating that the mutant allele had no discernible effect on the correct synthesis and activation of apoSOD-1. Size exclusion chromatography of soluble cell extracts derived from wild type and SOD1 deletion strains identified a copper binding peak that corresponded to SOD-1. This copper-binding fraction was absent in cell extracts from the sod1-1-containing strain although Western blot analysis of the corresponding chromatographic fractions showed that SOD-1 polypeptide was present in these fractions. Sequence data derived from the cloned genes showed that sod1-1 differed from SOD1 only in the adjacent 5'-noncoding region. The biochemical data indicate that this genetic alteration results in the synthesis of a collection of SOD-1 polypeptides that fail to bind copper and may also fail to completely self-associate. Both phenotypes could be due to the inability of these polypeptides to adopt the native SOD-1 conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1577848798,"Osteoblasts express high levels of liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase (LBK AP), an enzyme critical for bone formation. Other tissues and cell types generally express much lower levels of LBK AP and correspondingly lower levels of mRNA. In light of our early observations that the human LBK AP promoter is expressed equally when transfected into a variety of different cells, we have carried out a detailed study of LBK AP gene expression in Saos-2 cells which are osteoblast-derived and express high levels of LBK AP mRNA, and in HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells which express LBK AP mRNA at levels which are approximately 1000-fold lower. Our results indicate that both of these cells utilize the same promoter sequences to initiate transcription of their LBK AP genes at roughly the same rates. Moreover, the stability of cytoplasmic LBK AP mRNA is equal in both cell types. The lack of any apparent buildup of unspliced precursor mRNA in the nucleus of HepG2 cells leads us to the conclusion that splicing (and nuclear export) is equivalent. It is therefore likely that differential expression is controlled at a very early step post-transcription, possibly by sequences that destabilize the nascent RNA in HepG2 cells. We reason that these destabilizing sequences are located in the gene's introns because a transfected LBK AP minigene, comprised of the full length cDNA and flanking sequences, is expressed efficiently in both cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1543085308,"The structure-function relationship of the oligomeric unactivated glucocorticoid receptor is not fully understood. An essential step in the process of understanding such a relationship involves the production of large quantities of the receptor. Using a baculovirus expression system we have been able to overproduce a recombinant rat glucocorticoid receptor (rGR). A cDNA coding for the entire rGR was introduced into the genome of the wild type baculovirus, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, by an in vivo recombination event. Based on specific steroid binding, insect cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus expressed 1-3 x 10(6) receptor molecules/cell which is 15-45 times more than that expressed normally in a hepatocyte. The recombinant rGR expressed in insect cells is indistinguishable from the bona fide rGR with respect to immunogenic reactivity, cytoplasmic localization, sedimentation, chromatographic and electrophoretic mobility, and hormone and DNA binding. Furthermore, the recombinant rGR is expressed as a functional protein as demonstrated by its ability to specifically bind a glucocorticoid agonist, to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon hormone-binding, and to act as a transcriptional enhancer. Pulse labeling of recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells with 32Pi and isolation of the labeled products by immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the recombinant rGR is a phosphoprotein. Thus, the recombinant rGR expressed in insect cells is biologically active and is suitable for structural and functional analysis. A simple three-step purification procedure of the unactivated recombinant rGR is described."
https://openalex.org/W1540649785,"We have examined the expression of cytochrome P-450IA1 (CypIa1) in cultured rat arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC). We report here that newborn (pup) aortic and adult carotid neointimal SMC express 10-20-fold higher steady-state levels of CypIa1 mRNA compared with identically treated SMC derived from adult aorta or uninjured carotid media, respectively. Nuclear transcription experiments suggest that the difference in basal expression of CypIa1 reflects differences in transcription rates of the gene in these two cell types. Treatment of adult aortic SMC with cycloheximide dramatically elevated CypIa1 mRNA levels and had little effect on the amount of this mRNA in pup SMC. That the cycloheximide effect in adult SMC was due to enhanced transcription of the CypIa1 gene was demonstrated by 1) the ability of actinomycin D to completely block the cycloheximide-induced increase in steady-state mRNA levels, and 2) the increased transcription rate of the CypIa1 gene in cycloheximide-treated adult nuclei determined via nuclear transcription assays. Treatment of either cell type with beta-napthoflavone increased CypIa1 mRNA levels to a similar extent, suggesting that the differential response to cycloheximide was specific and not a general lack of pup SMC to respond to transcriptional inducers of the CypIa1 gene. Our data suggest that a labile repressor of the CypIa1 gene is present in cultured adult aortic SMC and is absent, inactive, or at a greatly reduced level in cultured pup SMC."
https://openalex.org/W1567120519,"Calpastatin is an endogenous inhibitor protein acting specifically on calpain (EC 3.4.22.17; Ca2(+)-dependent cysteine proteinase). The phosphorylation of calpastatin was investigated in human hematopoietic system cell lines. Microheterogeneity of calpastatin was observed, in which 118- and 116-kDa forms were named calpastatin a and b, respectively. The phosphorylation of both calpastatins was identified in all cell lines examined and occurred mainly at serine residues with trace amounts of phosphothreonine in vivo. The incubation of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate increased the incorporation of 32P-orthophosphate into calpastatin a. Two-dimensional maps of 32P-labeled phosphopeptide from both calpastatins were identical except for additional minor spots for calpastatin a. [35S]methionine-labeled calpastatins a and b were localized mainly in the cytosol, and only 6% of cellular calpastatins were detected in the membrane fraction. By contrast, more than 30% of the 32P-labeled calpastatins a and b were distributed in the membrane fraction. Thus, the phosphorylation of calpastatin may be involved in regulating the calpain-calpastatin protein kinase system by its subcellular distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1500994217,"A cDNA coding for the human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6-R) has been expressed stably in murine NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Transfected cells exhibited a single class of binding sites for 125I-labeled recombinant human interleukin-6 (125I-rhIL-6) (Kd = 440 pM, 20,000 receptors per cell). Affinity cross-linking of 125I-rhIL-6 to the IL-6-R-expressing NIH/3T3 cells led to the detection of three 125I-rhIL-6-containing protein complexes with molecular masses of 100, 120, and 200 kDa suggesting a complex organization of the IL-6-R in the plasma membrane. IL-6 added to the transfected NIH/3T3 cells exerted growth inhibition. This anti-growth effect was observed by the measurement of cell numbers and ornithine decarboxylase mRNA expression. IL-6-R overexpressing fibroblasts internalized 125I-rhIL-6. Intracellular limited proteolysis of IL-6 could be demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A possible implication of skin fibroblasts in the catabolism of IL-6 is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1586799661,"Phospholipases A2 (PLA-2) are conserved enzymes that can vary widely in their activity toward certain biological targets. Activity of PLA-2 toward Escherichia coli treated with the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) of granulocytes has been detected only in PLA-2 (lacking Cys11-Cys77) and correlates with overall basicity and the presence of a cluster of basic amino acids within a variable surface region near the NH2 terminus (including residues 6, 7, 10, 11, and 15). We now show that of five pancreatic PLA-2 (Group I enzymes) tested from different species of mammals, the human enzyme that is most basic both globally (pI 8.7) and locally (Arg-6, Lys-7, and Lys-10) is active toward BPI-treated E. coli (approximately 1-2% activity of the most active Group II PLA-2) whereas the other four PLA-2 are essentially inactive (less than 0.1%). The cDNA of the pig pancreatic PLA-2 (pI 6.4; Arg-6, Ser-7, Lys-10) has been modified by site-specific mutagenesis and the wild-type and mutant PLA-2 have been expressed in and purified from either E. coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine more precisely the structural determinants of PLA-2 activity toward BPI-treated E. coli. The single substitution of lysine (or arginine) for Ser-7 transformed the pig pancreatic PLA-2 into an active enzyme toward BPI-treated E. coli possessing 25-50% the activity of the human PLA-2. Additional modifications to increase global basicity (increase in net charge up to +4) caused a further (up to 2-fold) increase in activity. All mutant PLA-2 still containing Ser-7 possessed little or no activity toward BPI-treated E. coli. Changes in activity toward BPI-treated E. coli were accompanied by parallel changes in enzyme binding to this target. In contrast, substitution of lysine (or arginine) for Ser-7 caused little or no alteration of enzyme activity toward either autoclaved E. coli or egg yolk lipoproteins indicating no major effects on the catalytic properties of the PLA-2. This study demonstrates directly the role of NH2-terminal basic residues in the action of PLA-2 on BPI-treated E. coli and suggests that these properties mainly facilitate PLA-2 binding to this biological target."
https://openalex.org/W2107336582,"Methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. Two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. Subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. The rectangular views can be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. It is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. The estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. The enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Escherichia coli, which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. In view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1) by using the name NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1561257145,"Trafficking and sorting of lipids during transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus was studied using a cell-free system from rat liver. Transitional elements of the endoplasmic reticulum were prepared from liver slices prelabeled with [14C]- or [3H]acetate as the donor fraction. Non-radioactive Golgi apparatus were immobilized on nitrocellulose as the acceptor. When reconstituted, the radiolabeled donor retained a capacity to transfer labeled lipids to the non-radioactive Golgi apparatus acceptor. Transfer exhibited two kinetically different components. One was stimulated by ATP, facilitated by cytosol and inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) and N-ethylmaleimide. In parallel with protein transport, the ATP-dependent lipid transfer occurred with a temperature transition at about 20 degrees C. The other was not stimulated by ATP, did not require cytosol, was acceptor unspecific, was unaffected by inhibitors and, while temperature dependent, did not exhibit a sharp temperature transition. The ATP-independent transfer was non-vesicular. In contrast, the ATP-dependent transfer was vesicular. Transition vesicles isolated by preparative free-flow electrophoresis, when used as the donor fraction, transferred lipids to Golgi apparatus acceptor with a 5-6-fold greater efficiency than that exhibited by the unfractionated transitional endoplasmic reticulum. Formation of transition vesicles was ATP-dependent. Transferred lipids were chiefly phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Membrane triglycerides, major constituents of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum membranes, were both depleted in the transition vesicle-enriched fractions and not transferred to Golgi apparatus suggestive of lipid sorting prior to or during transition vesicle formation. The characteristics of the ATP plus cytosol-dependent transfer were similar to those for protein transfer mediated by transition vesicles. Thus, the 50-70-nm vesicles derived from transitional endoplasmic reticulum appear to function in the trafficking of both newly synthesized proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W202822998,"The sugar specificity mutants of the lactose permease containing Val177 or Val177/Asn319 were analyzed with regard to their ability to couple H+ and sugar co-transport. Both mutants were able to transport lactose downhill to a significant degree. The Val177 mutant was partially defective in the active accumulation of galactosides, whereas the Val177/Asn319 mutant was completely defective in the uphill accumulation of sugars. With regard to coupling, the Val177 mutant was shown to catalyze the uncoupled transport of H+ to a substantial degree. This led to a decrease in the H+ electrochemical gradient under aerobic conditions and also resulted in faster H+ uptake when a transient H+ electrochemical gradient was generated under anaerobic conditions. Interestingly, galactosides were shown to diminish the rate of uncoupled H+ transport in the Val177 strain. The Val177/Asn319 strain also catalyzed uncoupled H+ transport, but to a lesser degree than the single Val177 mutant. In addition, the Val177/Asn319 mutant was shown to transport galactosides with or without H+. The observed H+/lactose stoichiometry was 0.30 in the double mutant compared to 0.98 in the wild-type strain. When an H+ electrochemical gradient was generated across the membrane, the Val177/Asn319 mutant permease was shown to facilitate an extremely rapid net H+ leak if nonmetabolizable galactosides had been equilibrated across the membrane. The mechanism of this leak is consistent with a circular pathway involving H+/galactoside influx and uncoupled galactoside efflux. The magnitude of the H+ leak in the presence of nonmetabolizable galactosides was so great in the double mutant that low concentrations of certain galactosides (i.e. 0.5 mM thiodigalactoside) resulted in a complete inhibition of growth. These results are discussed with regard to the possibility that cation and sugar binding to the lactose permease may involve a direct physical coupling at a common recognition site."
https://openalex.org/W1603566729,"Abstract CMP-sialic acid:lactosylceramide alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase (SAT-1) has been purified approximately 40,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from rat liver Golgi. The enzyme was solubilized from Golgi vesicles in 5% lauryldimethylamine oxide and partially purified by affinity chromatography twice on CMP-hexanolamine and once on lactosylceramide aldehyde-Sepharose 4B. Final purification was achieved by immunoaffinity chromatography on M12GC7-Gel 10. The M12GC7 monoclonal antibody specifically inhibits and immunoprecipitates SAT-1 activity. Identification of the protein, with an apparent molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of about 60,000 daltons, was confirmed by Western blot and immunodetection with M12GC7. SAT-1 specifically catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc, sialic acid) to lactosylceramide (Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-O-ceramide), forming GM3 ganglioside. Studies on substrate specificity indicate that the preferred acceptors have the general structure saccharide beta 1-O-ceramide, a disaccharide being preferred to a monosaccharide. SAT-1 is a glycoprotein. The carbohydrate moieties are detected with specific lectins. Deglycosylation of SAT-1 with N-glycanase results in an increase in a 43,000-dalton band. The two-dimensional electrophoretogram of SAT-1 indicates a pI range of 5.7-6.2 for the 60,000-dalton protein."
https://openalex.org/W1590651349,"The mechanism(s) by which rRNA accumulates during the growth of cardiac myocytes was investigated. The rates of rDNA transcription were measured in contracting myocytes and compared with nonbeating myocytes depolarized with 50 mM KCl. After 3 days of contraction the absolute rate of rDNA transcription was accelerated by 2-fold as measured by incorporation of [3H]UTP into the external transcribed spacer of preribosomal RNA. Corresponding increases in transcription were observed in isolated nuclei of contracting myocytes as measured by either hybridization of run-on transcripts of preribosomal RNA or activity of RNA polymerase I. The extent to which transcription was stimulated in contracting myocytes accounted for the previously observed acceleration of rRNA synthesis rates. The steady-state levels of preribosomal RNA relative to rRNA were unchanged in contracting myocytes, but the total amount of preribosomal RNA was 1.3-fold greater as a result of increased rRNA content. The increase of preribosomal RNA in proportion to rRNA in contracting myocytes demonstrated that the rate of preribosomal RNA processing was unchanged and that rRNA synthesis is regulated by an accelerated rate of rDNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1972551845,"A high-resolution fluorescence methodology for nonisotopic in situ hybridization was applied to determine the positions occupied by several single-copy genes, DNA sequences, and integrated viral genomes on sister chromatids. The lateral and longitudinal mapping of the probes was performed on prometaphase and metaphase chromosomes. A fixed lateral position, exterior or median in relation to the longitudinal axis of the chromatids, was observed for a given probe, with a symmetrical position of the double fluorescent spots. This position appears to be independent of chromosome condensation stage from prometaphase to metaphase. These observations suggest an opposite helical-handedness conformation of DNA on both chromatids with a mirror symmetry. They support the model of chromosome packaging recently proposed by Boy de la Tour and Laemmli. Moreover, our results indicate that the last stages of chromosome condensation occur by packing down the coils without further coiling."
https://openalex.org/W1495758200,"All thermotolerant methanol-utilizing Bacillus spp. investigated by us possess a NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) activity which is stimulated by a protein present in the soluble fraction of Bacillus sp. C1 cells. This activator protein was purified to homogeneity from Bacillus sp. C1 cells grown at a low dilution rate in a methanol-limited chemostat culture. The native activator protein (Mr = 50,000) is a dimer of Mr = 27,000 subunits. The N-terminal amino acid sequence revealed no significant similarity with any published sequences. Stimulation of MDH activity by the activator protein required the presence of Mg2+ ions. Plots of specific MDH activity versus activator protein concentration revealed Michaelis-Menten type kinetics. In the presence of activator protein, MDH displayed biphasic kinetics (v versus substrate concentration) toward C1-C4 primary alcohols and NAD. The data suggest that in the presence of activator protein plus Mg2+ ions, MDH possesses a high affinity active site for alcohols and NAD, in addition to an activator- and Mg2(+)-independent low affinity active site. The activation mechanism remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1637928941,"When low density lipoprotein (LDL) is incubated with granules isolated from rat serosal mast cells, a fraction of LDL is bound to the granule heparin proteoglycan. If incubation is continued at 37 degrees C, the bound LDL, but not the unbound LDL, is degraded by granule neutral proteases. In the early stage of incubation, all the granule-bound LDL can be released by 0.3 M NaCl (the fraction of LDL). With time, an increasing proportion of the granule-bound LDL requires 0.5 M NaCl for release (the fraction of LDL). Chemical analysis showed that, on average, 20% of the apolipoprotein B LDL was lost from the salt-sensitive fraction and 60% from the salt-resistant fraction, without any change in the composition of the lipid portion. Electron microscopic analysis disclosed large fused particles of LDL (diameters up to 100 nm) in the highly proteolyzed salt-resistant fraction, but no fused particles could be found in the less proteolyzed salt-sensitive fraction. We conclude that both binding and extensive degradation of LDL by mast cell granules is required for fusion of LDL particles on the granule surface. As compared with native LDL, the mast cell granule-modified LDL particles exhibit (i) increased particle size, (ii) selective loss of protein (apoB), (iii) a decrease in hydrated density, and (iv) stronger ionic interaction between apoB and heparin proteoglycan. The particles resemble the extracellular lipid droplets found in atherosclerotic lesions of both man and animals. Modification of LDL by mast cells may therefore provide a model of how these lipid structures are formed."
https://openalex.org/W1511991577,"A latent phospholipase A is concentrated in cis elements of rat liver Golgi apparatus, the presumed sites of fusion of the 50-70-nm transition vesicles formed from endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, conversion of transferred phospholipids to their corresponding lysoforms may provide an index of post transfer lipid processing in a corresponding reconstituted membrane transfer system. To label the phosphatidylcholine of transitional endoplasmic reticulum in vitro, [14C]CDP-choline and endogenous cytidyltransferases were used. In the reconstituted transfer system, the radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine was transferred via transition vesicles to Golgi apparatus immobilized on nitrocellulose strips in a time- and temperature-dependent process. Transfer was promoted by ATP and the ATP-dependent transfer was specific for cis Golgi apparatus elements as acceptor. Trans Golgi apparatus elements were ineffective as acceptors. Median Golgi apparatus elements were intermediate. A portion of the transferred phosphatidylcholine was converted subsequently to lysophosphatidylcholine also in a time- and ATP-dependent manner. The phospholipase A activity of the Golgi apparatus was more than 90% latent (active site located on the lumens of the Golgi apparatus membranes). Therefore, the lipid-containing vesicles derived from endoplasmic reticulum must have combined with cis Golgi apparatus membranes as the basis for Golgi apparatus-dependent phospholipase A processing of endoplasmic reticulum-derived phosphatidylcholine. Since the lipids were processed by phospholipase A in approximately the same proportion as occurs in situ, the findings offer evidence both for the specificity of the ATP-dependent component of cell-free lipid transfer from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus and its fidelity to lipid transfer observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2100160042,"Antithrombin III (ATIII) is a plasma-borne serine protease inhibitor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hemostasis. The cDNA for ATIII has been available, but genetic studies on the functional domains of ATIII have not progressed because of the absence of an expression system that will yield sufficient quantities of biologically active protein for biochemical analyses. In the present studies the cDNA of the human antithrombin III gene was inserted into the vector pVL 1393, which is suitable for cotransfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with Baculovirus wild-type DNA. Recombinant virus particles were selected by the presence of occlusion-negative plaques. Upon infection with purified recombinant virus, Sf9 cells secreted 10-35 micrograms of ATIII/1 x 10(6) cells. Southern analysis of DNA from infected cells demonstrated incorporation of the full-length cDNA into the Baculovirus recombinant, and RNase protection experiments verified the presence of full-length transcript. This recombinant ATIII protein was immunologically reactive with antisera raised against native human ATIII, formed stable complexes with thrombin, and was heparin-accelerated at the same concentration as native human ATIII. In addition, the recombinant ATIII retained specificity for the same molecular species of heparin that activates authentic human ATIII. This is the first successful production of active, recombinant ATIII in quantities that will allow purification on the milligram scale and permit a biochemical analysis of genetically engineered variants."
https://openalex.org/W2423368745,"In porcine cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, a dimeric enzyme, the amino-terminal region anchoring onto the neighboring subunit is linked to the adjoining floppy peptide segment (residues 12-47), an integral part of the small domain whose facile movement upon substrate binding is a striking induced fit feature of this enzyme. To assess the contribution by the amino-terminal region to small domain movement and protein stability, a series of enzyme derivatives truncated on the amino-terminal side (residues 1-9) was prepared by using oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis. Deletion of residues 1-3 showed no effect on catalytic activity and heat stability. Del 1-5 mutant enzyme with an extra methionine at position 5 showed only 43% of the kappa cat value (in the overall transamination) of the wild-type enzyme. Further deletion up to residue 9 resulted in a slight decrease in kappa cat values. Del 1-9 mutant enzyme still retained a kappa cat value of 33% that of wild-type enzyme. Km values for aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate increased sharply upon deletion of residues 1-9. Accordingly, Del 1-9 mutant enzyme showed a striking decrease in the kappa cat/Km value, to only 2% of that for the wild-type enzyme. Deletion of amino-terminal residues 1-9 resulted also in a large decrease in thermostability and in an enhanced susceptibility to limited proteolysis by protease 401, which is known to cleave at Leu20 of the wild-type enzyme. These findings indicate that an increase in the conformational freedom of the floppy segment (residues 12-47) would occur upon the loss of most of the anchorage region, thereby presenting an entropic barrier to conformational changes that facilitate substrate binding with high affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1606829881,"Incubation of prothrombin on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells with factor Xa and calcium ions induced the activation of prothrombin. The mechanism of prothrombin activation was analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels using immuno- and amido-blotting techniques. It was demonstrated that meizothrombin was formed as an intermediate in prothrombin activation on the endothelial cell surface. In addition, considerable amounts of meizothrombin des-fragment-1 accumulated during prothrombin activation and were not further converted to thrombin. Although preincubation of the endothelial cells with thrombin did not influence the formation of meizothrombin, addition of hirudin to the prothrombin activation mixture inhibited the formation of meizothrombin and meizothrombin des-fragment-1 almost completely. This indicated that the activity of endogenously formed thrombin influenced the formation of meizothrombin via a feedback mechanism. The increased formation of meizothrombin and accumulation of meizothrombin des-fragment-1 in a latter phase of prothrombin activation points to a regulatory mechanism in hemostasis which subdues the formation of the procoagulant alpha-thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1600052748,"The behavior of phosphatidylcholine monolayers at the air/water interface was studied by measuring their surface isotherm, surface potential, surface viscosity, and rate of hydrolysis by the dimeric phospholipase A2 from the venom of Crotalus atrox. The monolayers showed typical liquid-expanded behavior. In this phase, the surface potential was linearly dependent on surface concentration and extrapolated at zero concentration to a value characteristic of a liquid hydrocarbon/water interface. The rate of the reaction was measured by monitoring changes in area at constant surface pressure for 1,2-dioctanoyl- and 1,2-didecanoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholines, and by monitoring changes in surface potential for 1,2-dimyristoyl-, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-, and 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines. The enzymatic hydrolysis is first order with respect to the enzyme-calcium complex which forms with a Kd = 1.5 mM. A mechanism is proposed to account for the dependency of the reaction rates on the surface concentration of the substrate. We postulate that the rate-limiting step is the decomposition of a quaternary complex formed from two phospholipid molecules, one calcium ion and one dimeric enzyme. The rate is independent of the surface pressure per se; addition of inert lipids to a monolayer at constant area, and hence constant surface concentration of the substrate, increases the surface pressure without changing the surface density of the substrate yielding maximal enzymatic rate. The enzyme is specific for loosely packed substrate molecules in the liquid-expanded state: transition into the liquid-condensed state or compression of the liquid-expanded layer beyond 80 A2/phospholipid strongly inhibits the enzymatic reaction. Our results show that surface recognition is a direct consequence of a bifunctional active site since it is only at a phospholipid surface that the distance between two substrate molecules is optimal for forming a catalytically competent enzyme-Ca2+-(substrate)2 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1602057447,"Abstract The double mutant of the lactose permease containing Val177/Asn319 exhibits proton leakiness by two pathways (see Brooker, R. J. (1991) J. Biol Chem. 266, 4131-4138). One type of H+ leakiness involves the uncoupled influx of H+ (leak A pathway) while a second type involves the coupled influx of H+ and galactosides in conjunction with uncoupled galactoside efflux (leak B pathway). In the current study, 14 independent lactose permease mutants were isolated from the Val177/Asn319 parent which were resistant to thiodigalactoside growth inhibition but retained the ability to transport maltose. All of these mutants contained a third mutation (besides Val177/Asn319) at one of two sites. Eight of the mutants had Ile303 changed to Phe, while six of the mutants had Tyr236 changed to Asn or His. Each type of triple mutant was characterized with regard to sugar transport, H+ leakiness, and sugar specificity. Like the parental strain, all three types of triple mutant showed moderate rates of downhill lactose transport and were defective in the uphill accumulation of sugars. However, with regard to proton leakiness, the triple mutants fell into two distinct categories. The mutant containing Phe303 was generally less H+ leaky than the parent either via the leak A or leak B pathway. In contrast, the triple mutants containing position 236 substitutions (Asn or His) were actually more H+ leaky via the leak A pathway and exhibited similar H+ leakiness via the leak B pathway at high thiodigalactoside concentrations. The ability of the position 236 mutants to grow better than the parent in the presence of low concentrations of thiodigalactoside appears to be due to a decrease in affinity for this particular sugar rather than a generalized defect in H+ leakiness. Finally, the triple mutants showed a sugar specificity profile which was different from either the Val177/Asn319 parent, the single Val177 mutant, or the wild-type strain. These results are discussed with regard to the effects of mutations on both the sugar and H+ transport pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1525891292,"Activin A, a protein homologous to transforming growth factor beta, was shown to induce hemoglobin synthesis in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and was also termed erythroid differentiation factor (EDF) (Eto, Y., Tsuji, T., Takezawa, M., Takano, S., Yokogawa, Y., and Shibai, H. (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 142, 1095-1103). We found that activin A/EDF also induced thromboxane (TX) A2 synthetic activity in these cells. Synthesis of TXA2 from arachidonic acid is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase and TX synthase. Activin A/EDF induced the latter TX synthase activity, whereas the cyclooxygenase activity was constitutively expressed. The induction of this enzyme activity was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that activin A/EDF induced de novo protein synthesis of TX synthase. Furthermore, we studied the relationship between the induction of TXA2 synthetic activity and erythroid differentiation in MEL cells, since the former is not an erythroid phenotype. We found 1) that the two responses to activin A/EDF were distinctly affected by the initial cell density; 2) that the dose-response curves for activin A/EDF were similar (ED50 = approximately 100 pM), whereas the time course of induction of TXA2 synthetic activity was much faster; and 3) that other erythroid differentiation inducers of MEL cells, namely dimethyl sulfoxide and hexamethylene bisacetamide, had little or no effect on TXA2 synthesis. These results indicate that activin A/EDF induces TXA2 synthetic activity independently of erythroid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1537252349,"We have reported earlier the isolation of two recessive, serum- and anchorage-dependent revertants from an NIH 3T3 line which had been transformed with multiple copies of a c-H-ras oncogene. In both revertants the oncogene was fully expressed and fusion of either revertant with normal (untransformed) cells or of the two revertants with one another resulted in transformed progeny. These, and other data indicate that the transforming activity of the c-H-ras oncogene is impaired in the two revertants, in consequence of defects in distinct genes needed to mediate this activity. Here, we describe some of the biochemical features of the revertants. In both of these (as in the transformed line) the bulk of the ras-p21 protein was found in the membrane fraction. This suggests proper posttranslational processing. Furthermore, no difference was detected either in the ras-p21 protein GTPase stimulating activity of GAP or in the extent of GAP-tyrosine phosphorylation among growing cultures of the two revertants, the transformed line and the parental NIH 3T3 line. The level of glucose transporter mRNA was severalfold higher in the transformed line than in the NIH 3T3 line. In the two revertants, however, the level was as low as that in the NIH 3T3 line. This indicates that the reversion impaired the effect of the c-H-ras oncogene on transcription. The raf oncogene (proposed to increase transcription factor activity) could retransform both revertants. Moreover, as revealed in experiments with growing cultures, neither transformation by the c-H-ras oncogene nor reversion from the transformed state altered the electrophoretic mobility of the raf protein or the level of its actin kinase activity. These results suggest that transformation by the c-H-ras oncogene is not mediated by the activation of raf protein kinase. The tyrosine phosphorylation of the p34cdc2 protein kinase (a cell cycle regulatory enzyme) was severalfold higher in the transformed line than in the NIH 3T3 line. The level of p34cdc2 protein kinase phosphorylation was as high in the R260 revertant as in the transformed line and as low in the R116 revertant as in the NIH 3T3 line. We are attempting to identify the defective mediator genes impairing the transforming activity of the c-H-ras oncogene in the two revertants."
