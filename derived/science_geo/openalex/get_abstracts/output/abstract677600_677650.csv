https://openalex.org/W3186179742,"DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research."
https://openalex.org/W3184893336,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern1–10 and the recurrent spillovers of coronaviruses11,12 into the human population highlight the need for broadly neutralizing antibodies that are not affected by the ongoing antigenic drift and that can prevent or treat future zoonotic infections. Here we describe a human monoclonal antibody designated S2X259, which recognizes a highly conserved cryptic epitope of the receptor-binding domain and cross-reacts with spikes from all clades of sarbecovirus. S2X259 broadly neutralizes spike-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.427/B.1.429), as well as a wide spectrum of human and potentially zoonotic sarbecoviruses through inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding to the receptor-binding domain. Furthermore, deep-mutational scanning and in vitro escape selection experiments demonstrate that S2X259 possesses an escape profile that is limited to a single substitution, G504D. We show that prophylactic and therapeutic administration of S2X259 protects Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) against challenge with the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant of concern, which suggests that this monoclonal antibody is a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of emergent variants and zoonotic infections. Our data reveal a key antigenic site that is targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies and will guide the design of vaccines that are effective against all sarbecoviruses. The human monoclonal antibody S2X259 cross-reacts with spike proteins from all clades of sarbecovirus, and provides prophylactic and therapeutic protection in vivo against parental SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern."

https://openalex.org/W3186269282,"Serum antibodies can recognize both pathogens and commensal gut microbiota. However, our current understanding of antibody repertoires is largely based on DNA sequencing of the corresponding B-cell receptor genes, and actual bacterial antigen targets remain incompletely characterized. Here we have profiled the serum antibody responses of 997 healthy individuals against 244,000 rationally selected peptide antigens derived from gut microbiota and pathogenic and probiotic bacteria. Leveraging phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq) based on phage-displayed synthetic oligo libraries, we detect a wide breadth of individual-specific as well as shared antibody responses against microbiota that associate with age and gender. We also demonstrate that these antibody epitope repertoires are more longitudinally stable than gut microbiome species abundances. Serum samples of more than 200 individuals collected five years apart could be accurately matched and could serve as an immunologic fingerprint. Overall, our results suggest that systemic antibody responses provide a non-redundant layer of information about microbiota beyond gut microbial species composition."

https://openalex.org/W3183692263,"Heme plays a critical role in catalyzing life-essential redox reactions in all cells, and its synthesis must be tightly balanced with cellular requirements. Heme synthesis in eukaryotes is tightly regulated by the mitochondrial AAA+ unfoldase CLPX (caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase chaperone subunit X), which promotes heme synthesis by activation of δ-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS/Hem1) in yeast and regulates turnover of ALAS1 in human cells. However, the specific mechanisms by which CLPX regulates heme synthesis are unclear. In this study, we interrogated the mechanisms by which CLPX regulates heme synthesis in erythroid cells. Quantitation of enzyme activity and protein degradation showed that ALAS2 stability and activity were both increased in the absence of CLPX, suggesting that CLPX primarily regulates ALAS2 by control of its turnover, rather than its activation. However, we also showed that CLPX is required for PPOX (protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase) activity and maintenance of FECH (ferrochelatase) levels, which are the terminal enzymes in heme synthesis, likely accounting for the heme deficiency and porphyrin accumulation observed in Clpx−/− cells. Lastly, CLPX is required for iron utilization for hemoglobin synthesis during erythroid differentiation. Collectively, our data show that the role of CLPX in yeast ALAS/Hem1 activation is not conserved in vertebrates as vertebrates rely on CLPX to regulate ALAS turnover as well as PPOX and FECH activity. Our studies reveal that CLPX mutations may cause anemia and porphyria via dysregulation of ALAS, FECH, and PPOX activities, as well as of iron metabolism.

Heme is a prosthetic group comprising a central iron chelated by a tetrapyrrole ring. It is critical for many life-essential redox processes, such as detoxification, oxygen transport, circadian rhythm, and control of transcription and translation (1Feng D.

However, the interactions between mitochondrial homeostasis and heme synthesis, and the extent to which these interactions are tissue-specific, are poorly understood. Heme synthesis is tightly regulated by mitochondrial CLPX, a member of the ubiquitous AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) protein unfoldase family (9Kardon J.R. Yien Y.Y.

CLPX is a ring-shaped homo-hexamer and is best understood for its function in a proteasome-like enzyme complex with the peptidase CLPP (caseinolytic protease proteolytic subunit). The complex of CLPX and CLPP together forms the CLPXP ATP-dependent protease. The CLPXP protease is best understood to facilitate degradation of misfolded mitochondrial proteins. CLPX recognizes specific sequences in protein substrates and unfolds protein tertiary structures through its central pore, presenting the unfolded polypeptide chain to the CLPP proteolytic chamber (10Baker T.A.

The elevated ALAS activity caused erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) resulting from accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) (17Yien Y.Y. Ducamp S. van der Vorm L.N. Kardon J.R. Manceau H.

These results suggested that regulation of heme synthesis by CLPX was not conserved across species, necessitating additional work to understand the role of CLPX in erythroid heme regulation and in hematologic diseases. To determine the role of CLPX in erythroid heme synthesis, we conducted loss-of-function studies in murine erythroid cells. As CLPX-interacting regions of yeast ALAS (Hem1), required for CLPX to interact with and activate ALAS (18Kardon J.R. Moroco J.A. Engen J.R. Baker T.A. Mitochondrial ClpX activates an essential biosynthetic enzyme through partial unfolding.Elife. 2020; 9e54387Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), had little similarity to vertebrate ALAS2 (Fig. S1), we wanted to determine if CLPX was required for ALAS2 activation in mammalian cells. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the Clpx and Clpp genes in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and verified the loss of CLPX and CLPP protein and mRNA expression by western blot (Fig. 1B) and qRT-PCR (Fig. 1C). Benzidine staining of differentiated Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− MEL cells indicated that Clpx−/− cells were hemoglobin-deficient, consistent with published observations (Fig. 1D) (9Kardon J.R. Yien Y.Y. Huston N.C. Branco D.S. Hildick-Smith G.J. Rhee K.Y. Paw B.H. Baker T.A. Mitochondrial ClpX activates a key enzyme for heme biosynthesis and erythropoiesis.Cell. 2015; 161: 858-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This was not caused by defects in mitochondrial activity (Fig. S2). Clpp−/− cells, predicted to accumulate active ALAS2 due to defective CLPXP-catalyzed protein degradation, had increased hemoglobin (Fig. 1D). To quantify the role of Clpx and Clpp in heme synthesis, we labeled newly synthesized heme with 55Fe. Clpx−/− MEL cells had decreased heme synthesis. In contrast, Clpp−/− MEL cells synthesized increased quantities of heme (Fig. 1E). As heme is an important transcriptional regulator of globin (19Kobayashi M. Kato H. Hada H. Itoh-Nakadai A.

Biol. 2007; 27: 6962-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of Clpx or Clpp deficiency on globin expression. Consistent with a heme defect in Clpx−/− cells, differentiating Clpx−/− cells experienced a significant decrease in Hbb-b1 and Hbb-b2 mRNA expression. Undifferentiated Clpx−/− cells also had a significant decrease in Hbb2 expression (Fig. 1F). These data confirm previous observations that CLPX is required for heme synthesis, while CLPP is not, and confirm that CLPX regulates heme independent of its role in the CLPXP proteolytic complex. Clpx deficiency also decreased globin mRNA expression, contributing to the hemoglobinization defect. To understand the role of Clpx in erythropoiesis in vivo, we characterized a zebrafish clpxb mutant (clpxbsa38141) obtained from the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC). Zebrafish encode two homologs of Clpx, clpxa, and clpxb. We previously investigated the role of the zebrafish clpxa gene in hematopoiesis, showing that clpxa deficiency caused a decrease in gata1-expressing erythroid progenitors and globin-expressing erythroid cells (9Kardon J.R. Yien Y.Y. Huston N.C. Branco D.S. Hildick-Smith G.J. Rhee K.Y. Paw B.H. Baker T.A. Mitochondrial ClpX activates a key enzyme for heme biosynthesis and erythropoiesis.Cell. 2015; 161: 858-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As homologs in zebrafish arise by gene duplication, we wanted to determine if the clpxb homolog played redundant roles in erythropoiesis. The clpxbsa38141 mutant has an E129X nonsense mutation, which removes substantial portions of protein required for ATP binding. Homozygous mutant embryos express about half the clpxb mRNA as wild-type embryos due to nonsense mediated degradation (Fig. 2A). At 48 hpf, clpxb mutant embryos were anemic (Fig. 2B). To determine if the anemia resulted from erythroid differentiation defects, we quantitated erythroid cells in clpxb mutant Tg(globin-lcr:GFP) zebrafish (23Ganis J.J. Hsia N. Trompouki E. de Jong J.L. DiBiase A. Lambert J.S. Jia Z. Sabo P.J. Weaver M. Sandstrom R. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Zhou Y. Zon L.I. Zebrafish globin switching occurs in two developmental stages and is controlled by the LCR.Dev. Biol. 2012; 366: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). clpxb mutant embryos did not exhibit altered erythroid cell numbers, indicating that clpxb is not required for erythroid specification (Fig. 2C). Giemsa staining of sorted GFP+ cells revealed defects in clpxb erythroid cells, such as ruffled membranes and nonuniform morphology (Fig. 2D). In contrast to wild-type erythroid cells, clpxb mutant cells were larger and had more variable nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios (Fig. 2E) that were caused by increases in nuclear size (Fig. 2F) and decreases in cytoplasmic area (Fig. 2G). clpxb is hence required for erythroid heme synthesis and function but is not required for lineage determination or cell number. To determine if CLPX regulates ALAS2, we analyzed the expression of its steady-state mRNA and protein. qPCR analysis revealed that Alas2 mRNA decreased in undifferentiated Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− cells relative to wild-type cells. ALAS2 mRNA decreased in differentiated Clpx−/− cells, relative to wild-type cells, but remained unchanged in Clpp−/− cells (Fig. 3A, i). ALAS2 steady-state protein increased in both Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− cells (Fig. 3A, ii). These data suggested that CLPX and CLPP may regulate ALAS2 protein stability. In contrast to previous observations (24Seo J.H. Rivadeneira D.B. Caino M.C. Chae Y.C. Speicher D.W. Tang H.Y. Vaira V. Bosari S. Palleschi A. Rampini P. Kossenkov A.V. Languino L.R. Altieri D.C. The mitochondrial unfoldase-peptidase complex ClpXP controls Bioenergetics stress and metastasis.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14e1002507Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we did not observe statistically significant decreases in SDHB protein levels or activity in Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− MEL cells (Fig. S3). To determine if CLPXP regulates ALAS2 stability, we monitored ALAS2 turnover in WT, Clpx−/−, and Clpp−/− cells following inhibition of protein translation by cycloheximide (CHX) (17Yien Y.Y.

ALAS2 was stabilized in Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− cells (Fig. 3B), echoing observations that CLPXP regulates ALAS1 turnover (16Kubota Y. Nomura K. Katoh Y. Yamashita R. Kaneko K. Furuyama K.

Chem. 2016; 291: 20516-20529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ALAS activity assays showed that Clpx−/− cells had significantly increased ALAS activity, indicating that CLPX is not required for ALAS activation (Fig. 4A). Strikingly, Clpp−/− cells had even higher ALAS enzyme activity than Clpx−/− cells. This dramatic increase in ALAS activity was most pronounced in differentiated Clpp−/− cells (Fig. 4A). The increase of ALAS activity in Clpp−/− relative to Clpx−/− cells cannot be attributed to differences in protein expression or stability (Fig. 3) suggesting that CLPP may play an inhibitory role in ALAS activation. An alternative explanation is that excess CLPX in Clpp−/− cells (i.e., CLPX that was not in a CLPXP complex) activated ALAS. The differential effect on ALAS activity did not translate to differences in ALA content as Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− cells had similar ALA levels (Fig. 4B). We quantitated PPIX, the terminal heme intermediate, to determine if porphyrin levels mirrored changes in ALA synthesis. Surprisingly, while Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− cells had similar increases in ALA levels, Clpp−/− cells contained significantly more PPIX than Clpx−/− cells. This was especially apparent in differentiated cells, suggesting that CLPXP may regulate heme synthesis downstream of ALA production (Fig. 4C). Hence, the heme defect in Clpx−/− erythroid cells was not a result of a decrease in ALAS activation or porphyrin production. Since CLPX is in the mitochondrial matrix (27Rhee H.W. Zou P. Udeshi N.D.

Zou P. Udeshi N.D. Martell J.D. Mootha V.K. Carr S.A. Ting A.Y.

Donovan A. et al.Mitoferrin is essential for erythroid iron assimilation.Nature. 2006; 440: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that PPOX and FECH protein levels were slightly decreased in both knockout cell lines (Fig. 4D). However, only Clpx−/− cells had a decrease in PPOX activity relative to WT or Clpp−/− cells (Fig. 4E). FECH activity was decreased in Clpx−/− cells in nondifferentiating cells. In differentiating cells, both Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− cells had decreased FECH activity (Fig. 4F). As Clpp−/− cells did not exhibit a heme defect, it was unlikely that the FECH deficiency was the sole cause of the heme defect in Clpx−/− cells. We also considered the possibility that CLPX regulated mitochondrial iron utilization. We chemically complemented the heme defect in Clpx−/− cells with ferric ammonium citrate complexed with a lipophilic iron chelator, hinokitiol (29Grillo A.S. SantaMaria A.M. Kafina M.D. Cioffi A.G.

Treatment with Fe-hinokitiol increased heme content in Clpx−/− cells to levels close to wild-type. These results suggested that a mitochondrial iron defect contributed to the heme defect in Clpx−/− cells (Fig. 5A). We also treated zebrafish embryos spawned from frs or clpxb heterozygous incrosses with either vehicle (DMSO) or Fe-hinokitiol. frs mutant zebrafish lack expression of mfrn1, the mitochondrial iron transporter (28Shaw G.C.

SantaMaria A.M. Kafina M.D. Cioffi A.G. Huston N.C. Han M. Seo Y.A. Yien Y.Y. Nardone C. Menon A.V. Fan J. Svoboda D.C. Anderson J.B. Hong J.D. Nicolau B.G. et al.Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals.Science. 2017; 356: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As expected, the numbers of severely anemic zebrafish embryos in frs incrosses were sharply reduced when treated with Fe-hinokitiol. Fe-hinokitiol significantly decreased numbers of embryos from clpxb heterozygote incrosses in both “severely anemic” and “anemic” categories, but the results were not as clear-cut as the frs mutant zebrafish (Fig. 5, B and C). These intermediate results indicate that iron deficiency plays a role in anemia in the clpxb mutant embryos (Fig. 5, B and C), but is not the sole cause of the anemia. Neither Clpx−/− nor Clpp−/− cells had a defect in MFRN1 expression (Fig. S4A) or mitochondrial iron levels (Fig. S4B), suggesting the defect is not in mitochondrial iron transport. Our results indicate that the primary mechanism by which CLPX regulates ALAS in vertebrate cells is by control of its turnover, rather than its activity. We have also shown that CLPX is required for maximal PPOX and FECH activity and regulates mitochondrial iron metabolism in differentiating erythroid cells. The porphyrin accumulation observed in these cells is augmented by increased ALAS2 activity in these cells (Fig. 5D). Although the requirement for Clpx in heme synthesis is conserved from yeast to vertebrates, several differences in CLPX function exist. The role of CLPX in heme regulation was originally discovered in S. cerevisiae yeast, which do not possess a CLPP ortholog. In yeast, CLPX functions exclusively as a mitochondrial protein unfoldase that unfolds Hem1/ALAS, facilitating the incorporation of its PLP cofactor, leading to ALAS/Hem1 activation (9Kardon J.R. Yien Y.Y. Huston N.C. Branco D.S. Hildick-Smith G.J. Rhee K.Y. Paw B.H. Baker T.A. Mitochondrial ClpX activates a key enzyme for heme biosynthesis and erythropoiesis.Cell. 2015; 161: 858-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Vertebrates, however, possess a CLPP ortholog, which forms the CLPXP protease with CLPX. In vertebrate cells, CLPXP regulates ALAS turnover (16Kubota Y. Nomura K. Katoh Y. Yamashita R. Kaneko K. Furuyama K. Novel mechanisms for heme-dependent degradation of ALAS1 protein as a component of negative feedback regulation of heme biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 20516-20529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Previous studies on vertebrate CLPX did not examine the requirement of CLPX for ALAS activity or heme synthesis. Our current studies bridged this gap by assaying the effects of Clpx and Clpp loss of function on the activities of heme synthetic enzymes and ALAS2 stability, as CLPX was previously shown to be required for erythroid hemoglobinization in zebrafish (9Kardon J.R. Yien Y.Y. Huston N.C. Branco D.S. Hildick-Smith G.J. Rhee K.Y. Paw B.H. Baker T.A. Mitochondrial ClpX activates a key enzyme for heme biosynthesis and erythropoiesis.Cell. 2015; 161: 858-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Clpx−/− erythroid cells have elevated ALA content and ALAS activity, unlike in yeast. In contrast to previous predictions in yeast, the heme defect in Clpx−/− erythroid cells was not due to defects in ALAS activity (Fig. 4, A and B). However, ALAS activity in Clpp−/− cells is higher than that of Clpx−/− cells even though its steady-state protein levels in Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− cells are similar (Fig. 3A). This suggests that CLPX may play a nonessential role in ALAS activation, leading to Clpp−/− cells exhibiting a “superactivated” ALAS phenotype as CLPX activates accumulated ALAS2. PPIX content was elevated in Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− cells, caused by a combination of elevated ALA production with downstream heme synthesis and iron metabolism defects (Fig. 4C). Clpx−/− cells had decreased PPOX and FECH activity, partially accounting for the heme defect (Fig. 4, E and F). The increase in PPIX levels was due to increased protoporphyrinogen IX (PPgenIX) caused by ALA overproduction and defects in PPOX and FECH activity. PPgenIX auto-oxidises to PPIX (31Poulson R. Polglase W.J. The enzymic conversion of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity in mitochondrial extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1269-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and leads to increased measurable PPIX even with decreased PPOX activity in Clpx−/− cells. In differentiating MEL cells, FECH activity was decreased in Clpp−/− cells, which exacerbated PPIX accumulation, although this did not cause heme deficiency. The heme defect in Clpx−/− cells was exacerbated by an iron defect, which was ameliorated by exogenous iron (Fig. 5, A and B). While CLPX is best known for its proteolytic function (11Olivares A.O. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mechanistic insights into bacterial AAA+ proteases and protein-remodelling machines.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it has roles that are distinct from CLPXP-mediated proteolysis. Our data support the premise that CLPX has CLPXP-independent functions in heme synthesis. While PPOX protein levels are slightly decreased in Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− MEL cells, PPOX activity was decreased in only Clpx−/− cells, suggesting that CLPX plays a role in PPOX activation. Further, iron complementation studies suggest that Clpx−/−, but not Clpp−/−, erythroid cells have an iron metabolism defect. Our studies suggest that CLPX regulates the function of mitochondrial matrix proteins that regulate heme synthesis in erythroid cells. The interactions between CLPX, CLPP, and erythroid heme synthesis are complex and are likely to be tissue and developmental stage specific. Several CLPXP-binding proteins are iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cluster proteins that are involved in oxidative phosphorylation or Fe-S cluster assembly (32Fischer F. Langer J.D. Osiewacz H.D. Identification of potential mitochondrial CLPXP protease interactors and substrates suggests its central role in energy metabolism.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 18375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A mouse model of Friedreich ataxia with a striated-muscle specific frataxin knockout showed an increase in expression of the CLPP and LON proteases associated with a decrease in mitochondrial Fe-S proteins. These included FECH, NDUFS3, and SDHB, which are involved in heme synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation (33Guillon B. Bulteau A.L. Wattenhofer-Donzé M. Schmucker S. Friguet B. Puccio H. Drapier J.C. Bouton C. Frataxin deficiency causes upregulation of mitochondrial Lon and ClpP proteases and severe loss of mitochondrial Fe-S proteins.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1036-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data contrast with the decrease in FECH activity that we observed in our Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− erythroid cell lines, although the decreased FECH activity may be caused by defects in iron metabolism in Clpx−/− cells (Fig. 4, A and C). Unlike previous studies on prostate adenocarcinoma cells (24Seo J.H. Rivadeneira D.B. Caino M.C. Chae Y.C. Speicher D.W. Tang H.Y. Vaira V. Bosari S. Palleschi A. Rampini P. Kossenkov A.V.

The mitochondrial unfoldase-peptidase complex ClpXP controls Bioenergetics stress and metastasis.PLoS Biol. 2016; 14e1002507Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), SDHB protein levels and activity were relatively unchanged in Clpx−/− and Clpp−/− MEL cells (Fig. S3). Lastly, CLPXP interacts with and degrades ALAS1 in the presence of heme, but dissociates from ALAS1 when heme synthesis is suppressed; in contrast, ALAS2 turnover is not increased during erythroid differentiation, when there are increased levels of heme (Fig. 3B). This suggests that unlike ALAS1, CLPXP does not increase the degradation of ALAS2 under high heme conditions. It is likely that the specific roles of CLPXP are regulated by cell-specific proteins. During terminal differentiation, the function of erythroid mitochondria shifts toward heme production for hemoglobin synthesis (8Yien Y.Y. Shi J. Chen C. Cheung J.T.M. Grillo A.S. Shrestha R. Li L.

It is therefore revealing that CLPXP regulates heme synthesis at multiple points in the pathway, but is not essential for regulating Fe-S proteins in erythroid cells. Our data shed light on how a dominant CLPXG298D heterozygous mutation caused erythroid protoporphyria (17Yien Y.Y. Ducamp S. van der Vorm L.N. Kardon J.R. Manceau H. Kannengiesser C. Bergonia H.A. Kafina M.D. Karim Z. Gouya L. Baker T.A. Puy H. Phillips J.D. Nicolas G. Paw B.H.

A. 2017; 114: E8045-E8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). CLPXG298D lacked ATPase activity and hetero-oligomerized with wild-type CLPX, decreasing the ATPase activity of the CLPX hexamer. We previously proposed that the WT/G298D hetero-hexamer could activate, but not degrade ALAS, causing accumulation of active ALAS and overproduction of PPIX, leading to EPP. Our new data indicate that CLPX is not required for activation of ALAS, suggesting that CLPX-EPP can be caused by stabilization of ALAS alone. We also show that CLPX and CLPP are required for optimal FECH activity. The decrease in FECH activity can exacerbate PPIX accumulation caused by ALA overproduction and may be compounded by an iron defect. CLPX mutations contribute to metabolic disorders in human patients and animal models (12Gispert S. Parganlija D. Klinkenberg M. Dröse S. Wittig I. Mittelbronn M. Grzmil P. Koob S. Hamann A. Walter M.

More broadly, heme regulation is not limited to control of ALAS activity, long regarded as the rate-limiting step. Rather, it can also be controlled at the terminal steps, i.e., at the level of PPOX and FECH activity, and their integration with iron utilization. The heterogeneity of CLPX-deficient phenotypes in different cell types suggests that CLPX regulates mitochondrial metabolism in a cell-specific manner (9Kardon J.R. Yien Y.Y. Huston N.C. Branco D.S.

A method that meets the rapid quantitative detection of antibodies to assess the body’s immune response from natural COVID-19 illness or vaccines’ effects is urgently needed. In the present study, an attempt was made to integrate a newly designed spectrometer to the COVID-19 test strip procedure; this augmentation provides the quantitative capacity to a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). Optical interpretation of results by quantitative α index, rather than visual qualification, can be done quickly, in 5–10 minutes. The developed product was compared with several other serological IgM/IgG antibody reagents on the market by recruiting 111 participants suspected of having COVID-19 infection from March to May 2020 in a hospital. Taking RT-PCR as the diagnostic gold standard, the quantitative spectral LIFA platform could correctly detect all 12 COVID-19 patients. Concerning RT-PCR negative patients, all three antibody testing methods found positive cases. The optical-based platform exhibited the ability of early detection of immunoglobulins of RT-PCR negative patients. There was an apparent trend that elevation of IgM levels in the acute phase of infection; then IgG levels rose later. It exhibited the risk of a false-negative diagnosis of RT-PCR in COVID-19 testing. The significant detection ability of this new optical-based platform demonstrated clinical potential."

The mutation of TP53 has been well-studied and recognized as a major factor in the development of tumors. Yet other means of p53 inactivation has not been well-elucidated. We previously identified a hypermethylated gene ZDHHC1 that suppresses tumor growth when the expression was restored, but the specific mechanism was yet to be found. The protein product of ZDHHC1 is an S-palmitoyltransferase and we have identified p53 as a substrate for ZDHHC1-mediated palmitoylation, specifically at the C135, C176, and C275 residues. The novel form of post-translational modification of p53 is required for the nuclear translocation of the tumor suppressor. p53 recruited DNMT3A to ZDHHC1 promoter and is responsible for the hypermethylation of ZDHHC1 . The epigenetic feedback loop formed by ZDHHC1 and p53 sheds light on the inactivation of p53 without the presence of genetic mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3185059154,"Background Contact mixing plays a key role in the spread of COVID-19. Thus, mobility restrictions of varying degrees up to and including nationwide lockdowns have been implemented in over 200 countries. To appropriately target the timing, location, and severity of measures intended to encourage social distancing at a country level, it is essential to predict when and where outbreaks will occur, and how widespread they will be. Methods We analyze aggregated, anonymized health data and cell phone mobility data from Israel. We develop predictive models for daily new cases and the test positivity rate over the next 7 days for different geographic regions in Israel. We evaluate model goodness of fit using root mean squared error (RMSE). We use these predictions in a five-tier categorization scheme to predict the severity of COVID-19 in each region over the next week. We measure magnitude accuracy (MA), the extent to which the correct severity tier is predicted. Results Models using mobility data outperformed models that did not use mobility data, reducing RMSE by 17.3% when predicting new cases and by 10.2% when predicting the test positivity rate. The best set of predictors for new cases consisted of 1-day lag of past 7-day average new cases, along with a measure of internal movement within a region. The best set of predictors for the test positivity rate consisted of 3-days lag of past 7-day average test positivity rate, along with the same measure of internal movement. Using these predictors, RMSE was 4.812 cases per 100,000 people when predicting new cases and 0.79% when predicting the test positivity rate. MA in predicting new cases was 0.775, and accuracy of prediction to within one tier was 1.0. MA in predicting the test positivity rate was 0.820, and accuracy to within one tier was 0.998. Conclusions Using anonymized, macro-level data human mobility data along with health data aids predictions of when and where COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to occur. Our method provides a useful tool for government decision makers, particularly in the post-vaccination era, when focused interventions are needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks while mitigating the collateral damage from more global restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W3185494345,"In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, mathematical modeling constitutes an important tool to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and to guide policy-making. Most research is, however, centered around characterizing the epidemic based on point estimates like the average infectiousness or the average number of contacts. In this work, we use stochastic simulations to investigate the consequences of a population’s heterogeneity regarding connectivity and individual viral load levels. Therefore, we translate a COVID-19 ODE model to a stochastic multi-agent system. We use contact networks to model complex interaction structures and a probabilistic infection rate to model individual viral load variation. We observe a large dependency of the dispersion and dynamical evolution on the population’s heterogeneity that is not adequately captured by point estimates, for instance, used in ODE models. In particular, models that assume the same clinical and transmission parameters may lead to different conclusions, depending on different types of heterogeneity in the population. For instance, the existence of hubs in the contact network leads to an initial increase of dispersion and the effective reproduction number, but to a lower herd immunity threshold (HIT) compared to homogeneous populations or a population where the heterogeneity stems solely from individual infectivity variations."

In particular A . aculeata , due to its vocation to supply oil with the same productive capacity as the oil palm ( Elaeis guineenses ) even in areas with water deficit. Although eight species are recognized in the genus, the taxonomic classification based on morphology and geographic distribution is still controversial. Knowledge about the genetic diversity and population structure of the species is limited, which has limited the understanding of the genetic relationships and the orientation of management, conservation, and genetic improvement activities of species of the genus. In the present study, we analyzed the genomic diversity and population structure of Acrocomia genus, including 172 samples from seven species, with a focus on A . aculeata with 117 samples covering a wide geographical area of occurrence of the species, using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers originated from Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS).The genetic structure of the Acrocomia species were partially congruent with the current taxonomic classification based on morphological characters, recovering the separation of the species A . aculeata , A . totai , A . crispa and A . intumescens as distinct taxonomic groups. However, the species A . media was attributed to the cluster of A . aculeata while A . hassleri and A . glauscescens were grouped together with A . totai . The species that showed the highest and lowest genetic diversity were A . totai and A . media , respectively. When analyzed separately, the species A . aculeata showed a strong genetic structure, forming two genetic groups, the first represented mainly by genotypes from Brazil and the second by accessions from Central and North American countries. Greater genetic diversity was found in Brazil when compared to the other countries. Our results on the genetic diversity of the genus are unprecedented, as is also establishes new insights on the genomic relationships between Acrocomia species. It is also the first study to provide a more global view of the genomic diversity of A . aculeata .

The structure showed that the 3' end of the acceptor RNA binds in a pocket formed by an N-terminal extension present in non-long terminal repeat-retroelement RTs and the RT fingertips loop, with the 3' nucleotide of the acceptor base paired to the 1-nt 3'-DNA overhang and its penultimate nucleotide base paired to the incoming dNTP at the RT active site. Analysis of structure-guided mutations identified amino acids that contribute to acceptor RNA binding and a phenylalanine residue near the RT active site that mediates nontemplated nucleotide addition. Mutation of the latter residue decreased multiple sequential template switches in RNA-Seq. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of TS and nontemplated nucleotide addition by RTs, suggest how these reactions could be improved for RNA-Seq, and reveal common structural features for TS by non-long terminal repeat-retroelement RTs and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W3186440218,"The large amounts of engineered titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) that have been manufactured have inevitably been released into the ecosystem. Reports have suggested that TiO 2 is a relatively inert material that has low toxicity to animals. However, as various types of NPs increasingly accumulate in the ocean, their effects on aquatic life-forms remain unclear. In this study, a zebrafish model was used to investigate TiO 2 NP-induced injury and mortality. We found that the treatment dosages of TiO 2 NP are positively associated with increased motility of zebrafish and the bacterial counts in the water. Notably, gill but not dorsal fin and caudal fin of the zebrafish displayed considerably increased bacterial load. Metagenomic analysis further revealed that gut microflora, such as phyla Proteobacteria , Bacteroidetes , and Actinobacteria , involving more than 95% of total bacteria counts in the NP-injured zebrafish gill samples. These results collectively suggest that opportunistic bacterial infections are associated with TiO 2 NP-induced mortality in zebrafish. Infections secondary to TiO 2 NP-induced injury could be a neglected factor determining the detrimental effects of TiO 2 NPs on wild fish."
https://openalex.org/W3048853375,"The rise of machine learning (ML) has created an explosion in the potential strategies for using data to make scientific predictions. For physical scientists wishing to apply ML strategies to a particular domain, it can be difficult to assess in advance what strategy to adopt within a vast space of possibilities. Here we outline the results of an online community-powered effort to swarm search the space of ML strategies and develop algorithms for predicting atomic-pairwise nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties in molecules. Using an open-source dataset, we worked with Kaggle to design and host a 3-month competition which received 47,800 ML model predictions from 2,700 teams in 84 countries. Within 3 weeks, the Kaggle community produced models with comparable accuracy to our best previously published 'in-house' efforts. A meta-ensemble model constructed as a linear combination of the top predictions has a prediction accuracy which exceeds that of any individual model, 7-19x better than our previous state-of-the-art. The results highlight the potential of transformer architectures for predicting quantum mechanical (QM) molecular properties."
https://openalex.org/W3184399921,"Chromium toxicity is a major problem in agricultural soils that negatively affects a plant's metabolic activities. It reduces biochemical and antioxidant defence system's activities. In search of the solution to this problem a two-year pot experiment (completely randomized design with three replications), in three genetically different varieties of sorghum (SSG 59-3, HJ 513 and HJ 541) under Cr toxicity (2 and 4 ppm) was conducted to determine the effect of glycine betaine (50 and 100mM) and Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the antioxidant system (enzymes viz. superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase, peroxidase and metabolites viz. glutathione, ascorbate, proline, β-carotene) along with Cr accumulation and indices of oxidative stress parameters (polyphenol oxidase, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde) at two growth stages (vegetative and grain filling). According to results; Cr stress (2 & 4 ppm) increased its accumulation and indices of oxidative stresses significantly (p≤0.05) in all varieties of sorghum at both growth stages. However, soil application of glycine betaine (GB) and AMF decreased Cr accumulation and indices of oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzymes and metabolites activities at both growth stages in all varieties. The combination of 100mM GB with AMF was observed most significant (p≤0.05) in decreasing oxidative stress and improved the antioxidant system's activities. The SSG 59-3 cultivar showed the lowest Cr accumulation (1.60 and 8.61 ppm), indices of oxidative stress and highest antioxidant system's activity among these three cultivars at both growth stages. Thus, SSG 59-3 was found most tolerant cultivars followed by HJ 513 and then HJ 541. These findings suggest that both GB and AMF, either individually or combined can play a positive role to reduce oxidative stress and increased antioxidant attributes under Cr toxicity in sorghum."
https://openalex.org/W3185968192,"Background Compared to in-centre, home hemodialysis is associated with superior outcomes. The impact on patient experience and clinical outcomes of consistently providing the choice and training to undertake hemodialysis-related treatment tasks in the in-centre setting is unknown. Methods A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial in 12 UK renal centres recruited prevalent in-centre hemodialysis patients with sites randomised into early and late participation in a 12-month breakthrough series collaborative that included data collection, learning events, Plan-Study-Do-Act cycles, and teleconferences repeated every 6 weeks, underpinned by a faculty, co-production, materials and a nursing course. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients undertaking five or more hemodialysis-related tasks or home hemodialysis. Secondary outcomes included independent hemodialysis, quality of life, symptoms, patient activation and hospitalisation. ISRCTN Registration Number 93999549. Results 586 hemodialysis patients were recruited. The proportion performing 5 or more tasks or home hemodialysis increased from 45.6% to 52.3% (205 to 244/449, difference 6.2%, 95% CI 1.4 to 11%), however after analysis by step the adjusted odds ratio for the intervention was 1.63 (95% CI 0.94 to 2.81, P = 0.08). 28.3% of patients doing less than 5 tasks at baseline performed 5 or more at the end of the study (69/244, 95% CI 22.2–34.3%, adjusted odds ratio 3.71, 95% CI 1.66–8.31). Independent or home hemodialysis increased from 7.5% to 11.6% (32 to 49/423, difference 4.0%, 95% CI 1.0–7.0), but the remaining secondary endpoints were unaffected. Conclusions Our intervention did not increase dialysis related tasks being performed by a prevalent population of centre based patients, but there was an increase in home hemodialysis as well as an increase in tasks among patients who were doing fewer than 5 at baseline. Further studies are required that examine interventions to engage people who dialyse at centres in their own care."

The United States (U.S.) President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) establishes the global HIV/AIDS treatment agenda in alignment with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets to achieve epidemic control related to enhanced testing, treatment, and viral suppression. A strategic PEPFAR priority area recognizes that large-scale collective efforts and sharing of resources bear greater potential impact for lasting change than any single organization or entity can achieve alone. An important vehicle utilized within the global public health context is the public-private partnership (PPP) model whereby multiple international organizations forge unified project charters to collectively reach mutually agreed goals. While touted as an ideal mechanism to synthesize resources and maximize gain in numerous applications, little is known from a seasoned stakeholder perspective regarding PPP implementation and sustainability issues. The purpose of this research is to holistically examine perceptions of PPP model sustainability related to inputs and impacts among a collective network of stakeholders experienced with PEPFAR workforce development, laboratory-system strengthening project implementation. Interviews were conducted with frontline stakeholders from public and private sector organizations based in the US and select PEPFAR-supported priority countries. Analysis revealed three dominant themes: PPP impacts, keys of successful collaboration, and logistical challenges and opportunities to enhance sustainability of PPP outcomes in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3183774523,"Adult elastic cartilage has limited repair capacity. MRL/MpJ (MRL) mice, by contrast, are capable of spontaneously healing ear punctures. This study was undertaken to characterize microbiome differences between healer and non-healer mice and to evaluate whether this healing phenotype can be transferred via gut microbiome transplantation.We orally transplanted C57BL/6J (B6) mice with MRL/MpJ cecal contents at weaning and as adults (n = 57) and measured ear hole closure 4 weeks after a 2.0mm punch and compared to vehicle-transplanted MRL and B6 (n = 25) and B6-transplanted MRL (n = 20) mice. Sex effects, timing of transplant relative to earpunch, and transgenerational heritability were evaluated. In a subset (n = 58), cecal microbiomes were profiled by 16S sequencing and compared to ear hole closure. Microbial metagenomes were imputed using PICRUSt.Transplantation of B6 mice with MRL microbiota, either in weanlings or adults, improved ear hole closure. B6-vehicle mice healed ear hole punches poorly (0.25±0.03mm, mm ear hole healing 4 weeks after a 2mm ear hole punch [2.0mm-final ear hole size], mean±SEM), whereas MRL-vehicle mice healed well (1.4±0.1mm). MRL-transplanted B6 mice healed roughly three times as well as B6-vehicle mice, and half as well as MRL-vehicle mice (0.74±0.05mm, P = 6.9E-10 vs. B6-vehicle, P = 5.2E-12 vs. MRL-vehicle). Transplantation of MRL mice with B6 cecal material did not reduce MRL healing (B6-transplanted MRL 1.3±0.1 vs. MRL-vehicle 1.4±0.1, p = 0.36). Transplantation prior to ear punch was associated with the greatest ear hole closure. Offspring of transplanted mice healed significantly better than non-transplanted control mice (offspring:0.63±0.03mm, mean±SEM vs. B6-vehicle control:0.25±0.03mm, n = 39 offspring, P = 4.6E-11). Several microbiome clades were correlated with healing, including Firmicutes (R = 0.84, P = 8.0E-7), Lactobacillales (R = 0.65, P = 1.1E-3), and Verrucomicrobia (R = -0.80, P = 9.2E-6). Females of all groups tended to heal better than males (B6-vehicle P = 0.059, MRL-transplanted B6 P = 0.096, offspring of MRL-transplanted B6 P = 0.0038, B6-transplanted MRL P = 1.6E-6, MRL-vehicle P = 0.0031). Many clades characteristic of female mouse cecal microbiota vs. males were the same as clades characteristic of MRL and MRL-transplanted B6 mice vs. B6 controls, including including increases in Clostridia and reductions in Verrucomicrobia in female mice.In this study, we found an association between the microbiome and tissue regeneration in MRL mice and demonstrate that this trait can be transferred to non-healer mice via microbiome transplantation. We identified several microbiome clades associated with healing."

Recently, researchers have begun to examine the effect of droughts on the risk of Intimate-Partner Violence (IPV), but so far this work has led to inconclusive results. For example, two large recent studies analyzed comparable data from multiple sub-Saharan African countries and drew opposite conclusions. We attempt to resolve this apparent paradox by replicating previous analyses with the largest data set yet assembled to study drought and IPV. Integrating the methods of previous studies and taking particular care to control for spatial autocorrelation, we find little association between drought and most forms of IPV, although we do find evidence of associations between drought and women's partners exhibiting controlling behaviors. Moreover, we do not find significant heterogeneous effects based on wealth, employment, household drinking water sources, or urban-rural locality."
https://openalex.org/W3184268689,"Objectives We sought to assess the rate of unplanned hospital visits among patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. Summary background data The majority of surgeries performed in the United States now take place in outpatient settings. Post-discharge hospital visit rates have been shown to vary widely, suggesting variation in surgical or discharge care quality. Complicating efforts to address quality, most facilities and surgeons are unaware of their patients’ hospital visits after surgery since patients may present to a different hospital. Methods We used state-level, administrative data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from California to assess unplanned hospital visits after ambulatory surgery. To compare rates across centers, we determined the age, sex, and procedure-adjusted rates of hospital visits for each facility using 2-level, hierarchical, generalized linear models using methods similar to existing Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services measures. Results Among a total of 1,260,619 ambulatory same-day surgeries from 440 surgical facilities, the risk adjusted 30-day rate of unplanned hospital visits was 4.8%, with emergency department visits of 3.1% and hospital admissions of 1.7%. Several patient characteristics were associated with increased risk of unplanned hospitals visits, including increased age, increased number of comorbidities (using the Elixhauser score), and type of procedure (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions The overall rate unplanned hospital visits within 30 days after same-day surgery is low but variable, suggesting a difference in the quality of care provided. Further, these rates are higher among specific patient populations and procedure types, suggesting areas for targeted improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3185908097,"Citrus cultivars are widely spread worldwide, and some of them only differ by specific mutations along the genome. It is difficult to distinguish them by traditional morphological identification. To accurately identify such similar cultivars, the subtle differences between them must be detected. In this study, UPLC-ESI-MS/MS-based widely targeted metabolomics analysis was conducted to study the chemical differences between two closely related citrus cultivars, Citrus reticulata 'DHP' and C. reticulata 'BZH'. Totally 352 metabolites including 11 terpenoids, 35 alkaloids, 80 phenolic acids, 25 coumarins, 7 lignans, 184 flavonoids and 10 other compounds were detected and identified; Among them, 15 metabolites are unique to DHP and 16 metabolites are unique to BZH. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal signal correction and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) can be used to clearly discriminate between DHP and BZH. 93 metabolites including 36 down-regulated and 57 up-regulated are significantly different in DHP and BZH. They are mainly involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, flavones, flavonols, and isoflavonoids. In addition, the relative content levels of flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids are much higher in the peel of DHP than that of BZH, the presence of which may correlate with the quality difference of the peels. The results reported herein indicate that metabolite analysis based on UPLC-ESI-MS/MS is an effective means of identifying cultivars with different genotypes, especially those that cannot be distinguished based on traditional identification methods."
https://openalex.org/W3186747208,"Trypanosomiasis is a significant productivity-limiting livestock disease in sub-Saharan Africa, contributing to poverty and food insecurity. In this paper, we estimate the potential economic gains from adopting Waterbuck Repellent Blend (WRB). The WRB is a new technology that pushes trypanosomiasis-transmitting tsetse fly away from animals, improving animals' health and increasing meat and milk productivity. We estimate the benefits of WRB on the production of meat and milk using the economic surplus approach. We obtained data from an expert elicitation survey, secondary and experimental sources. Our findings show that the adoption of WRB in 5 to 50% of the animal population would generate an economic surplus of US$ 78-869 million per annum for African 18 countries. The estimated benefit-cost ratio (9:1) further justifies an investment in WRB. The technology's potential benefits are likely to be underestimated since our estimates did not include the indirect benefits of the technology adoption, such as the increase in the quantity and quality of animals' draught power services and human and environmental health effects. These benefits suggest that investing in WRB can contribute to nutrition security and sustainable development goals."
https://openalex.org/W3184863454,"A substantial fraction of the human genome displays high sequence similarity with at least one other genomic sequence, posing a challenge for the identification of somatic mutations from short-read sequencing data. Here we annotate genomic variants in 2,658 cancers from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) cohort with links to similar sites across the human genome. We train a machine learning model to use signals distributed over multiple genomic sites to call somatic events in non-unique regions and validate the data against linked-read sequencing in an independent dataset. Using this approach, we uncover previously hidden mutations in ~1,700 coding sequences and in thousands of regulatory elements, including in known cancer genes, immunoglobulins and highly mutated gene families. Mutations in non-unique regions are consistent with mutations in unique regions in terms of mutation burden and substitution profiles. The analysis provides a systematic summary of the mutation events in non-unique regions at a genome-wide scale across multiple human cancers."

We examined the seroprevalence of these diseases and associated factors amongst pastoralists and their cattle in Sokoto State, a hub of cattle and pastoral populations in Nigeria. Serum samples randomly collected from 137 pastoralists and 366 cattle from 27 herds in three selected Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the state were analysed for antibodies to Brucella abortus using Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBT) and competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (cELISA) as well as antibodies to Coxiella burnetti using indirect ELISA. Consenting pastoralists’ knowledge, perception and practices about the diseases were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis at p ≤ 0.05 level of significance. Brucellosis adjusted individual seroprevalence were 0.83% (95%CI: 0.04–4.59%) and 0% among pastoralists; 2.28% (95%CI: 1.16–4.43%) and 5.70% (95%CI: 3.68–8.74%) in cattle by RBT and cELISA, respectively. Adjusted herd-level seroprevalence for brucellosis were 23.20% (95%CI: 11.07–42.54%) and 42.00% (95%CI: 25.27–61.11%) by RBT and cELISA, respectively. For Q fever, higher seroprevalence of 62.57% (95%CI: 54.04–70.46%) and 2.98% (95%CI: 1.57–5.58%) were recorded amongst the pastoralists and their cattle, respectively. with adjusted herd-level seroprevalence of 40.36% (95%CI: 22.57–63.17%). The LGAs of sampling were significantly (OR: 0.2; 95%CI: 0.02–1.00) associated with Q fever infection, though marginal. The majority of the pastoralists had poor knowledge, perception and practices towards the diseases. This is the first study establishing the presence of brucellosis and Q fever at the human-animal interface in Sokoto State, Nigeria. The pastoralists’ poor knowledge, perception and practices about these diseases are worrisome and are important factors for consideration in disease control."
https://openalex.org/W3183679856,"Measurement while drilling is an important part of the intelligent development of coal mines. The main purpose of this paper is to comprehensively analyze the response characteristics of borehole drilling parameters and find a better method to predict rock mechanical properties based on drilling parameters. Firstly, six concrete blocks and multiple specimens were prepared with different material ratios. Next, the concrete specimens were tested for mechanical properties in the laboratory. Meanwhile, the displacement, rotation speed, torque, and sound pressure level (SPL) were observed during the drilling of the concrete blocks. Finally, the response characteristics of drilling parameters such as rotation speed, rate of penetration (ROP), torque, and SPL were analyzed. Besides, multiple prediction models of rock mechanical parameters were obtained by data analysis. The research results indicate that the drilling process can be classified into the initial stage of drilling (fast speed) and the steady stage of drilling (slow speed). The torque work ratio accounts for more than 99%, which increases with the increase in rock strength. The penetration depth per revolution and torque work ratio are significantly related to rock uniaxial compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength, cohesion, and elastic modulus. The ROP is the best choice for estimating rock mechanical parameters. This research provides an important reference for laboratory rock mechanics parameter testing and geological features detection based on drilling parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3184315925,"Spot-the-difference, the popular childhood game and a prototypical change blindness task, involves identification of differences in local features of two otherwise identical scenes using an eye scanning and matching strategy. Through binocular fusion of the companion scenes, the game becomes a visual search task, wherein players can simply scan the cyclopean percept for local features that may distinctly stand-out due to binocular rivalry/lustre. Here, we had a total of 100 visually normal adult (18-28 years of age) volunteers play this game in the traditional non-fusion mode and after cross-fusion of the companion images using a hand-held mirror stereoscope. The results demonstrate that the fusion mode significantly speeds up gameplay and reduces errors, relative to the non-fusion mode, for a range of target sizes, contrasts, and chromaticity tested (all, p<0.001). Amongst the three types of local feature differences available in these images (polarity difference, presence/absence of a local feature difference and shape difference in a local feature difference), features containing polarity difference was identified as first in ~60-70% of instances in both modes of gameplay (p<0.01), with this proportion being larger in the fusion than in the non-fusion mode. The binocular fusion advantage is lost when the lustre cue is purposefully weakened through alterations in target luminance polarity. The spot-the-difference game may thus be cheated using binocular fusion and the differences readily identified through a vivid experience of binocular rivalry/lustre."
https://openalex.org/W3185847377,"Accuracy of infrared (IR) models to measure soil particle-size distribution (PSD) depends on soil preparation, methodology (sedimentation, laser), settling times and relevant soil features. Compositional soil data may require log ratio (ilr) transformation to avoid numerical biases. Machine learning can relate numerous independent variables that may impact on NIR spectra to assess particle-size distribution. Our objective was to reach high IRS prediction accuracy across a large range of PSD methods and soil properties. A total of 1298 soil samples from eastern Canada were IR-scanned. Spectra were processed by Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) to predict sand, silt, clay and carbon. Slope and intercept of the log-log relationships between settling time and suspension density function (SDF) (R2 = 0.84-0.92) performed similarly to NIR spectra using either ilr-transformed (R2 = 0.81-0.93) or raw percentages (R2 = 0.76-0.94). Settling times of 0.67-min and 2-h were the most accurate for NIR predictions (R2 = 0.49-0.79). The NIR prediction of sand sieving method (R2 = 0.66) was more accurate than sedimentation method(R2 = 0.53). The NIR 2X gain was less accurate (R2 = 0.69-0.92) than 4X (R2 = 0.87-0.95). The MIR (R2 = 0.45-0.80) performed better than NIR (R2 = 0.40-0.71) spectra. Adding soil carbon, reconstituted bulk density, pH, red-green-blue color, oxalate and Mehlich3 extracts returned R2 value of 0.86-0.91 for texture prediction. In addition to slope and intercept of the SDF, 4X gain, method and pre-treatment classes, soil carbon and color appeared to be promising features for routine SGB-processed NIR particle-size analysis. Machine learning methods support cost-effective soil texture NIR analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3186373214,"Listening is critical for foreign language learning. Listening difficulties can occur because of an inability to perceive or recognize sounds while listening to speech, whereas successful listening can boost understanding and improve speaking when learning a foreign language. Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that EEG-neurofeedback (NF) using mismatch negativity event-related brain potential successfully induced unconscious learning in terms of auditory discrimination of speech sounds. Here, we conducted a feasibility study with a small participant group (NF group and control group; six participants each) to examine the practical effects of mismatch negativity NF for improving the perception of speech sounds in a foreign language. Native Japanese speakers completed a task in which they learned to perceive and recognize spoken English words containing the consonants ""l"" or ""r"". Participants received neurofeedback training while not explicitly attending to auditory stimuli. The results revealed that NF training significantly improved the proportion of correct in discrimination and recognition trials, even though the training time for each word pair was reduced to 20% of the training time reported in our previous study. The learning effect was not affected by training with three pairs of words with different vowels. The current results indicate that NF resulted in long-term learning that persisted for at least 2 months."
https://openalex.org/W3183445312,"Down syndrome, which results from a trisomic imbalance for chromosome 21, has been associated with 80+ phenotypic traits. However, the cellular changes that arise in somatic cells due to this aneuploid condition are not fully understood. The primary aim of this study was to determine if germline trisomy 21 is associated with an increase in spontaneous somatic cell chromosomal instability frequencies (SCINF). To achieve this aim, we quantified SCINF in people with mosaic Down syndrome using a cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay. By comparing values in their isogenic trisomic/disomic cells, we obtained a measure of differences in SCINF that are directly attributable to a trisomy 21 imbalance, since differential effects attributable to ""background"" genetic factors and environmental exposures could be eliminated. A cross-sectional assessment of 69 people with mosaic Down syndrome (ages 1 to 44; mean age of 12.84 years) showed a significantly higher frequency of micronuclei in their trisomic (0.37 ± 0.35 [mean ± standard deviation]) compared to disomic cells (0.18 ± 0.11)(P <0.0001). The daughter binucleates also showed significantly higher levels of abnormal patterns in the trisomic (1.68 ± 1.21) compared to disomic (0.35 ± 0.45) cells (P <0.0001). Moreover, a significant Age x Cell Type interaction was noted (P = 0.0113), indicating the relationship between age and SCINF differed between the trisomic and disomic cells. Similarly, a longitudinal assessment (mean time interval of 3.9 years; range of 2 to 6 years) of 18 participants showed a mean 1.63-fold increase in SCINF within individuals over time for their trisomic cells (P = 0.0186), compared to a 1.13-fold change in their disomic cells (P = 0.0464). In summary, these results showed a trisomy 21-associated, age-related increase in SCINF. They also underscore the strength of the isogenic mosaic Down syndrome model system for ""unmasking"" cellular changes arising from a trisomy 21 imbalance."
https://openalex.org/W3183810645,"Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we investigated the effects of passive heat stress and recovery on the human cognitive function with Flanker tasks, involving congruent and incongruent stimuli. We hypothesized that modulation of the peak amplitude and latency of the P300 component in ERP waveforms would differ with task difficulty during passive heat stress and recovery. Subjects performed the Flanker tasks before (Pre), at the end of whole body heating (Heat: internal temperature increase of ~1.2°C from the pre-heat baseline), and after the internal temperature had returned to the pre-heat baseline (Recovery). The internal temperature was regulated by a tube-lined suit by perfusing 50°C water for heat stress and 25°C water for recovery immediately after the heat stress. Regardless of task difficulty, the reaction time (RT) was shortened during Heat rather than Pre and Recovery, and standard deviations of RT (i.e., response variability) were significantly smaller during Heat than Pre. However, the peak amplitudes of the P300 component in ERPs, which involved selective attention, expectancy, and memory updating, were significantly smaller during Heat than during Pre, suggesting the impairment of neural activity in cognitive function. Notably, the peak amplitudes of the P300 component were higher during Recovery than during Heat, indicating that the impaired neural activity had recovered after sufficient whole-body cooling. An indicator of the stimulus classification/evaluation time (peak latency of P300) and the RT were shortened during Heat stress, but such shortening was not noted after whole-body cooling. These results suggest that hyperthermia affects the human cognitive function, reflected by the peak amplitude and latency of the P300 component in ERPs during the Flanker tasks, but sufficient treatment such as whole-body cooling performed in this study can recover those functions."

https://openalex.org/W3009694818,"We first propose a quantitative approach to detect high risk outbreaks of independent and coinfective SIR dynamics on three empirical networks: a school, a conference and a hospital contact network. This measurement is based on the k-means clustering method and identifies proper samples for calculating the mean outbreak size and the outbreak probability. Then we systematically study the impact of different temporal correlations on high risk outbreaks over the original and differently shuffled counterparts of each network. We observe that, on the one hand, in the coinfection process, randomization of the sequence of the events increases the mean outbreak size of high-risk cases. On the other hand, these correlations do not have a consistent effect on the independent infection dynamics, and can either decrease or increase this mean. Randomization of the daily pattern correlations has no strong impact on the size of the outbreak in either the coinfection or the independent spreading cases. We also observe that an increase in the mean outbreak size does not always coincide with an increase in the outbreak probability; therefore, we argue that merely considering the mean outbreak size of all realizations may lead us into falsely estimating the outbreak risks. Our results suggest that some sort of contact randomization in the organizational level in schools, events or hospitals might help to suppress the spreading dynamics while the risk of an outbreak is high."

High-grade squamous lesions or worse detection was considered recurrence. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed, including age, conization technique (CKC, cold-knife, or ETZ, excision of transformation zone), and pathological results. Conization height to provide negative margins and the risk of residual disease were analyzed.Conization was indicated by biopsy CIN2/3 in 293 cases. Definitive treatments were hysterectomy (69.8%), CKC (20.5%), and ETZ (9.7%). Recurrence rate was 5.5%, more frequent in older women (p = 0.030), and less frequent in the hysterectomy group (p = 0.023). Age ≥40 years, ETZ and conization height are independent risk factors for margin involvement. For ages <40 years, 10 mm cone height was associated with 68.6% Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for positive margins, while for 15 mm and 25 mm, the NPV was 75.8% and 96.2%, respectively. With negative margins, the NPV for RD varied from 85.7-92.3% for up to 24 mm cone height and 100% from 25 mm.Conization 10 mm height for women <40 years provided adequate staging for almost 70%, with 10% of RD and few recurrences. A personalized cone height and staging associated with conservative treatment are recommended."

This study aimed at comparative evaluation of growth and reproductive performance traits of sheep in the highland and lowland agro-ecologies of northwestern Ethiopia. Data on growth performance traits were collected from 144 Washera (78 males and 66 females) lambs and 72 Gumuz (37 males and 35 females) lambs. Data on reproductive performance traits were collected from 260 Washera (130 rams and 130 ewes) sheep and 150 Gumuz (75 rams and 75 ewes) sheep. General linear model univariate procedure was employed to analyze the collected data. Breed, the interaction effect between breed and season of birth as well as the interaction effect between breed and type of birth all exerted very high significant effect (P<0.001) on live weight at all age groups. Breed type affected pre-weaning average daily weight gain significantly (P<0.01). Pre-weaning average daily weight gain of Washera (70 g/day) was found much better performance than 60 g/day of Gumuz. Breed type exerts significant (P<0.05) effect on age at first lambing, lambing interval, annual reproductive rate and number of lambs born per ewe life time. Average age at first lambing and lambing interval of Washera sheep were 11.69 months and 9.27 months, respectively. The corresponding values for Gumuz sheep were 12.51 months and 10.43 months, respectively. Production and reproduction performance values of traits varied across the two breeds and sexes as well. These values can be used to set up breeding objectives or goals for selective breeding of sheep giving special emphasis to growth traits believed to have medium heritability values."
https://openalex.org/W3186316771,"To assess the effects of a novel mass media intervention in increasing media reports on salt and health by involving media reporters in a scientifically well designed salt reduction trial.We recruited and trained 66 media reporters in Changzhi, Shanxi province, China to conduct a randomized controlled trial on blood pressure lowering effect of salt substitute in Dec, 2012 and Jan 2013 among their own relatives or friends (253 from 129 families in the salt substitute arm and 263 from 133 families in the control arm for two months). We shared trial results and other information on salt and health with the reporters within a month after the trial. We monitored all local newspapers for the number of relevant articles in 3 months before, 3 months during and 3 months after the intervention and at the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 48th months after the intervention. Additionally, we conducted two independent surveys on knowledge, belief and behaviours of salt and health among local citizens before and after the intervention.As expected, systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly more in the salt substitute than the control group (-4.7±11.0 mmHg vs -2.6±10.3 mmHg, p<0.001) in the randomized trial. The monthly mean number of relevant articles increased from 0.7 before to 1.7 during (p = 0.263), and further to 6.0 after the intervention (p<0.001), and varied from 2 (p = 0.170) to 4 (p = 0.008) from the 6th to 48th month; the awareness of knowledge on salt and health among local citizens improved significantly after the intervention.Media reporters' participation in a well-designed salt reduction trial significantly increased the number of relevant media reports, and the effect was sustained for a prolonged period. Future mass media public health education programs should consider this innovative strategy for better and sustained impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3187019700,"In humans, GART [phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.2) / phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase (EC 6.3.4.13) / phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase (EC 6.3.3.1)] is a trifunctional protein which catalyzes the second, third, and fifth reactions of the ten step de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) pathway. The second step of DNPS is conversion of phosphoribosylamine (5-PRA) to glycineamide ribonucleotide (GAR). 5-PRA is extremely unstable under physiological conditions and is unlikely to accumulate in the absence of GART activity. Recently, a HeLa cell line null mutant for GART was constructed via CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. This cell line, crGART, is an important cellular model of DNPS inactivation that does not accumulate DNPS pathway intermediates. In the current study, we characterized the crGART versus HeLa transcriptomes in purine-supplemented and purine-depleted growth conditions. We observed multiple transcriptome changes and discuss pathways and ontologies particularly relevant to Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome. We selected the Cluster of Differentiation (CD36) gene for initial analysis based on its elevated expression in crGART versus HeLa as well as its high basal expression, high log2 value, and minimal P-value."
https://openalex.org/W3183158123,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen with an arsenal of virulence factors and a propensity to acquire antibiotic resistance genes. The understanding of the global epidemiology of S. aureus through the use of various typing methods is important in the detection and tracking of novel and epidemic clones in countries and regions. However, detailed information on antibiotic resistance and virulence genes of S. aureus, and its population structure is still limited in Africa. In this study, S. aureus isolates collected in South Africa (n = 38) and Nigeria (n = 2) from 2001-2004 were characterized by spa typing and DNA microarray. The combination of these two methods classified the isolates into seven spa types and three clonal complexes (CCs) i.e. t064-CC8 (n = 17), t037-CC8 (n = 8), t1257-CC8 (n = 6), t045-CC5 (n = 5), t951-CC8 (n = 1), t2723-CC88 (n = 1), t6238-CC8 (n = 1), and untypeable-CC8 (n = 1). A high percentage agreement (>95%) and kappa coefficient (>0.60) was largely observed with antibiotic susceptibility testing and DNA microarray, indicating substantial agreement. Some antibiotic and virulence gene markers were associated with specific clones. The detection of the collagen-binding adhesion (cna) gene was unique for t037-CC8-MRSA while the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc) and staphylococcal complement inhibitor (scn) gene were identified with t045-CC5-MRSA. Moreover, the combination of genes encoding enterotoxins (entA, entB, entK, entQ) was noted with most of the CC8 isolates. The t045-CC5-MRSA clone was positive for the mercury resistance (mer) operon. DNA microarray provides information on antibiotic resistance and virulence gene determinants and can be a useful tool to identify gene markers for specific S. aureus clones in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3183800258,"Many studies have explored patients' experiences of dialysis and other treatments for kidney failure. This is the first qualitative multi-site international study of how staff perceive the process of a patient's transition from peritoneal dialysis to in-centre haemodialysis. Current literature suggests that transitions are poorly coordinated and may result in increased patient morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to understand staff perspectives of transition and to identify areas where clinical practice could be improved.Sixty-one participants (24 UK and 37 Australia), representing a cross-section of kidney care staff, took part in seven focus groups and sixteen interviews. Data were analysed inductively and findings were synthesised across the two countries.For staff, good clinical practice included: effective communication with patients, well planned care pathways and continuity of care. However, staff felt that how they communicated with patients about the treatment journey could be improved. Staff worried they inadvertently made patients fear haemodialysis when trying to explain to them why going onto peritoneal dialysis first is a good option. Despite staff efforts to make transitions smooth, good continuity of care between modalities was only reported in some of the Australian hospitals where, unlike the UK, patients kept the same consultant. Timely access to an appropriate service, such as a psychologist or social worker, was not always available when staff felt it would be beneficial for the patient. Staff were aware of a disparity in access to kidney care and other healthcare professional services between some patient groups, especially those living in remote areas. This was often put down to the lack of funding and capacity within each hospital.This research found that continuity of care between modalities was valued by staff but did not always happen. It also highlighted a number of areas for consideration when developing ways to improve care and provide appropriate support to patients as they transition from peritoneal dialysis to in-centre haemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W3184088912,"Oscillatory neural activities are prevalent in the brain with their phase realignment contributing to the coordination of neural communication. Phase realignments may have especially strong (or weak) impact when neural activities are strongly synchronized (or desynchronized) within the interacting populations. We report that the spatiotemporal dynamics of strong regional synchronization measured as maximal EEG spectral power-referred to as activation-and strong regional desynchronization measured as minimal EEG spectral power-referred to as suppression-are characterized by the spatial segregation of small-scale and large-scale networks. Specifically, small-scale spectral-power activations and suppressions involving only 2-7% (1-4 of 60) of EEG scalp sites were prolonged (relative to stochastic dynamics) and consistently co-localized in a frequency specific manner. For example, the small-scale networks for θ, α, β1, and β2 bands (4-30 Hz) consistently included frontal sites when the eyes were closed, whereas the small-scale network for γ band (31-55 Hz) consistently clustered in medial-central-posterior sites whether the eyes were open or closed. Large-scale activations and suppressions involving over 17-30% (10-18 of 60) of EEG sites were also prolonged and generally clustered in regions complementary to where small-scale activations and suppressions clustered. In contrast, intermediate-scale activations and suppressions (involving 7-17% of EEG sites) tended to follow stochastic dynamics and were less consistently localized. These results suggest that strong synchronizations and desynchronizations tend to occur in small-scale and large-scale networks that are spatially segregated and frequency specific. These synchronization networks may broadly segregate the relatively independent and highly cooperative oscillatory processes while phase realignments fine-tune the network configurations based on behavioral demands."
https://openalex.org/W3184208099,"Residents in difficulty are a major cause for concern in medical education, with a prevalence of 7-15%. They are often detected late in their training and cannot make use of remediation plans. Nowadays, most training hospitals in Switzerland do not have a specific program to identify and manage residents in difficulty. The aim of the study was to explore the challenges perceived by physicians regarding the process of identifying, diagnosing, and supporting residents in difficulty in a structured and programmatic way. We explored perceptions of physicians at different hierarchical levels (residents (R), Chief residents (CR), attending physicians (A), Chief Physician (CP)) in order to better understand these challenges.We conducted an exploratory qualitative study between December 2015 and July 2016. We asked volunteers from the Primary Care Division of the Geneva University Hospitals to partake to three focus groups (with CR, A, R) and one interview with the division's CP. We transcribed, coded, and qualitatively analyzed the three focus groups and the interview, using a content thematic approach and Fishbein's conceptual framework.We identified similarities and differences in the challenges of the management of residents in difficulty on a programmatic way amongst physicians of different hierarchical levels. Our main findings: Supervisors (CR, A, CP) have good identification skills of residents in difficulty, but they did not put in place systematic remediation strategies.Supervisors (CR, A) were concerned about managing residents in difficulty. They were aware of the possible adverse effects on patient care, but ""feared to harm"" resident's career by documenting a poor institutional assessment.Residents ""feared to share"" their own difficulties with their supervisors. They thought that it would impact their career negatively.The four physician's hierarchical level reported environmental constraints (lack of funding, time constraint, lack of time and resources…).Our results add two perspectives to specialized recommendations regarding the implementation of remediation programs for residents in difficulty. The first revolves around the need to identify and fully understand not only the beliefs but also the implicit norms and the feeling of self-efficacy that are shared by teachers and that are likely to motivate them to engage in the management of residents in difficulty. The second emphasizes the importance of analyzing these elements that constitute the context for a change and of identifying, in close contact with the heads of the institutions, which factors may favor or hinder it. This research action process has fostered awareness and discussions at different levels. Since then, various actions and processes have been put in place at the Faculty of Medicine in Geneva."

Iron-deficiency among pre-school children have been documented, however, studies evaluating the impact of immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype responses among iron-fortified pre-school children in malaria endemic communities has not been assessed. We evaluated the impact of iron fortification on the IgG responses to GLURP R0, GLURP R2 and MSP3 FVO malaria-specific antigens among pre-school children in malaria endemic areas.This community-based, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cluster-randomized trial study was conducted in Wenchi Municipal and Tain District of Bono Region. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov-registered trial (Identifier: NCT01001871). Ethical approval was obtained and informed consent were sought from each participant parents/guardian. For the current objective, 871 children aged 6-35 months were screened, from which 435 children received semi-liquid home-made meals mixed with 12.5 mg of iron daily (intervention group), and 436 received micronutrient powder without iron (placebo group) for 5 months. Standardized clinical and epidemiological questionnaires were administered and blood samples taken to measure IgG responses to GLURP R0, GLURP R2 and MSP3 FVO recombinant antigens using the Afro Immunoassay (AIA) protocol.Baseline anthropometry, malaria diagnosis, anaemia and iron status, demographic features and dietary intake were identical among the groups (p > 0.05). After the intervention, there was no significant difference in the IgG response against GLUP R0, GLUP R2 and MSP3 FVO between the iron-containing micronutrient and placebo groups (p > 0.05). The iron-containing micronutrient powder group who were iron-sufficient or iron replete had significantly higher IgG response to GLURP R0 and GLURP R2 compared to iron-deficient and iron-deficiency anaemia in the same group (p < 0.05). The IgG responses to all the three malaria specific antigens were low among children without malaria episode but high among those with two and four episodes due to exposure differences.Iron fortification did not influence antibody response against endogenous malaria specific antigens among pre-school children in malaria endemic areas, however, IgG response to malaria specific antigens were high among children with sufficient iron status."
https://openalex.org/W3186075635,"Suicide is a global public health issue. Several environmental, psychosocial, behavioral factors along with physical, sexual, and emotional abuse have been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts. Childhood physical, sexual abuse, and health risk behaviors are also associated with suicidal attempts. The suicidal ideation prevalence varied from 1 to 20% and it varied with study population, geography, age group, gender, and other factors. The Beck suicidal ideation scale is an effective tool for assessing the major suicidal ideation with a six cut-off score.160 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into this cross-sectional study after random sampling among the patients visiting the Psychiatric OPD of Shree Birendra Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. The Semi-Structured Interview Schedule (SSIS), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), and Kuppuswamy's Scale were used to collect the data from the patients enrolled in the study. The Chi-square test and binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify and differentiate the factors associated with high suicidal risk.Out of total 160 patients, 65% (n = 104) were female, 92.5% (n = 148) were married, 61.9% (n = 99) were residing in urban area, 93.1% (n = 148) were Hindus, 74.4% (n = 119) patients were living in the nuclear family, 5% (n = 8) patients had family history of psychiatric illness and 10.6% (n = 17) patients were using the substance of abuse. In the Beck scale for suicidal ideation questionnaire, 87.5% (n = 140) patients had moderate to strong wish to live, 89.4% (n = 143) patients responded as they would take precautions to save a life, 88.8% (n = 142) patients had such ideation/wish for brief, 96.3% (n = 154) had not considered for specificity/planning of contemplated suicidal attempt, 91.9% (n = 147) patients stated that they would not attempt active suicide because of a deterrent example from family, religion, irreversibility of the act and 98.1% (n = 157) patients had revealed ideas of deception/concealment of contemplated suicide openly. 16.9% (n = 27) of participants were categorized as high risk for suicide while 83.1% (n = 133) patients were as a low-risk category for suicide based on the Beck scale for suicidal ideation scoring.In conclusion, this study found that most of the suicidal attempts were done as an act of impulse and it is higher among female and married individuals residing in the urban areas. This study did not establish any statistically significant association or differences among independent variables with the higher risk scoring in the Beck suicidal ideation scale."
https://openalex.org/W3184275368,"The bacterium Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) swims in viscous fluids by rotating several helical flagellar filaments, which are gathered in a bundle behind the cell during ‘runs’ wherein the cell moves steadily forward. In between runs, the cell undergoes quick ‘tumble’ events, during which at least one flagellum reverses its rotation direction and separates from the bundle, resulting in erratic motion in place and a random reorientation of the cell. Alternating between runs and tumbles allows cells to sample space by stochastically changing their propulsion direction after each tumble. The change of direction during a tumble is not uniformly distributed but is skewed towards smaller angles with an average of about 62°–68°, as first measured by Berg and Brown (1972). Here we develop a theoretical approach to model the angular distribution of swimming E. coli cells during tumbles. We first use past experimental imaging results to construct a kinematic description of the dynamics of the flagellar filaments during a tumble. We then employ low-Reynolds number hydrodynamics to compute the consequences of the kinematic model on the force and torque balance of the cell and to deduce the overall change in orientation. The results of our model are in good agreement with experimental observations. We find that the main change of direction occurs during the ‘bundling’ part of the process wherein, at the end of a tumble, the dispersed flagellar filaments are brought back together in the helical bundle, which we confirm using a simplified forced-sphere model."

https://openalex.org/W3185149922,"This paper offers an economic model of the operation of multi-level marketing (MLM) firms in competitive and non-competitive markets. The model takes a recursive approach to analyse decision making at the distributor level in order to understand basic issues in the MLM market and firm structure. Specifically, it is shown that under reasonable assumptions MLM firms will have a limited structure. In cases where commissions increase with the number of levels, MLM firms will include no more than six to nine levels in equilibrium. In cases of fixed commissions, market conditions dictate a cap on the number of distributors. These conditions imply a limited ""multi-level"" structure. They also imply that the revenues of the median distributor are mainly a result of direct sales and not a result of commissions. The model also suggests that MLM firms will only arise where marketing costs are substantial, and that it is primarily individuals with small outside offers who choose to become distributors. Finally, the model provides a formula that calculates market prices for a monopoly MLM firm."
https://openalex.org/W3185831395,"It was shown that single repetition, contraction-phase specific and total time-under-tension (TUT) can be extracted reliably and validly from smartphone accelerometer-derived data of resistance exercise machines using user-determined resistance exercise velocities at 60% one repetition maximum (1-RM). However, it remained unclear how robust the extraction of these mechano-biological descriptors is over a wide range of movement velocities (slow- versus fast-movement velocity) and intensities (30% 1-RM versus 80% 1-RM) that reflect the interindividual variability during resistance exercise.In this work, we examined whether the manipulation of velocity or intensity would disrupt an algorithmic extraction of single repetitions, contraction-phase specific and total TUT.Twenty-seven participants performed four sets of three repetitions of their 30% and 80% 1-RM with velocities of 1 s, 2 s, 6 s and 8 s per repetition, respectively. An algorithm extracted the number of repetitions, single repetition, contraction-phase specific and total TUT. All exercises were video-recorded. The video recordings served as the gold standard to which algorithmically-derived TUT was compared. The agreement between the methods was examined using Limits of Agreement (LoA). The Pearson correlation coefficients were used to calculate the association, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2.1) examined the interrater reliability.The calculated error rate for the algorithmic detection of the number of single repetitions derived from two smartphones accelerometers was 1.9%. The comparison between algorithmically-derived, contraction-phase specific TUT against video, revealed a high degree of correlation (r > 0.94) for both exercise machines. The agreement between the two methods was high on both exercise machines, intensities and velocities and was as follows: LoA ranged from -0.21 to 0.22 seconds for single repetition TUT (2.57% of mean TUT), from -0.24 to 0.22 seconds for concentric contraction TUT (6.25% of mean TUT), from -0.22 to 0.24 seconds for eccentric contraction TUT (5.52% of mean TUT) and from -1.97 to 1.00 seconds for total TUT (5.13% of mean TUT). Interrater reliability for single repetition, contraction-phase specific TUT was high (ICC > 0.99).Neither intensity nor velocity disrupts the proposed algorithmic data extraction approach. Therefore, smartphone accelerometers can be used to extract scientific mechano-biological descriptors of dynamic resistance exercise with intensities ranging from 30% to 80% of the 1-RM with velocities ranging from 1 s to 8 s per repetition, respectively, thus making this simple method a reliable tool for resistance exercise mechano-biological descriptors extraction."

The metabolites contributing to the medicinal properties of H . hemerocallidea have been identified in several studies and, more recently, the active terpenoids of the plant were profiled. However, the biosynthetic pathways and the enzymes involved in the production of the terpene metabolites in H . hemerocallidea have not been characterised at a transcriptomic or proteomic level. In this study, total RNA extracted from the corm, leaf and flower tissues of H . hemerocallidea was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A total of 143,549 transcripts were assembled de novo using Trinity and 107,131 transcripts were functionally annotated using the nr, GO, COG, KEGG and SWISS-PROT databases. Additionally, the proteome of the three tissues were sequenced using LC-MS/MS, revealing aspects of secondary metabolism and serving as data validation for the transcriptome. Functional annotation led to the identification of numerous terpene synthases such as nerolidol synthase, germacrene D synthase, and cycloartenol synthase amongst others. Annotations also revealed a transcript encoding the terpene synthase phytoalexin momilactone A synthase. Differential expression analysis using edgeR identified 946 transcripts differentially expressed between the three tissues and revealed that the leaf upregulates linalool synthase compared to the corm and the flower tissues. The transcriptome as well as the proteome of Hypoxis hemerocallidea presented here provide a foundation for future research."
