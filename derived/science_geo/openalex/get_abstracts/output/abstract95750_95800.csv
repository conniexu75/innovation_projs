https://openalex.org/W1549922475,"Abstract Lubricating glycoprotein-I (LGP-I) was prepared from bovine synovial fluid by density gradient sedimentation and gel-permeation chromatography. The LGP-I sample obtained was able to lubricate articular cartilage in a manner equivalent to that of whole synovial fluid. Chemical, physical, and electron microscope measurements were carried out to determine the structure of the LGP-I molecules. The molecular weight calculated from sedimentation equilibrium measurements was 2 X 10(5), and the solute distribution obtained indicated that LGP-I was relatively monodisperse. The s(0)20,w value was 4.84, and the intrinsic viscosity was 92 ml/g. The molecular weight and diffusion coefficient calculated from later light-scattering measurements was 2.06 x 10(5) and 1.10 x 10(-7) cm2/s, respectively. The electron microscope measurements showed that the LGP-I molecules had a number average length of 204 nm, a weight average length of 222 nm (with a standard deviation of 54 nm), and a width of 1-2 nm. These data and the kinked appearance of the molecules indicate that LGP-I is a partially extended flexible rod. The hydrodynamic measurements also indicate that LGP-I has the same structure in solution, although the apparently high s(0)20,w value, compared to other rod-like molecules, suggests that due to its flexibility LGP-I can occupy a more compact domain than would be expected based on its extended dimensions. The name of lubricin is suggested for this lubricating glycoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W2105035591,"Electrolectin, a beta-D-galactoside binding lectin, has been isolated from the electric organ of the electric eel Electrophorus electricus. Electrolectin is purified 1000-fold with a yield of 10 mg/kg of tissue by steps including low speed centrifugation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and affinity chromatography on a lactosyl-Sepharose column. Electrolectin is a dimer composed of two subunits. The molecular weight of the monomer is around 16,500 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and amino acid analysis. The molecular weight of the dimer determined by equilibrium sedimentation is 32,500 +/- 750. The electrolectin monomer is composed of 144 amino acids and 2.2 +/- 0.45 carbohydrate. It contains one tryptophan but cysteine and metals are absent. The exposure of electrolectin to O2 destroys its hemagglutination activity, abolishes its UV fluorescence and shifts its UV absorption maximum from 287 nm to 250 nm. The oxidation of tryptophan to oxindole is prevented by lactose. The strict requirement of reducing agents for the maintenance of electrolectin agglutination activity is explained by the need to prevent the oxidation of a tryptophan residue in the lactose-binding site. The quantum yields of electrolectin and its complex with lactose are pH dependent and reach a maximal value of 0.4 at neutral pH. The binding constant of lactose to electrolectin is also pH dependent. These data and their temperature dependence stress the important contribution of ionizable groups in the binding of lactose. The latter stabilizes the dimeric structure of electrolectin."

When these cells are placed in serum-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium devoid of glucose, there is a rapid cessation of the synthesis of the usual Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 lipid-linked oligosaccharide and the accumulation of a smaller species with the composition Man9GlcNAc2. This latter compound is the glucosylated and transferred to protein where it is subsequently processed. These findings demonstrate that Chinese hamster ovary cells utilize an alternate glycosylation pathway when deprived of glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1485202534,"Incubation of AtT-20/D-1 mouse pituitary tumor cells with glucocorticoids leads to a progressive diminution in the number of cellular glucocorticoid receptors. Control incubations demonstrate that non-glucocorticoids don't cause this depletion and that the decrease is not due to deleterious alterations in the incubation medium or degradation of the steroid. Incubation of cells with 0.5 micrograms/ml of cycloheximide alone does not dramatically diminish receptor content. However, incubation of cells with both cycloheximide and dexamethasone results in receptor depletion, suggesting that depletion involves enhanced receptor degradation. The cell's ability to bind glucocorticoids can be regenerated by a 24- to 48-h incubation in steroid-free medium. However, unlike the depletion step, the repletion process is sensitive to cycloheximide."

The complete amino acid sequence of chicken hepatic lectin has been established by analysis of peptides generated by chemical cleavage at methionine or tryptophan residues. Larger BrCN fragments were further digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and clostripain. All sequences were determined by automated sequential Edman degradation. Extensive use was made of high performance liquid chromatography in the purification of peptides and identification of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of amino acids. The complete sequence is: (formula: see text). The stretch of uncharged amino acids from residue 25 to 48 is a possible membrane-interaction region. Carbohydrate is attached to residue 67."
https://openalex.org/W1580057573,"Kinetic and binding studies were performed with a purified microsomal cytochrome P-450 from neonatal pig testis, the C21 side chain cleavage system (17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase). Binding of substrates and inhibitors was measured by spectral methods and by equilibrium dialysis. Kinetic data revealed that pregnenolone inhibits lyase activity with 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone as substrate (Ki, 0.3 microM) and that progesterone inhibits lyase activity with 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (Ki, 1.5 microM); inhibition is competitive in both cases. Binding and kinetic studies revealed that Km, Ks, and Kd (Michaelis constant and dissociation constants determined by spectral and dialysis methods, respectively) are all considerably lower for the delta 5 substrates than for the corresponding delta 4 compounds. Equilibrium dialysis shows that there is a single binding site for the substrates of both activities (hydroxylase and lyase). Spectral studies revealed a lag in the development of the spectral shift produced by the addition of steroids and gave results compatible with a single active site, although this spectral evidence is not conclusive by itself. It is concluded that (i) the powerful forward competitive inhibition by pregnenolone and progesterone may be important in regulating synthesis of androgens in vivo; (ii) the porcine enzyme uses delta 5 substrates in preference to delta 4 substrates, thereby accounting for extensive use of the delta 5 pathway by pig testis in vivo; (iii) the evidence presented suggests one active site for both hydroxylase and lyase activities."

https://openalex.org/W1591608900,"Rat intermediate pituitary cells maintained in culture synthesize the same forms of beta-endorphin observed in intermediate pituitary extracts. Biosynthetically labeled intermediate pituitary beta-endorphin-sized material was fractionated by ion exchange chromatography on sulfopropyl-Sephadex and the identities of the major peaks were determined by co-chromatography with synthetic marker peptides, gel filtration, and analysis of pronase, chymotrypsin, and trypsin digests. Peaks of alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-27), alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-31), and beta-endorphin(1-31) were identified and a fourth peak (eluting from the sulfopropyl-Sephadex column at 0.18 M NaCl) was tentatively identified as alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-26). Analysis of beta-endorphin synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine and [3H]histidine confirmed the absence of His in the material eluting at 0.18 M NaCl. Based on both steady labeling and pulse-chase incubations, beta-endorphin(1-31) was the first form of labeled beta-endorphin-sized material to appear in cell extracts. This molecule was quickly N-acetylated on its NH2-terminal tyrosine residue and was then more slowly converted to alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-27) and then to alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-26)."
https://openalex.org/W1592749118,"Addition of CaCl2 (0.4 mM) to GH3 cells incubated in a serum-free, Ca2+-free medium increased relative prolactin synthesis (prolactin synthesis/total protein synthesis) 7- to 150-fold by 3-4 days, but had no effect on relative growth hormone synthesis. Half-maximal and maximal stimulation of relative prolactin synthesis occurred at about 0.07 and 0.2 mM CaCl2, respectively. Neither MgCl2 (0.4 mM) nor KCl 0.4 mM) affected relative prolactin synthesis. 32P-labeled rat prolactin and growth hormone cDNA plasmids were employed to measure by RNA gel blot hybridization changes in cytoplasmic levels of the corresponding mRNA sequences. Both prolactin mRNA sequence levels and translatable prolactin mRNA increased in parallel with the CaCl2-induced increase in relative prolactin synthesis. CaCl2 increased prolactin mRNA sequences by 7- to 200-fold, without affecting growth hormone mRNA sequence levels. Dexamethasone (100 nM) decreased prolactin mRNA sequences in cells incubated with CaCl2, antagonized the CaCl2-induced increases in prolactin mRNA sequences independently of the CaCl2 concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1918714512,"Abstract Submitochondrial particles from beef heart mitochondria synthesize ADP-arsenate from ADP and arsenate when energized by succinate. The ADP-arsenate formed hydrolyzes rapidly and this is almost certainly the mechanism by which arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. When sufficient hexokinase is present, a substantial portion of the ADP-arsenate formed reacts with glucose to form glucose 6-arsenate and ADP. The glucose 6-arsenate thus formed hydrolyzes, at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C, under the conditions used, with a rate constant of 5.5 X 10(-4) s-1 and is a substrate for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1513558075,"An enzyme fraction which specifically catalyzes the formation of methylglyoxal from dihydroxyacetone phosphate has been isolated and partially purified from goat liver. The enzyme fraction appears to be substantially free from glyoxalase I, reduced glutathione, and triosephosphate isomerase. Approximately equimolar quantities of methylglyoxal and inorganic phosphate were obtained from dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Formation of methylglyoxal was confirmed by colorimetric and enzymatic estimations as well as by paper chromatography and its spectrum. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxyacetone, and glyceraldehyde, failed to act as substrates. The enzyme is inhibited by some phosphorylated compounds and inorganic phosphates."

https://openalex.org/W157671821,"The relationship between the electrochemical proton gradient (delta mu-H+) and the electrochemical gradient for biogenic amines (delta mu-A) was investigated in isolated chromaffin ghosts free of endogenous components and gradients. The addition of ATP to a ghost suspension resulted in the generation of a large proton concentration gradient (delta pH), acidic inside (measured by [14C]-methylamine distribution), and a large proton electrical gradient (delta psi), positive inside (measured by [14C]-thiocyanate distribution). In the presence of this large electrochemical proton gradient, the accumulation of [14C]5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and other biogenic amines rapidly reached an apparent steady state level. Collapse of the proton gradients after steady state levels were achieved resulted in the efflux of the accumulated amines. Uptake in the presence of a delta psi alone produced an amine gradient equal to the magnitude of the delta psi, while in the presence of a delta pH alone biogenic amine distribution was equal to twice the magnitude of the delta pH. Using additions of ammonia or thiocyanate, it was possible to vary the magnitude of the electrochemical proton gradient over a wide range of values; the driving force for amine accumulation under these conditions was found to be equal to delta psi--2Z delta pH (where Z = 2.3 RT/F). The results, which provide unequivocal evidence for the primary role of the electrochemical proton gradient in the active transport of biogenic amines, are consistent with a model based on the chemiosmotic hypothesis, of an obligatory coupling of amine influx and proton efflux, mediated via a putative reserpine-sensitive translocator. Measurement of the stoichiometry of this coupling of H+ and amines permits conclusions concerning the molecular mechanism of amino accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1500557103,"The chemical specificity of the colchicine-binding site of tubulin is less stringent for the presence of the B-ring than the A- and C-rings of colchicine, Colchicine analogues with modifications in the B-ring bind to tubulin at the same site as colchicine. Analogues with smaller or no substituents in the B-ring bind tubulin remarkably faster than colchicine. Thus, a compound without the B-ring [2-methoxy-5-(2',3',4'-trimethoxyphenyl)tropone] binds tubulin even at 4 degrees C and the binding is almost instantaneous at 37 degrees C. Colcemid and 2-methoxy-5-(2',3',4'-trimethoxyphenyl)tropone bind reversibly to tubulin, whereas colchicine and desacetamidocolchicine bind almost irreversibly, suggesting that the size of the B-ring moiety of colchicine is not related to the reversibility of binding. We conclude that although the presence of the B-ring of colchicine does not appear to be an essential prerequisite for the drug-tubulin interaction, the B-ring substituents play an important role in determining the binding properties of colchicine to tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W1518379018,"The use of phase-sensitive fluorescence spectroscopy is described for the resolution of heterogeneous fluorescence from a protein and from fluorophore mixtures which model heterogeneous protein fluorescence. This new method permits direct recording of the individual emission spectra of each fluorophore in a two-component mixture or the determination of the lifetime of each species in the mixture. A phase fluorometer is used, modified only by addition of a phase-sensitive detector. To model multi-tryptophan proteins, we examined a mixture of indole and 2,3-dimethylindole. The lifetimes and emission spectra of these fluorophores differ. Choice of the detector phase angle to be out of phase with one component results in a phase-sensitive emission spectrum which precisely superimposes with the steady state emission spectrum of the second unsuppressed component. In addition, heterogeneity of the fluorescence emission is readily revealed by the phase-sensitive emission spectra. For a single compound, or more properly, a single decay rate, the emission maximum is independent of detector phase angle. In contrast a marked dependence on detector phase was observed for the mixture. We also examined a mixture of tyrosine and tryptophan derivatives. In this instance, we used phase-sensitive emission spectra to determine the lifetime of each fluorophore in the mixture. These lifetimes were determined from the detector phase angles necessary to match the phase-sensitive emission spectra with the steady state spectra of either tyrosine or tryptophan. In a similar manner, we recorded directly the emission spectra of the tyrosine or tryptophan residues from denatured human serum albumin and thereby determined the lifetimes of these spectral components. Phase-sensitive fluorescence spectra depend upon both the lifetimes and spectral distributions of each species in a heterogeneous mixture, and thereby provide a practical and powerful approach for the analysis of fluorescence emission from heterogeneous samples. Fluorescence spectroscopic methods are widely used in investigations of proteins, membranes, and other more complex biological systems. Frequently, interpretation of fluorescence data is hindered by the presence of multiple emissions. Several compounds may be fluorescent or a single compound may be present in more than one environment. Examples of heterogeneous emissions are numerous and include fluorescence * This work was supported by Grant PCM 78-16706 from the National Science Foundation.

https://openalex.org/W1504531652,"Membrane protein methylation was studied in intact human erythrocytes. Erythrocytes were incubated with physiological concentrations of L-[methyl]3H]methionine and incorporated 35 pmol of methyl groups into membrane components/mg of membrane protein in a 2.5-hr incubation at 37 degrees C. At least 90% of the total groups (12,500 methyl groups/cell) were incorporated into polypeptides via linkages which were labile to 1 N NaOH. Major methylated membrane polypeptides were identified based on the comigration of radioactivity with Coomassie blue- and periodic acid-Schiff-staining species in pH 2.4 dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, as well as by the distribution of radiolabel and protein following selective proteolysis and membrane extraction procedures. Methylated species identified in this way include the cytoskeletal polypeptides band 2.1 (ankyrin) and band 4.1, as well as the band 3 anion transport protein. Other methylated species include an intrinsic polypeptide comigrating with band 3 but insensitive to external chymotrypsin digestion, a glycoprotein showing variable migration in this gel system (40,000-55,000 daltons), an intrinsic polypeptide at about 30,000 daltons, and an extrinsic species of about 17,000 daltons. A small amount of radioactivity comigrated with the band 4.5 region. Bands 1, 2, 4.2, 5, 6, 7, and the major sialoglycoprotein were not methylated in this system. All of the methylated species exhibited turnover in vivo, and the time taken to reach 50% demethylation for each species ranged from less than 2 to 29 h."
https://openalex.org/W1578048699,"Studies are elaborated on regulation of acetylcholinesterase activity by nerve growth factor (NGF) in cultures of clonal PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Acetylcholinesterase specific activity in these cultures is maximally and half-maximally increased by NGF concentrations of approximately 1-1.5 and 0.5 nM, respectively. These increases are blocked by antiserum to NGF and are neither mimicked nor significantly altered by epidermal growth factor (1-1000 ng/ml), dexamethasone (10 microM), or dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM). The action of NGF on acetylcholinesterase activity is abolished by low concentrations of the inhibitors of RNA synthesis, camptothecin and actinomycin D. Such findings indicate a transcriptional requirement for this effect of NGF. A series of PC12 variants were employed that in serum-containing medium do not show normal PC12 responses to NGF such as cessation of proliferation and neurite outgrowth. Each of the variants exhibited NGF-dependent increases in acetylcholinesterase specific activity. This suggests that the effects of NGF on regulation of acetylcholinesterase activity can be dissociated from the effects of the factor on neurite outgrowth and proliferation, and that NGF may therefore work via parallel or branching pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1547049042,"The NH2-terminal sialoglycopeptides from human erythrocyte glycophorin A have been obtained by specific proteolytic cleavage and gel filtration chromatography. By cyanogen bromide cleavage, a glycosylated octapeptide was obtained from blood group M donors having an amino acid composition and 13C NMR spectrum consistent with the structure (formula: see text) was demonstrated. By Staphylococcus aureus protease cleavage, a glycosylated pentapeptide was obtained from N donors having the same structure as II, without the carboxyl-terminal sequence Val . Ala . Hse. Methanolysis/gas chromatographic analysis and 13C NMR spectroscopy of I and II and their asialo derivatives reveal that the M- and N-active sialoglyco-octapeptides both have identical oligosaccharide structures, each containing three O-linked tetrasaccharides with the structure NeuNAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3(NeuNAc alpha 2-6)GalNAc alpha 1-O-Ser(Thr). The demonstration of the anomeric form of GalNAc-peptide linkages revealed by 13C NMR has previously been inaccessible by chemical analysis. Conformationally, I and II appear identical and both manifest several unusual resonance shifts suggestive of a glycopeptide secondary structure involving four specific hydrogen bonds. Calcium ion titration was also found to induce shifts in the NeuNAc 13C resonances that may be of functional significance. Serological studies reveal that both the M and N glyco-octapeptides and the N glyco-pentapeptide retain all of the M and N activity of the parent structure. Deamination and/or desialylation completely destroys this activity. These data are consistent with a model in which the M or N determinant is the NH2-terminal amino acid and a NeuNAc residue(s). From these data it is concluded that there is no chemical basis for assertions in the literature that M and N antigens differ in their oligosaccharide structure or that the N antigen is biosynthetically transformed to the M antigen by sialylation."
https://openalex.org/W1584098714,"The half-life (t 1/2) of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase of Chinese hamster ovary cells grown in fetal calf serum medium is approximately 2 h. When cells are switched to grow in delipidated serum medium (DeL-M) for more than 24 h, the t 1/2 of the enzyme is found to be drastically altered to approximately 13 h. Exposure of low density lipoprotein (LDL) (100 micrograms of protein/ml) or 25-hydroxycholesterol (1 microgram/ml) to cells grown in DeL-M suppresses reductase activity more rapidly than would be expected solely if reductase synthesis were suppressed, showing that inactivation of reductase activity by sterols, previously demonstrated using only analogs of cholesterol, is a normal mechanism for regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity by the physiologically important sterol source (LDL). This inactivation effect by LDL or by 25-hydroxycholesterol is shown to be at least in part due to acceleration of reductase degradation rate. Furthermore, the inactivation effect by sterols is shown to be largely abolished if cycloheximide (250 micrograms/ml) is added simultaneously to the growth medium, indicating that continuous synthesis of a class of mediator protein(s) is necessary in mediating the effect of LDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol. Two different protein synthesis inhibitors (emetine and puromycin) were used and gave essentially identical results. Preincubation of cell culture with cycloheximide for 2 h essentially completely abolishes the effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol, indicating that the mediator protein(s) turns over rapidly, with t 1/2 less than 3 or 4 h."
https://openalex.org/W1494762484,"Only the lecithin in the outer leaflet (representing 70% of the total) of egg lecithin unilamellar vesicles is hydrolyzed by Crotalus atrox phospholipase A2. Hydrolyzed vesicles remain intact and impermeable to ionic solutes. The fatty acids produced in the hydrolysis remain on the vesicle and are only partially ionized at neutral pH due to electrostatic repulsions. About 40% of the lysolecithin product is desorbed from the vesicle. In the presence of a large excess of bovine serum albumin, the reaction is first order with respect to both the enzyme and the substrate. At 21 degrees C, pH 7.2, I = 0.16 M, and [Ca2+] = 7 mM, the second order rate constant is kex(2) = 1.5 X 10(6) M-1 s-1. In the absence of albumin, the reaction is inhibited competitively by both the monomeric (KIm = 4.5 X 10(-8) M) and micellar (nKIa = 3.7 X 10(-7) M) forms of lysolecithin ([critical micelle concentration] = 4.3 X 10(-6) M). Bovine serum albumin complexes two molecules of lysolecithin with a dissociation constant, Kb = 5 X 10(-8) M. With substoichiometric albumin, the reaction is biphasic, and, when the albumin is saturated with lysolecithin, the kinetics become similar to those observed in the absence of albumin. The action of phospholipase A2 shows that in unilamellar vesicles there is only one major lecithin conformation in the outer leaflet, or that all conformations are rapidly interconvertible."
https://openalex.org/W1502102376,"Short oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5'-terminal sequence of reovirus mRNAs were produced in vitro by virion-associated transcriptase activity. Both capped and uncapped oligonucleotides were synthesized in molar excess relative to mRNA. Yields of uncapped oligomers including ppG-C and ppG-C-U were severalfold greater than the homologous capped structures. In partial reaction mixtures that were nonsupportive for mRNA chain elongation, capped oligomer synthesis was increased. Similarly, oligonucleotide formation was differentially resistant in viral preparations that were inactivated with respect to mRNA synthesis by modification of the genome RNA by dimethyl sulfate alkylation or psoralen photoreaction. The results suggest that reovirus mRNA synthesis involves excessive initiation by reiterative transcription of promoter sites by the reovirus polymerase. Only a small fraction of the resulting oligonucleotides are capped and extended to form full length mRNAs during a subsequent elongation step which is apparently mediated by transcriptase molecules that escape the reiterative phase of transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1593774147,"Band 3, the anion channel protein of the human erythrocyte, is the major transmembrane glycoprotein of the erythrocyte membrane. The protein is distributed in a broad 88,000-98,000-dalton band on gel electrophoresis. Previous investigations have defined an NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain and an adjacent membrane-spanning domain of the Band 3 molecule. The fragments containing these domains appear as discrete bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A carboxyl-terminal fragment of the Band 3 molecule was generated by digestion with chymotrypsin at the external face of intact erythrocytes. This fragment appears as a broad band of Mr = 34,000-45,000. It has a site accessible to lactoperoxidase at the internal face of the membrane and must, therefore, span the membrane. Slices from different regions of the broad electrophoretic band of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of Band 3 all have identical peptide maps. The same is true of Band 3. Therefore, despite their heterogeneous appearance on gels, Band 3 and its proteolytic fragments are homogeneous polypeptides. This conclusion is supported by the finding of an unique NH2-terminal tetrapeptide sequence for one Band 3 fragment. The apparent heterogeneity of Band 3 and its carboxyl-terminal region may reflect variability of glycosylation or sodium dodecyl sulfate binding."
https://openalex.org/W2111908120,"Adenosine [gamma-(S)-16O, 17O, 18O]triphosphate has been used as a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by creatine kinase, and the configuration at phosphorus in the product [16O, 17O, 18O]phosphocreatine has been determined. The reaction proceeds with inversion of the configuration, consistent with the emerging pattern of behavior among the phosphokinases. This result, coupled with recently published data from NMR, ESR, and infrared studies of ternary and quaternary complexes od creatine kinase with its substrates and inhibitors, defines the enzyme-catalyzed transphosphorylation as an associative in-line transfer of the phosphoryl group between the bound substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1521683984,"A Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant that requires both cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids for growth (Limanek, J. S., Chin, J., and Chang, T. Y. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 5452-5456) has been further characterized with respect to its dependence on cholesterol. Upon removal of serum lipids from the growth medium, the activity of the important cholesterogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding activity both increase significantly in the normal cell. Both these increases were much less in the mutant cell. Studies in vitro with NaF indicate that the differences in reductase activities between normal and mutant cells are not due to differences in activation by a dephosphorylation mechanism. Heat inactivation profiles and Km for HMG-CoA of both cell reductases were found to be identical, thus reducing the possibility that the mutant cell contains a mutation in the polypeptide chain of reductase. The fact that in lipid-deficient medium both reductase and LDL binding activities are low in the mutant strongly suggests that the expression of these activities is controlled in a coordinate manner. This conclusion is supported by parallel studies on a spontaneous revertant of the mutant in which the expression of reductase and LDL binding activities have both reverted to normal. These results indicate that the phenotypic abnormalities seen in the mutant are probably caused by a single mutation. A common factor is postulated to mediate this coordinate expression, and the function of such a factor is altered in the mutant cell."
https://openalex.org/W1567294555,"Changes in the mRNAs coding for specific hepatic proteins in male rats during aging were examined by in vitro translation of the liver mRNA in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Characterization of the [35S]methionine-labeled translation products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography showed major age-dependent changes in the hepatic concentrations of three mRNA species. The translation products of these three mRNAs were found to have Mr = 28,500, 26,300, and 19,500 and are called senescence marker proteins (SMP) 1, 2, 3, respectively. On the basis of its immunochemical reactivity, SMP-3 (Mr = 19,500) is identified as alpha 2u-globulin while the mRNAs for SMP-1 (Mr = 28,500) and SMP-2 (Mr = 26,300) code for two yet uncharacterized proteins. The liver of the prepubertal male rats was found to contain the mRNA for SMP-2 and showed almost complete absence of the mRNAs for SMP-1 and SMP-3. However, the mRNAs for both SMP-1 and SMP-3 were present in the postpubertal young adults while the mRNA for SMP-2 was absent. Finally, when the animals reached senescence, the mRNAs for SMP-1 and SMP-3 disappeared from the liver with the reappearance of the SMP-2 mRNA. Age-dependent regulation of the mRNAs for these three senescence marker proteins can serve as an important model for the study of differential gene expression during aging."
https://openalex.org/W1546821531,"We have previously reported that synthesis of phospholipids increases 4-fold at the onset of chemotactic migration during development of Dictyostelium discoideum and that the newly synthesized phospholipids are preferentially incorporated into the plasma membrane (De Silva, N. S. and Siu, C-H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8489-8496). To test the hypothesis that the rapid transfer of phospholipids to the plasma membrane is mediated by vesicles, we isolated phospholipid-rich vesicles from cells at 6 h of development. These vesicles had an average size of 0.35 micrometer in diameter. They banded at a density of 1.097 g/cm3 and they had a phospholipid: protein (w/w) ratio of 2.25. The predominant classes of phospholipids in these vesicles were phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. In pulse-labeling studies using [3H]glycerol, these low density vesicles had the highest phospholipid-specific activity, which was about 3 times higher than that of 6-h plasma membranes. Almost 80% of the incorporated radioactivity was found to be associated with phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. When cells were chased with cold precursor after pulse labeling, the specific activity of these vesicles dropped by almost 20-fold in 90 min, while plasma membranes showed a 2.5-fold increase in 60 min. Addition of colchicine to 7-h cells inhibited the translocation of newly synthesized phospholipids to the plasma membrane. The low density vesicles were found in much reduced amounts in preaggregation stage cells or the aggregateless mutant WL3. These results indicate that transfer of newly synthesized phospholipids from their site of synthesis to the plasma membrane probably occurs through a special class of phospholipid-rich vesicles."

Chloride, chlorate, and oxygen are the products of the decomposition of chlorine dioxide. The optimum pH for the enzymic of decomposition of both chlorite and chlorine dioxide is approximately pH 2.75. At this pH, 1 mole of chlorine dioxide is dismutated to 0.3 mole of chloride, 0.7 mol of chlorate, and 0.17 mole of oxygen. At the same pH, the complete decomposition of 1 mole of chlorite yields 0.4 mole of chloride, 0.6 mole of chlorate, and 0.13 mole of oxygen. During the inactivation of chloroperoxidase by chlorine dioxide, the Soret absorption band of the native enzyme is completely lost, and the enzyme becomes chlorinated. Kinetic parameters for the chlorite reaction have been determined. The Km value for chlorite obtained from various kinetic plots was about 10 mM. The catalytic rate constant for the formation of chlorine dioxide from chlorite was about 70,000 s-1."
https://openalex.org/W1497356553,"Elastin is a major protein of compliant connective tissue and is characterized by an amino acid composition abundant in nonpolar residues. The soluble precursor to elastin tropoelastin, is extractable in organic solvents and possesses an extensive clustering of nonpolar amino acid residues in the immediate NH2-terminal region (Foster, J. A., Shapiro, R., Voynow, P., Crombie, G., Faris, B., and Franzblau, C. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 857-864). It was, therefore, of special interest to determine whether tropoelastin requires a hydrophobic signal peptide for vectorial transport of the nascent polypeptide. The possibility that the initial tropoelastin translation product possesses a short signal peptide was examined in a cell-free translation system. Total RNA, isolated from aortae of 1-day-old chicks, was translated in an mRNA-dependent reticulocyte lysate translation assay. The translation products were then immunoprecipitated and subjected to automated radiosequencing. Comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of tropoelastin b synthesized in the cell-free system versus that synthesized in organ culture demonstrated the presence of a signal peptide 24 amino acid residues in length. The signal peptide sequence is as follows: Met-Arg-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-Leu-Pro-Gly-Val-Leu-Leu-Leu-Phe-Ser-Ile-Leu-Pro -Ala-Ser-Gln-Gln. The preponderance of hydrophobic amino acid residues as well as the polar residues adjacent to the initiator methionine and the carboxyl termini found in the signal peptide is similar to that reported for other secreted proteins."

https://openalex.org/W119959606,"Cytochrome P-450 functions as an oxygenase in 0 2 and NADPH-dependent substrate hydroxylations and also as a peroxygenase in a variety of peroxide-dependent substrate hydroxylation reactions. As shown previously, peroxy compounds react with the phenobarbital-induced isozyme of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 to yield an intermediate (Complex D) with an absorption maximum at about 436 nm in the difference spectrum; a transient intermediate (Complex C) is also detected spectrally but only under certain conditions. The results are in accord with a reversible two-step mechanism, P-450 + oxidant e C e D, which differs from that of peroxidases in several important respects. In the present study, the effect of toluene as a hydroxylatable substrate on the kinetics was determined. The overall reaction is as follows: toluene + cumene hydroperoxide + benzyl alcohol + cumyl alcohol. Both the rate and amplitude of absorbance changes indicative of Complex D formation were shown to be functions of the toluene concentration, whereas only the amplitude is affected by perfluorocyclohexane, a pseudosubstrate. From these results it was concluded that the change in amplitude is due to binding of the hydroxylatable or pseudosubstrate and that the effect on the rate constant is due to the hydroxylation reaction. Reaction schemes in which either Complex C o r D yields free P-450 as well as benzyl alcohol and cumyl alcohol were evaluated by computer simulation and compared with the data obtained on the toluene-dependent spectral perturbation of the system containing P-450 and cumene hydroperoxide as well as on benzyl alcohol formation. Our findings indicate that Complex C is directly involved in the hydroxylation pathway and that Complex D is produced in a nonproductive side reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1574158932,"Reticulocyte lysates contain a latent form of eukaryotic peptide chain initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) kinase (dsI) which becomes activated in the presence of double-stranded RNA and ATP and inhibits protein synthesis. The latent form of dsI has been partially purified from reticulocyte ribosomal salt wash. The purified dsI has been activated by incubation in the presence of poly(rI).poly(rC) and [gamma 32P]ATP and the activated dsI has been further purified to near homogeneity. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, purified [32P]dsI shows an intensely staining 67,000-dalton polypeptide band which corresponds to a single 67,000-dalton radioactive band. During Sephadex (G-200) gel filtration, both the latent form of dsI and the activated dsI elute similarly with a peak corresponding to a molecular weight of 67,000. Purified dsI phosphorylates the 38,000-dalton subunit of eIF-2 and, under conditions of eIF-2 phosphorylation, dsI strongly inhibits AUG-dependent Met-tRNAf binding to 40 S ribosomes. Also, in partial reactions, eIF-2 alpha (P) formed by phosphorylation of eIF-2 using dsI and ATP, is not recognized by two eIF-2 ancillary factors, Co-eIF-2B and Co-eIF-2C. These results are similar to those reported previously for the heme-regulated eIF-2 kinase (Das, A., Ralston, R. O., Grace, M., Roy, R., Ghosh-Dastidar, P., Das H. K., Yaghmai, B., Palmieri, S., and Gupta, N. K. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76,5076-5079) and suggest that dsI, like the heme-regulated eIF-2 kinase phosphorylates eIF-2 and eIF-2 alpha (P) thus formed, in both cases, is not recognized by Co-eIF-2B and Co-eIF-2C, and is inactive in some step(s) of Met-tRNAf.40 S initiation complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1556109481,"We have synthesized diisethionyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate (DIDIT), a new membrane-impermeant, cleavable protein cross-linking reagent designed for probing protein organization at one face of a membrane. Rabbit muscle aldolase were reacted in solution with DIDIT and the products were electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. When electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions, the gels contain bands corresponding to oligomers of aldolase, while pretreatment with dithiothreitol to cleave the cross-link prior to electrophoresis results in gels containing primarily the band corresponding to aldolase monomer. These experiments demonstrate that DIDIT is a cleavable protein cross-linker. Reaction of isolated human erythrocyte membranes with DIDIT leads to extensive cross-linking of spectrin, band 3, and band 6, and residual hemoglobin, consistent with results previously obtained with permeant cross-linkers. In contrast, when intact human erythrocytes are cross-linked with DIDIT, hemoglobin and the cytoplasmic face membrane proteins are not cross-linked, but band 3, which is accessible at the extracytoplasmic face of the membrane, is cross-linked to dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1490007484,"UMP is known to be an allosteric inhibitor of carbamyl phosphate synthetase, whereas IMP activates the enzyme. Surprisingly, dialdehyde UMP (prepared by periodate oxidation of UMP) was found to be a potent activator of the enzyme. Dialdehyde IMP, like IMP, produced activation. The corresponding dialcohol analogs of UMP and IMP (prepared by borohydride reduction of the dialdehyde analogs) had no effect on activity. These nucleotide interactions were further characterized by sedimentation velocity studies and by examination of the effects of inorganic phosphate on enzymatic activity. Although UMP promotes formation of an enzyme dimer, and IMP promotes formation of a tetramer (Powers, S. G., Meister, A., and Haschemeyer, R. H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1554-1558), the dialdehyde analogs of UMP and IMP both promote formation of mixed species. Low levels (less than 10 mM) of inorganic phosphate decrease the extent of activation by IMP, dialdehyde IMP, and dialdehyde UMP, but increase the extent of inhibition by UMP. The marked activation observed with dialdehyde UMP, and other considerations, suggest that the binding sites on the enzyme for IMP and UMP may overlap substantially. The findings also suggest that physiological levels of inorganic phosphate function in the modulation of the allosteric regulation of this enzyme by nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1672993705,"Synthesis of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-[1,2-3H]cholenoic acid has permitted a study of its metabolism in bile-fistula hamsters that received the compound by intravenous infusion. Metabolites in bile were identified by reverse isotope dilution after their complete resolution by high pressure liquid chromatography using muPorasil. Recovery of administered radioactivity ranged from 21-60% in three animals. In each study, lithocholic acid (0.8-4.4%) and chenodeoxycholic acid (7.8-11.3%) were identified as metabolites of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-cholenoate and can be considered primary bile acids in the side-chain pathway of bile acid synthesis beginning with the oxidation of cholesterol to 26-hydroxycholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1495203622,"The rate of assembly of oxyhemoglobins A and S at pH 7 and 20 degrees C has been followed spectrophotometrically at 582.5 nm, a maximum of the difference spectrum of isolated oxygenated subunits and intact oxyhemoglobin. In 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, the resultant time courses following mixing of equivalent concentrations of alpha and beta chains were homogeneous and followed first order kinetics. These time courses were protein concentration independent over a range of 8.0 to 60 X 10(-6) M in heme after mixing and presumably reflect the rate of dissociation of the beta chain tetramer. This rate-limiting dissociation reaction was found to be nearly 2-fold slower for the beta S than the beta A chain tetramer exhibiting half-times of 27 and 15 min, respectively. The overall rate of formation of Hb S and Hb A appears to be significantly influenced by the rates of dissociation of their respective beta chains. These findings are in contrast to mixing experiments done in 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer which revealed time courses which were heterogeneous and markedly dependent upon protein concentration. The stability of the oxygenated beta chain tetramer and, therefore, the overall kinetic profile of liganded hemoglobin reconstitution is acutely sensitive to buffer conditions."

Cells were allowed to grow to fusion (differentiation) and exposed to [35S]methionine for a short period. Subsequently, the decay of labeled proteins in the presence of cycloheximide was measured for various cellular fractions as well as individual proteins isolated from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and separated by gel electrophoresis. Some dystrophic material showed an increased decay when compared to normal material. The most significant (p less than 0.005) difference was found in a Mr = 65,000 component of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This same component accumulates label at an accelerated rate in the presence of the protease inhibitor leupeptin. Increased turnover of this protein, possibly calsequestrin, may be a manifestation of the genetic disease."

https://openalex.org/W1574448826,"The protein products from one of the two major silkmoth chorion multigene families contain blocked NH2 termini. The blocked residue has been identified as pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid. Its formation occurs post-translationally, by modification of NH2-terminal glutamine, after removal of a 20-residue-long signal peptide. Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid formation begins within minutes after polypeptide chain termination and is largely, although not entirely, complete by 60 min. Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid thus appears to be formed both within the cell and in the extracellular chorion. Another class of minor chorion proteins also appears to contain pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid."

Alkaline, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was employed to analyze the distribution of the five isolectins. The polyacrylamide gels were scanned at 625 nm and the peak height corresponding to each isolectin was measured and expressed as a percentage of the total of peak height. Principal components analysis of the correlations among the percentages indicated a sequential relationship among the five isolectins with the concentrations of B4 and A4 inversely related. Further statistical analyses indicated that although the distribution of isolectins in each seed was unique, seeds gathered from the same tree were more similar than seeds gathered from different trees. Several causes of this sequential relationship are discussed."

Solubilized Cysticercus collagen shows two different alpha subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of 100,000 and is readily degraded by bacterial collagenase. The amino acid composition is characteristic of collagen except that it contains no hydroxyproline. Segment long spacing crystallites measuring 280 nm in length were prepared. These segments showed a band pattern different from that of vertebrate and other invertebrate collagens. The denaturation temperature at neutral pH was 35 degrees C and correlated with the total pyrrolidine content as observed for other collagens. An intrinsic viscosity value of 15.3 dl/g was obtained for this collagen. Its possible evolutionary relationship with other collagens is discussed."

Using this deuterated salicylate as a substrate for salicylate hydroxylase, the product catechol was isolated and characterized with respect to the positions of deuterium retention. Based on nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy analyses, the product was identified as [3,5-2H]catechol. It is thus unequivocally demonstrated that salicylate is decarboxylated and hydroxylated at the same ring position. Also consistent with this conclusion is the lack of a kinetic isotope effect for the deuterated salicylate substrate."
