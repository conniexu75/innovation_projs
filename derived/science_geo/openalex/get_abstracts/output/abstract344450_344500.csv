https://openalex.org/W2097729660,"Dynamic models of crystal surfaces have provided new insights into the crystal growth process. The effects of surface roughening, dislocations, and impurities have been assessed. Certain impurities have been found to cause a larger increase in the growth rate than screw dislocations."
https://openalex.org/W2051213539,There is a need to measure societal risk more accurately; to examine and reevaluate our priorities in risk reduction; to determine the level of expenditure for risk reduction beyond which adverse economic and political effects may be overriding; and to develop a national approach to risk management.
https://openalex.org/W2078227218,"A considerable portion of the abyssal floor of the western North Pacific was already receiving pelagic sediment in late Jurassic time. Carbonate sediments were later replaced by abyssal clays as the basin deepened and bottom waters became more aggressive. The resulting facies boundary, which can be recognized on seismic profiles, is broadly transgressive; it ranges in age from mid-Cretaceous in the western Pacific to Oligocene in the central Pacific. Cherts are encountered at and below the major facies boundary and appear to have been formed by postdepositional processes."
https://openalex.org/W2088674363,"Vacuum sublimation of oriented single crystals of ice at temperatures from -110 to -60 degrees Celsius was studied by electron microscopy with the freeze-etch technique. Sublimation etches the ice surface to produce pits and asperities and above -85 degrees Celsius causes extreme surface roughening. The etch pits are ascribed to surface dislocations, and the extreme roughening is ascribed to the departure from unity of the vaporization coefficient. The asperities could not be attributed to impurities; they may be related to the whiskers that others have observed at higher temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2022760982,"Starch-filled leaves of plants which have been subjected to low dosages of naturally occurring photochemical oxidants, ozone, or peroxyacetyl nitrate hydrolyze their starch more slowly when placed in the dark. Delayed hydrolysis occurs irrespective of whether the oxidants were applied during the light or dark period. Occasionally this effect is evident only in the intervenal areas."
https://openalex.org/W1993576741,"The glassy portion of lunar sample 12013 from Apollo 12 is chemically more like some tektites from Java than like any terrestrial igneous rock. It satisfies all the chemical criteria for a tektite. Tektites are relatively recent and acid rocks, whereas the moon is chiefly ancient and basaltic; hence, tektites are probably ejected volcanically, rather than by impact, from the moon."
https://openalex.org/W1989704177,The application of the lutetium-176/ hafnium-176 method to gram quantities of minerals containing rare earths is made possible by the development of analytical and isotope dilution techniques for microgram amounts of lutetium and hafnium. The geological redetermination of the half-life of lutetium-176 (3.3 ± 0.5 × 1010 years) is in agreement with recent physical measurements.
https://openalex.org/W2137653987,In its time the treadmill pattern of growth was progress enough and served us well. But as the relationships change between human numbers and the total environment we must abandon unregulated growth before it strangles us. The essential tasks ahead are to stabilize human population levels and to learn to recycle as much of our material abundance as possible. Ideally the change to new ways would be by incremental evolutionary and perhaps experimental steps although some writers believe an incremental approach may not work. But if steps of some kind are not started soon they may well be outrun the pace of events. Unless we can slow the treadmill on which we have been running faster and faster we may stumble--and find ourselves flung irretrievably into disaster. (excerpt)

https://openalex.org/W2040677905,The most accurate infrared photometric observations (8 to 14 microns) to date of the average limb darkening of Jupiter have been combined with the most refined deduction of jovian model atmospheres in which flux constancy has been closely maintained in the upper regime of radiative equilibrium and a much more accurate approximation of the 10-and 16-micron vibration-rotation bands of ammonia has been incorporated. The theoretically predicted emergent specific intensity has been multiplied by the spectral response function and folded (mathematically convolved-intersmeared) with the spatial response function of the atmosphere-telescope-photometer combination. The resulting comparison indicates that Jupiter is radiating from three to four times as much power as the planet is receiving from the sun.
