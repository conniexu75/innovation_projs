https://openalex.org/W2955632554,"There is compelling evidence that the human cerebellum is engaged in a wide array of motor and cognitive tasks. A fundamental question centers on whether the cerebellum is organized into distinct functional subregions. To address this question, we employed a rich task battery designed to tap into a broad range of cognitive processes. During four functional MRI sessions, participants performed a battery of 26 diverse tasks comprising 47 unique conditions. Using the data from this multi-domain task battery, we derived a comprehensive functional parcellation of the cerebellar cortex and evaluated it by predicting functional boundaries in a novel set of tasks. The new parcellation successfully identified distinct functional subregions, providing significant improvements over existing parcellations derived from task-free data. Lobular boundaries, commonly used to summarize functional data, did not coincide with functional subdivisions. The new parcellation provides a functional atlas to guide future neuroimaging studies. Using a large task battery spanning motor, cognitive, social and affective domains, this functional MRI (fMRI) study provides a comprehensive functional map of the human cerebellum, along with a comparison to maps derived from anatomy and resting-state fMRI data."

Neurodevelopment was assessed by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition (Bayley-III; cognitive, language and motor domains) in 146 children and through neurodevelopment questionnaires/neurological examinations in 70 remaining children. Complete eye exams (n = 137) and hearing assessments (n = 114) were also performed. Below-average neurodevelopment and/or abnormal eye or hearing assessments were noted in 31.5% of children between 7 and 32 months of age. Among children assessed by Bayley-III, 12% scored below -2 s.d. (score <70; a score of 100 ± 2 s.d. is the range) in at least one domain; and 28% scored between -1 and -2 s.d. in any domain (scores <85-70). Language function was most affected, with 35% of 146 children below average. Improved neurodevelopmental outcomes were noted in female children, term babies, children with normal eye exams and maternal infection later in pregnancy (P = 0.01). We noted resolution of microcephaly with normal neurodevelopment in two of eight children, development of secondary microcephaly in two other children and autism spectrum disorder in three previously healthy children in the second year of life."
https://openalex.org/W2959924472,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, the extent to which genetic factors increase risk for PAD is largely unknown. Using electronic health record data, we performed a genome-wide association study in the Million Veteran Program testing ~32 million DNA sequence variants with PAD (31,307 cases and 211,753 controls) across veterans of European, African and Hispanic ancestry. The results were replicated in an independent sample of 5,117 PAD cases and 389,291 controls from the UK Biobank. We identified 19 PAD loci, 18 of which have not been previously reported. Eleven of the 19 loci were associated with disease in three vascular beds (coronary, cerebral, peripheral), including LDLR, LPL and LPA, suggesting that therapeutic modulation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the lipoprotein lipase pathway or circulating lipoprotein(a) may be efficacious for multiple atherosclerotic disease phenotypes. Conversely, four of the variants appeared to be specific for PAD, including F5 p.R506Q, highlighting the pathogenic role of thrombosis in the peripheral vascular bed and providing genetic support for Factor Xa inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for PAD. Our results highlight mechanistic similarities and differences among coronary, cerebral and peripheral atherosclerosis and provide therapeutic insights."
https://openalex.org/W2960241504,"Severe insect declines make headlines, but they are rarely based on systematic monitoring outside of Europe. We estimate the rate of change in total butterfly abundance and the population trends for 81 species using 21 years of systematic monitoring in Ohio, USA. Total abundance is declining at 2% per year, resulting in a cumulative 33% reduction in butterfly abundance. Three times as many species have negative population trends compared to positive trends. The rate of total decline and the proportion of species in decline mirror those documented in three comparable long-term European monitoring programs. Multiple environmental changes such as climate change, habitat degradation, and agricultural practices may contribute to these declines in Ohio and shift the makeup of the butterfly community by benefiting some species over others. Our analysis of life-history traits associated with population trends shows an impact of climate change, as species with northern distributions and fewer annual generations declined more rapidly. However, even common and invasive species associated with human-dominated landscapes are declining, suggesting widespread environmental causes for these trends. Declines in common species, although they may not be close to extinction, will have an outsized impact on the ecosystem services provided by insects. These results from the most extensive, systematic insect monitoring program in North America demonstrate an ongoing defaunation in butterflies that on an annual scale might be imperceptible, but cumulatively has reduced butterfly numbers by a third over 20 years."

https://openalex.org/W2956118984,"Targeting genes to specific neuronal or glial cell types is valuable for both understanding and repairing brain circuits. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are frequently used for gene delivery, but targeting expression to specific cell types is an unsolved problem. We created a library of 230 AAVs, each with a different synthetic promoter designed using four independent strategies. We show that a number of these AAVs specifically target expression to neuronal and glial cell types in the mouse and non-human primate retina in vivo and in the human retina in vitro. We demonstrate applications for recording and stimulation, as well as the intersectional and combinatorial labeling of cell types. These resources and approaches allow economic, fast and efficient cell-type targeting in a variety of species, both for fundamental science and for gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2961444901,"In order to maintain high yields and protect the environment, the replacement of chemical fertilizers with organic ones has received increasing attention in recent years. A 2-year field experiment (2015–2016) was carried out to assess the effects of substituting equal amounts of mineral fertilizer with organic manure on the yield, dry matter (DM), and nitrogen (N) uptake of spring maize (Zea mays L.) and on the mineral N (Nmin) distribution in the soil profile. The treatments included chemical fertilizer; different amounts of maize straw, cow manure, and chicken manure; and an unfertilized control (CK). Compared with the chemical fertilizer treatments, equal amounts of substitutions with cow manure or chicken manure increased production, and a 25% nutrient substitution resulted in the best yield increase. Straw return had no effect on maize production, and 100% straw return resulted in reduced production. The N accumulation and DM content both exhibited a slow-fast-slow growth trend throughout the various growth stages, and the average N uptake and DM accumulation in response to the treatments followed the order of chicken manure > cow manure > chemical fertilizer > straw return > CK. The Nmin content in the profile not only increased as the Nmin application rate increased but also showed greater increases at certain depths than at the surface, indicating that excessive N led to leaching. These results suggest that an appropriate proportion of organic substitution not only provides enough nutrients but also improves the soil environment and leads to increased yields. This technique represents a practical method of continuously increasing production and reducing the risk of N leaching."

https://openalex.org/W2957848130,"Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that eliminates aggregated proteins and damaged organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. A major route for activating autophagy involves inhibition of the mTORC1 kinase, but current mTORC1-targeting compounds do not allow complete and selective mTORC1 blockade. Here, we have coupled screening of a covalent ligand library with activity-based protein profiling to discover EN6, a small-molecule in vivo activator of autophagy that covalently targets cysteine 277 in the ATP6V1A subunit of the lysosomal v-ATPase, which activates mTORC1 via the Rag guanosine triphosphatases. EN6-mediated ATP6V1A modification decouples the v-ATPase from the Rags, leading to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, increased lysosomal acidification and activation of autophagy. Consistently, EN6 clears TDP-43 aggregates, a causative agent in frontotemporal dementia, in a lysosome-dependent manner. Our results provide insight into how the v-ATPase regulates mTORC1, and reveal a unique approach for enhancing cellular clearance based on covalent inhibition of lysosomal mTORC1 signaling. A covalent ligand that targets C277 of ATP6V1A was identified resulting in enhanced v-ATPase activity, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, increased lysosomal acidification, activation of autophagy and clearance of toxic protein aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W2956832867,"Marine seaweeds increasingly grow into extensive algal blooms, which are detrimental to coastal ecosystems, tourism and aquaculture. However, algal biomass is also emerging as a sustainable raw material for the bioeconomy. The potential exploitation of algae is hindered by our limited knowledge of the microbial pathways—and hence the distinct biochemical functions of the enzymes involved—that convert algal polysaccharides into oligo- and monosaccharides. Understanding these processes would be essential, however, for applications such as the fermentation of algal biomass into bioethanol or other value-added compounds. Here, we describe the metabolic pathway that enables the marine flavobacterium Formosa agariphila to degrade ulvan, the main cell wall polysaccharide of bloom-forming Ulva species. The pathway involves 12 biochemically characterized carbohydrate-active enzymes, including two polysaccharide lyases, three sulfatases and seven glycoside hydrolases that sequentially break down ulvan into fermentable monosaccharides. This way, the enzymes turn a previously unexploited renewable into a valuable and ecologically sustainable bioresource. Elucidation of a multi-enzyme pathway for degradation of the polysaccharide ulvan by Formosa agariphila provides tools to use ulvan biomass from marine algal blooms as feedstock for renewable sources of carbohydrates."
https://openalex.org/W2961714134,"Austrian beekeepers frequently suffered severe colony losses during the last decade similar to trends all over Europe. This first surveillance study aimed to describe the health status of Austrian bee colonies and to analyze the reasons for losses for both the summer and winter season in Austria. In this study 189 apiaries all over Austria were selected using a stratified random sampling approach and inspected three times between July 2015 and spring 2016 by trained bee inspectors. The inspectors made interviews with the beekeepers about their beekeeping practice and the history of the involved colonies. They inspected a total of 1596 colonies for symptoms of nine bee pests and diseases (four of them notifiable diseases) and took bee samples for varroa mite infestation analysis. The most frequently detected diseases were three brood diseases: Varroosis, Chalkbrood and Sacbrood. The notifiable bee pests Aethina tumida and Tropilaelaps spp. were not detected. During the study period 10.8% of the 1596 observed colonies died. Winter proved to be the most critical season, in which 75% of the reported colony losses happened. Risks for suffering summer losses increased significantly, when colonies were weak in July, had queen problems or a high varroa mite infestation level on bees in July. Risks for suffering winter losses increased significantly, when the colonies had a high varroa mite infestation level on bees in September, were weak in September, had a queen older than one year or the beekeeper had few years of beekeeping experience. However, the effect of a high varroa mite infestation level in September had by far the greatest potential to raise the winter losses compared to the other significant factors."
https://openalex.org/W2959351144,"The subset of pro-inflammatory B cells, called late memory, tissue-like or double negative (DN), accumulates in the blood of elderly individuals. Here we show that DN B cells do not proliferate and do not make antibodies to influenza antigens, but they secrete antibodies with autoimmune reactivity, in agreement with their membrane phenotype (CD95+CD21-CD11c+) and their spontaneous expression of the transcription factor T-bet. These cells also increase in the blood of individuals with obesity and autoimmune diseases, but causative mechanisms and signaling pathways involved are known only in part. In the present paper we compare frequencies and metabolic requirements of these cells in the blood of healthy individuals of different ages and in the blood and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of individuals with obesity. Results show that DN B cells from young individuals have minimal metabolic requirements, DN B cells from elderly and obese individuals utilize higher amounts of glucose to perform autoimmune antibody production and enroll in aerobic glycolysis to support their function. DN B cells from the SAT have the highest metabolic requirements as they activate oxidative phosphorylation, aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. DN B cells from the SAT also show the highest levels of ROS and the highest levels of phosphorylated AMPK (5’-AMP activated kinase) and Sestrin 1, both able to mitigate stress and cell death. This metabolic advantage drives DN B cell survival and function (secretion of autoimmune antibodies)."
https://openalex.org/W2960367101,"Here, we report the fragment-based discovery of BI-9321, a potent, selective and cellular active antagonist of the NSD3-PWWP1 domain. The human NSD3 protein is encoded by the WHSC1L1 gene located in the 8p11-p12 amplicon, frequently amplified in breast and squamous lung cancer. Recently, it was demonstrated that the PWWP1 domain of NSD3 is required for the viability of acute myeloid leukemia cells. To further elucidate the relevance of NSD3 in cancer biology, we developed a chemical probe, BI-9321, targeting the methyl-lysine binding site of the PWWP1 domain with sub-micromolar in vitro activity and cellular target engagement at 1 µM. As a single agent, BI-9321 downregulates Myc messenger RNA expression and reduces proliferation in MOLM-13 cells. This first-in-class chemical probe BI-9321, together with the negative control BI-9466, will greatly facilitate the elucidation of the underexplored biological function of PWWP domains."
https://openalex.org/W2956819517,"During natural behavior, animals actively gather information that is relevant for learning or actions; however, the mechanisms of active sampling are rarely investigated. We tested parietal neurons involved in oculomotor control in a task in which monkeys made saccades to gather visual information relevant to a subsequent action. We show that the neurons encode, before the saccade, the information gain (reduction in decision uncertainty) that the saccade was expected to bring for the following action. Sensitivity to information gain correlates with the monkeys' efficiency at processing the information in the post-saccadic fixation, but is independent of neuronal reward sensitivity. Reward sensitivity, in turn, is unreliable across task contexts, inconsistent with the view that the cells encode economic utility. The findings suggest that parietal cells involved in oculomotor decisions show uncertainty-dependent boosts of neural gain that facilitate the implementation of active sampling policies, including the selection of relevant cues and the efficient use of the information delivered by these cues."
https://openalex.org/W2956185667,"Constructed wetlands are sustainable technologies for the treatment of wastewater. These biological systems have been widely studied throughout the world for more than 30 years; however, most studies have focused on the effects of design and engineering on pollutant removal from wastewater. Undoubtedly, agro-technical aspects have been given too little consideration by research. This paper reports the main results of a set of experiments carried out on two pilot horizontal subsurface flow systems in Sicily (Italy). Festuca, Lolium and Pennisetum spp. in combination and three emergent macrophytes–Arundo donax L., Cyperus alternifolius L. and Typha latifolia L.–alone, were assessed. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that, under predetermined hydraulic and design conditions, the choice of plant species and the management of the vegetation can significantly affect the pollutant removal performance of constructed wetlands. In addition, wastewater (after treatment) can also be used for agricultural purposes leading to increased sustainability in agricultural systems. Arundo and Typha-planted units performed better than Cyperus-planted units in terms of chemical, physical and microbiological contaminant removal. All the species adapted extremely well to wetland conditions. Polyculture systems were found to be more efficient than monocultures in the removal of dissolved organic compounds. The reuse of treated wastewater for the irrigation of open fields and horticultural crops led to significant savings in the use of freshwater and fertilizers. The results of physical-energy characterization of A. donax above-ground plant residues and pellets highlighted the fact that a constructed wetland could also be a potential source of bioenergy."
https://openalex.org/W2954653557,"The ability to safely control transgene expression with simple synthetic gene switches is critical for effective gene- and cell-based therapies. In the present study, the signaling pathway controlled by human transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin 8 (hTRPM8), a TRP channel family member1, is harnessed to control transgene expression. Human TRPM8 signaling is stimulated by menthol, an innocuous, natural, cooling compound, or by exposure to a cool environment (15-18 °C). By functionally linking hTRPM8-induced signaling to a synthetic promoter containing elements that bind nuclear factor of activated T cells, a synthetic gene circuit was designed that can be adjusted by exposure to either a cool environment or menthol. It was shown that this gene switch is functional in various cell types and human primary cells, as well as in mice implanted with engineered cells. In response to transdermal delivery of menthol, microencapsulated cell implants harboring this gene circuit, coupled to expression of either of two therapeutic proteins, insulin or a modified, activin type IIB, receptor ligand trap protein (mActRIIBECD-hFc), could alleviate hyperglycemia in alloxan-treated mice (a model of type 1 diabetes) or reverse muscle atrophy in dexamethasone-treated mice (a model of muscle wasting), respectively. This fully human-derived orthogonal transgene switch should be amenable to a wide range of clinical applications."

Mitochondrial dynamics and related cell function require the uncleaved form of the dynamin-like GTPase OPA1. Stabilization of OPA1 might then confer a protective mechanism against stress-induced tissue damages. To study the putative role of hepatic mitochondrial morphology in a sick liver, we expressed a cleavage-resistant long form of OPA1 (L-OPA1Δ) in the liver of a mouse model with mitochondrial liver dysfunction (i.e. the hepatocyte-specific prohibitin-2 knockout (Hep-Phb2−/−) mice). Liver prohibitin-2 deficiency caused excessive proteolytic cleavage of L-OPA1, mitochondrial fragmentation, and increased apoptosis. These molecular alterations were associated with lipid accumulation, abolished gluconeogenesis, and extensive liver damage. Such liver dysfunction was associated with severe hypoglycemia. In prohibitin-2 knockout mice, expression of L-OPA1Δ by in vivo adenovirus delivery restored the morphology but not the function of mitochondria in hepatocytes. In prohibitin-competent mice, elongation of liver mitochondria by expression of L-OPA1Δ resulted in excessive glucose production associated with increased mitochondrial respiration.

However, to what extent OPA1 contributes to the phenotypic outcomes of mitochondrial dysfunction is unclear. Furthermore, it remains controversial whether altered mitochondrial morphology is the cause or the consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic stress. In other words, whether or not morphological adaptation serves the mitochondrial function is an ongoing debate. To assess the role of prohibitins and related mitochondrial integrity in the liver, we generated conditional tamoxifen-inducible hepatocyte-specific knockout mice. The loss of Phb2 in hepatocytes abolished gluconeogenesis and increased cell death. These effects were associated with mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of L-OPA1. To further define the role of OPA1-dependent fusion in mitochondrial liver disease, we expressed an isoform of cleavage-resistant OPA1 (L-OPA1Δ) by intravenous injection of recombinant adenovirus. Stabilization of L-OPA1 led to elongated mitochondria with higher respiration in control hepatocytes and to only the normalization of mitochondrial morphology in the absence of Phb2. Surprisingly, OPA1 stabilization in the control mice potentiated gluconeogenesis, pointing to mitochondrial oxidative capacity as a master regulator of hepatic glucose production. Global deletion of prohibitins is embryonically lethal in mice (22He B. Feng Q. Mukherjee A. Lonard D.M. DeMayo F.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W.

To achieve post-natal gene ablation specifically in mouse hepatocytes, conditional Phb2 mice (Phb2fl/fl) (11Merkwirth C. Dargazanli S. Tatsuta T. Geimer S. Löwer B.

Nonrecombined Phb2fl/fl;Alb-Cre-ERT2 mice were bred at the expected Mendelian ratio with normal gross anatomy and fertility. We used floxed littermates without the Cre transgene (Phb2fl/fl) as controls for experiments to homogenize the genetic background between the groups. Tamoxifen treatment was initiated at the age of 8 weeks on both Phb2fl/fl controls and Phb2fl/fl;Alb-Cre-ERT2 mice by one-time subcutaneous implantation of a tamoxifen pellet, the latter producing hepatocyte-specific Phb2 knockout (Hep-Phb2−/−) mice. Two weeks after tamoxifen administration, immunoblotting on extracts of isolated hepatocytes revealed close to complete deletion of Phb2 in Hep-Phb2−/− mice (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous findings in mice and cell lines (11Merkwirth C. Dargazanli S. Tatsuta T. Geimer S. Löwer B. Wunderlich F.T. von Kleist-Retzow J.C. Waisman A. Westermann B. Langer T.

This observation indicates that, as for other tissues, Phb1 and Phb2 are functionally interdependent in hepatocytes. Immunoblotting of liver lysates from Hep-Phb2−/− mice showed residual Phb2, which is presumably explained by expression of the gene in nonparenchymal liver cells and the persistence of some hepatocytes that eventually escaped recombination. No recombination was observed in the pancreas, skeletal muscles, kidney, and brain of Hep-Phb2−/− mice (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). About 1 week after tamoxifen-induced recombination was initiated, Hep-Phb2−/− mice showed a progressive decline of random plasma glucose levels and of their body weights (Fig. 1, B and C). At 2 weeks post-recombination, food consumption (Fig. S1B) was lower (−25%) in knockout animals, and by 3 weeks, they were severely sick and consumed ∼63% less food than their controls. The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were not significantly different in Hep-Phb2−/− mice at 2 weeks post-recombination despite a trend for elevated plasma levels (Fig. S1, C and D), whereas at 3 weeks, IL-6 and TNFα levels were dramatically higher compared with controls (TNFα concentrations were out of range). Hep-Phb2−/− mice died at around 3–4 weeks after tamoxifen-induced deletion of prohibitins. Liver weights of Hep-Phb2−/− mice were reduced by 15% after 3 weeks of recombination versus controls (Fig. 1, D and E). There was a marked reduction of the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in Hep-Phb2−/− mice, which was 55 and 85% lower compared with control mice 2 and 3 weeks after recombination, respectively (Fig. 1F). Histology on liver sections (Fig. 1G) of Hep-Phb2−/− mice revealed disorganized hepatic structures and small lipid droplets, reminiscent of NAFLD. On the other hand, steatotic liver of ob/ob mice did not exhibit changes in Phb2 (Fig. S1E), whereas others reported reduced levels of prohibitin complex in liver mitochondria of ob/ob mice (26García-Ruiz I. Fernández-Moreira D. Solís-Muñoz P. Rodríguez-Juan C. Díaz-Sanjuán T. Muñoz-Yagüe T. Solís-Herruzo J.A. Mitochondrial complex I subunits are decreased in murine nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: implication of peroxynitrite.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9 (20222668): 2450-245910.1021/pr9011427Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Oil Red O staining further confirmed the accumulation of lipids in the livers of Hep-Phb2−/− mice. It has been reported that a high dose of tamoxifen induces hepatotoxicity (27Parvez S. Tabassum H. Rehman H. Banerjee B.D. Athar M. Raisuddin S. Catechin prevents tamoxifen-induced oxidative stress and biochemical perturbations in mice.Toxicology. 2006; 225 (16797820): 109-11810.1016/j.tox.2006.05.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, we observed no change in liver histology 3 weeks after tamoxifen administration on the Cre-negative control floxed mice, which disqualifies tamoxifen as a confounding factor for the observed phenotype. This set of data shows that the loss of hepatic prohibitins resulted in hypoglycemia, reduction of body weight, and altered liver mass and histology. Due to the severity of the phenotype observed in Hep-Phb2−/− mice at about 3–4 weeks after recombination, we then centered the study when the disease was less severe (i.e. 2 weeks after recombination). Potential hepatic damages due to Phb2 deficiency were evaluated by the analysis of liver enzymes and bilirubin in plasma, which were markedly increased in Hep-Phb2−/− mice versus controls (Fig. 2, A and B). These data indicate significant liver damage in Hep-Phb2−/− mice before the induction of cytokines (Fig. S1), illness appearing already 2 weeks after the loss of hepatic Phb2. We next analyzed plasma and hepatic lipid profiles. The plasma concentrations of free fatty acid (FFA), total cholesterol, and triglycerides (Fig. 2, C–E) were lower in Hep-Phb2−/− mice compared with controls. Conversely, liver triglyceride contents (Fig. 2F) were markedly increased in Hep-Phb2−/− mice versus controls, confirming the lipid accumulation revealed by histology. Hepatic triglycerides are released into the bloodstream via packaging with apolipoprotein B into VLDL, with microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) activity as a rate-limiting factor (28Tietge U.J. Bakillah A. Maugeais C. Tsukamoto K. Hussain M. Rader D.J. Hepatic overexpression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) results in increased in vivo secretion of VLDL triglycerides and apolipoprotein B.J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40 (10553017): 2134-2139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under fed conditions, Hep-Phb2−/− mice had 1.5-fold higher MTP activity than the control mice, probably driven by an oversufficient supply of hepatic triglycerides (Fig. 2G). Considering the marked reduction of eWAT (a sign of increased lipolysis) and potential higher hepatic VLDL formation, one would expect plasma lipid levels to be increased in Hep-Phb2−/− mice. On the contrary, Hep-Phb2−/− mice exhibited hypolipidemia, suggesting increased clearance by peripheral tissues, such as the skeletal muscles. Although the liver normally increases the production of ketone bodies from fatty acids under low blood glucose conditions, plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate were similar between the knockout and control mice (Fig. 2H). Overall, loss of prohibitins induced liver failure and a dramatic imbalance of lipid storage from adipose tissue to the liver. Consistent with their low glycemia, Hep-Phb2−/− mice displayed a 70% reduction of hepatic glycogen content (fed conditions) compared with the control mice (Fig. 2I). In parallel, plasma insulin levels were reduced by 58% in Hep-Phb2−/− mice, along with a trend for increased glucagon levels (Fig. 2, J and K). As insulin and glucagon are produced by pancreatic islets, we examined the islets by immunohistochemistry. We observed no significant changes in the knockout mice regarding either the pancreatic distribution of islets or the density of endocrine cells within the islets with the expected organization of α-cells at the periphery and β-cells predominately in the center (Fig. S2). Despite the low plasma glucose and insulin levels, Hep-Phb2−/− mice showed similar glucose tolerance in response to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) and robust insulin sensitivity upon intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ipITT) compared with the control mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Remarkably, starting from 1 week post-recombination, gluconeogenesis was completely abolished in Hep-Phb2−/− mice, as indicated by in vivo pyruvate challenges (Fig. 3, C–E), concomitant with the appearance of hypoglycemia (Fig. 1B). Of note, the in vivo pyruvate challenge may be influenced by the uptake of lactate/pyruvate by peripheral tissues competing for the substrate (29Hui S. Ghergurovich J.M. Morscher R.J. Jang C. Teng X. Lu W. Esparza L.A. Reya T. Zhan L. Yanxiang Guo J. White E. Rabinowitz J.D. Glucose feeds the TCA cycle via circulating lactate.Nature. 2017; 551 (29045397): 115-11810.1038/nature24057Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). However, the impaired gluconeogenesis was also observed in vitro on hepatocytes isolated from Hep-Phb2−/− mice (see below). We next analyzed the proteins implicated in glucose and lipid metabolisms in liver extracts by immunoblotting (Fig. 3F). The insulin signaling pathway was first investigated for its role in hepatic steatosis (30Farese R.V. Sajan M.P. Standaert M.L. Insulin-sensitive protein kinases (atypical protein kinase C and protein kinase B/Akt): actions and defects in obesity and type II diabetes.Exp. Biol. Med. 2005; 230 (16179727): 593-60510.1177/153537020523000901Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Binding of insulin to its receptor initiates a signaling cascade that diverges at protein kinase Akt. The absence of Phb2 caused a 50% reduction of phospho-Akt Ser-473, whereas phospho-Akt Thr-308 was unchanged. Downstream of insulin-Akt signaling, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibits glycogen synthase (GS) activity by phosphorylation, whereas Akt promotes GS activity by inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3. Expression of GSK3β in Hep-Phb2−/− liver was markedly increased, associated with higher phosphorylated GSK3. Glucokinase (GCK) is induced by insulin and converts glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) used for both glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. In the liver of Hep-Phb2−/− mice, GCK protein levels were decreased, possibly as a consequence of low insulin levels. In Phb2-deficient livers, GS was markedly down-regulated, and the remaining GS was phosphorylated to levels similar to those of control liver, further reducing its overall activity. Regarding glycogenolysis, expression of glycogen phosphorylase was also markedly reduced. Overall, whereas the signaling pathway for glycogen production was up-regulated, the enzymatic machinery was markedly down-regulated in Phb2-deficient liver. Moreover, the scarce availability of the necessary substrates rendered glycogen storage inoperative (31von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff A. Hunter R.W. García-Rocha M. Kang L. López-Soldado I. Lantier L. Patel K. Peggie M.W. Martínez-Pons C. Voss M. Calbó J. Cohen P.T. Wasserman D.H. Guinovart J.J. Sakamoto K. Glucose-6-phosphate-mediated activation of liver glycogen synthase plays a key role in hepatic glycogen synthesis.Diabetes. 2013; 62 (23990365): 4070-408210.2337/db13-0880Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although not rate-limiting (32Burgess S.C. He T. Yan Z. Lindner J. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Browning J.D. Magnuson M.A. Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase does not solely control the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis in the intact mouse liver.Cell Metab. 2007; 5 (17403375): 313-32010.1016/j.cmet.2007.03.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) significantly contributes to hepatic gluconeogenesis and is localized mainly in the cytosol (PEPCK-c) and partly in mitochondria (PEPCK-m) according to its two isoforms. Expression of PEPCK-c is stimulated by glucagon and repressed by insulin, whereas PEPCK-m is constitutively expressed. Phb2-deficient liver had almost complete suppression of PEPCK-c protein (Fig. 3F), whereas glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) was similarly expressed in the knockout and control livers. Next, we examined the protein levels of lipogenic enzymes in the liver. Both acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) were markedly reduced in the liver of Hep-Phb2−/− mice (Fig. 3F). This shows defective capacity for de novo lipogenesis in Phb2-deficient liver despite the observed lipid accumulation, pointing to a nonhepatic source contributing to increased triglyceride storage. Given that Hep-Phb2−/− mice eat less (Fig. S1B), the few dietary lipids from their chow diet hardly account for increased hepatic lipid content. As insulin inhibits lipase in white adipose tissue, the low plasma insulin levels (Fig. 2J) might have contributed to promote lipolysis in adipose tissue (Fig. 1F), resulting in elevated supply of hepatic lipids in Hep-Phb2−/− liver (Fig. 2F). PEPCK and ACC directly rely on mitochondrial activity for the supply of their respective substrates and GCK is associated with liver mitochondria, integrating glucose metabolism and apoptosis (33Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J.

Because these proteins were markedly down-regulated in prohibitin-deficient liver, we investigated the integrity of mitochondria normally contributed by prohibitins. EM showed the loss of an elongated ultrastructure resulting in a globular pattern in Hep-Phb2−/− liver (Fig. 3G). This might indicate a link between the structure of mitochondria and the levels of proteins associated with this organelle. Deletion of Phb2 in MEFs, neurons, and pancreatic β-cells leads to excessive proteolytic cleavage of L-OPA1, which is accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation (11Merkwirth C. Dargazanli S.

The rapid degradation of short-lived proteins by the UPS is essential for many biological processes, and the selective hydrolysis of misfolded proteins by the UPS is critical in protein quality control. In this pathway, nuclear and cytosolic proteins are targeted for degradation by covalent attachment of chains of ubiquitin (Ub) on a lysine residue via a cascade of enzymes, including the Ub-activating enzymes (UAE, E1), Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2), and Ub ligases (E3) (3Finley D.

The C termini of these Ub-like proteins are conjugated to substrates by a similar enzymatic cascade as Ub but by their own E1, E2, and E3s (1Hochstrasser M.

The modification by the small Ub-related modifier (SUMO), termed SUMOylation, has attracted particular attention because this pathway modifies more than 1000 target proteins (6Hendriks I.A. Vertegaal A.C. A comprehensive compilation of SUMO proteomics.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 (27435506): 581-59510.1038/nrm.2016.81Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and influences diverse cellular processes, including nuclear transport, transcription, chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, cell cycle, and ribosomal biogenesis (7Gareau J.R.

Conjugation of all three SUMOs to substrates requires the dimeric SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE1/SAE2) and the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which catalyzes the covalent linkage to an ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue in the substrate, frequently within the SUMOylation consensus motif (SCM) ψKXE (where ψ is a large hydrophobic residue; X is any residue) (8Wilkinson K.A. Henley J.M. Mechanisms, regulation and consequences of protein SUMOylation.Biochem. J. 2010; 428 (20462400): 133-14510.1042/BJ20100158Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Unlike SUMO1, SUMO2/3 both contain an SCM to allow formation of Lys-11–linked poly-SUMO chains (10Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. Polymeric chains of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are conjugated to protein substrates by SAE1/SAE2 and Ubc9.J. Biol.

Although substrates containing SCM can be SUMOylated in cell-free reactions with a high concentration of Ubc9 (11Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Structural basis for E2-mediated SUMO conjugation revealed by a complex between ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and RanGAP1.Cell. 2002; 108 (11853669): 345-35610.1016/S0092-8674(02)00630-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), most SUMOylation in cells needs to be accelerated by one of several SUMO ligases (E3s) (8Wilkinson K.A. Henley J.M. Mechanisms, regulation and consequences of protein SUMOylation.Biochem. J. 2010; 428 (20462400): 133-14510.1042/BJ20100158Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), which also confer substrate selectivity. SUMOylation of most proteins can be readily reversed by SUMO-specific proteases (12Hickey C.M. Wilson N.R. Hochstrasser M. Function and regulation of SUMO proteases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 (23175280): 755-76610.1038/nrm3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These proteases maintain basal SUMO conjugate levels low in cells normally, which allows cells to trigger robust modification with SUMO, especially SUMO2/3 chains upon stressful conditions (e.g. oxidative stress, hypoxia, osmotic stress, DNA damage, or heat shock) (5van der Veen A.G. Ploegh H.L. Ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81 (22404627): 323-35710.1146/annurev-biochem-093010-153308Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The biological effects of SUMOylation are mediated by the binding between SUMO and proteins containing SUMO–interaction motifs (SIMs) (13Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: a regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2013; 82 (23746258): 357-38510.1146/annurev-biochem-061909-093311Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Although SUMO binds SIMs with a weak affinity (in the low-micromolar range), in cells the SUMO–SIM interactions are frequently multivalent (by binding to proteins harboring multiple SIMs (13Flotho A. Melchior F. Sumoylation: a regulatory protein modification in health and disease.Annu. Rev.

Jentsch S. Protein group modification and synergy in the SUMO pathway as exemplified in DNA repair.Cell. 2012; 151 (23122649): 807-82010.1016/j.cell.2012.10.021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar)), resulting in formation of phase-separated protein condensates (15Banani S.F.

The major SUMO-rich protein condensate is the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body (PML-NB) (16Lallemand-Breitenbach V. de Thé H. PML nuclear bodies: from architecture to function.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2018; 52 (29723661): 154-16110.1016/j.ceb.2018.03.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the main site in cells for protein SUMOylation. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, its main component, the PML protein, is fused with the retinoic acid receptor α, which causes disorganization of PML-NB (17Ablain J. Rice K. Soilihi H. de Reynies A.

By contrast, PML-NBs become more prominent when cells are exposed to oxidative stress (19Sahin U. Ferhi O. Jeanne M. Benhenda S. Berthier C. Jollivet F. Niwa-Kawakita M. Faklaris O.

Although their exact role is still uncertain, PML-NBs and the associated SUMOylated proteins have been implicated in many nuclear processes, including transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle, apoptosis, and senescence (24Sahin U. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. de Thé H. PML nuclear bodies: regulation, function and therapeutic perspectives.J. Pathol. 2014; 234 (25138686): 289-29110.1002/path.4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, PML knockout mice are viable, although they have a higher incidence of tumors (25Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. PML is essential for multiple apoptotic pathways.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20 (9806545): 266-27210.1038/3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). SUMO-mediated association of PML proteins constitutes the nucleation event in PML-NB formation, and PML thus functions as a scaffold to bind both the SUMO-E2 Ubc9 and certain substrates to facilitate their SUMOylation (26Shen T.H. Lin H.K. Scaglioni P.P. Yung T.M. Pandolfi P.P. The mechanisms of PML-nuclear body formation.Mol.

Protein modifications by ubiquitination and SUMOylation have been reported to influence each other. Many lysine residues on substrates can be modified with either Ub or SUMO2/3. In fact, a systematic analysis of many thousands of SUMOylation sites revealed that 24% can also be ubiquitinated (28Hendriks I.A. D'Souza R.C. Yang B. Verlaan-de Vries M. Mann M. Vertegaal A.C. Uncovering global SUMOylation signaling networks in a site-specific manner.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 (25218447): 927-93610.1038/nsmb.2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Competition between SUMO and Ub conjugation for modification of the same lysine has been characterized for several proteins, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (29Zilio N. Eifler-Olivi K. Ulrich H.D. Functions of SUMO in the maintenance of genome stability.Adv. Exp. Med.

Abd Elghani F. Bandopadhyay R. Engelender S. SUMOylation and ubiquitination reciprocally regulate α-synuclein degradation and pathological aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, SUMOylation serves as a signal for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of many proteins (32Tatham M.H. Geoffroy M.C. Shen L. Plechanovova A. Hattersley N. Jaffray E.G. Palvimo J.J. Hay R.T. RNF4 is a poly-SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase required for arsenic-induced PML degradation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10 (18408734): 538-54610.1038/ncb1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Chains of SUMO2/3 recruit SUMO-targeted Ub ligases (STUbLs) to promote the polyubiquitination of SUMOylated proteins, which leads to their degradation by proteasomes (32Tatham M.H. Geoffroy M.C. Shen L. Plechanovova A. Hattersley N. Jaffray E.G. Palvimo J.J. Hay R.T. RNF4 is a poly-SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase required for arsenic-induced PML degradation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10 (18408734): 538-54610.1038/ncb1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). For example, in humans, the main STUbL, RNF4, is important for triggering the degradation of PML upon arsenic trioxide treatment (32Tatham M.H. Geoffroy M.C. Shen L. Plechanovova A. Hattersley N. Jaffray E.G. Palvimo J.J. Hay R.T. RNF4 is a poly-SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase required for arsenic-induced PML degradation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10 (18408734): 538-54610.1038/ncb1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and of DNA repair factors following homologous recombination (33Yin Y. Seifert A. Chua J.S. Maure J.F. Golebiowski F. Hay R.T. SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 is required for the response of human cells to DNA damage.Genes Dev. 2012; 26 (22661230): 1196-120810.1101/gad.189274.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 34Galanty Y.

STUbL-mediated ubiquitination following SUMOylation at PML-NBs also appears to play an important role in protein quality control in the nucleus. For example, in certain cell models of neurodegenerative disease, this pathway promotes the clearance of the causative nuclear proteins bearing an expanded polyglutamine sequence, including Ataxin1 and Huntingtin mutants (27Guo L. Giasson B.I. Glavis-Bloom A. Brewer M.D. Shorter J. Gitler A.D. Yang X. A cellular system that degrades misfolded proteins and protects against neurodegeneration.Mol.

Protein ubiquitination and SUMOylation frequently increase together under conditions such as proteasome inhibition (35Tatham M.H. Matic I. Mann M. Hay R.T. Comparative proteomic analysis identifies a role for SUMO in protein quality control.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4 (21693764): rs410.1126/scisignal.2001484Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and heat shock (36Golebiowski F. Matic I. Tatham M.H. Cole C. Yin Y. Nakamura A. Cox J. Barton G.J. Mann M. Hay R.T. System-wide changes to SUMO modifications in response to heat shock.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2 (19471022): ra2410.1126/scisignal.2000282Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), both of which cause the accumulation of many misfolded proteins. Upon proteasome inhibition, SUMOylation of mostly newly-synthesized proteins increases, whereas upon heat shock, there is greater SUMOylation of long-lived pre-existent cell proteins (35Tatham M.H. Matic I. Mann M. Hay R.T. Comparative proteomic analysis identifies a role for SUMO in protein quality control.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4 (21693764): rs410.1126/scisignal.2001484Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The basis for the simultaneous increases in these two modifications is unclear. In this study, we used a selective inhibitor of the UAE, TAK243 (37Barghout S.H. Patel P.S. Wang X. Xu G.W. Kavanagh S. Halgas O. Zarabi S.F. Gronda M. Hurren R. Jeyaraju D.V. MacLean N. Brennan S. Hyer M.L. Berger A. Traore T. et al.Preclinical evaluation of the selective small-molecule UBA1 inhibitor, TAK-243, in acute myeloid leukemia.Leukemia. 2019; 33 (29884901): 37-5110.1038/s41375-018-0167-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Hyer M.L.

Med. 2018; 24 (29334375): 186-19310.1038/nm.4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), to investigate the consequence of blocking ubiquitination on protein turnover. We made the unexpected finding that treating cells with TAK243, although depleting cells of ubiquitinated proteins, led to a large accumulation of proteins modified by SUMO2/3 chains. We therefore carried out detailed studies to characterize this unexpected finding, to identify the SUMOylated proteins involved, and to clarify the cellular mechanisms for their modification. To block protein ubiquitination, we treated cells with TAK243, which prevents the transfer of activated Ub from UAE to Ub–E2s (38Hyer M.L. Milhollen M.A. Ciavarri J. Fleming P. Traore T. Sappal D. Huck J. Shi J. Gavin J. Brownell J. Yang Y. Stringer B. Griffin R. Bruzzese F. Soucy T. et al.A small-molecule inhibitor of the ubiquitin activating enzyme for cancer treatment.Nat. Med. 2018; 24 (29334375): 186-19310.1038/nm.4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After a 1-h treatment of neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y, M17 cells), HeLa, or U2OS cells with 10 μm TAK243, ubiquitinated proteins were no longer evident (Fig. 1A) (data not shown). However, by 3 h, there was a large surprising accumulation of proteins modified by SUMO2/3 in all four cell lines (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. S1, A–D). Inhibition of ubiquitination thus appears to trigger a general accumulation of SUMOylated proteins in mammalian cells. This accumulation of SUMOylated proteins occurred long before marked cell death or signs of apoptosis. Treatment of all four cell lines with TAK243 for 5 h did not trigger cleavage of PARP, an indicator of apoptosis (Fig. 1A and data not shown), and caused less than 25% loss of viability at 8 h (measured by the MTS assay of mitochondria function) and less than 50% at 16 h (Fig. 1C). To test whether protein SUMOylation may be an adaptive response that enhances the viability of TAK243-treated cells, we co-treated HeLa cells with both TAK243 and ML-792, an inhibitor of the SUMO E1 SAE1 (39He X. Riceberg J. Soucy T. Koenig E. Minissale J. Gallery M. Bernard H. Yang X. Liao H. Rabino C. Shah P. Xega K. Yan Z.H. Sintchak M. Bradley J. et al.Probing the roles of SUMOylation in cancer cell biology by using a selective SAE inhibitor.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 (28892090): 1164-117110.1038/nchembio.2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This possibility seems unlikely because preventing SUMOylation with a high concentration of 20 μm ML-792 alone for 20 h reduced cell viability by 25%, but ML-792 did not alter loss of viability caused by TAK243 (Fig. S1E). In these experiments (Fig. 1, A and B), we fractionated cell lysates prepared in the mild detergent (1% Triton X-100) by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), in order to distinguish soluble proteins and pelleted proteins, which are associated with large inclusions, chromatin, cytoskeleton, or organelles. Unlike ubiquitinated proteins, which are mostly soluble, the SUMOylated proteins were almost exclusively present in the 10,000 × g pellet (Fig. 1D). A similar enrichment of pelleted SUMOylated proteins has also been reported by us and others for cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (35Tatham M.H. Matic I. Mann M. Hay R.T. Comparative proteomic analysis identifies a role for SUMO in protein quality control.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4 (21693764): rs410.1126/scisignal.2001484Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 40Sha Z. Schnell H.M. Ruoff K. Goldberg A. Rapid induction of p62 and GABARAPL1 upon proteasome inhibition promotes survival before autophagy activation.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 (29535191): 1757-177610.1083/jcb.201708168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because deSUMOylation may be occurring during cell lysis and centrifugation, we also lysed cells in denaturing buffer containing 2% SDS to inactivate deSUMOylating enzymes. These conditions preserved more SUMOylated proteins, which could then be detected even in untreated cells (Fig. 1E). Nevertheless, using this lysis condition, TAK243 treatment still caused a marked accumulation of SUMOylated proteins. The SUMOylated proteins that accumulate upon proteasome inhibition appeared to be mainly newly-synthesized proteins because their buildup was blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis (35Tatham M.H. Matic I. Mann M. Hay R.T. Comparative proteomic analysis identifies a role for SUMO in protein quality control.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4 (21693764): rs410.1126/scisignal.2001484Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, addition of cycloheximide (CHX) together with the TAK243 for 2–8 h almost abolished the accumulation of SUMO2/3-modified proteins in SH-SY5Y, M17 (Fig. 1F), HeLa, and U2OS cells (Fig. S1, A–D). After lysing cells in denaturing condition, as described above to prevent deSUMOylation, we could still observe a dramatic suppression of TAK243-triggered accumulation of SUMO2/3 conjugates by CHX co-treatment (Fig. 1E). Thus TAK243 treatment, like proteasome inhibitors, appears to lead to SUMOylation selectively of newly-synthesized proteins. Upon TAK243 treatment, there was a time delay between the depletion of ubiquitinated proteins (at 1 h) and the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins (at 3 h) (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, we tested whether protein synthesis during this time delay is important for SUMOylated proteins to accumulate. M17 or SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with TAK243 for 5 h, and CHX was added after 1–4 h. After the addition of CHX at 3 h to M17 cells or at 2 h to SH-SY5Y cells, CHX could still completely block the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins measured at the end of the 5-h treatment (Fig. 1G). Therefore, new protein synthesis for 2–3 h is required for TAK243 to cause the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins. Proteotoxic stresses such"

Hyaluronan (HA) and its receptor CD44 may also participate in this process. To further understand this process, primary mouse skin fibroblasts were isolated and treated in vitro with recombinant TGF-β1 (rTGF-β1) to induce α-SMA expression. CD44 expression was also increased.

Removal of extracellular HA or inhibition of HA synthesis had no effect on α-SMA levels, suggesting a dispensable role for HA. Exploration of mechanisms linking CD44 knockdown to α-SMA induction, using RNAi and chemical inhibitors, revealed a requirement for noncanonical TGFβR signaling through p38MAPK. Decreased monomeric G-actin but increased filamentous F-actin following CD44 RNAi suggested a possible role for myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), a known regulator of α-SMA transcription and itself regulated by G-actin binding. CD44 RNAi promoted nuclear accumulation of MRTF and the binding to its transcriptional cofactor SRF. MRTF knockdown abrogated the increased α-SMA expression caused by CD44 RNAi, suggesting that MRTF is required for CD44-mediated regulation of α-SMA. Finally, chemical inhibition of p38MAPK reversed nuclear MRTF accumulation after rTGF-β1 addition or CD44 RNAi, revealing a central involvement of p38MAPK in both cases.

However, dysregulated fibrosis gives rise to many pathological conditions including keloids (3Andrews J.P. Marttala J. Macarak E. Rosenbloom J. Uitto J. Keloids: The paradigm of skin fibrosis—pathomechanisms and treatment.Matrix Biol. 2016; 51 (26844756): 37-4610.1016/j.matbio.2016.01.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), scleroderma (4van Caam A.

Nascent and cumulative expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) is one of the most well-established hallmarks for MF differentiation (7Gabbiani G. The myofibroblast in wound healing and fibrocontractive diseases.J Pathol. 2003; 200 (12845617): 500-50310.1002/path.1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Once generated, α-SMA can incorporate into actin stress fibers and produce contractile forces which play a critical role in wound closure and scar formation during wound healing (8Hinz B. Dugina V. Ballestrem C. Wehrle-Haller B. Chaponnier C. α-Smooth muscle actin is crucial for focal adhesion maturation in myofibroblasts.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14 (12808047): 2508-251910.1091/mbc.e02-11-0729Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Multiple transcriptional regulatory proteins have been identified that respond to biomechanical and metabolic signals generated after skin injury; together with specific binding partners, these proteins bind to the α-SMA promoter and regulate α-SMA gene expression (9Strauch A.R. Hariharan S. Dynamic interplay of smooth muscle α-actin gene-regulatory proteins reflects the biological complexity of myofibroblast differentiation.Biology (Basel). 2013; 2 (24832798): 555-58610.3390/biology2020555PubMed Google Scholar). One of these is serum response factor (SRF), a mammalian transcription factor that binds to a consensus sequence CArG box (CC(A/T)6GG). This serum response element (SRE) is found in smooth muscle cell–specific contractile genes (9Strauch A.R. Hariharan S. Dynamic interplay of smooth muscle α-actin gene-regulatory proteins reflects the biological complexity of myofibroblast differentiation.Biology (Basel). 2013; 2 (24832798): 555-58610.3390/biology2020555PubMed Google Scholar). Myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A), a co-activator of SRF, is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm as a result of its binding to monomeric G-actin (globular actin). In response to growth factor stimulation, or after activation of Rho/ROCK signaling and subsequent polymerization of G-actin to F-actin (filamentous actin), the amount of G-actin is decreased and MRTF is freed from sequestration, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus and bind to SRF, hence triggering serum response element–dependent α-SMA gene expression (10Olson E.N. Nordheim A. Linking actin dynamics and gene transcription to drive cellular motile functions.Nat. Rev. Mol.

TGF-β and its downstream effectors constitute one of the most potent regulatory cascades for α-SMA gene expression and MF differentiation. Among the three TGF-β ligands (TGF-β1, 2, 3), TGF-β1 is the predominant isoform and also the most studied in the context of MF differentiation (12Penn J.W. Grobbelaar A.O. Rolfe K.J.

Binding of TGF-β1 to TGFβ Receptor II (TβRII) facilitates the formation of a heterotetrameric complex between the TβRII homodimer and the TGFβ Receptor I (TβRI) homodimer. This results in the phosphorylation of the GS domain of TβRI and the activation of TβRI receptor kinase activity, leading to recruitment and phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads: Smad2 and Smad3). Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 rapidly dissociate from TβRI and form a complex with Smad4, which translocates to the nucleus and activates α-SMA gene transcription (14Akhurst R.J. Hata A. Targeting the TGFβ signalling pathway in disease.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2012; 11 (23000686): 790-81110.1038/nrd3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Although the Smad-dependent signaling pathway is widely accepted as the canonical pathway induced by TGF-β1, accumulating evidence has shown that TGF-β1 can also activate a number of other Smad-independent signaling pathways that involve mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as ERK1/2, JNK, p38MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and RhoA (15Kim S.I. Choi M.E. TGF-β-activated kinase-1: New insights into the mechanism of TGF-β signaling and kidney disease.Kidney Res. Clin.

Many of these molecules are also involved in α-SMA gene regulation in a tissue and cell context–dependent manner (15Kim S.I. Choi M.E.

In particular, studies from different groups have shown a role for p38MAPK signaling during fibrotic processes within tissues and organs as diverse as the kidney (16Stambe C. Nikolic-Paterson D.J.

CD44 is a type I transmembrane proteoglycan with multiple isoforms that arise from alternative splicing of 10 variable exons; the most widely expressed isoform is the standard form (CD44s) (19Ponta H.

CD44 not only mediates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, but also binds growth factors and interacts with a number of growth factor receptors within the cell membrane, thereby exerting a complex role in the regulation of cell growth, survival, and differentiation (19Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. CD44: From adhesion molecules to signalling regulators.Nat. Rev. Mol.

CD44 is also the principal receptor for hyaluronan (HA), a major constituent of the extracellular matrix and a mediator of some aspects of CD44 signaling (22Knudson W. Chow G. Knudson C.B. CD44-mediated uptake and degradation of hyaluronan.Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 15-2310.1016/S0945-053X(01)00186-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). HA is a negatively charged, unbranched, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan consisting of alternating disaccharide units of d-glucuronic acid and GlcNAc. HA is synthesized by HA-synthase enzymes (Has1, Has2, Has3) and degraded by hyaluronidases (Hyal1 and Hyal2) (23Maytin E.V.

Importantly, HA has been demonstrated to be involved in profibrotic signaling and myofibroblast differentiation in human lung fibroblasts (24Webber J. Jenkins R.H. Meran S. Phillips A. Steadman R. Modulation of TGFβ1-dependent myofibroblast differentiation by hyaluronan.Am. J.

Tammi M.I. Hyaluronan accumulation in wounded epidermis: A mediator of keratinocyte activation.J. Invest.

When considering CD44 and HA and their role in regulating TGF-β–mediated profibrotic signaling and MF differentiation, many issues remain unresolved because different groups have generated contradictory results. In some experimental systems, both HA and CD44 appear to be supportive and stimulatory for TGF-β–driven MF differentiation. For example, Simpson et al. (28Simpson R.M. Wells A. Thomas D. Stephens P. Steadman R. Phillips A. Aging fibroblasts resist phenotypic maturation because of impaired hyaluronan-dependent CD44/epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.Am. J.

They further demonstrated that TGF-β1–mediated MF differentiation required an interaction between EGFR, CD44, and HA in the plasma membrane which could be disrupted by treatment with hyaluronidase or 4-MU. As another example of a stimulatory role of HA and CD44 upon fibrosis and α-SMA expression, Li et al. (30Li Y. Jiang D. Liang J. Meltzer E.B. Gray A. Miura R. Wogensen L. Yamaguchi Y. Noble P.W. Severe lung fibrosis requires an invasive fibroblast phenotype regulated by hyaluronan and CD44.J. Exp.

On the other hand, evidence from other groups showed that CD44 can have an inhibitory effect on TGF-β receptor signaling and fibrosis in some tissues. Ansorge et al. (31Ansorge H.L. Beredjiklian P.K. Soslowsky L.J. CD44 deficiency improves healing tendon mechanics and increases matrix and cytokine expression in a mouse patellar tendon injury model.J. Orthop. Res. 2009; 27 (19382192): 1386-139110.1002/jor.20891Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) found that in a tendon-healing model, loss of CD44 (CD44 knockout mice) led to significant increases in the gene expression of TGF-β1, TGF-β3, and COL3A1, as well as in parameters indicative of good tissue repair such as material strength and tissue organization. Porsch et al. (32Porsch H. Mehić M. Olofsson B. Heldin P. Heldin C.H. Platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor, transforming growth factor β type I receptor, and CD44 protein modulate each other’s signaling and stability.J. Biol.

Depletion of CD44 promoted TGF-β receptor signaling activity, implying that CD44 is a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling in these fibroblasts. In a third example, Velasco et al. (33Velasco J. Li J. DiPietro L. Stepp M.A. Sandy J.D. Plaas A. Adamts5 deletion blocks murine dermal repair through CD44-mediated aggrecan accumulation and modulation of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) signaling.J. Biol.

These contrasting examples suggest that the mechanistic relationship between CD44- and TGF-β–mediated regulation of fibrotic responses remains unclear. In this study, we sought to obtain a better understanding of how CD44 regulates TGF-β signaling and expression of α-SMA in primary murine dermal fibroblasts. We studied the impact of inhibiting CD44 gene expression by RNAi and observed an up-regulation of α-SMA. This was accompanied by changes in the cytoskeleton including an increase in F-actin polymerization, in parallel with an observed increase in nuclear accumulation of MRTF. Interestingly, CD44-mediated effects appeared to be entirely independent of HA, and although TGF-β signaling was also involved, p38MAPK rather than Smad2 turned out to be the relevant downstream effector. The various isoforms of CD44, including the standard form (CD44s) and other variants, are expressed in a tissue and cell context–dependent manner (19Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. CD44: From adhesion molecules to signalling regulators.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4 (12511867): 33-4510.1038/nrm1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). We examined the expression of CD44 in murine dermal fibroblasts, and in primary murine keratinocytes and epithelial cancer cells for comparison, by Western blotting using a polyclonal pan-CD44 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, left, CD44s was the only detectable form of CD44 in fibroblasts, as confirmed by a specific knockdown experiment in which the other bands are not responsive to CD44 RNAi and therefore are nonspecific (Fig. 1A, right), and in contrast to primary keratinocytes and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells that express CD44E (34Brown T.A. Bouchard T. St. John T. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Human keratinocytes express a new CD44 core protein (CD44E) as a heparan-sulfate intrinsic membrane proteoglycan with additional exons.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113 (2007624): 207-22110.1083/jcb.113.1.207Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and CD44v6 (35Afify A. Purnell P. Nguyen L. Role of CD44s and CD44v6 on human breast cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invasion.Exp. Mol.

In primary murine fibroblasts, CD44 was shown to be up-regulated at both the protein and mRNA level in response to treatment with rTGF-β1 (Fig. 1B). Because CD44 has been shown to facilitate TGF-β–driven myofibroblast differentiation in human lung fibroblasts (28Simpson R.M. Wells A. Thomas D. Stephens P. Steadman R. Phillips A. Aging fibroblasts resist phenotypic maturation because of impaired hyaluronan-dependent CD44/epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.Am. J.

We tested this hypothesis by knocking down CD44 via RNAi. To our surprise, the expression of α-SMA was further increased in response to CD44 RNAi, at both the mRNA (Fig. 1C) and protein levels (Fig. 1D). In addition, the formation of α-SMA–positive stress fibers was significantly enhanced in fibroblasts treated with CD44 RNAi, as analyzed by immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 1E). To further clarify the role of CD44s in regulating α-SMA gene expression, we forcibly expressed a CD44s plasmid vector (37Schmitt M. Metzger M. Gradl D. Davidson G. Orian-Rousseau V. CD44 functions in Wnt signaling by regulating LRP6 localization and activation.Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22 (25301071): 677-68910.1038/cdd.2014.156Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) in fibroblasts and observed down-regulation of α-SMA expression on Western blots (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, cotransfection of CD44s plasmid and CD44 RNAi effectively attenuated the increase in α-SMA levels induced by CD44 RNAi alone (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that forced expression of the standard form of CD44 is inhibitory to α-SMA gene expression. We then sought to investigate the impact of changes in CD44 expression levels on cell migration. Confluent monolayers of primary murine skin fibroblasts, transfected with either CD44-targeted siRNA or a CD44s-expressing plasmid, were subjected to an in vitro scratch wound healing assay. Wound closure rates were measured at different time points and compared among different treatment groups. As shown in Fig. S1A, CD44 RNAi inhibited migration of the fibroblasts. On the other hand, forced expression of the standard form of CD44 promoted migration of the fibroblasts (Fig. S1B). Because CD44 is the principal receptor for HA on plasma membranes of most cell types, including fibroblasts, and because HA is a critical regulator of profibrotic signaling and MF differentiation in some tissues (see the Introduction), we investigated whether HA is involved in regulating the expression of α-SMA in primary skin fibroblasts during manipulation of CD44 and/or TGF-β levels. Extracellular HA was removed by treating fibroblast cultures with hyaluronidase, and the efficient removal of extracellular HA was verified by immunofluorescent staining using HA-binding proteins as described previously (data not shown) (38Wang Y. Lauer M.E. Anand S. Mack J.A. Maytin E.V. Hyaluronan synthase 2 protects skin fibroblasts against apoptosis induced by environmental stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (25266724): 32253-3226510.1074/jbc.M114.578377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cultures were subsequently treated with or without rTGF-β1 for 48 h. Western blot analysis showed that α-SMA gene expression was not altered by hyaluronidase treatment, whether in the absence or presence of rTGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 3A). Addition of 4-MU, a compound known to inhibit HA synthesis (38Wang Y. Lauer M.E. Anand S. Mack J.A. Maytin E.V. Hyaluronan synthase 2 protects skin fibroblasts against apoptosis induced by environmental stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (25266724): 32253-3226510.1074/jbc.M114.578377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), also failed to alter α-SMA gene expression (Fig. 3B). A third manipulation was to knock down Has2, the functionally predominant Has enzyme in murine skin fibroblasts (38Wang Y. Lauer M.E. Anand S. Mack J.A. Maytin E.V. Hyaluronan synthase 2 protects skin fibroblasts against apoptosis induced by environmental stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (25266724): 32253-3226510.1074/jbc.M114.578377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Knockdown efficacies of Has2 and CD44 were verified by qPCR analyses (Fig. 3C). An examination of HA levels by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) analysis (Fig. 3D) showed that Has2 RNAi alone or together with CD44 RNAi significantly reduced the quantity of HA, both in the cell layer and in the conditioned media. However, despite marked reduction in HA levels because of Has2 knockdown, no effect on α-SMA expression was observed (Fig. 3E). CD44 knockdown on the other hand, either alone or in combination with rTGF-β1 treatment, led to consistent increases in α-SMA expression (Fig. 3E), as observed previously. Given previous strong evidence for an important role for TGF-β signaling in regulating α-SMA gene expression, and for the involvement of CD44 (either positive or negative) upon TGFβR-regulated signaling (see the Introduction), we sought to determine which components of the TGF-β signaling cascade might be involved in the up-regulation of α-SMA caused by CD44 knockdown. Fibroblasts were pretreated with individual chemical inhibitors for membrane receptors (TGFβR or EGFR) or with RNAi or chemical inhibitors for midlevel signaling molecules (SMADs, ERK, and p38), followed by transfection with CD44 RNAi and addition of rTGF-β1. As shown in Fig. 4, A, C, and D, inhibition of TGFβR but not inhibition of EGFR suppressed α-SMA gene expression at baseline and abrogated the increased α-SMA gene expression induced by either CD44 RNAi or rTGF-β1 treatment. To investigate how CD44 knockdown might affect SMAD-dependent TGF-β signaling, fibroblasts were transfected with either nontargeted or CD44 RNAi for 48 h, then synchronized by serum starvation for another 24 h, followed by addition of rTGF-β1 in the media. As shown in Fig. S2A, exposure to rTGF-β1 initiated a rapid increase in phosphorylated Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad3. However, CD44 RNAi had no effect on these phosphorylations relative to scrambled RNAi controls, as analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. S2A). Furthermore, Smad2 RNAi failed to alter α-SMA gene expression in murine skin fibroblasts either at baseline or in response to rTGF-β1 treatment, nor alter the induction caused by CD44 RNAi (Fig. S3), suggesting that SMAD-mediated TGF-β signaling is dispensable for the regulation of α-SMA expression in murine skin fibroblasts. CD44 RNAi also did not alter the overall pattern of rTGF-β1–induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. S2B). Knockdown of CD44 exerted a mild effect on p38, with a shift in the kinetics of rTGF-β1–induced phosphorylation (peak shifted from 30 min in control cells to 6 h in CD44 knocked down cells, with both returning to baseline by 12 h) (Fig. S2C). Although no involvement of SMAD signaling in the TGF-β–mediated regulation of α-SMA was observed in these fibroblasts, one of the Smads was found to be involved in regulating CD44 expression.

The HPLC analysis was performed using the Kinetex RP18 chromatographic column and eluent consisting of methanol-water-0.1% formic acid (5–100% (v/v)) at 30 °C with the run time of 60 min. and the detection wavelength 280 nm. The chromatograms were preliminary processed with the smoothing, noise reduction, background subtraction and alignment using the SpecAlign program (version 2.4.1). The presence of selected standards (apigenin, myricetin, luteolin, luteolin 7-glucoside, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid) in the extracts was confirmed. The chemical similarity between studied plants was evaluated using the Cluster Analysis (Pearson correlation coefficient, r, and Euclidean) and PCA. The preliminary antioxidant activity of studied extracts was evaluated based on the total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu method), ferric ion reducing antioxidant parameter (FRAP) and α,α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging method using the spectrophotometric technique."
https://openalex.org/W2959013617,"A common means of vaccination coverage measurement is the administrative method, done by dividing the aggregated number of doses administered over a set period (numerator) by the target population (denominator). To assess the quality of national target populations, we defined nine potential denominator data inconsistencies or flags that would warrant further exploration and examination of data reported by Member States to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF between 2000 and 2016.We used the denominator reported to calculate national coverage for BCG, a tuberculosis vaccine, and for the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing (DTP3) vaccines, usually live births (LB) and surviving infants (SI), respectively. Out of 2,565 possible reporting events (data points for countries using administrative coverage with the vaccine in the schedule and year) for BCG and 2,939 possible reporting events for DTP3, 194 and 274 reporting events were missing, respectively. Reported coverage exceeding 100% was seen in 11% of all reporting events for BCG and in 6% for DTP3. Of all year-to-year percent differences in reported denominators, 12% and 11% exceeded 10% for reported LB and SI, respectively. The implied infant mortality rate, based on the country's reported LB and SI, would be negative in 9% of all reporting events i.e., the country reported more SI than LB for the same year. Overall, reported LB and SI tended to be lower than the UN Population Division 2017 estimates, which would lead to overestimation of coverage, but this difference seems to be decreasing over time. Other inconsistencies were identified using the nine proposed criteria.Applying a set of criteria to assess reported target populations used to estimate administrative vaccination coverage can flag potential quality issues related to the national denominators and may be useful to help monitor ongoing efforts to improve the quality of vaccination coverage estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2957867605,"Radiotherapy is a common treatment option for head and neck cancer patients; however, the surrounding healthy salivary glands are often incidentally irradiated during the process. As a result, patients often experience persistent xerostomia and hyposalivation, which deceases their quality of life. Clinically, there is currently no standard of care available to restore salivary function. Repair of epithelial wounds involves cellular proliferation and establishment of polarity in order to regenerate the tissue. This process is partially mediated by protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), an apical polarity regulator; however, its role following radiation damage is not completely understood. Using an in vivo radiation model, we show a significant decrease in active PKCζ in irradiated murine parotid glands, which correlates with increased proliferation that is sustained through 30 days post-irradiation. Additionally, salivary glands in PKCζ null mice show increased basal proliferation which radiation treatment did not further potentiate. Radiation damage also activates Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a proliferation-inducing mitogen-activated protein kinase normally inhibited by PKCζ. In both a PKCζ null mouse model and in primary salivary gland cell cultures treated with a PKCζ inhibitor, there was increased JNK activity and production of downstream proliferative transcripts. Collectively, these findings provide a potential molecular link by which PKCζ suppression following radiation damage promotes JNK activation and radiation-induced compensatory proliferation in the salivary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2961015539,"Air pollution inhaled dose is the product of pollutant concentration and minute ventilation (). Previous studies have parameterized the relationship between and variables such as heart rate (HR) and have observed substantial inter-subject variability. In this paper, we evaluate a method to estimate with easy-to-measure variables in an analysis of pooled-data from eight independent studies. We compiled a large diverse data set that is balanced with respect to age, sex and fitness level. We used linear mixed models to estimate with HR, breath frequency (fB), age, sex, height, and forced vital capacity (FVC) as predictors. FVC was estimated using the Global Lung Function Initiative method. We log-transformed the dependent and independent variables to produce a model in the form of a power function and assessed model performance using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure. The best performing model using HR as the only field-measured parameter was = e-9.59HR2.39age0.274sex-0.204FVC0.520 with HR in beats per minute, age in years, sex is 1 for males and 2 for females, FVC in liters, and a median(IQR) cross-validated percent error of 0.664(45.4)%. The best performing model overall was = e-8.57HR1.72fB0.611age0.298sex-0.206FVC0.614, where fB is breaths per minute, and a median(IQR) percent error of 1.20(37.9)%. The performance of these models is substantially better than any previously-published model when evaluated using this large pooled-data set. We did not observe an independent effect of height on , nor an effect of race, though this may have been due to insufficient numbers of non-white participants. We did observe an effect of FVC such that these models over- or under-predict in persons whose measured FVC was substantially lower or higher than estimated FVC, respectively. Although additional measurements are necessary to confirm this finding regarding FVC, we recommend using measured FVC when possible."
https://openalex.org/W2960164751,"Two out of 41 non-small cell lung cancer patients enrolled in a clinical study were found with a somatic CRAF mutation in their tumor, namely CRAFP261A and CRAFP207S. To our knowledge, both mutations are novel in lung cancer and CRAFP261A has not been previously reported in cancer. Expression of CRAFP261A in HEK293T cells and BEAS-2B lung epithelial cells led to increased ERK pathway activation in a dimer-dependent manner, accompanied with loss of CRAF phosphorylation at the negative regulatory S259 residue. Moreover, stable expression of CRAFP261A in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and BEAS-2B cells led to anchorage-independent growth. Consistent with a previous report, we could not observe a gain-of-function with CRAFP207S. Type II but not type I RAF inhibitors suppressed the CRAFP261A-induced ERK pathway activity in BEAS-2B cells, and combinatorial treatment with type II RAF inhibitors and a MEK inhibitor led to a stronger ERK pathway inhibition and growth arrest. Our findings suggest that the acquisition of a CRAFP261A mutation can provide oncogenic properties to cells, and that such cells are sensitive to combined MEK and type II RAF inhibitors. CRAF mutations should be diagnostically and therapeutically explored in lung and perhaps other cancers."

PfCRT is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, palmitoylation, and, possibly, ubiquitination. However, the impact of these post-translational modifications on P. falciparum biology and, in particular, the drug resistance–conferring activity of PfCRT has remained elusive. Here, we confirm phosphorylation at Ser-33 and Ser-411 of PfCRT of the chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strain Dd2 and show that kinase inhibitors can sensitize drug responsiveness. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate genetically engineered PfCRT variants in the parasite, we further show that substituting Ser-33 with alanine reduced chloroquine and quinine resistance by ∼50% compared with the parental P. falciparum strain Dd2, whereas the phosphomimetic amino acid aspartic acid could fully and glutamic acid could partially reconstitute the level of chloroquine/quinine resistance. Transport studies conducted in the parasite and in PfCRT-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes linked phosphomimetic substitution at Ser-33 to increased transport velocity. Our data are consistent with phosphorylation of Ser-33 relieving an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction within PfCRT, leading to a stimulated drug transport activity.

The functional roles of these modifications are largely obscure. The only exception is the phosphorylation of Thr-416 that serves as a trafficking and sorting signal directing PfCRT from the endoplasmic reticulum to the digestive vacuolar membrane (13Kuhn Y.

Commun. 2011; 2 (22127061): 56510.1038/ncomms1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we initially examined the phosphorylation pattern of the drug resistance–conferring PfCRT variant (PfCRTDd2) from the chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strain Dd2. Nano-LC coupled to tandem MS identified phosphorylation of Ser-33, Ser-411 (Fig. 1, A and B), and Thr-416 of PfCRTDd2. In addition to the phosphorylated forms, we also detected the unmodified amino acids. Phosphorylation of Ser-420 was not detected; only the unmodified form was observed. To test the hypothesis of whether phosphorylation plays a role in the drug resistance–conferring activity of PfCRT, we screened nine different kinase inhibitors and one phosphatase inhibitor for an effect on chloroquine accumulation in Dd2. To this end, parasitized erythrocytes at the trophozoite stage (24–36 h postinvasion) were incubated for 5 min in medium containing 42 nm [3H]chloroquine and the respective protein kinase or phosphatase inhibitor before the amount of label taken up was determined. The selected protein kinase inhibitors included inhibitors of protein kinases A and C (ML-7, ET-18-OCH3, and chelerythrine), casein kinases (TBB), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (W7 and KN-93), tyrosine kinases (tyrphostin A25), and general kinase inhibitors, such as H-89 and rottlerin (33Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Specificity and mechanism of action of some commonly used protein kinase inhibitors.Biochem.

As a phosphatase inhibitor, we used okadaic acid, a blocker of serine/threonine protein phosphatases (35Dounay A.B. Forsyth C.J. Okadaic acid: the archetypal serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor.Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9 (12369865): 1939-198010.2174/0929867023368791Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, only ML-7, W7, H-89, and rottlerin significantly increased the amount of chloroquine taken up by P. falciparum clone Dd2 (p < 0.05, according to Student's t test). Interestingly, three of the compounds, namely ML-7, W7, and H-89, are structurally related naphthalenesulfonamide and isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives, whereas rottlerin is an unrelated natural polyphenolic compound. We selected ML-7 for further analysis and tested the effect of increasing concentrations of ML-7, ranging from 0 to 30 μm, on chloroquine accumulation. The amount of chloroquine taken up by Dd2 increased with rising ML-7 concentrations until 10 μm before it declined, possibly due to cytotoxic effects (Fig. 2B). In comparison, the chloroquine-sensitive strain HB3 accumulated chloroquine to high levels despite ML-7, and only at toxic concentrations of >10 μm did the amount of chloroquine taken up decline (Fig. 2B). Comparable accumulation-response profiles have been reported for verapamil and other chemosensitizers of chloroquine resistance (36Sanchez C.P. McLean J.E. Stein W. Lanzer M. Evidence for a substrate specific and inhibitable drug efflux system in chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains.Biochemistry. 2004; 43 (15610031): 16365-1637310.1021/bi048241xCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We further evaluated the in vitro antiplasmodial activity of ML-7 in the standard growth inhibition assay and obtained IC50 values of 21 ± 4 and 36 ± 4 μm for Dd2 and HB3, respectively (Fig. 2C). An ML-7 concentration of 2.5 μm had only a mild, if any, cytotoxic effect on parasite development and was subsequently used in growth inhibition assays together with chloroquine or quinine. The addition of 2.5 μm ML-7 to the medium sensitized chloroquine resistance in Dd2, resulting in a significantly reduced chloroquine IC50 value, from 140 ± 10 nm in the absence of ML-7 to 76 ± 4 nm in the presence of ML-7 (p < 0.001, according to Student's t test) (Fig. 3A). Similarly, ML-7 sensitized Dd2 to quinine, with quinine IC50 values dropping from 260 ± 15 to 130 ± 15 nm (p < 0.001, according to Student's t test) (Fig. 3B). In comparison, ML-7 did not affect the responsiveness of HB3 to chloroquine or quinine (Fig. 3, A and B). As a control, we investigated the impact of ML-7 on pyrimethamine responsiveness. Pyrimethamine targets the dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate synthase of the parasite, and resistance to pyrimethamine is conferred by discrete point mutations in this bifunctional enzyme (37Heinberg A. Kirkman L. The molecular basis of antifolate resistance in Plasmodium falciparum: looking beyond point mutations.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2015; 1342 (25694157): 10-1810.1111/nyas.12662Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). No effects of ML-7 on pyrimethamine responses were found in HB3 and Dd2 (Fig. 3C). These data provide the first evidence of phosphorylation possibly influencing PfCRT-mediated drug responses. To verify a role of phosphorylation in PfCRT-conferred drug responses, we attempted to substitute alanine for serine residues at positions 33 and 411 in the sequence of PfCRT in Dd2 using trace-free genome editing technology via the CRISPR/Cas9 system (38Ghorbal M. Gorman M. Macpherson C.R. Martins R.M. Scherf A. Lopez-Rubio J.J. Genome editing in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32 (24880488): 819-82110.1038/nbt.2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These two residues were chosen for further analysis because they were the predominant phosphorylation events with unknown function in the biology of PfCRT (see Fig. 1). Despite numerous attempts, we could not obtain the desired mutation for the S411A replacement. However, we were able to obtain the S33A mutation in several independent transfection experiments (Fig. 4A). Two independent clones, termed B5 S33A and B6 S33A, were subsequently isolated by limiting dilution, and the desired mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis of the entire genomic pfcrt gene and the transcribed pfcrt mRNA (Fig. 4B). With the exception of the S33A substitution, PfCRT remained of the Dd2-type. Both mutants expressed PfCRT at the digestive vacuolar membrane as shown by immunofluorescence assays using a specific rabbit antiserum to PfCRT (Fig. 5A). The total amount of PfCRT expressed in the two mutant clones was comparable with that of the parental Dd2 strain according to semiquantitative Western analyses with tubulin serving as an internal loading control (Fig. 5B).Figure 5Localization, expression, and stability of mutated PfCRT variants in P. falciparum.

In this work, 20,319 water samples were collected in 3,983 environmental surveys during a 16-year period by ARPA, the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection, Friuli Venezia Giulia, and the results were studied to better understand the diffusion mechanisms of Legionella. The data showed a strong seasonal signal, a prevalence of L. pneumophila serogroup 2-15 in most environments (63% of positive samples), a prevalence of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 in swimming pool-associated environments (82% of positive samples), a persistent presence of Legionella in hospitals and a recurrent presence of Legionella in other facilities such as hotels, possibly years after interventions, highlighting the difficulty of eradicating the bacteria. Retrospective spatio-temporal analyses on geocoded historical data were carried out with SaTScan using an ordinal model with risk as a covariate to identify potential clusters with an excess of cases in the higher-risk categories. Although no outbreaks occurred during the period of study, such analyses identified spatially restricted zones with unusual contamination, which sometimes were also areas in which several surveys triggered by notifications of clinical cases were performed. Simulations of periodic prospective analyses permitted the assessment of the efficacy of the method in early detection of such clusters. The proposed method may be a useful tool in environmental surveillance, prevention and control of Legionella."

Thus, the present study investigated the relationship between delay detection ability and agency judgment using the delay detection task and the agency attribution task. Fifty-eight participants performed the delay detection and agency attribution tasks, and the time windows of each measure were analyzed using logistic curve fitting. The results revealed that the time window of judgment of agency was significantly longer than that of delay detection, and there was a slight correlation between the time windows in each task. The results supported a two-step model of agency, suggesting that judgment of agency involved not only comparison of multisensory information but also several cognitive factors.

The aim of the current paper was the assessment of fencer’s performance and response time in lunge attacks under uncertain conditions. For this study, an innovative fencing lunge simulator was designed. The performance of 11 regional to national-level fencers performing lunges in Fixed, Moving and Uncertain conditions was assessed. The results highlighted notably that i) Accuracy and success decreased significantly in Moving and Uncertain conditions with regard to Fixed ones ii) Movement and Reaction times were also affected by the experimental conditions iii) Different fencer profiles were distinguishable among subjects. In conclusion, the hypothesis that fencers may privilege an adaptation to the attack conditions and preserve accuracy instead of privileging quickness was supported by the results. Such simulators may be further used to analyze in more detail the motor control strategies of fencers through the measure and processing of biomechanical quantities and a wider range of fencing levels. It has also a great potential to be used as training device to improve fencer’s performance to adapt his attack to controlled opponent’s motion."
https://openalex.org/W2960149577,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate the innate immune responses, such as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines after vaccination can cause local adverse reactions, such as pain, itching, swelling, and redness. Previous studies have shown that circulating EV miR-451a regulates innate immune responses, and miR-451a levels in serum EVs are negatively correlated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels in response to the influenza vaccine. Since excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production is a cause of the local adverse reactions to vaccination, we investigated whether miR-451a levels in serum EVs correlate with local symptoms at the vaccination site, such as pain, itching, swelling, and redness. Interestingly, miR-451a levels in serum EVs were inversely correlated with the number of symptoms after vaccination. We determined the level of several other immune-regulatory miRNAs in serum EVs. Using the immune-regulatory miRNA levels of miR-22, miR-29a, miR-451a, and miR-107, we calculated a normalized miRNA level for each healthy donor and found that the normalized miRNA levels were significantly correlated with the number of local symptoms after vaccination. Our data indicated that immune-regulatory miRNA levels in serum EVs can be used as biomarkers to assess local symptoms after influenza vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2956519951,"We have previously described a native human monoclonal antibody, TRL1068, that disrupts bacterial biofilms by extracting from the biofilm matrix key scaffolding proteins in the DNABII family, which are present in both gram positive and gram negative bacterial species. The antibiotic resistant sessile bacteria released from the biofilm then revert to the antibiotic sensitive planktonic state. Qualitative resensitization to antibiotics has been demonstrated in three rodent models of acute infections. We report here the surprising discovery that antibodies against the target family were found in all twenty healthy humans surveyed, albeit at a low level requiring a sensitive single B-cell assay for detection. We have cloned 21 such antibodies. Aside from TRL1068, only one (TRL1330) has all the biochemical properties believed necessary for pharmacological efficacy (broad spectrum epitope specificity and high affinity). We suggest that the other anti-DNABII antibodies, while not necessarily curative, reflect an immune response at some point in the donor’s history to these components of biofilms. Such an immune response could reflect exposure to bacterial reservoirs that have been previously described in chronic non-healing wounds, periodontal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, colorectal cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerotic artery explants. The detection of anti-DNABII antibodies in all twenty surveyed donors with no active infection suggests that bacterial biofilm reservoirs may be present periodically in most healthy individuals. Biofilms routinely shed bacteria, creating a continuous low level inflammatory stimulus. Since chronic subclinical inflammation is thought to contribute to most aging-related diseases, suppression of bacterial biofilm has potential value in delaying age-related pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2961285850,"Antigen receptor assembly in lymphocytes involves stringently-regulated coordination of specific DNA rearrangement events across several large chromosomal domains. Previous studies indicate that transcription factors such as paired box 5 (PAX5), Yin Yang 1 (YY1), and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) play a role in regulating the accessibility of the antigen receptor loci to the V(D)J recombinase, which is required for these rearrangements. To gain clues about the role of CTCF binding at the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus, we utilized a computational approach that identified 144 putative CTCF-binding sites within this locus. We found that these CTCF sites share a consensus motif distinct from other CTCF sites in the mouse genome. Additionally, we could divide these CTCF sites into three categories: intergenic sites remote from any coding element, upstream sites present within 8 kb of the VH-leader exon, and recombination signal sequence (RSS)-associated sites characteristically located at a fixed distance (∼18 bp) downstream of the RSS. We noted that the intergenic and upstream sites are located in the distal portion of the VH locus, whereas the RSS-associated sites are located in the DH-proximal region. Computational analysis indicated that the prevalence of CTCF-binding sites at the IgH locus is evolutionarily conserved. In all species analyzed, these sites exhibit a striking strand-orientation bias, with >98% of the murine sites being present in one orientation with respect to VH gene transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2962322640,"Monocytes/macrophages drive progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), an anti-inflammatory lipid, mediates atheroprotective effects. We investigated how CLA alters monocyte/macrophage phenotype during attenuated progression and regression of atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE−/−) mice were fed a high-fat (60%) high-cholesterol (1%) diet (HFHCD) for 2 wk, followed by 6-wk 1% CLA 80: 20 supplementation to investigate disease progression. Simultaneously, ApoE−/− mice were fed a 12-wk HFHCD with/without CLA for the final 4 wk to investigate regression. Aortic lesions were quantified by en face staining. Proteomic analysis, real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometry were used to interrogate monocyte/macrophage phenotypes. CLA supplementation inhibited atherosclerosis progression coincident with decreased proinflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory macrophages. However, CLA-induced regression was associated with increased proinflammatory monocytes resulting in increased proresolving M2 bone marrow-derived macrophages, splenic macrophages, and dendritic cells in lesion-draining lymph nodes. Proteomic analysis confirmed regulation of a proinflammatory bone marrow response, which was abolished upon macrophage differentiation. Thus, in attenuation and regression of atherosclerosis, regardless of the monocyte signature, during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, proresolving macrophages prevail, mediating vascular repair. This study provides novel mechanistic insight into the monocyte/macrophage phenotypes in halted atherosclerosis progression and regression of atherosclerosis.— Bruen, R., Curley, S., Kajani, S., Lynch, G., O'Reilly, M.

https://openalex.org/W2959810542,"Bioinformatics research is frequently performed using complex workflows with multiple steps, fans, merges, and conditionals. This complexity makes management of the workflow difficult on a computer cluster, especially when running in parallel on large batches of data: hundreds or thousands of samples at a time. Scientific workflow management systems could help with that. Many are now being proposed, but is there yet the ""best"" workflow management system for bioinformatics? Such a system would need to satisfy numerous, sometimes conflicting requirements: from ease of use, to seamless deployment at peta- and exa-scale, and portability to the cloud. We evaluated Swift/T as a candidate for such role by implementing a primary genomic variant calling workflow in the Swift/T language, focusing on workflow management, performance and scalability issues that arise from production-grade big data genomic analyses. In the process we introduced novel features into the language, which are now part of its open repository. Additionally, we formalized a set of design criteria for quality, robust, maintainable workflows that must function at-scale in a production setting, such as a large genomic sequencing facility or a major hospital system. The use of Swift/T conveys two key advantages. (1) It operates transparently in multiple cluster scheduling environments (PBS Torque, SLURM, Cray aprun environment, etc.), thus a single workflow is trivially portable across numerous clusters. (2) The leaf functions of Swift/T permit developers to easily swap executables in and out of the workflow, which makes it easy to maintain and to request resources optimal for each stage of the pipeline. While Swift/T's data-level parallelism eliminates the need to code parallel analysis of multiple samples, it does make debugging more difficult, as is common for implicitly parallel code. Nonetheless, the language gives users a powerful and portable way to scale up analyses in many computing architectures. The code for our implementation of a variant calling workflow using Swift/T can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/ncsa/Swift-T-Variant-Calling, with full documentation provided at http://swift-t-variant-calling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/."
https://openalex.org/W2960202442,"The hepatocyte growth factor receptor C-met plays an important role in cellular migration, which is crucial for many developmental processes as well as for cancer cell metastasis. C-met has been linked to the development of mammalian appendicular muscle, which are derived from migrating muscle progenitor cells (MMPs) from within the somite. Mammalian limbs are homologous to the teleost pectoral and pelvic fins. In this study we used Crispr/Cas9 to mutate the zebrafish met gene and found that the MMP derived musculature of the paired appendages was severely affected. The mutation resulted in a reduced muscle fibre number, in particular in the pectoral abductor, and in a disturbed pectoral fin function. Other MMP derived muscles, such as the sternohyoid muscle and posterior hypaxial muscle were also affected in met mutants. This indicates that the role of met in MMP function and appendicular myogenesis is conserved within vertebrates."

Acute exercise has been shown to decrease peripheral pulse wave velocity (pPWV) in young healthy volunteers. We hypothesized the response to acute exercise to be diminished in CAD patients compared to healthy young (HY) and age-matched (HAM) controls.In 21 patients after recent myocardial infarction (CAD), 11 HAM and 10 HY pPWV was measured by applanation tonometry at the proximal femoral artery and the posterior tibial artery at rest and from 5 to 15 min after cessation of exhaustive exercise. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored continuously. Resting central PWV (cPWV) was measured between the carotid and femoral arteries. Resting values and reponses to acute exercise were compared between the three groups and predictors for pPWV response were sought.The response in pPWV to acute exercise seen in HY (lowering in pPWV by 17%) was absent in both CAD and HAM. Resting pPWV was not statistically different between the three groups, while cPWV was comparable in CAD and HAM but 17% lower in HY. Predictors for response in pPWV to exercise were age (Spearman r = 0.48), cPWV (r = 0.34) and response in diastolic BP (r = 0.32).The response in pPWV to acute exercise observed in HY was absent in CAD and HAM. In dilated peripheral arteries, PWV may reflect stiffness of passive vessel structures, which are likely to increase with age in healthy persons and CAD alike."

The second purpose was to investigate all parameters related to platelet function on the hemogram, including the platelet count (PLT), the mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT) in patients with XFG. These parameters were subsequently compared with those belonging to normal controls, POAG and XFS subjects.This case control study involved 152 consecutive patients that were examined at the Glaucoma Department of Clinic for Eye Diseases, Clinical Centre of Serbia, as the referral center for glaucoma in Serbia, between June 2016 and December 2017.Regarding capillaroscopic characteristics, statistically significant difference was found in capillary diameter and tortuosity between the XFG and POAG group (p = 0.050 and p = 0.035) and the XFG and NC group (p = 0.003 and p = 0.044), as well as in the distribution of capillary loops and avascular zones between the XFG and NC group (p = 0.014 and p = 0.004). The subjects with XFG had lower PLT values compared to POAG patients (p = 0.022).In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first attempt to evaluate capillary morphology as well as to investigate all parameters related to platelet function on the hemogram, in patients with newly diagnosed XFG. Our findings revealed nailfold capillary morphological vascular changes in XFG patients. The subjects with XFG had lower PLT values and a higher MPV serum parameter compared to normal controls and patients with POAG. Further research in this field should therefore aim to evaluate the consequences of the aforementioned microvascular abnormalities in patients with XFG."

Each mark was given a score value that was averaged throughout a session-registry and resulting in a session score for each criterion, ranging from ""0"" score for a hypothetical ""worst runner"", to score ""1"" for a hypothetical ""perfect runner"" rat. We found significant differences throughout a training program, thus providing evidence of sufficient sensitivity of this score to reflect the individual evolution of performance improvement in exercise capacity due to training. We hypothesize that this score could be correlated with other physiological or metabolic parameters, thus refining research results and further helping researchers to reduce the number of experimental subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2961503613,"Background Since 2006 there has been substantial long-term investment in school-based child obesity prevention programs in New South Wales (Australia). Whether these programs have led to population level improvements in children’s weight status and weight-related behaviors are yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in children’s weight status and weight-related behaviors, including Indigenous children, who are at greater risk of poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous children. Methods Representative cross-sectional population surveys conducted in 2010 and 2015 among children age 5–16 years (n = 15,613). Objective measurements included height, weight, waist circumference, cardiorespiratory fitness, and fundamental movement skills. Indigenous status and indicators of weight-related behavior (i.e., diet, physical activity, school travel, screen-time) were measured by questionnaire with parents responding for children age <10 years and self-report by children age ≥10 years. Results The prevalences of overweight/obesity, obesity and abdominal obesity were higher in 2015, than 2010, and higher among Indigenous than non-Indigenous children at both timepoints. There were some small positive changes towards healthier weight-related behaviors between surveys among all children, but many unhealthy weight-related behaviors remain highly prevalent. The magnitude of changes and the 2015 prevalences of weight-related behaviors were generally similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Conclusions Schools play an important role in health promotion, but our findings suggest the current approaches need re-thinking. Upstream factors that shape weight-related behaviors such as the regulation of the food industry and food environment, urban, neighborhood and public transport planning must be including in solutions to ensure populations can eat healthily and be physical active."
https://openalex.org/W2956436254,"Asparaginase (ASNase) is an important drug for the treatment of leukemias. However, hypersensitivity to ASNase can increase the risk of leukemia relapse. Two mechanisms of ASNase hypersensitivity have been identified in mice. The existence of a pathway involving anti-ASNase IgG and Fc-γ receptor III (FC-γRIII) implies that IgG and ASNase immune complexes (ICs) could directly induce hypersensitivity. The aim of this study was to detect ASNase ICs in mice after hypersensitivity reactions and determine their role in hypersensitivity. Protein G beads were used to detect plasma ASNase ICs by flow cytometry. Anti-ASNase IgG was purified from the plasma of sensitized mice, and ASNase ICs were prepared ex vivo at various ratios of ASNase to anti-ASNase IgG. The levels of ASNase ICs detected after hypersensitivity reactions correlated with reaction severity (R2 = 0.796; P = 0.0005). ASNase ICs prepared ex vivo required high levels of anti-ASNase IgG for formation, and binding to naive and sensitized immune cells depended on soluble anti-ASNase IgG, antigen:antibody ratio, and FC-γRIII. Similarly, basophil activation by ASNase ICs depended on the antigen:antibody ratio and FC-γRIII. Consistent with the ex vivo results, naive mice receiving ASNase ICs developed hypersensitivity reactions. Our data demonstrate that ASNase ICs can directly contribute to the onset and severity of ASNase hypersensitivity.—Rathod, S., Ramsey, M., DiGiorgio, D., Berrios, R., Finkelman, F. D., Fernandez, C.

https://openalex.org/W2957289705,"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is an important foodborne pathogen threatening modern food safety due to its ability to survive and grow at low temperatures. DEAD-box RNA helicase CsdA has been shown to play an important role in the low-temperature growth of psychrotrophic Y. pseudotuberculosis. A total of five DEAD-box RNA helicase genes (rhlB, csdA, rhlE, dbpA, srmB) have been identified in Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953. However, their role in various stress conditions used in food production is unclear. We studied the involvement of the DEAD-box RNA helicase-encoding genes in the cold tolerance of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 using quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) and mutational analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that mRNA transcriptional levels of csdA, rhlE, dbpA and srmB were significantly higher after cold shock at 3°C compared to non-shocked culture at 28°C, suggesting the involvement of these four genes in cold shock response at the transcriptional level. The deletion of csdA ceased growth, while the deletion of dbpA or srmB significantly impaired growth at 3°C, suggesting the requirement of these three genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis at low temperatures. Growth of each DEAD-box RNA helicase mutant was also investigated under pH, osmotic, ethanol and oxidative stress conditions. The five helicase-encoding genes did not play major roles in the growth of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 under pH, osmotic, ethanol or oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2960983811,"Analysis of the coupling between the phases and amplitudes of oscillations within the same continuously sampled signal has provided interesting insights into the physiology of memory and other brain process, and, more recently, the pathophysiology of parkinsonism and other movement disorders. Technical aspects of the analysis have a significant impact on the results. We present an empirical exploration of a variety of analysis design choices that need to be considered when measuring phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). We studied three alternative filtering approaches to the commonly used Kullback–Leibler distance-based method of PAC analysis, including one method that uses wavelets, one that uses constant filter settings, and one in which filtering of the data is optimized for individual frequency bands. Additionally, we introduce a time-dependent PAC analysis technique that takes advantage of the inherent temporality of wavelets. We examined how the duration of the sampled data, the stability of oscillations, or the presence of artifacts affect the value of the “modulation index”, a commonly used parameter describing the degree of PAC. We also studied the computational costs associated with calculating modulation indices by the three techniques. We found that wavelet-based PAC performs better with similar or less computational cost than the two other methods while also allowing to examine temporal changes of PAC. We also show that the reliability of PAC measurements strongly depends on the duration and stability of PAC, and the presence (or absence) of artifacts. The best parameters to be used for PAC analyses of long samples of data may differ, depending on data characteristics and analysis objectives. Prior to settling on a specific PAC analysis approach for a given set of data, it may be useful to conduct an initial analysis of the time-dependence of PAC using our time-resolved PAC analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2961606799,"This retrospective study was aimed to evaluate the reduced iodine load on image quality and diagnostic performance in multiphasic hepatic CT using a novel monoenergetic reconstruction algorithm (nMERA) in assessment of local tumor progression after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ninety patients who underwent CT 1 month after RFA of HCC. Forty-five patients had multiphasic hepatic dual-energy CT with a half-reduced contrast medium (HRCM) of 277.5 mg I/kg. The nMERA (40-70-keV) images were reconstructed in each phase. Another 45 patients received a standard contrast medium (SCM) of 555 mg I/kg, and the images were reconstructed as a simulated 120-kVp images. Primary outcome was accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in assessment of local tumor progression. Additional advanced assessments included the image noise, attenuation value, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and subjective image quality between the groups. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of nMERA HRCM images were 95.7%, 100% and 93.9% for 40 keV, 95.7%, 85.7% and 100% for 50 keV, 83.0%, 42.8% and 100% for 60 keV, and 83.0%, 42.9% and 100% for 70 keV. The AUROC was 0.99, 0.99, 0.94, and 0.93 for 40-70 keV nMERA HRCM images, respectively. Compared with simulated 120-kVp SCM images, nMERA HRCM images demonstrated comparable noise at 70-keV (P < 0.05), and comparable CNR at 40- and 50-keV (P < 0.05). nMERA DECT enables the contrast medium to be reduced to up to 50% in multiphasic hepatic CT while preserving diagnostic accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2956778941,"Harmful algal blooms are an ongoing threat to many aquatic systems throughout the world. In the Chowan River, North Carolina, the frequency of toxin producing Microcystis aeruginosa blooms has increased since 1975 along with an average 0.71°C rise in water temperature. The combined effect of microcystin-LR toxin and rising temperatures on a dominant zooplankter in the system, Bosmina longirostris, was the focus of this study. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine how microcystin-LR, produced from M. aeruginosa blooms, affected B. longirostris mortality under different temperature regimes. At 25°C, the LC50 for B. longirostris was 26.3 μg L-1 suggesting that B. longirostris can survive typical current bloom microcystin-LR concentrations ranging 0.1μg L-1 to 2.0 μg L-1, but would be susceptible to higher concentrations they may be periodically exposed to. Mortality was assessed at a constant microcystin-LR concentration of 26.3 μg L-1 over 15-35°C, and it was found that B. longirostris mortality increased at higher temperatures. B. longirostris mortality increased approximately 18% due to microcystin-LR alone over 2°C between 25°C and 27°C when exposed to the LC50 concentration. The increased prevalence of toxic M. aeruginosa blooms and increasing temperatures due to climate change may reduce B. longirostris populations, potentially affecting larval fish and fisheries in the Chowan River, North Carolina."
https://openalex.org/W2959145811,"The Complexity-entropy causality plane (CECP) is a parsimonious representation space for time series. It has only two dimensions: normalized permutation entropy ([Formula: see text]) and Jensen-Shannon complexity ([Formula: see text]) of a time series. This two-dimensional representation allows for detection of slow or rapid drifts in the condition of mechanical components monitored through sensor measurements. The CECP representation can be used for both predictive analytics and visual monitoring of changes in component condition. This method requires minimal pre-processing of raw signals. Furthermore, it is insensitive to noise, stationarity, and trends. These desirable properties make CECP a good candidate for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnostics. In this work we study the effectiveness of CECP on three rotary component condition assessment applications. We use CECP representation of vibration signals to differentiate various machine component health conditions for rotary machine components, namely roller bearing and gears. The results confirm that the CECP representation is able to detect, with high accuracy, changes in underlying dynamics of machine component degradation states. From class separability perspective, the CECP representation is able to generate linearly separable classes for the classification of different fault states. This classification performance improves with increasing signal length. For signal length of 16,384 data points, the fault classification accuracy varies from 90% to 100% for bearing applications, and from 85% to 100% for gear applications. We observed that the optimum parameter for CECP representatino depends on the application. For bearing applications we found that embedding dimension D = 4, 5, 6, and embedding delay τ = 1, 2, 3 are suitable for good fault classification. For gear applications we find that embedding dimension D = 4, 5, and embedding delay τ = 1, 5 are suitable for fault classification."
https://openalex.org/W2961950180,"This study addresses the effects of large-amplitude vibration on the pressure-dependent absorption of a structure multiple-cavity system. It is the first study to consider the effects of large-amplitude vibration and pressure-dependent absorption. Previous studies considered only one of these two factors in the absorption calculation of a perforated panel absorber. Nonlinear differential equations, which represent the structural vibration of a perforated panel absorber, are coupled with the wave equation, which represents the acoustic pressures induced within the cavities. The coupled nonlinear differential equations are solved with the proposed harmonic balance method, which has recently been adopted to solve nonlinear beam problems and other nonlinear structural-acoustic problems. Its main advantage is that when compared with the classical harmonic balance method, the proposed method generates fewer nonlinear algebraic equations during the solution process. In addition, the solution form of the nonlinear differential equations from this classical method can be expressed in terms of a set of symbolic parameters with various physical meanings. If a numerical method is used, there is no analytic solution form, and the final solution is a set of numerical values. The effects of the excitation magnitude, cavity depth, perforation ratio, and hole diameter on the sound absorption of a panel absorber are investigated, and mode and solution convergence studies are also performed. The solutions from the proposed harmonic balance method and a numerical integration method are compared. The numerical results show that the present harmonic balance solutions agree reasonably well with those obtained with the numerical integration method. Several important observations can be made. First, perforation nonlinearity is a very important factor in the absorption of a panel absorber at the off structural resonant frequency range. The settings of the hole diameter, perforation ratio, and cavity depth for optimal absorption differ greatly with consideration of perforation nonlinearity. Second, the “jump up phenomenon,” which does not occur in the case of linear perforation, is observed when perforation nonlinearity is considered. Third, one or more absorption troughs, which worsen the average absorption performance, may exist in cases with multiple cavities."
https://openalex.org/W2961130618,"This study explores the views of children, parents, school staff and intervention staff regarding interventions designed to promote healthy lifestyles and positive choices in primary schools in the North East of England, United Kingdom. The interventions consisted of six weekly sessions in which classroom learning was followed by physically active games. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 45 participants and thematic analysis was performed on the resultant 26 transcripts to identify themes relating to the role of physical activity, facilitators and barriers to children's engagement in the sessions and the perceived outcomes of intervention participation. Results indicated that participants across the four groups felt the inclusion of classroom learning and physical activity made the interventions suitable for a range of children, with the games reinforcing classroom messages and acting as a reward for their work. Central to children's active engagement was their enjoyment, and they were felt to benefit in terms of psychosocial wellbeing and-especially when the topic of the intervention was fitness and nutrition-physical wellbeing. Overall, combined classroom- and games-based interventions were valued methods for communicating healthy lifestyle and positive choices messages to a primary school audience, though research into intervention outcomes is currently limited."
