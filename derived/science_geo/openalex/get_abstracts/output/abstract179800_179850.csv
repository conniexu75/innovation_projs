https://openalex.org/W1487645896,"α-Synuclein is one of the major components of intracellular fibrillary aggregates in the brains of a subset of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and Hallervorden-Spatz disease, which are referred to as α-synucleinopathies. We have shown previously (Fujiwara, H., Hasegawa, M., Dohmae, N., Kawashima, A., Masliah, E., Goldberg, M. S., Shen, J., Takio, K., and Iwatsubo, T. (2002) Nat. Cell Biol. 4, 160–164) that α-synuclein deposited in synucleinopathy brains is extensively phosphorylated at Ser-129 and migrates at 15 kDa. Here we examined the biochemical characteristics of the additional, higher molecular mass species of phosphorylated α-synuclein-positive polypeptides that also are recovered in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of synucleinopathy and migrate at about 22 and 29 kDa. These 22 and 29 kDa bands were positive for three different anti-ubiquitin antibodies and comigrated perfectly with in vitro ubiquitinated α-synuclein that may correspond to mono- and diubiquitinated α-synuclein, respectively. Furthermore, cyanogen bromide cleavage of the 22 and 29 kDa polypeptides shifted the mobility to 19 and 26 kDa, respectively, and they retained immunoreactivity for both ubiquitin and α-synuclein. Finally, protein sequence analysis showed that the 19 kDa band contained two amino-terminal sequences of α-synuclein and ubiquitin. These results strongly suggest that phosphorylated α-synuclein is targeted to mono- and diubiquitination in synucleinopathy brains, which may have implications for mechanisms of these diseases. α-Synuclein is one of the major components of intracellular fibrillary aggregates in the brains of a subset of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and Hallervorden-Spatz disease, which are referred to as α-synucleinopathies.

Immunohistochemical and biochemical studies using anti-α-synuclein antibodies revealed that α-synuclein is deposited in other types of filamentous inclusions, including glial or neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy (MSA) (7Wakabayashi K.

Recent biochemical studies have shown that the full-length α-synuclein is deposited as abnormal filaments (9Tu P.-H. Galvin J.E. Baba M. Giasson B. Tomita T. Leight S. Nakajo S. Iwatsubo T.

Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19213-19219Google Scholar). We and others have shown that insoluble α-synuclein from synucleinopathic brains as well as in vitro assembled filaments from recombinant α-synuclein are highly resistant to proteinase K, leaving the middle portion of α-synuclein as the core structure of the filaments (15Miake H.

We have further shown by mass spectrometry and specific antibodies that the α-synuclein deposited in DLB brains as well as other synucleinopathies is phosphorylated at Ser-129 (17Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Google Scholar). Quantitative immunoblot analyses have further shown that >90% of the insoluble α-synuclein in DLB brains is phosphorylated, whereas ∼4% of normal α-synuclein is phosphorylated at Ser-129, suggesting that the extensive phosphorylation of α-synuclein is a pathological event (17Fujiwara H.

Additional post-translational modifications of α-synuclein, including tyrosine nitration (18Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q.

In addition to α-synuclein, immunoreactivities for a number of proteins including ubiquitin (20Kuzuhara S. Mori H. Izumiyama N. Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Acta Neuropathol. 1988; 75: 345-353Google Scholar), neurofilament (21Goldmann J.E. Yen S.-H. Science. 1986; 221: 1081-1841Google Scholar), synphilin-1 (22Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Google Scholar), parkin (19Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Google Scholar), microtubule-associated protein 1B (23Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Google Scholar), etc. have been shown by immunohistochemistry in LBs and related structures. Among these proteins, ubiquitin has been known to be the most constantly and robustly immunopositive in LBs, glial cytoplasmic inclusions, and other related lesions together with α-synuclein. The presence of ubiquitin in intracellular inclusions in synucleinopathies suggests that abnormally aggregated or misfolded proteins are targeted for ubiquitination in these inclusions in a similar fashion to tau in neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (24Mori H. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Science. 1987; 235: 1641-1644Google Scholar, 25Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Google Scholar). Recently, Shimura et al. (19Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Google Scholar) reported that glycosylated α-synuclein (αSp22) can be readily multiubiquitinated by parkin that functions as E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro. However, the target protein for ubiquitination in synucleinopathy lesions including LBs has been totally unknown. Here we show immunochemical and protein chemical evidence that full-length, phosphorylated α-synuclein is one of the target proteins for ubiquitination in synucleinopathies and that these α-synuclein polypeptides undergo mono- and diubiquitination.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody PSer129 specifically recognizes α-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser-129 (17Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K.

Science. 1987; 235: 1641-1644Google Scholar) specifically recognize ubiquitin. Frozen cortical tissues from the following autopsied cases were used: three cases of DLB (neocortical form with abundant cortical LBs, stage 5 (30McKeith I.G. Galasko D. Kosaka K. Perry E.K.

Fukushima T. Koide R. Horikawa Y. Hasegawa M. Watanabe Y. Noda T. Eguchi I. Morita T. Yoshimoto M. Iwatsubo T. Takahashi H. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 99: 331-336Google Scholar) and a 29 year-old male), one case of MSA with abundant glial cytoplasmic inclusions in cerebral white matter as well as in the brainstem and cerebellum (73 year-old female (31Piao Y.-S. Hayashi S. Hasegawa M. Wakabayashi K. Yamada M. Yoshimoto M. Ishikawa A. Iwatsubo T. Takahashi T. Acta Neuropathol. 2001; 101: 285-293Google Scholar)), and one control individual (61 year-old male). Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein was prepared as described (15Miake H. Mizusawa H. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19213-19219Google Scholar, 17Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, frozen brain tissues from patients with DLB, MSA, and HSD as well as from control individuals were homogenized in a 10-fold volume of buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (23,000 × g) for 15 min. The pellets were then extracted in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 386,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant pellets were subsequently homogenized in buffer A containing 1% Sarkosyl, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and centrifuged at 386,000 ×g for 20 min. The Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were solubilized in 2% SDS, spun at 23,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. In vitro ubiquitination of α-synuclein was performed according to the same methods described previously (32Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 20 μg of human recombinant α-synuclein and 2 μg of ubiquitin (derived from bovine blood cells) or methylated ubiquitin were incubated with a ubiquitin ligase fraction (Fraction II) from rabbit reticulocytes at 37 °C for 2 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH9.0), 2 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The conjugation reaction was stopped by boiling the samples in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer followed by separation of the components by SDS-PAGE. The Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets from control, DLB, MSA, and HSD brains were dissolved in 70% formic acid and treated with 2% CNBr at room temperature for 18 h. The samples were diluted with distilled water, lyophilized, resolved in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described (15Miake H. Mizusawa H. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19213-19219Google Scholar). The Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet from a MSA brain was suspended in 8 m urea, centrifuged at 386,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant was subjected onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4) containing 8 m urea. The ubiquitin-positive bands were eluted with a gradient of NaCl up to 0.5 m. The immunoreactive polypeptides were pooled and concentrated by lyophirization. After CNBr treatment, the polypeptides were applied onto SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The ubiquitin-positive bands on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis with a Applied Biosystems model 492 protein sequencer. To biochemically characterize the changes in α-synuclein deposited in the brains of patients with DLB, MSA, or HSD, we sequentially extracted frozen brain tissues with Tris-HCl buffer, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Sarkosyl and 2% SDS and analyzed the solubilized proteins by immunoblotting with anti-α-synuclein antibodies. Immunoblots of Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions showed a couple of α-synuclein immunoreactive bands exclusively in DLB, MSA, and HSD, but not in control brains (Figs.1 and 2). The major immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 15-kDa on the Tris-tricine gel system was also immunoreactive with the phosphorylation-dependent anti-α-synuclein antibody anti-PSer129 and co-migrated with human recombinant α-synuclein as well as Tris-soluble normal α-synuclein anti-PSer129, as we have described previously (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition to the 15 kDa band, anti-α-synuclein antibodies detected a couple of minor bands migrating at a higher molecular mass range of 22–29 kDa in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of DLB brains (Fig. 1). The 22 and 29 kDa polypeptides were observed in all the synucleinopathy brains (i.e. DLB, MSA, and HSD) examined in this study but were exclusively detected in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions, and the intensities of these bands apparently correlated with those of the 15-kDa band (Figs. 1 and 2). These 22 and 29 kDa bands were also immunoreactive for anti-PSer129, suggesting that the higher molecular mass α-synuclein-related polypeptides are phosphorylated. We next investigated whether the higher molecular mass bands represent α-synuclein multimers or, alternatively, they may correspond to α-synuclein with some specific post-translational modifications. Judging from the size of these polypeptides, we hypothesized that the 22 and 29 kDa bands may correspond to mono- and diubiquitinated α-synuclein, respectively. To test these possibilities, we analyzed the Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of DLB brains with anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody 1510 (mAb 510). mAb 1510 strongly labeled the 22 and 29 kDa bands as well as the smearing substances at higher molecular mass ranges in DLB brains (Fig. 1), suggesting that these bands represent ubiquitinated forms of α-synuclein.Figure 2Comparison of the 22- and 29-kDa bands within vitro ubiquitinated α-synuclein. A, immunoblot analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated α-synuclein with Syn102 and 1510. Recombinant α-synuclein itself (α-Syn), ubiquitin itself (Ub), α-synuclein and ubiquitin (α-Syn+ Ub), and α-synuclein and ubiquitin with ubiquitin ligase fraction (α-Syn+Ub+Lig) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Note that the ubiquitinated α-synuclein ladder bands were observed in the reaction of α-Syn+Ub+Lig with Syn102 and 1510 (arrows indicate ubiquitinated α-synuclein bands).B, immunoblot analysis of the Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein from control, DLB, MSA, and HSD brains with in vitro ubiquitinated α-synuclein. Note that Syn102-positive 22 and 29 kDa bands detected in the DLB, MSA, and HSD brains aligned with mono- and diubiquitinated α-synuclein bands from in vitroubiquitinated α-synuclein, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine our speculation that the 22- and 29-kDa bands represent ubiquitinated α-synuclein, we ubiquitinated α-synuclein using ubiquitin ligase fractions from rabbit reticulocytes in vitro and compared the mobilities of in vitro ubiquitinated α-synuclein on SDS-PAGE with those derived from DLB and other synucleinopathy brains. On immunoblots of recombinant α-synuclein by itself or with ubiquitin, a major 15-kDa band (corresponding to α-synuclein monomer) and a minor 29-kDa band, the latter presumably representing α-synuclein dimer, were detected with an anti-α-synuclein mAb Syn102 (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis of ubiquitin itself with anti-ubiquitin mAb also showed a similar pattern with a major 7-kDa (ubiquitin monomer) and a minor 15-kDa band, the latter presumably representing an ubiquitin dimer (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when recombinant α-synuclein was incubated with ubiquitin and the ubiquitin ligase fraction, both Syn102- and mAb 1510-positive bands appeared at 22, 29, and 36 kDa (Fig. 2A). None of these bands were detected in reaction mixtures of the ubiquitin ligase fraction without α-synuclein and ubiquitin (Ub) (data not shown). Considering the molecular mass of Ub comprised of 76 amino acids, it is reasonable to speculate that these 22, 29, and 36 kDa bands represent mono-, di-, and triubiquitinated forms of α-synuclein. The 22 and 29 kDa bands (presumably mono- and diubiquitinated α-synuclein, respectively) derived from in vitro ubiquitination of α-synuclein co-migrated at positions identical to those of the 22 and 29 kDa polypeptides recovered from Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from DLB, MSA, and HSD brains on immunoblots (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the 22 and 29 kDa bands from DLB, MSA, and HSD brains correspond to mono- and diubiquitinated forms of phosphorylated α-synuclein, respectively. Notably, the migration position of the 29-kDa α-synuclein dimer was almost identical to that of diubiquitinated α-synuclein (Fig 2A). To further characterize the ubiquitinated α-synuclein in synucleinopathy brains, we treated the Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from DLB and HSD brains with CNBr that chemically cleaves peptide bonds following Met. α-Synuclein harbors four Met residues at positions 1, 5, 116, and 127 (Fig. 4A), and ubiquitin has one Met at the N terminus. When we treated the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction from HSD brains that was most abundant in insoluble α-synuclein with CNBr, separated the digests by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-α-synuclein antibody 259 or an anti-Ub mAb DF2, polypeptides migrating at 19 and 26 kDa were observed instead of the 22- and 29-kDa bands (Fig. 3). The reduction of the molecular masses of corresponding bands by ∼3 kDa was almost equivalent to the sum of the N- and C-terminal portions (i.e. 5 and 24 amino acids, respectively) that were cleaved by CNBr treatment. (Figs. 3 and4) Notably, the anti-α-synuclein 259-positive but anti-Ub negative, 25 kDa band appeared after CNBr treatment (Fig. 3). This band may represent a truncated form of α-synuclein dimer derived from the 29-kDa full-length dimer, because the reduction in the molecular mass of the α-synuclein dimer by CNBr treatment (equivalent to 58 amino acids) is predicted to be larger than that of ubiquitinated α-synuclein (29 + 1 amino acids). Immunoblot analysis of the CNBr-treated Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet from an MSA brain also showed patterns similar to those of DLB and HSD brains. These results supported our view that the 22-kDa band in the insoluble fractions of synucleinopathy brains represents monoubiquitinated α-synuclein, and the 29 kDa band may be the mixture of a diubiquitinated α-synuclein and α-synuclein dimer. It is consistent with the fact that the ubiquitin-acceptable lysine residues are located in the N-terminal to middle portion of α-synuclein (residues 6–115) rather than in the extreme N- or C-terminal regions of α-synuclein.Figure 3Immunoblot analysis of the Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein after CNBr treatment. A, immunoblots of the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction from HSD brain prior to (lane 1) and after (lane 2) CNBr treatment with anti-α-synuclein antibody 259 and anti-ubiquitin antibody DF2. Note that after the CNBr treatment, 19 and 26 kDa bands (arrowheads) were detected with both 259 and DF2. A 25-kDa band (arrows) appeared after CNBr treatment was observed only with anti-α-Syn antibody 259.B, immunoblots of CNBr-treated Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from control (Con), DLB, and HSD brains with 259 and anti-Ub antibody 5-25.

The Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet from an MSA brain was extracted in 8 m urea and partially purified on a Q-Sepharose column. After CNBr treatment, the 19-kDa polypeptide was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis. Protein sequence analysis showed that the 19-kDa polypeptide contained two amino-terminal sequences, KGLSKAKE and qIFvKtL (lower case letters indicate signals weakly assigned), which correspond to the amino-terminal sequences of CNBr-cleaved α-synuclein (residues 6–13) and ubiquitin (residues 2–8), respectively. This result provides protein chemical evidence that the 22-kDa polypeptide and the 19-kDa CNBr fragment are monoubiquitinated forms of α-synuclein. During the analysis of post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) of α-synuclein in synucleinopathy brains, we found two α-synuclein-positive polypeptides migrating at 22 and 29 kDa, in addition to the major 15-kDa band, which were immunoreactive to both phosphorylation-independent and Ser(P)-129-specific anti-α-synuclein antibodies. These 22 and 29 kDa bands were also immunoreactive to three different anti-ubiquitin antibodies (i.e. mAbs 1510, DF2, and 5-25). Furthermore, these bands aligned on SDS-PAGE with the in vitroubiquitinated α-synuclein bands that presumably correspond to mono- and diubiquitinated α-synuclein, respectively. The 22 and 29 kDa bands shifted to positions at 19 and 26 kDa, respectively, after treatment with CNBr, which was also immunopositive for both an anti-α-synuclein antibody 259 and anti-ubiquitin antibodies, providing further evidence that these represent ubiquitinated forms of α-synuclein. Finally, protein sequence analysis showed that the 19-kDa CNBr fragment of the ubiquitin-positive polypeptide has two amino-terminal sequences of α-synuclein and ubiquitin. These data strongly suggest that a fraction of phosphorylated α-synuclein deposited in DLB, MSA, and HSD brains is mono- or diubiquitinated. A number of immunohistochemical studies on synucleinopathy brains have shown that LBs and LNs in PD and DLB, glial cytoplasmics and neural cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA, and LB-like inclusions and dystrophic neurites in HSD are positively stained with anti-ubiquitin antibodies, although the amounts of Ub-positive structures are much less than those positive for α-synuclein (6Irizarry M.C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis has shown that the ratio of relative intensities of ubiquitin-positive 22 and 29 kDa bands to those of a 15-kDa α-synuclein monomer in Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from DLB brains was ∼1:10, suggesting that mono- or diubiquitinated α-synuclein may be a minor species, although the high molecular mass smearing substances or SDS-insoluble fractions may contain multiubiquitinated forms of α-synuclein. Indeed, support for this notion comes from our previous attempts to raise mAbs to LBs, which yielded an antibody (LB112) that specifically reacted with multiubiquitin chains in LBs, and this provided the first biochemical evidence that suggests a role for ubiquitination in LB formation (33Iwatsubo T. Yamaguchi H. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Ihara Y. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1517-1529Google Scholar). Because the mid-portion of α-synuclein harbors 15 Lys residues, further protein chemical analysis is required to locate the exact position of ubiquitin-ligated Lys residue. As to the possible diubiquitinated form (i.e. 29 kDa) of α-synuclein, it is unknown whether the two ubiquitin molecules are conjugated to two different lysine residues, or alternatively, only one Lys residue of α-synuclein is ubiquitinated and the second ubiquitin is conjugated to the initial one, forming a “T-shaped” diubiquitin moiety. It has been shown that tau in paired helical filaments of Alzheimer brains are ubiquitinated (24Mori H. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Science. 1987; 235: 1641-1644Google Scholar, 25Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Google Scholar); our previous protein chemical analysis has identified a couple of ubiquitination sites within the microtubule binding domain of tau that comprise the core structure of paired helical filaments (25Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Google Scholar). Importantly, ∼70% of ubiquitin conjugated to tau in paired helical filaments were present in monoubiquitinated form, although some multiubiquitin chains also were detected. Taken together with our previous observation that the core structure of α-synuclein filaments is composed of residues 31–109 (15Miake H. Mizusawa H. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19213-19219Google Scholar), it is possible to speculate that Lys residues within or flanking the positions of the core structures of insoluble filaments are prone to undergo ubiquitination by some specific ubiquitin ligase system that recognizes abnormally fibrillized proteins, although an effective formation of multi-ubiquitin chains is interfered with by an unknown mechanism, allowing the progressive deposition of oligoubiquitinated proteins that are less effectively targeted to proteasome degradation. Our data suggest that mono- or diubiquitinated α-synuclein in synucleinopathy brains is also phosphorylated at Ser-129. Although it is well known that protein phosphorylation triggers ubiquitination of a number of short lived proteins (e.g. cyclin or β-catenin) (34Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar), it is unknown whether the phosphorylation at Ser-129 of α-synuclein, which is specifically up-regulated and may promote deposition of insoluble α-synuclein in synucleinopathic brains, may have some role in the ubiquitination and degradation of α-synuclein in diseased brains. Recent data suggest that monoubiquitination of a subset of proteins does not serve as a signal for proteasome degradation but instead may induce endocytosis or membrane trafficking (35Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Google Scholar), although it is not known unequivocally whether this modification might play some role in the degradation of α-synuclein. It is tempting to speculate that oligoubiquitination may have some promotive effects on the deposition of filamentous α-synuclein in diseased brains. Further studies are required to clarify the relationship between phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Recently, Shimura et al. have reported that a 22-kDaO-glycosylated form of α-synuclein (αSp22) serves as a good substrate for parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is deficient in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, and is effectively multiubiquitinated by parkin in vitro. Our observation strongly suggests that the 22 kDa α-synuclein-positive polypeptide in insoluble deposits in synucleinopathy brains represents a monoubiquitinated α-synuclein and not the αSp22 species. Moreover, deposition of insoluble α-synuclein is not observed in the brains of autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism, where αSp22 is increased in soluble fractions. Nonetheless, our novel findings provide new insights into the intriguing possibility for a role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the deposition and degradation of α-synuclein in different types of neurodegenerative α-synucleinopathies.

https://openalex.org/W2033453582,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) regulates the transcription of many genes induced by low oxygen conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated that non-hypoxic stimuli can also activate HIF-1 in a cell-specific manner. Here, we define two key mechanisms that are implicated in increasing the active subunit of the HIF-1 complex, HIF-1α, following the stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) with angiotensin II (Ang II). We show that, in contrast to hypoxia, the induction of HIF-1α by Ang II in VSMC is dependent on active transcription and ongoing translation. We demonstrate that stimulation of VSMC by Ang II strongly increases HIF-1α gene expression. The activation of diacylglycerol-sensitive protein kinase C (PKC) plays a major role in the increase of HIF-1α gene transcription. We also demonstrate that Ang II relies on ongoing translation to maintain elevated HIF-1α protein levels. Ang II increases HIF-1α translation by a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, which acts on the 5′-untranslated region of HIF-1α mRNA. These results establish that the non-hypoxic induction of the HIF-1 transcription factor via vasoactive hormones (Ang II and thrombin) is triggered by a dual mechanism,i.e. a PKC-mediated transcriptional action and a ROS-dependent increase in HIF-1α protein expression. Elucidation of these signaling pathways that up-regulate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could have a strong impact on different aspects of vascular biology.

Elucidation of these signaling pathways that up-regulate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could have a strong impact on different aspects of vascular biology. Hypoxia activates a number of genes that are important in the cellular and tissular adaptation to low oxygen conditions (1Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Google Scholar).

VEGF is a major angiogenic factor that has been shown to activate new blood vessel formation in a number of experimental models (2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Google Scholar, 3Mustonen T.

Transcriptional up-regulation was shown to be implicated in the induction of this gene, an action mediated by the specific binding of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) to the hypoxic response element (HRE) (6Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar, 7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). The HIF-1 transcription factor is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β. Although the HIF-1β protein is readily found in all cells, HIF-1α is virtually undetectable in normal oxygen conditions. When cells are subjected to hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen), protein expression levels of the HIF-1α subunit are rapidly increased. Instead of acting on HIF-1α transcription or translation, hypoxia increases HIF-1α protein levels by inhibiting the rapid ubiquitination and degradation of the HIF-1α protein by the proteasome. An elegant series of studies has shown that under normal oxygen conditions, HIF-1α is modified by prolyl hydroxylation, which permits the binding of pVHL, a recognition component of the E3 ligase complex. This promotes the ubiquitin-degradation of HIF-1α. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α is blocked, and the HIF-1 transcription factor is stabilized (8Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S.

We were recently the first to show that VEGF expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) induced by non-hypoxic stimuli like angiotensin II (Ang II), thrombin, and platelet-derived growth factor is mediated through activation of the HIF-1 complex. The HIF-1α subunit was highly elevated at the protein expression level following stimulation with the aforementioned agents, allowing activation of the HIF-1 transcription factor (14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Google Scholar). Our studies also demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the activation of HIF-1. However, the cellular signaling mechanisms that are implicated in increasing HIF-1α protein levels in VSMC after stimulation with these agents remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of VSMC by Ang II strongly increases HIF-1α gene expression. The activation of the diacylglycerol-sensitive protein kinase C plays an important part in the increase of HIF-1α transcription. We also demonstrate that Ang II relies on ongoing translation to maintain elevated HIF-1α protein levels. Ang II increases HIF-1α translation by ROS-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway and through the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of HIF-1α mRNA. These results identify two separate pathways that are responsible for the hormonal induction of the HIF-1 transcription complex.

VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aortas of 6-week-old male Wistar rats by enzymatic dissociation (16Owens G.K. Loeb A. Gordon D. Thompson M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 343-352Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) in a humid atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). Cells were serially passaged upon reaching confluence, and all experiments were performed on passages 3–10. Quiescent cells were obtained by total deprivation of FCS for 16–20 h. Pretreatment of cells with different compounds was performed 15 min prior to stimulation. Hypoxic conditions were obtained by placing the cells in a sealed “Bug-Box” anaerobic work station (Ruskinn Technologies, Leeds, United Kingdom). The oxygen levels in this work station were maintained at 1–2% with the residual gas mixture containing 93–94% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. Confluent cells were lysed in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Protein concentration was determined by Lowry assay. 25 μg of whole cell extracts were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8%) and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). Proteins of interest were revealed with specific antibodies as indicated (1:1000 dilution for primary antibodies and 1:5000 for secondary antibodies). The bands were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Confluent cells were rendered quiescent 18 h prior to a 3 h stimulation in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Easy Tag Express35S-protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was then added at a final concentration of 0.3 mCi/ml, and cells were labeled for 30 min and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Cell extracts (1 mg) were precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose followed by the addition of 3 μl of anti-HIF-1α antiserum 2087. Extracts were left overnight at 4 °C prior to the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8%) followed by gel drying and exposure to Kodak BioMax MS film. Confluent cells were lysed, and RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA resolved on 1% agarose/6% formaldehyde gels was transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with a radioactive cDNA probe comprising either the first 900-bp coding sequence of the human HIF-1α gene or the total coding sequence of the mouse VEGF gene. A probe against 18 S rRNA was used as a loading control. Results were quantified with the use of a Storm blot imaging system (AmershamBiosciences). Reporter (500 ng/well) was used along with cytomegalovirus Renilla reniformis luciferase expression vector (250 ng/well; Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency. Transfection of VSMC was performed using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) at a 1:5 DNA/reagent ratio. At 3 h post-transfection, cells were washed, and fresh medium was added. At 12 h post-transfection, cells were deprived of FCS for 16 h. Stimulation with Ang II and hypoxia was performed for 18 h. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and luciferase assays were performed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Results were quantified with a Topcount NXT luminescence counter (Packard Bioscience). Results are expressed as a ratio of beetle luciferase activity over R. reniformis luciferase activity. All data expressed an average of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. For the HIF-1A reporters, duplicate wells were lysed in TRIzol reagent, and total RNA was extracted. Reverse transcription was then preformed using the Ready-To-Go T-primed first strand kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by amplification by PCR of the firefly and Renilla sequences (primer sequences available upon request). Products were then electrophoretically migrated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. As mentioned previously, we have shown that Ang II strongly induced an increase in HIF-1α protein expression levels in VSMC (14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Google Scholar). In the same study, we also showed that HIF-1α induction by Ang II proceeded in a manner distinct from that mediated by hypoxia. Interestingly, when time course studies of HIF-1α protein induction were performed in VSMC following stimulation with Ang II, we noticed a striking difference between the kinetics of HIF-1α protein induction mediated by hypoxia and that mediated by Ang II. As seen in Fig. 1A, the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α was rapid, and an increase could be seen at as early as 5 min following hypoxic incubation. Maximal stimulation was attained between 1–2 h of incubation in oxygen-deprived conditions. In contrast, stimulation with Ang II caused a more latent time course. No increase in HIF-1α protein expression levels could be seen for times up to 1 h following Ang II addition (Fig. 1A). A small but detectable increase in HIF-1α protein expression levels could be observed at 1 h following Ang II addition, with maximal stimulation obtained between 3 and 4 h of incubation in the presence of Ang II. This was not due to slow receptor activation, because p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation, a control for AT1 receptor activity, was strongly increased at the first time point (5 min). Given the slow induction of HIF-1α, these results suggest that transcriptional activity is implicated in the maximal increase of HIF-1α in VSMC following Ang II stimulation. To confirm this, we pretreated cells for 15 min with the commonly used inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D, prior to stimulation with Ang II for 4 h. Following this treatment, the activation of HIF-1α by Ang II in VSMC was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 1B). Actinomycin D did not block normal receptor signaling, because the ability of Ang II to activate p42/p44 MAPK was not decreased. It is also noteworthy to mention that HIF-1α protein levels induced during hypoxia were not decreased by treatment with actinomycin D. Interestingly, actinomycin D treatment in hypoxia induced a marked increase in the molecular weight of the HIF-1α protein (Fig. 1B). We believe that this is due to increased HIF-1α phosphorylation in these conditions. We have previously shown that p42/p44 MAPK activity can induce a shift in HIF-1α molecular weight (15Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32638Google Scholar). p42/p44 MAPK activity was also increased when VSMC were treated with actinomycin D (Fig. 1B, lower panel). It is therefore possible that this increased p42/p44 MAPK activity causes the shift in the molecular weight of the HIF-1α protein. We are currently investigating this possibility. Similar results were obtained when the experiment was performed in the presence of another transcriptional inhibitor, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (data not shown). These results demonstrate that, in contrast to hypoxia, transcriptional activity is essential for Ang II-increased HIF-1α protein levels. Given the ability of actinomycin D to attenuate Ang II-mediated induction of HIF-1α protein expression levels, we wondered whether Ang II stimulation could increase HIF-1α mRNA levels. If this was the case, this increase would directly influence the turnover of HIF-1α protein. As mentioned previously, traditional HIF-1α inducers such as hypoxia or cobalt have very little effect on HIF-1α mRNA levels in a number of cell lines (17Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Guenet J.L. Gassmann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 54-59Google Scholar, 18Kallio P.J. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Google Scholar, 19Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Google Scholar). This is also the case in VSMC, because a 4-h incubation period in hypoxic conditions did not affect the basal level of HIF-1α mRNA in these cells (Fig. 2A). However, the expression level of HIF-1α mRNA was strongly increased in VSMC stimulated with Ang II. This increase was maximal after a 4-h stimulation with 100 nm Ang II (Fig. 2B). As with the increase in HIF-1α protein expression levels, the increase in HIF-1α mRNA was mediated through the AT1 receptor subtype because the AT1-specific antagonist, losartan, completely blocked the increase in HIF-1α mRNA (Fig. 2A). PD123319, an AT2-specific inhibitor, had no effect on the ability of Ang II to up-regulate HIF-1α mRNA expression levels (results not shown). To evaluate the effect of Ang II on HIF-1α mRNA transcription, we used a luciferase reporter, pHIF-1A-572/+32Luc, driven by the humanHIF-1A gene promoter region (20Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Google Scholar). When cells were transfected with this reporter and stimulated with Ang II, a strong increase (6.4-fold over basal levels) in reporter activity was observed (Fig. 3). In contrast, hypoxia did not significantly increase HIF-1 promoter activity. These results indicate that Ang II increases the rate of transcription of theHIF-1A gene in VSMC. Studies were also performed to evaluate HIF-1α mRNA stability following Ang II stimulation. To perform these studies, we evaluated the HIF-1α mRNA degradation rate after 4 h of Ang II treatment by blocking transcription with actinomycin D in either the presence or absence of losartan, which inhibits Ang II signaling. However, no differences could be observed between the HIF-1α mRNA half-life in these two conditions, indicating that HIF-1α mRNA stability is not increased during Ang II stimulation (results not shown). Activation of PKC is one pathway by which Ang II regulates gene expression. In VSMC, Ang II potently activates a number of PKC isoforms, including the diacylglycerol (DAG)-sensitive forms of PKC. To investigate whether these PKCs are implicated in the regulation of HIF-1α mRNA, we treated VSMC with PMA. As seen in Fig. 4A, PMA strongly increased HIF-1α protein expression levels in VSMC. This increase was similar to that induced by Ang II and also followed a similar time course (results not shown), again suggesting the implication of transcriptional activation. Indeed, in the presence of 100 nm PMA, HIF-1α mRNA levels are also strikingly increased (Fig. 4B). Given the common pathways activated by Ang II and PMA and the similarity between the effects of Ang II and PMA on HIF-1α, our results suggested that PKC activation was implicated in Ang II-mediated increases in HIF-1α. To confirm this, we treated cells with GF109203X, a compound shown to inhibit PKC activation by Ang II in VSMC (21Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Nickenig G. Clark M. Murphy T.J. Griendling K.K. Mol.

Preincubation of VSMC with GF109203X strongly inhibited HIF-1α protein levels following stimulation with Ang II and PMA (Fig. 4A). It is important to note that hypoxic induction of HIF-1α protein levels was not modified following incubation with GF109203X (Fig. 4A). In addition, GF109203X did not block normal receptor signaling, because p42/p44 MAPK activation by Ang II was not decreased. It has been shown that DAG-sensitive forms of PKC are only minimally responsible for p42/p44 MAPK activation by Ang II (23Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Google Scholar). However, PKC activation was indeed inhibited by GF109203X, because the activation of p42/p44 MAPK by PMA was completely blocked in the presence of GF109203X. Taken together, these results suggest that PKC activity is implicated in the non-hypoxic up-regulation of HIF-1α by Ang II. More importantly, GF109203X inhibited Ang II- and PMA-induced HIF-1α and VEGF mRNA levels (Fig. 4B). GF109203X had no effect on HIF-1α mRNA levels in unstimulated cells (results not shown). These results indicate that activation of PKC is involved in the induction of HIF-1 by increasing HIF-1α mRNA levels. We have shown that ROS are implicated in the increase in HIF-1α protein levels following Ang II stimulation (14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to evaluate whether ROS activity was implicated in the Ang II-stimulated increase of HIF-1α mRNA. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors of Ang II-stimulated ROS production in VSMC, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and catalase. We have previously shown that these two agents can potently inhibit HIF-1α protein induction by Ang II (14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Google Scholar). When cells were pretreated with DPI or catalase prior to stimulation with Ang II, no inhibition of HIF-1α mRNA expression could be observed (Fig. 5A). As a control, Fig. 5B demonstrates that these compounds effectively inhibited HIF-1α protein expression. These results demonstrate that ROS are not implicated in increasing HIF-1α mRNA and suggest that Ang II activates a secondary ROS-dependent mechanism that is responsible for controlling HIF-1α protein induction. Recent studies brought us to consider that ROS activity could be implicated in HIF-1α protein translation. These studies have shown the following. 1) Ang II activates the PI3K/AKT pathway in a ROS-dependent manner in VSMC (24Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Google Scholar); and 2) the PI3K pathway is implicated in heregulin receptor-mediated increases in HIF-1α protein translation in breast cancer cells (20Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Google Scholar). We therefore set out to investigate the possibility that, through the activation of ROS production and hence the PI3K pathway, Ang II could increase HIF-1α protein translation in VSMC. Our previous study (14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Google Scholar) demonstrated that the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 could partially inhibit HIF-1α protein levels in VSMC stimulated by Ang II. When this experiment was repeated in new cell lines with different batches of Ly294002, we noted that this inhibition could be considerably stronger (Fig. 6A). Additionally, wortmannin, another PI3K inhibitor, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of a downstream target of the PI3K pathway, mTOR/FRAP, also impaired the induction of HIF-1α protein expression levels in response to Ang II. These results point to the implication of the PI3K pathway in HIF-1α induction by Ang II in VSMC. As a control, all these compounds effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of a downstream target of this pathway, p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) (Fig. 6A). However, these compounds had no effect on the Ang II-mediated increases in HIF-1α mRNA, indicating that PI3K is not implicated in the transcriptional regulation of HIF-1α (Fig. 6B). In agreement with previous studies by Ushio-Fukai et al. (24Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Google Scholar), Fig. 5B shows that ROS inhibitors DPI and catalase also inhibited PI3K pathway activation (phosphorylation of p70S6K) by Ang II in VSMC. To demonstrate that Ang II increases HIF-1α protein synthesis, VSMC were or were not stimulated for 3 h followed by a pulse-labeling period with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 30 min. Very little labeled HIF-1α was immunoprecipitated from VSMC under control conditions (Fig. 7). Only minor changes in labeled HIF-1α could be seen in hypoxic conditions. These results indicate that, in VSMC, hypoxia relies on protein stabilization rather than increases in translation. This has been seen in other cell models, and it is possible that during the 30 min labeling following 3 h of hypoxia, the rate of new protein turnover was not elevated enough to be detected by this technique (20Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Google Scholar). However, a strong labeling of HIF-1α protein could be seen in cells treated with Ang II. This indicates that, in opposition to hypoxic induction, Ang II utilizes continued novel protein synthesis to maintain elevated levels of HIF-1α in VSMC. When cells were treated with rapamycin 10 min before the pulse-labeling period, HIF-1α labeling was blocked (Fig. 7). This implicates mTOR and the PI3K pathway in increasing HIF-1α protein synthesis. Laughner et al. (20Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Google Scholar) have shown that the 5′-UTR of HIF-1α mRNA is involved in the heregulin-mediated induction of HIF-1α protein synthesis. We therefore wanted to investigate whether the 5′-UTR of HIF-1α mRNA could be implicated in increasing HIF-1α translation in VSMC following Ang II stimulation. For this experiment, we used a luciferase reporter construct under the control of theHIF-1A gene promoter that included the 5′-UTR pHIF-1A-572/+284Luc (20Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Google Scholar). As was the case for the activation of the HIF-1α promoter construct (Fig. 3), this reporter was not activated by hypoxia (Fig. 8A). However, when cells were stimulated with Ang II, a strong activation of pHIF-1A-572/+284Luc could be observed. This increase was superior (by nearly 4-fold) to assays performed with the HIF-1α promoter only (compare Figs. 3 and 8A). To ensure that the 5′-UTR was not increasing transcription of the reporter, we performed a reverse transcription PCR analysis of firefly and Renilla luciferase mRNA. As seen in Fig. 8B, when cells transfected with the pHIF-1A-572/+284Luc or pHIF-1A-572/+32Luc were stimulated with Ang II, expression of firefly luciferase mRNA for both constructs was significantly increased to similar levels as compared with the controlRenilla luciferase mRNA. These results demonstrate that the HIF-1α 5′-UTR does not affect the transcription of the luciferase reporter. Taken together, these results indicate that the 5′-UTR of HIF-1α mRNA controls the increase of HIF-1α translation following Ang II stimulation. To investigate the implication of the ROS-activated PI3K pathway on this increase in HIF-1α translation, we evaluated the effect of a p22phox antisense plasmid and a dominant negative form of PI3K, p85ΔPI3K. p22phox is a critical component of the VSMC NADH/NADPH oxidase and is essential for Ang II-mediated ROS production in VSMC (24Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Google Scholar). p85ΔPI3K is a mutant form of the PI3K subunit p85, which cannot interact with the P110 subunit and acts as a dominant negative (25Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Google Scholar). When VSMC were transfected with either p85ΔPI3K or antisense p22phox, a significant decrease was seen in the activation of the pHIF-1A-572/+284Luc reporter (Fig. 9, −572/+284). The constructs also decreased the activation of the HIF-1-targeted reporter construct PRE-tk-LUC (Fig. 9, HRE). However, p85ΔPI3K and antisense p22phox had no significant effect on theHIF-1A gene promoter construct pHIF-1A-572/+32Luc, which contains no 5′-UTR (Fig. 9, −572/+32). These results indicate that, in addition to increases in HIF-1α transcription, HIF-1 activation by Ang II is mediated through the ROS-activated PI3K pathway, which increases HIF-1α translation. Ubiquitously, hypoxia strongly increases HIF-1α protein expression levels by blocking the ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1α through the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylation (8Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Google Scholar, 9Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I.

Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Google Scholar). In VSMC, we have previously shown that Ang II can potently increase and activate the HIF-1 transcription complex (14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Google Scholar) to levels that can even surpass those achieved by hypoxic activation. In this study, we set out to identify the mechanisms that control this increase. We have found that, in contrast to hypoxia, Ang II modulates two different pathways to increase HIF-1α protein expression levels. The first involves an increase in the rate of HIF-1α mRNA transcription through a mechanism requiring the activation of the DAG-sensitive PKC. The second involves increasing the rate of translation of this newly produced HIF-1α mRNA by activating ROS production and the subsequent activation of the PI3K pathway. Together, these two pathways boost VSMC HIF-1α protein expression to levels that surpass hypoxic induction and lead to the activation of HIF-1-responsive genes such as VEGF. In VSMC, Ang II activates a large number of signaling pathways that are responsible for the modulation of vasomotor tone, cell growth, migration, and apoptosis (26Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 639-672Google Scholar). In this study, our task was to identify the signaling pathways that were responsible for increasing the expression levels of the HIF-1 complex. One signaling mechanism of interest was the protein kinase C pathway. In these cells, Ang II is a major activator of various forms of PKC that have been shown to activate a number of pathways and genes. PMA is an agonist that directly and potently activates DAG-sensitive isoforms of PKC. Our results show that PMA is one of the strongest activators of HIF-1α activity in VSMC. 2D. E. Richard, unpublished observations. We noticed that the time course of HIF-1α induction and activation by PMA closely resembles that of Ang II. We show that the common mediator involved in the increase of HIF-1α mRNA expression by Ang II and PMA is indeed PKC. The use of specific inhibitors of DAG-sensitive PKCs also potently blocks the induction of HIF-1α protein levels. Previous studies have also shown that PKC activity is required for Ang II-induced expression of nox1, a main component of the VSMC ROS-producing NADPH oxidase (22Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Szocs K. Yin Q. Akers M. Zhang Y. Grant S.L. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 888-894Google Scholar). The expression of nox1 or other elements during Ang II stimulation would also be blocked by actinomycin D, thereby explaining the strong potency of this drug on HIF-1α protein expression. Taken together, these results define a central role for PKC in Ang II-induced HIF-1 activation. PKC may control HIF at two levels: 1) by increasing HIF-1α mRNA levels; and 2) by increasing cellular ROS levels, which are essential in increasing the rate of HIF-1α protein translation. The HIF-1α gene promoter has been cloned from the human and mouse genome and shows an 80% conservation of the nucleotide sequence (17Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Guenet J.L. Gassmann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 54-59Google Scholar,27Iyer N.V. Leung S.W. Semenza G.L. Genomics. 1998; 52: 159-165Google Scholar). Although the promoter of rat HIF-1α gene has not yet been sequenced, we suspect that the sequence is similar to those of the mouse and human genes given the strong homology of the HIF-1α gene product. At this time, we have not identified the sequences that are responsible for the activation of the HIF-1α gene promoter by Ang II. Interestingly, a number of Sp1 sites exist in the HIF-1 promoter that are conserved between the mouse and the human sequence (27Iyer N.V. Leung S.W. Semenza G.L. Genomics. 1998; 52: 159-165Google Scholar). Studies have shown that PKC can increase the rate of gene transcription via the Sp1 transcription factor (28Han J.W. Ahn S.H. Kim Y.K. Bae G.U. Yoon J.W. Hong S. Lee H.Y. Lee Y.W. Lee H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42084-42090Google Scholar, 29Zheng X.L. Matsubara S. Diao C. Hollenberg M.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31747-31754Google Scholar). We are currently undertaking studies to investigate this possibility. Free radicals have been shown to play a crucial role in the activity of a number of signaling pathways in VSMC (24Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Google Scholar, 30Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Google Scholar, 31Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Google Scholar, 32Brasier A.R. Jamaluddin M. Han Y. Patterson C. Runge M.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 212: 155-169Google Scholar, 33Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16993-16999Google Scholar). We and others have shown that ROS production is important for the induction of HIF-1α protein levels by vasoactive hormones (14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Google Scholar, 34Gorlach A. Diebold I. Schini-Kerth V.B. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Roth U. Brandes R.P. Kietzmann T. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 47-54Google Scholar). However, ROS inhibitors do not affect the ability of Ang II to up-regulate the rate of HIF-1α gene transcription, indicating that a second pathway was involved in the induction of HIF-1α by Ang II. Ushio-Fukai et al. (24Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Google Scholar) has clearly shown that Ang II activates the PI3K pathway in VSMC. Recently, a number of studies have shown that this pathway plays an important role in the induction of HIF-1α by non-hypoxic factors such as heregulin and insulin (20Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Google Scholar, 35Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Semenza G.L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27975-27981Google Scholar). These factors have no effect on HIF-1α mRNA transcription but instead increase HIF-1α protein translation. We therefore wanted to investigate whether ROS-dependent activation of the PI3K pathway by Ang II in VSMC could increase HIF-1α translation of the newly increased HIF-1α mRNA. We demonstrate that this is indeed the case and that the 5′-UTR is critically involved in this increase. A possible mechanism by which Ang II could increase the rate of HIF-1α translation involves the activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF-4F) and/or the ribosomal S6 protein by the PI3K/p70S6K/mTOR pathway. p70S6K regulates the translation of a group of mRNAs possessing a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5′TOP), a stretch of 4–14 pyrimidines found at the extreme 5′-terminus of certain mRNAs (36Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Google Scholar). The HIF-1α 5′-UTR contains these tracts, including a long conserved sequence in the extreme 5′ terminus (27Iyer N.V. Leung S.W. Semenza G.L. Genomics. 1998; 52: 159-165Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the S6 protein of the 40 S ribosomal unit by p70S6K increases the translation of the 5′-TOP mRNAs. In VSMC, the p70S6K pathway has been shown to be implicated in the increases in protein translation induced by Ang II (37Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Google Scholar). The eIF-4F complex is formed by interactions between eIF-4E, eIF-4G, and other factors. This complex binds to the 5′-mRNA cap structure and permits the recruitment of the eukaryotic ribosome (38Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Google Scholar). eIF-4E activity is blocked by interaction with 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation. Hypo-phosphorylated 4E-BPs strongly bind eIF-4E, whereas hyper-phosphorylated 4E-BPs release eIF-4E. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP is regulated by PI3K/mTOR. In VSMC, Ang II increases 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (39Fleurent M. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4006-4012Google Scholar) through the PI3K pathway. 3G.A. Robitaille and D.E. Richard, unpublished results. eIF-4E is also phosphorylated in VSMC following Ang II stimulation, leading to increased protein synthesis (40Rao G.N. Griendling K.K. Frederickson R.M. Sonenberg N. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7180-7184Google Scholar). PKC activity was shown to be implicated in this phosphorylation, suggesting again that PKC plays a central role in the induction of HIF-1α by Ang II. A second study has also shown that ROS are implicated in eIF-4E phosphorylation, further supporting our findings (33Rao G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16993-16999Google Scholar). During our previous study, two observations indicated that, in VSMC, hypoxia and Ang II acted through different pathways. First, the hypoxic and Ang II effects were additive, and, second, DPI completely blocked Ang II-mediated HIF-1α protein increases while having no effect on the HIF-1α induction by hypoxia. In this study we clearly demonstrate that the actions of Ang II in VSMC are distinct from those of hypoxia. It is essential to understand that, in VSMC, hypoxia had no effect on the rate of HIF-1α transcription or translation. We believe that, in this way, Ang II can increase the low basal expression levels of HIF-1α mRNA in quiescent VSMC and effectively translate the messenger, leading to high HIF-1α protein expression levels during Ang II stimulation, whereas hypoxia relies on increased protein stability to maintain elevated HIF-1α protein expression levels. 4E.L. Pagé and D.E. Richard, unpublished results. Given the low expression levels of HIF-1α mRNA in quiescent VSMC, this would explain the mediocre induction of HIF-1α in response to hypoxia. However, when cells are stimulated with both hypoxia and hormones or growth factors, the induction of HIF-1α is additive because of the different pathways activated (see Ref. 14Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Google Scholar). In conclusion, our study provides data that identifies two interesting mechanisms by which Ang II (and other hormones like thrombin) activates the HIF-1 complex. By binding to the AT1 receptor, Ang II activates at least two distinct pathways involved in the up-regulation of HIF-1. The first, by increasing HIF-1α mRNA expression levels, leads to increased HIF-1α protein expression activity. The second, which involves ROS production, results in an increased rate of translation of the HIF-1α protein. An active HIF-1 complex is thus formed that increases the expression of its target genes, including VEGF. Given the importance of these genes in cellular physiology, we strongly believe that these studies will have a strong impact on vascular biology. We are grateful to Drs.

Understanding the mechanism of action of Bt toxin and development of resistance in insects is fundamental in sustaining the use of Cry proteins in integrated pest management. One of the mechanisms of resistance development is an alteration in the binding ability and/or a decrease in the population of receptor molecules, which bind Bt toxin in the insect midgut (2Gould F. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 701-726Google Scholar). There have been intense efforts to characterize the nature of this receptor. As a result of several independent experiments employing ligand blot analysis and fluorescent labeling of insecticidal proteins, cadherin and aminopeptidase N (APN) have emerged as main putative receptor molecules (Ref. 3Jenkins J.L. Dean D.H. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering Principles and Methods. 22. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2000: 33-54Google Scholar and references there in). While the role of a receptor molecule in mediating the effect of Cry toxin is acknowledged, the identity of this receptor is still being worked out. Aminopeptidase N from Manduca sexta was the first molecule to be tentatively identified as a Cry toxin-binding protein (4Knight P.J.K. Crickmore N. Ellar D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 429-436Google Scholar, 5Sangadala S. Walters F.S. English L.H. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10088-10092Google Scholar), and APN is the most extensively studied putative receptor, having been identified and isolated subsequently from other lepidopteran insect pests. Independently, a 210-kDa cadherin-like protein from M. sexta was shown to interact with Cry1Ab toxin (6Vadlamudi R.K. Weber B. Ji I. Ji T.H. Bulla L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5490-5494Google Scholar) and later its presence and toxin interaction was also demonstrated from another insect, Bombyx mori (7Nagamatsu Y. Koike T. Sasaki K. Yoshimoto A. Furukawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 385-390Google Scholar). Relative abundance of APN in the posterior midgut (8Carroll J. Wolfersberger M.G. Ellar D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3099-3104Google Scholar) and lower binding constants of Cry toxin toward cadherin as compared with APN (9Jenkins J.L. Dean D.H. BMC Biochemistry. 2001; 2: 12Google Scholar) raised apprehension about the role of APN as a receptor for Bt toxin in the insect midgut. Moreover, a recent report shows that high levels of resistance to the Bt toxin, Cry1Ac, inHeliothis virescens is due to disruption of a cadherin superfamily gene by retroposon-mediated insertion (10Gahan L.J. Gould F. Heckel D.G. Science. 2001; 293: 857-860Google Scholar). Althoughin vitro experiments such as toxin-induced increase in the86Rb+ efflux from lipid vesicles reconstituted with APN and reduction in the inhibition of short circuit current (ISC) for Cry1Ac following the release of APN from midgut membrane by phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C treatment provide support for the role of APN as a receptor, the vital in vivo evidence for receptor characterization is lacking (5Sangadala S. Walters F.S. English L.H. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10088-10092Google Scholar,11Lee M. You T. Young B. Cotrill J. Valaitis A. Dean D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2845-2849Google Scholar). RNA interference (RNAi) is a process of dsRNA-mediated gene silencing in which only the mRNA cognate to dsRNA is specifically degraded (12Fire A. Xu S.Q. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Google Scholar, 13Kennerdell J.R. Carthew R.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 1017-1026Google Scholar, 14Lee N.S. Dohjima T. Bauer G. Li H. Li M.J. Ehsani A. Salvaterra P. Rossi J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 500-505Google Scholar). Recently, we reported isolation of a 2.8-kb APN-encoding geneslapn (AF320764), from the midgut of the polyphagous pest,Spodoptera litura, and its expression in the insect cells by a baculovirus expression vector. By in vitro ligand blot analysis and immunofluorescence toxin binding studies, we demonstrated a direct interaction between the expressed receptor and Cry1C protein (15Agrawal N. Malhotra P. Bhatnagar R.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4583-4592Google Scholar). Here we report that dsRNA-mediated silencing of the aminopeptidase N gene results in increased resistance of S. litura larvae to Cry1C protein, thereby demonstrating a functional role for this protein in Cry protein-mediated toxicity. S. litura larvae were reared on fresh castor leaves (Ricinus communis) under a photoperiod of 14:10 h (light:dark), 70% relative humidity, and 27 °C. Midguts from 6th instar 1st day larvae were dissected in DEPC-treated water, snap-frozen into liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Total RNA was isolated from the midgut tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. The amount of RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Inclusion bodies (IB) of Cry1C toxin were prepared as reported earlier by Lee (16Lee M.K. Milne R.E. Ge Z. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3115-3121Google Scholar). The amount of the toxin was quantitated densitometrically by resolving the IB on SDS-PAGE. Toxin amounts from 1000 to 10,000 ng was diluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 μl of each concentration was coated on both the sides of a castor leaf disc (area = 3.8 cm2). The toxin-coated leaf disc was air-dried and placed in a well of a 12-well tissue culture plate (Nunc Inc). One 6th instar 1st day larva was released on each well and exposed to the toxin treatment for 24 h. After 24 h the larva was transferred to fresh castor leaves (without toxin). Mortality was recorded after 4 days and the LC50 value calculated by Probit analysis using the software Indo Stat (Indostat Services, Hyderabad, India). Ten larvae were tested for each treatment and the bioassay replicated three times. LC50 values were also determined for neonate larvae ofS. litura by coating castor leaf discs with different doses of Cry1C toxin and scoring the mortality in each treatment after 72 h. 10 neonate larvae were released on each leaf disc, and each treatment was replicated five times. The dsRNA was prepared following the procedure prevoiusly described by us (17Malhotra P. Dasaradhi P.V.N. Kumar A. Mohmmed A. Agrawal N. Bhatnagar R.K. Chauhan V.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1245-1254Google Scholar). A 756-bp fragment, from amino acid 609 to 861, was amplified from the S. litura APN gene and subcloned in pGEM-Te. The cloned fragment was amplified using vector-specific universal and reverse primers (Promega). The PCR product was purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen GmbH) and used as a template to generate sense RNA (sRNA) and antisense RNA (asRNA) using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases (Ambion), respectively. To make dsRNA, equal amounts of sRNA and asRNA were mixed, heated to 65 °C, and annealed by slow cooling over 4 h followed by DNase (Invitrogen) treatment for 15 min at 37 °C. The dsRNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform and precipitated overnight with ice-cold ethanol in the presence of 0.3m sodium acetate at −20 °C. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of DEPC-treated water. Varying doses of dsRNA were injected intrahemocoelically into early 5th instar S. litura larvae using a microapplicator (KDS 200, KD Scientific Inc., New Hope, PA). After 48 h, the insect midguts were dissected, and total RNA was extracted. The quantity of RNA in each treatment was normalized by amplifying the β-actin gene in each treatment to equal intensity after 20 cycles of RT-PCR using the Titan one-tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics Gmbh). The amplification regimen was as follows: reverse transcription at 43 °C for 35 min followed by 20 PCR cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, re-annealing at 51 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. Using this normalized amount of RNA as template, the slapntranscript in different treatments was compared by amplifying a 756-bp part of the slapn gene. Before loading on 1% agarose gel the RT-PCR products were treated with 1 μg of RNase (Qiagen GmbH) at 37 °C for 10 min to eliminate template RNA, since it hinders the correct estimation of the β-actin gene product in the gel. The gels were photographed with Polaroid 667 black and white print film and scanned for net intensity of each RT-PCR product using the software Kodak 1D, version 2.0. BBMVs were prepared from 6th instar midgut by following the protocol of Wolfersberger (18Wolfersberger M.G. Luthy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Saachi V.F. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1987; 86: 301-308Google Scholar). One microgram of the BBMV protein was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrotransfered to nitrocellulose membranes at 50 mA for 2 h at 4 °C. The blot was blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 1:50,000 dilution of anti-APN antibodies. Subsequently, the blot was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and developed with NBT-BCIP substrate. Low molecular weight RNA was isolated from midgut of insects injected with α-32P-labeled dsRNA following the protocol of Hamilton and Baulcombe (19Hamilton A.J. Baulcombe D.C. Science. 1999; 286: 950-952Google Scholar) and resolved on 12% acrylamide 7 m urea gel in 1× TBE buffer (10.8 g of Tris, 5.5 g of boric acid, 4.0 ml of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, made up to 1 liter with water). The gel was dried and exposed to a Kodak Bio-Max MR autoradiographic film overnight at −70 °C. The film was developed to detect the occurrence of radiolabeled siRNA. To evaluate the functional role of aminopeptidase N in the insecticidal activity of Cry1C in vivo, we sought to specifically inhibit the expression of slapn by its corresponding dsRNA. The reported routes of dsRNA delivery in lower eukaryotes such as Caenorhabditis elegans are soaking, feeding, or injection of dsRNA solution into the worm (12Fire A. Xu S.Q. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Google Scholar, 20Tabara H. Grishok A. Mello C. Science. 1998; 282: 430-431Google Scholar), while dsRNA in Drosophila melanogaster was introduced by injecting into eggs. D. melanogaster embryos hatched from dsRNA-injected eggs displayed nearly 75% gene-silencing, which reduces to 3% with maturity (21Misquitta L. Paterson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1451-1456Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments to introduce dsRNA into neonate larvae of S. litura by soaking them in dsRNA solution or by feeding through diet were unsuccessful, since no reduction in transcript levels was detected. Subsequently, varying amounts of dsRNA were injected into hemolymph of 5th instar larvae (2 μl/insect) using a microapplicator (KDS 200, KD Scientific Inc.). After 48 h of injection of dsRNA the transcript abundance was estimated by relative RT-PCR. An injection of 4 μg of dsRNA resulted in a 95% reduction over control of midgut slapn transcript levels (Fig. 1 a, lanes 1 and 2). The consequence of decrease in slapn transcript on the susceptibility of S. litura larvae against Cry1C protein was examined by performing toxicity assays. Initially, the assays were performed on freshly moulted, 6th instar larvae (injected with 2 μl of DEPC-treated water in 5th instar), a developmental stage corresponding to the growth status of 5th instar larvae after 48 h of injection. These larvae were released on 3.8-cm2 castor leaf discs coated with various concentrations of Cry1C protein (1–10 μg). Mortality was recorded after 4 days and LC50 (50% lethal concentration) value calculated by probit analysis. The calculated LC50 value was 5.642 μg/disc with the regression equation, y = 5.1921x-14.478, and the fiducial limits lie between 5.355 and 6.025 μg. Larvae injected with dsRNA and released on castor leaf discs coated with 6 μg of Cry1C displayed reduction in the mortality rate. The increase in tolerance for dsRNA-injected larvae to Cry1C protein correlated with a comparable (70%) increase in the larvae that pupated. On the other hand, none of the control larvae could reach pupation (TableI).Table IReduction in S. litura's toxicity to Cry1C by dsRNATreatmentEffect on 6th instar larvaeEffect on neonate larvae in next generation, mortality %MortalityPupation%%Control61.0a00.0a65.0adsRNA injected15.0 (75.0)b70.0 (70.0)b45.0 (30.0)bslapn dsRNA was injected into 5th instar, 1st day larvae at 4 μg/larvae. Control larvae were injected with DEPC water of equal volume. On moulting to 6th instar, the larvae were transferred to individual leaf discs (3.8 cm2) coated with 6.0 μg of Cry1C protein. After 24 h, the larvae were transferred to fresh leaves. The experiment was replicated on three different occasions with 50 larvae each. Mortality was recorded 4 days after toxin application. In a separate experiment, 50 larvae injected with slapn dsRNA were allowed to grow without being exposed to Cry1C, pupate, and mate among themselves. The neonates from this treatment were transferred to castor leaf discs (3.8 cm2) coated with 250 ng of Cry1C and compared with neonates emerging from normal insects. Ten larvae of each treatment were released on toxin-coated leaf discs and replicated 15 times. The mortality data were subjected to Students t test and values superscripted by a and b are significantly different at 95% confidence limits. Values in parentheses indicate percent reduction in mortality over control. Open table in a new tab slapn dsRNA was injected into 5th instar, 1st day larvae at 4 μg/larvae.

The mortality data were subjected to Students t test and values superscripted by a and b are significantly different at 95% confidence limits. Values in parentheses indicate percent reduction in mortality over control. To examine the effect on the expression of APN upon dsRNA delivery, BBMVs were prepared by the differential MgCl2 method from the midgut of 6th instar larvae and resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Probing the BBMV proteins with anti-APN antibodies revealed nearly 80% reduction in APN expression in dsRNA-injected larvae as compared with control larvae (Fig. 1 b). Thus the reduction in the expression of aminopeptidase correlates well with the reduction ofslapn transcript levels and the decreased sensitivity to Cry1C proteins (Fig. 1 a). Fifth instar larvae injected with slapn dsRNA were reared up to pupation and bred into the next generation. Analysis of neonate larvae for abundance of slapn transcript revealed 60% reduction in slapn levels (Fig. 1 a, lanes 3 and 4). Neonate larvae of the F1 generation withslapn silencing displayed resistance to Cry1C toxin compared with untreated neonate larvae (Table I). The LC50 value of Cry1C on untreated neonate larvae was 200 ng/3.8 cm2. An important step in RNAi-mediated gene silencing is the formation of 21–25-nt siRNAs, which target and degrade mRNA of the target gene (22Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2000; 101: 25-33Google Scholar). In the present study, the generation of siRNA was investigated by extracting LMW RNA (19Hamilton A.J. Baulcombe D.C. Science. 1999; 286: 950-952Google Scholar) from the midgut of larvae injected with α-P32-labeled dsRNA. By resolving the LMW RNA preparation on PAGE, a distinct band corresponding to 25 nt is observed (Fig.1 c). Occurrence of a 25-mer oligonucleotide establishes that RNAi pathway in larvae is similar to that observed in other organisms. Thus in the present study, we have demonstrated that the dsRNA-mediated silencing of slapn in whole S. litura larvae resulted in the decrease in the amount of APN expressed in the epithelial membrane of midgut cells, which in turn enabled the larvae to tolerate lethal concentrations of the Cry1C protein. By performingin vivo experiments we are able to provide a direct evidence for the role of APN as a Bt toxin receptor in the midgut of insects. The silencing of the S. litura apn by introducing cognate dsRNA into larvae demonstrates that RNAi functions in whole larvae and also that the midgut columnar cells can take up dsRNA molecules injected in the hemocoel. This result shows that like in the plant kingdom, there is a “systemic” effect of RNAi in animals too, in organs away from the point of delivery of dsRNA. Also, we show that RNAi effect by dsRNA administration is heritable in the next generation, as comparable with the interference obtained by using “hairpin-loop” RNA (23Kenderdell J.R. Carthew R.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 896-898Google Scholar). Here, we have used RNAi as a technique to probe the function of a protein as a toxin receptor, thereby implying that it can be used to explore the functional role of different proteins involved in various host-pathogen interactions."

These channels may be localized to large multimeric signaling complexes via association with PDZ-containing scaffolding proteins.

To determine subunit arrangement, individual TRPC channel pairs were heterologously expressed in Sf9 insect cells and immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for each channel subtype. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations showed that TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 co-associate and that TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 co-associate but that cross-association between the two major subgroups does not occur. Additionally, the interaction between each TRPC channel and the PDZ-containing protein, INAD (protein responsible for theinactivation-no-after-potentialDrosophila mutant), was examined.

Trends Neurosci. 2001; 23: 159-166Google Scholar). In the last 7 years, 21 mammalian homologs have been discovered. There are currently seven mammalian TRP siblings designated TRPC1–TRPC7 that exhibit 32–47% overall identity at the amino acid level compared with the Drosophila isoforms. Based on amino acid sequence homologies, the TRPC family can be into divided into two major subgroups: TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 and TRPC3, -C6, and -C7. TRPC2, which is a pseudogene in humans (4Wes P.D. Chevesich J. Jeromin A. Rosenberg C. Stetten G. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9652-9656Google Scholar), is related but is clearly distinct from the two major subgroups. The primary TRPC channels, like theDrosophila versions, appear to be regulated by phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent mechanisms and thus are thought to be intimately involved in receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling. In many cell types, a specific receptor-activated channel appears to be regulated by the level of Ca2+ within the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive internal Ca2+ store (5Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Google Scholar, 6Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.-P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Google Scholar). These so-called store-operated channels are responsible for the Ca2+ release-activated current,ICRAC (7Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Google Scholar). There is evidence from heterologous expression studies (8Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Harteneck C. Kalkbrenner F. Lückhoff A. Schultz G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1189-1196Google Scholar, 9Warnat J.

Ambudkar I.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1652-1654Google Scholar) that mammalian TRPC channel subunits are components of store-operated channels, although results in the literature are often conflicting. There is, however, general agreement that TRPC3 and TRPC6, and perhaps TRPC7, comprise channels that can be regulated by diacylglycerol (20Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Google Scholar, 21Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Google Scholar). Based on the known structure of K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels, it is assumed that TRPC channels are composed of four subunits, and there is growing evidence to suggest heteromultimeric channel assembly (22Xu X.Z.S. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar, 23Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldsetzer M. Baskaran T. Graier W.F. Romanin C. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol.

Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar). However, the channel composition in vivo and the rules governing subunit assembly remain to be determined. Likewise, how these tetrameric channels are localized in the plasmalemma is unknown. Selective localization to specific domains of the membrane appears to play an important role in signal transduction (26Delmas P. Wanaverbecq N. Abogadie F.C. Mistry M. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 209-220Google Scholar). In this regard, studies inDrosophila photoreceptor cells have shown that TRP channels are held in a signaling complex (i.e. a signalplex) by a scaffolding protein called INAD (1Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; : RE1Google Scholar). INAD contains five tandem PDZ domains that serve as protein binding modules mediating the clustering of proteins involved in the Drosophila phototransduction cascade (e.g. TRP, TRPL, PLC, protein kinase C, and calmodulin). Likewise, PDZ-containing proteins may provide the scaffolding necessary for TRPC channel signalplex formation and localization in mammalian cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments in heterologous expression systems and rat brain have shown that the first PDZ domain of the Na+-H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) binds TRPC4, TRPC5, PLCβ1, and PLCβ2 (27Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither NHERF nor INAD appear to bind TRPC3 (27Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Google Scholar, 28Xu X.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Google Scholar), suggesting that only certain TRPC channel subunits may associate with PDZ-containing proteins and consequently contribute to the signalplex in mammalian cells. In order to determine the subunit arrangement of native TRPC channels, we isolated and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against amino acid sequences specific for each channel subtype. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations of individual TRPC channel pairs heterologously expressed in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculovirus revealed that TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 co-associate and that TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 co-associate but that cross-association between the two major subgroups does not occur. Additionally, we examined the interaction between each TRPC channel and the PDZ-containing protein, INAD. TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 co-immunoprecipitated with INAD, whereas TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 did not. In order to define channel subunit interactions in vivo, synaptosomal preparations were isolated from rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Again the immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that TRPC1, -C4, and -C5 co-associate and that TRPC3, -C6, and -C7 co-associate in both cortex and cerebellum but that cross-association between the two major subgroups does not occur. These results not only demonstrate that TRPC channels are present in nerve terminals, but they provide the first direct evidence for selective assembly of channel subunits in vivo. Selective subunit assembly and selective interaction with PDZ-containing proteins may underlie differences in the activation mechanism for the various TRPC channels and help to explain conflicting results with regard to their putative role as store-operated channels. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured as previously described (29Hu Y. Rajan L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1736-C1743Google Scholar,30O'Reilly D.R.

Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar) using Grace's insect medium supplemented with 2% lactalbumin hydrolysate, 2% yeastolate solution, 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin solution (Invitrogen). Peptide sequences specific to each human TRPC protein (Table I) were selected based on specificity, potential immunogenicity, and similarity across species lines. Additionally, peptide sequences were selected that lacked potential phosphorylation sites, which might render antibodies ineffective for in vivo immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Because each sequence chosen had one or more lysine and/or arginine residues, the peptides were synthesized with a cysteine at the NH2 terminus for subsequent conjugation to carrier proteins. An aminocaproic acid linker (NH2-(CH2)5-COOH) was inserted between the NH2-terminal cysteine and the peptide sequence to provide greater exposure of the peptide on the surface of KLH, which was used as the carrier protein for rabbit immunization. Peptide synthesis, including the addition of cysteine and aminocaproic acid groups, and peptide conjugation to KLH and to SulfoLink coupling gel were performed by Aves Labs (Tigard, OR). Rabbit immunizations and serum collection were performed by Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory (Canadensis, PA).Table IPeptide sequences used to generate human TRPC-specific polyclonal antibodiesAnti-TRPC1Anti-TRPC3Anti-TRPC4Human683LKEWRNLKQKRDEN969730RRRRLQKDIEMGMGN744826QEPPREKQRKVNFV839MouseLKEWRNLKQKRDENRRRRLQKDLELGMGNQEPPREKQRKVNFVRatLKEWRNLKQKRDENRRRRLQKDLELGMGNQEPPREKQRKVNFVBovineLKEWRHLNEKRDENNAQEPPREKQRKVNFVAnti-TRPC5Anti-TRPC6Anti-TRPC7Human955DLLMHKWGDGQEEQ968796QEDAEMNKINEEKK809843EKFGKNLNKDHLRVN857MouseDLLMHKWGDGQEEQQEDAEMNKRNEEKKEKFGKNLNKDHLRVNRatDLLMHKWGDGQEEQQEDAEMNKRNEEKKNABovineNANANA Open table in a new tab The IgG fraction from aliquots of rabbit serum was isolated using a Hi-Trap Protein G column (Amersham Biosciences). An aliquot of rabbit serum (4 ml) adjusted to pH 8.0 with 0.4 ml of 1 m Tris was passed twice over a column pre-equilibrated with column buffer (0.1m Tris, pH 8.0). The column was washed with ice-cold column buffer until the A280 of the eluant was less than 0.01. Bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.8) and collected as 0.5-ml aliquots in Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl of 1 m Tris (pH 8.0). The A280 of each fraction was tested, and the fractions containing the majority of protein were pooled. An affinity column was created by adding 2 ml of peptide-SulfoLink affinity resin to a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad). The pooled IgG fractions were added, and the column was placed on a rotary mixer for 1 h at 4 °C. The column was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline until the A280 of the eluant was less than 0.01. Bound antibody was eluted with 0.1m glycine (pH 2.8) as described above, and the protein fractions were pooled. The pooled fractions were concentrated by centrifugation using a molecular weight 30,000 cut-off spin filter (Ultrafree-4; Millipore Corp.). The concentrated sample was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and recentrifuged. After three such washes, the purified antibody was concentrated to a volume of about 0.5 ml, an equal volume of glycerol was added, and the final preparation was stored at −20 °C. Stock solutions of affinity-purified rabbit anti-TRPC antibodies ranged in final concentration from 0.7 mg/ml (TRPC6) to 3.1 mg/ml (TRPC5). For Western blot analysis, the primary TRPC antibodies were used at a 1:10,000 dilution or 0.07–0.31 μg/ml. This equates to a final antibody concentration of 0.5–2 nm. For immunoprecipitations, the antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution. The cDNAs for the TRPC channel proteins were generous gifts from the following investigators: human TRPC1 and TRPC3, Dr. Craig Montell (The Johns Hopkins University); mouse TRPC7 and TRPC5, Drs. Yasuo Mori (National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan) and Mike Zhu (Ohio State University); and mouse TRPC6, Drs. Guylain Boulay and Lutz Birnbaumer (UCLA). The cDNA for bovine TRPC4 was cloned, using reverse transcriptase-PCR, from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. The INAD cDNA and antibodies were generous gifts from Dr. Bih-Hwa Shieh (Vanderbilt University). The cDNAs encoding the various mammalian TRPC channel proteins and INAD were individually subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector, PVL1393, using standard techniques. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced using the BaculoGoldTM transfection kit (Pharmingen) as described in the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Recombinant viruses were plaque-purified and amplified to obtain a high titer viral stock solution. The virus was stored at 4 °C under sterile conditions. Sf9 cells in Grace's medium were plated into 100-mm plastic tissue culture dishes or onto glass coverslips (∼105 cells/cm2). Following incubation for 30 min, an aliquot of viral stock was added (multiplicity of infection was ∼10), and the cells were maintained at 27 °C in a humidified air atmosphere. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were used at 28 h postinfection. Synaptosomes were isolated from rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum exactly as described by Cotman (31Cotman C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 445-452Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared as described below immediately following isolation of the final synaptosomal preparation. Lysates were stored frozen (−80 °C) at a protein concentration of ∼0.5 mg/ml. Following infection with recombinant baculovirus, Sf9 cells were harvested, subjected to centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and resuspended at a density of 5 × 106cells/ml in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice using a sonic dismembranator (Fisher) on a power setting of 2.5. The cell suspension was sonicated three times for 10 s with a 10-s rest between pulses. The cell lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was discarded, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 42,000 × gfor 30 min. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer at a protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C until use. Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus were incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.2% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside, 0.2 mmsodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein extracts from Sf9 cells or synaptosomal lysates were centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and partially solubilized membrane fragments. Lysates (∼500 μg of protein) were precleared by adding control IgG together with protein A/G-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 3 h. Immunocomplexes were captured by incubating with protein A/G-agarose beads at 4 °C for 12 h. Beads were pelleted, washed four times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer (100 μl), and boiled for 3 min. Cell lysates and immunocomplexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (5 μg of lysate protein or 10 μl of immunoprecipitate per lane) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (100 V for 1 h) in Tris-glycine buffer. Blots were probed with the indicated primary antibody and detected, following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, by SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The figures show representative results from at least three independent experiments. For the co-expression experiments in Sf9 cells, this represents at least three independent infections. Antibodies were generated in rabbits against peptide sequences specific to each human TRPC channel protein (Table I). The sequences chosen were either identical or had only one or two amino acid differences when compared with the same mouse, rat, and bovine sequences. All of the sequences are in the COOH-terminal region and are predicted to be cytoplasmic. In preliminary experiments, each antibody was evaluated for its ability to selectively recognize the appropriate TRPC channel protein expressed in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculovirus. The proteins examined and their predicted molecular masses were as follows: human TRPC1 (accession numberX89066; Mr = 87.6 kDa) and TRPC3 (U47050; 97.3 kDa); bovine TRPC4 (X99792; 112.5 kDa); and mouse TRPC5 (AF029983; 111.4 kDa), TRPC6 (U49069; 106.7 kDa), and TRPC7 (AF139923; 99.5 kDa). Sf9 cells were infected, and membrane fractions were isolated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using each of the affinity-purified anti-TRPC antibodies. With the exception of anti-TRPC1 and anti-TRPC6, the results showed that each antibody 1) recognized the appropriate TRPC channel protein, 2) did not recognize other membrane proteins endogenously expressed in Sf9 cells, 3) did not recognize any baculovirus proteins, and 4) exhibited no cross-reactivity with any of the other TRPC channel proteins (see Fig. 1 in Supplementary Material). Anti-TRPC1 also selectively recognized the TRPC1 channel protein, but an additional band at a slightly higher molecular mass was often observed (Fig. 1 in Supplementary Material). Likewise, anti-TRPC6 recognized the TRPC6 channel protein, but an additional band was sometimes observed at or slightly above the dye front (∼30 kDa). These bands were also seen in Sf9 cells expressing each of the TRPC proteins and in Sf9 cells infected with an unrelated baculovirus containing the human B2bradykinin receptor cDNA. Thus, these additional bands probably reflect either an endogenous Sf9 cell membrane protein or a baculovirus protein. We next examined the ability of each anti-TRPC antibody to immunoprecipitate the appropriate protein from total Sf9 cell lysates (see Fig. 2 in Supplementary Material). Each anti-TRPC antibody was able to immunoprecipitate the appropriate TRPC channel protein. Two bands were immunoprecipitated using the anti-TRPC1 antibody. As indicated above, the lower molecular mass band reflects TRPC1, whereas the upper band may reflect an endogenous Sf9 cell protein. The Sf9 cell-baculovirus system is useful for the co-expression of proteins or co-expression of protein subunits. When used at appropriate multiplicities of infection, individual subunits are properly assembled into a functioning unit in Sf9 cells co-infected with individual recombinant baculoviruses (32Puri T.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4900-4905Google Scholar). We took advantage of this system to determine whether the TRPC channel proteins co-assemble. Each TRPC channel was individually co-expressed in channel pairs with the other members of the channel family. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed for each pair. The results show that TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 co-immunoprecipitate from Sf9 cell lysates when expressed in the appropriate combinations (Fig. 1). Likewise, TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2). In contrast, TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 did not co-precipitate with TRPC3, TRPC6, or TRPC7 (Fig. 3; the reciprocal immunoprecipitations for each channel pair are not shown in Fig. 3 but were also negative). These results suggest that there is association between the members of the two major TRPC channel subgroups but that there is no cross-association between groups.Figure 2TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 co-immunoprecipitate from Sf9 cell lysates.

Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Google Scholar). Likewise,Drosophila TRP and TRPL interact with INAD but not with TRPC3 (28Xu X.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that there may be subgroup-specific interaction of TRPCs with PDZ domains. To begin to examine this question, we co-expressed INAD in Sf9 cells along with the individual TRPC channel proteins. As seen in Fig. 4, INAD co-immunoprecipitated with TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 but not with TRPC3, TRPC6, or TRPC7. To determine whether the subgroup specificity of interaction is also true of native TRPC channels as they exist in their normal signaling environment, we performed immunoprecipitations from isolated nerve endings (synaptosomes) obtained from rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Synaptosomes were isolated from the 6/13% interface of a Ficoll step gradient as previously described (31Cotman C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 445-452Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, TRPC channel proteins were only observed in lysates prepared from material obtained at the 6/13% interface; TRPCs were not present at the 4/6% interface. This result is consistent with co-enrichment of TRPC channel proteins with synaptosomes. We next evaluated the ability of each antibody to immunoprecipitate the appropriate channel protein from synaptosomal lysates. With the exception of TRPC4, each of the anti-TRPC antibodies immunoprecipitated a protein of appropriate molecular mass from both cortex and cerebellum, although TRPC7 was difficult to detect in cortex (Fig. 5). We were unable to immunoprecipitate or detect TRPC4 in either cortex or cerebellum, a rather paradoxical result, given that TRPC4 was detected in immunoprecipitations from Sf9 cells (Fig. 1) and, in previous studies, from rat brain (25Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar, 27Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Google Scholar). In some gels, additional minor bands were seen. These may reflect glycosylated forms or alternatively spliced versions of the TRPC proteins in brain. We next performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from cortex and cerebellar synaptosomal lysates. As seen in Fig. 6, TRPC1 co-immunoprecipitated with TRPC5. Much to our surprise, TRPC4 also co-immunoprecipitated with TRPC1 and TRPC5 (Fig. 6), but neither TRPC1 nor TRPC5 immunoprecipitated with TRPC4 (not shown). These results suggest that the epitope on native TRPC4 is not accessible to the anti-TRPC4 antibody. Furthermore, the results suggest that TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 all co-associate in rat cerebral cortex. The same results were obtained in synaptosomal preparations isolated from cerebellum (not shown). As seen in Fig. 7, TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 co-immunoprecipitated from rat cerebellar synaptosomal lysates but did not co-immunoprecipitate with TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 (Fig. 8; the reciprocal immunoprecipitations for each channel pair are not shown in Fig. 8 but were also negative). Results essentially identical to those shown in Figs. 7 and 8 were also obtained in synaptosomal preparations isolated from cortex (not shown). These results suggest that there is association between the members of the two major TRPC channel subgroups in vivo but that there is no cross-association between groups.Figure 6TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 co-immunoprecipitate from rat cortex synaptosomes.

In the present study, we characterized rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against amino acid sequences specific for each TRPC channel protein expressed in Sf9 insect cells using recombinant baculovirus. Using this system, we found that the affinity-purified TRPC antibodies were specific and selective and recognized the appropriate TRPC channel proteins with high affinity. Furthermore, each TRPC antibody preparation was capable of immunoprecipitating the appropriate TRPC protein from Sf9 cell lysates, suggesting that the specific epitope recognized by the antibodies was exposed in each homomeric channel. With the exception of TRPC4, each TRPC antibody was also able to immunoprecipitate the appropriate TRPC channel protein from rat brain synaptosomal preparations, again suggesting that the epitope is exposed in the native channel signalplex. However, we were unable to immunoprecipitate TRPC4 from synaptosomes using the TRPC4-specific antibody. This apparently did not reflect the absence of TRPC4 protein in the nerve terminals, since TRPC4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-TRPC1 and anti-TRPC5 antibodies. The simplest explanation, consistent with all of the results, is that the epitope for TRPC4 is not exposed in the native channel signalplex. Thus, amino acids 826–839 of TRPC4 may be partially or totally occluded by other TRPC subunits present in the heteromultimeric channel or may be blocked by some other protein present in the signalplex. Based on amino acid sequence similarities, the TRPC channel family can be subdivided into two major subgroups: (a) TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 and (b) TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7. Two lines of evidence suggest that members of each subgroup assemble to form heteromeric channel structures but that cross-association between subgroups does not occur. First, only members of each group co-immunoprecipitate following in vitro expression of individual subunit pairs. All of the immunoprecipitations were performed in a reciprocal fashion. Thus, association of the individual subunits is not dependent on the antibody used for precipitation. Likewise, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations of all channel pairings between the two major subgroups were negative. Thus, the interactions found within subgroups were specific and unrelated to technical artifacts such as mutual micellar associations. Second, only members of each subgroup assemble in vivo; no association was found between subgroups. Again, these experiments were all performed in a reciprocal fashion and in synaptosomal preparations isolated from both cortex and cerebellum. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that within each subgroup the TRPC proteins form heteromultimeric channels both in vitro and in vivo, but the actual subunit stoichiometry of native channels remains unknown. Two previous studies suggested that TRPC1 and TRPC3 subunits form heteromultimers. Xu et al. (22Xu X.Z.S. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar) reported the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged TRPC1 and TRPC3 heterologously overexpressed in 293T cells, and Lintschinger et al. (23Lintschinger B. Balzer-Geldsetzer M. Baskaran T. Graier W.F. Romanin C. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 27799-27805Google Scholar) reported that membrane currents with unique biophysical properties were observed following co-expression of TRPC1 and TRPC3 in HEK293 cells. However, neither study reported interactions of native TRPC subunits. Strubing et al. (25Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar) reported that novel channels were observed following heterologous expression of TRPC1 and TRPC5 in HEK293 cells and that TRPC1 co-immunoprecipitated with TRPC5 from mouse brain and with TRPC4 from rat brain. Using a variety of different approaches including FRET, immunoprecipitation, and functional (electrophysiological) assays applied to heterologously expressed TRPC channel proteins, Hofmann et al. (24Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Google Scholar) reported that TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 co-assemble and that TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 co-assemble but that there was no detectable interaction between the two major subgroups. The in vitro results of the present study using a different expression system with nonmodified channel proteins and the in vivo results obtained in rat brain synaptosomes clearly support this proposed subunit interaction. One note of caution; splice variants of the TRPC proteins lacking the antibody epitope may exist. If these are expressed in rat brain, they would not be seen in our assays and may exhibit a different interaction profile. Likewise, splice variants with molecular mass similar to IgG heavy or light chains would be hidden. It is now well established that Drosophila TRP and TRPL are held in a large signalplex by a PDZ-containing scaffolding protein called INAD (1Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; : RE1Google Scholar). This signalplex appears to be essential for normal signal transduction, and both TRP and INAD are mislocalized when the interaction is disrupted through genetic mutations (36Shieh B.H. Niemeyer B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 201-210Google Scholar, 37Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Google Scholar). An analogous signalplex may be necessary for normal signal transduction and localization in mammalian cells, but there is relatively little direct evidence for TRPC signalplex formation. A number of mammalian PDZ-containing proteins with homology to INAD have been identified. These include human INAD-like (hINAD-L) (38Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Google Scholar), multiple PDZ-containing protein (MUPP1) (39Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Google Scholar), and the glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP) (40Dong H. O'Brien R.J. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Google Scholar). Their interaction with TRPC channels, however, has not been demonstrated. TRPC4 and TRPC5 have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with NHERF from brain lysates and from lysates of cells heterologously co-expressing the proteins (27Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Google Scholar), but the functional consequences of this interaction remain unknown. However, neither NHERF nor INAD bind to TRPC3, suggesting that the interaction of PDZ domains with TRPC channel proteins may be selective. The results of the present study show that TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 interact with INAD, whereas TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 do not. This result suggests that TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 may form heteromultimeric channels that are tethered to specific subcellular sites via interaction with INAD-like PDZ-containing proteins, whereas TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 may form nontethered heteromultimers. In this regard, Delmas et al.(26Delmas P. Wanaverbecq N. Abogadie F.C. Mistry M. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 209-220Google Scholar) showed that TRPC1 overexpressed in superior cervical ganglion neurons forms store-operated channels localized to a specific microdomain that includes a plasmalemmal bradykinin receptor and an endoplasmic reticulum inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. Furthermore, these investigators showed that diacylglycerol-sensitive TRPC6 channels are not localized to specific domains but rather are randomly distributed on the cell surface. In contrast, activation of either TRPC5 or TRPC1-TRPC5 heteromultimers expressed in HEK293-M1 cells is independent of Ca2+ store depletion (25Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of TRPC channel activation may depend on subunit composition, localization to specific subcellular domains, and the constellation of accessory proteins present in the signalplex. There is little information in the literature concerning TRPC protein distribution in the brain. Immunohistochemical staining of rat brain slices showed that TRPC1 immunoreactivity is present in the hippocampus, amygdala, purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and neurons of the cortex and striatum (25Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Google Scholar). In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, TRPC1 immunofluorescence, detected by confocal microscopy, was found in the cell bodies, dendrites, and axons, but TRPC1 was not observed in synapse-like structures identified by the presence of synaptophysin. In the present study, all of the TRPCs appear to be present in freshly isolated synaptosomal preparations from rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that native TRPC channels are present in nerve terminals. Preliminary confocal imaging suggests that the TRPC channel proteins are differentially expressed in various regions of rat brain. 2M. C. Buniel, P. Glazebrook,W. P. Schilling, and D. L. Kunze, manuscript in preparation. It will be interesting to determine whether the subgroup-specific association reflects selective localization to specific nerve endings or if all nerve terminals contain both tethered and nontethered forms of these channels.

https://openalex.org/W2104875047,"Several clinical and angiographic intervention trials have shown that fibrate treatment leads to a reduction of the coronary events associated to atherosclerosis. Fibrates are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) that modulate risk factors related to atherosclerosis by acting at both systemic and vascular levels. Here, we investigated the effect of treatment with the PPARα agonist fenofibrate (FF) on the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein (apo) E-deficient mice and human apoA-I transgenic apoE-deficient (hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient) mice fed a Western diet. In apoE-deficient mice, plasma lipid levels were increased by FF treatment with no alteration in the cholesterol distribution profile. FF treatment did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion surface area in the aortic sinus of 5-month-old apoE-deficient mice. By contrast, FF treatment decreased total cholesterol and esterified cholesterol contents in descending aortas of these mice, an effect that was more pronounced in older mice exhibiting more advanced lesions. Furthermore, FF treatment reduced MCP-1 mRNA levels in the descending aortas of apoE-deficient mice, whereas ABCA-1 expression levels were maintained despite a significant reduction of aortic cholesterol content. In apoE-deficient mice expressing a human apoA-I transgene, FF increased human apoA-I plasma and hepatic mRNA levels without affecting plasma lipid levels. This increase in human apoA-I expression was accompanied by a significant reduction in the lesion surface area in the aortic sinus. These data indicate that the PPARα agonist fenofibrate reduces atherosclerosis in these animal models of atherosclerosis. Several clinical and angiographic intervention trials have shown that fibrate treatment leads to a reduction of the coronary events associated to atherosclerosis.

FF treatment did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion surface area in the aortic sinus of 5-month-old apoE-deficient mice. By contrast, FF treatment decreased total cholesterol and esterified cholesterol contents in descending aortas of these mice, an effect that was more pronounced in older mice exhibiting more advanced lesions. Furthermore, FF treatment reduced MCP-1 mRNA levels in the descending aortas of apoE-deficient mice, whereas ABCA-1 expression levels were maintained despite a significant reduction of aortic cholesterol content. In apoE-deficient mice expressing a human apoA-I transgene, FF increased human apoA-I plasma and hepatic mRNA levels without affecting plasma lipid levels. This increase in human apoA-I expression was accompanied by a significant reduction in the lesion surface area in the aortic sinus. These data indicate that the PPARα agonist fenofibrate reduces atherosclerosis in these animal models of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular disease initiated by abnormal accumulation of plasma lipoproteins in the sub-endothelial space of the blood vessels (1Skalen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Boren J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Google Scholar). Macrophages within the vascular wall take up cholesterol, resulting in their transformation into foam cells. Concomitant activation of the different vascular cell types leads to a chronic inflammatory response (2Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Google Scholar). Numerous epidemiological studies have highlighted the importance of metabolic risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, in these pathological changes. Indeed, the relative abundance of the different lipoprotein fractions appears critical as increased plasma levels of atherogenic particles (such as low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; hapoA-I, human apoA-I; apo, apolipoprotein; FF, fenofibrate; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; IDL, intermediary density lipoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ABCA-1, ATP-binding casette A-1; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. ) or decreased levels of the anti-atherogenic lipoprotein fraction (high density lipoprotein (HDL)) are well known risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis (3Assmann G. Cullen P. Jossa F. Lewis B. Mancini M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1819-1824Google Scholar, 4Gordon T. Castelli W.P. Hjortland M.C. Kannel W.B. Dawber T.R. Am. J Med. 1977; 62: 707-714Google Scholar). Fibrates are hypolipidemic drugs that are currently used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia (5Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Google Scholar). They are efficient in lowering elevated plasma triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol, and increasing HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Several clinical and angiographic intervention trials have shown that fibrate treatment leads to a reduction of coronary events (6Frick M.H. Elo O. Haapa K. Heinonen O.P. Heinsalmi P. Helo P. Huttunen J.K. Kaitaniemi P. Koskinen P. Manninen V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 317: 1237-1245Google Scholar, 7Rubins H.B. Robins S.J. Collins D. Fye C.L. Anderson J.W. Elam M.B. Faas F.H. Linares E. Schaefer E.J. Schectman G. Wilt T.J. Wittes J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 410-418Google Scholar) and delays progression of coronary atherosclerosis (8Syvanne M. Nieminen M.S. Frick M.H. Kauma H.

Lancet. 1996; 347: 849-853Google Scholar, 10.(2001) Lancet 357, 905–910.Google Scholar). Fibrates are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, which mediates their lipid-normalizing effects (11Gervois P. Torra I.P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2000; 38: 3-11Google Scholar). Studies performed using PPARα-deficient mice have demonstrated the obligatory role of PPARα in mediating the effects of fibrates on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism (12Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Google Scholar). Although fibrates decrease plasma triglycerides both in man and rodents, plasma concentrations of HDL-cholesterol and apoA-I are regulated in an opposite manner in rodents (decrease) and humans (increase) (13Vu-Dac N. Chopin-Delannoy S. Gervois P. Bonnelye E. Martin G. Fruchart J.C. Laudet V. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25713-25720Google Scholar). As in humans, fibrate-activated PPARα induces the expression of human apoA-I in transgenic mice overexpressing the human apoA-I (hapoA-I) gene (hapoA-I Tg), thereby increasing HDL production (14Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARα is expressed in the major cell types found in the atherosclerotic lesion (macrophages, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells) (15Marx N. Sukhova G.K. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3125-3131Google Scholar, 16Shu H. Wong B. Zhou G. Li Y. Berger J. Woods J.W. Wright S.D. Cai T.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 345-349Google Scholar, 17Neve B. Corseaux D. Chinetti G. Zawadzki C. Fruchart J.C. Duriez P. Staels B. Jude B. Circulation. 2001; 103: 207-212Google Scholar), and increasing evidence indicates that PPARα agonists exert a potent anti-inflammatory action directly at the level of the vascular wall (18Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Google Scholar, 19Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Google Scholar). Therefore, both lipid-related and direct vascular activities may account for the overall beneficial action of fibrates on atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of fibrate treatment on atherosclerosis in vivo. ApoE-deficient mice were treated with the PPARα agonist fenofibrate (FF), and the lesion surface area was determined in the aortic sinus and aortic cholesterol content in the descending aorta. Furthermore, to assess the influence of hapoA-I induction by FF on atherosclerosis, human apoA-I transgenic apoE-deficient (hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient) mice were subjected to the same treatment. Our results show that plasma lipids of apoE-deficient mice treated with the PPARα agonist FF were not decreased and rather increased. Furthermore, FF treatment did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion size at the site of the aortic sinus in 5-month-old apoE-deficient mice. However, FF treatment tended to decrease cholesterol content in the descending aorta of these mice. Moreover, when administered to older apoE-deficient mice fed a Western diet for a longer period to induce advanced lesion formation, FF treatment led to a strong decrease of cholesterol content in the descending aorta. This decrease was associated with lowered aortic monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and unchanged ATP-binding casette A-1 (ABCA-1) mRNA levels in the descending aortas of the fenofibrate-treated mice. Furthermore, induction of human apoA-I by FF treatment resulted in a decreased aortic sinus lesion surface area in hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice. Altogether these data indicate that fibrate treatment can modulate atherogenesis in vivo in a manner independent of changes in absolute plasma lipid levels. Homozygous human apoA-I transgenic (20Rubin E.M. Ishida B.Y. Clift S.M. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 434-438Google Scholar) and apoE-deficient C57Bl/6 mouse strains were obtained from Charles River-Iffa Credo (L'Arbresle, France). Human apoA-I transgenic mice were crossed with apoE-deficient mice to generate heterozygous human apoA-I transgenic mice in a heterozygous apoE-deficient background. These mice were further mated with homozygous apoE-deficient mice to generate human apoA-I transgenic mice in a homozygous apoE-deficient background (hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice). Human apoA-I transgene expression was analyzed in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using specific antibodies (14Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Google Scholar). Homozygous apoE-deficient mice were identified after determination of total cholesterol levels. After weaning, apoE-deficient and hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient male mice were maintained on a standard pellet rodent chow (Usine d'Alimentation Rationnelle, Villemoisson, France). In a first experiment, 10-week-old apoE-deficient male mice were given a Western diet containing 20% (g/100 g) fat and 0.2% cholesterol for 2 weeks before the treatment period. Then each genotype of mice was divided into two groups (12 mice/group); one was treated with fenofibrate (FF) added to the Western diet (0.05% w/w corresponding to 100 mg/kg/day), and the other group (control) was maintained on the Western diet. The treatment period lasted 8 weeks. Animals were housed in a facility with a light/dark cycle (12 h/12 h) and had free access to food and water. At the end of the study, animals were anesthetized by ether inhalation, and blood was collected after a 4-h fasting period by retro-orbital puncture. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tissues were collected for further analysis. In a second experiment, apoE-deficient male mice on a C57Bl/6 background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at Merck Research Laboratories. At weaning they were fed and maintained on Western diet. Starting at 20 weeks of age, groups of 10 mice were treated by gavage with either vehicle or FF (100 mg/kg/day suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose solution). After 6 weeks of treatment, mice were euthanized, and their aortic cholesterol and cholesteryl ester contents were determined (see below). Ten-week-old hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient male mice (12 mice/group) were given a Western diet for 2 weeks before treatment with either control or FF (0.05% w/w corresponding to 100 mg/kg/day) for another 8 weeks. At the end of the study, blood and tissue samples were collected for further analysis. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees from both Institut Pasteur de Lille and Merck Research Laboratories. Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined by an enzymatic assay adapted to microtiter plates using commercially available reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). Plasma human apoA-I levels were measured by an immunonephelometric assay using species-specific polyclonal antibodies (14Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Google Scholar). Lipoprotein cholesterol profiles were obtained by fast-protein liquid chromatography. This system allows the separation of the three major lipoprotein classes, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediary density lipoprotein (IDL)+LDL and HDL according to their size. 200 μl of pooled plasma samples was injected onto a Superose 6HR® 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden), and lipoproteins were separated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 containing 0.01% EDTA and 0.01% NaN3. The effluent was monitored at 280 nm and collected in 0.27-ml fractions. Cholesterol concentration was measured in each fraction. Total RNA was isolated from each liver or descending aorta by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Dot blot analysis of 10 μg of total RNA was performed using the human apoA-I cDNA as probe. Rat 36B4 cDNA was used as a control probe. mRNA were quantified using a GS525 phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA). Human apoA-I mRNA levels were expressed as -fold induction, and an arbitrary value of 1 was assigned to the average of the control. ABCA-1 and MCP-1 mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) and normalized to a β-actin internal control. The following specific primer pairs were used: ABCA-1 sense, 5′-GTT CTC AGA CGC TCA GAG GC-3′; ABCA-1 antisense, 5′-CAG CAG GCT GTC CAC AGT AG-3′; MCP-1 sense, 5′-TGT CAT GCT TCT GCC CCT GC-3′; MCP-1 antisense, 5′-GGG TCA GCA CAG CCT CTC TTG-3′. Reactions were carried out using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBRGreen mix (3 mmMgCl2) as recommended by the manufacturer. Hearts and ascending aortas of animals were fixed in formaldehyde, and serial 10-μm-thick cryosections were cut from the aortic arch to the ventricles for quantitative analysis of atherosclerosis. The distance between each section was 50 μm, and the final magnification was 2.5-fold. Sections were stained with Oil Red O and counterstained with hematoxylin. The atherosclerotic lesion and Oil Red O-stained areas of each section were quantified using a computer-assisted video imaging system (Leica Mikroskopic System, Wetzlar, Germany). To avoid morphological heterogeneity between mice, the expression of average atherosclerotic lesion areas in the region of the aortic sinus, from the appearance to the disappearance of the aortic valves, was normalized at 10 equal sections. After collection of the blood, the vasculature was gently perfused through the left ventricle with cold PBS and 5 mmEDTA. For collection of aorta for biochemical analysis, all branches and adipose tissue connected to the aorta were removed, and each aorta was carefully excised from the aortic root to the right renal artery. The aortas were kept briefly on ice in PBS and then blotted dry, weighed, minced, and extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), according to the method of Folch et al. (22Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were dried down, resuspended quantitatively in chloroform/methanol (2:1), and stored at −20 °C until the time of assay. Total and free cholesterol levels in the aortic extracts were determined with an enzymatic fluorometric assay as previously described (23Sparrow C.P. Burton C.A. Hernandez M. Mundt S. Hassing H. Patel S. Rosa R. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Wang P.R. Zhang D. Peterson L. Detmers P.A. Chao Y.S. Wright S.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 115-121Google Scholar). Briefly, the solvent was evaporated and the lipid residue was redissolved in 100 μl of reagent grade ethanol. Aliquots of cholesterol (Aldrich) and cholesteryl oleate (Aldrich) standard solutions prepared in chloroform/methanol (1:1) were treated similarly. To determine free cholesterol, samples and standards were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 1.01 ml of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.03% Triton X-100 and 0.9 mm sodium cholate. Cholesterol oxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), andp-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (Aldrich) were added for an additional 1-h incubation at 37 °C. The fluorescent product was measured (excitation 325 nm, emission 415 nm). For total cholesterol determinations, cholesterol esterase (Calbiochem) was included in the first incubation step, and cholesteryl oleate was used as a standard. The esterified cholesterol content in each sample was calculated by subtracting the value of free cholesterol from that for total cholesterol. Samples of individual aortas were run in duplicate at two different concentrations. All values are expressed as nmol/aorta. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze for significant differences between the experimental groups. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post-hoc tests were used for analysis of the lesion area data. Ten-week-old apoE-deficient mice were fed a Western diet 2 weeks before treatment with either a control or a FF (0.05% w/w corresponding to 100 mg/kg/day)-supplemented Western diet for another 8 weeks. First, the effects of FF treatment on plasma lipids were examined. Plasma cholesterol levels were not decreased by FF treatment and even slightly increased as compared with control mice (1657 ± 477 versus 2186 ± 415 mg/dl, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). Similarly, FF treatment did not decrease, but rather increased triglyceride levels (127 ± 42 versus 275 ± 64 md/dl,p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). To assess whether FF treatment may lead to changes in lipoprotein profiles, the cholesterol lipoprotein distribution profile was then analyzed by subjecting a representative pooled plasma sample from each group to gel filtration chromatography. As previously shown, in apoE-deficient mice almost all the cholesterol is contained in the low density fractions (VLDL, IDL + LDL). The cholesterol distribution profile after FF treatment was slightly skewed toward smaller VLDL or IDL remnant particles, but the changes were very small (Fig. 1B). Next, the extent of atherosclerotic lesions was measured in serial sections between the valves and the aortic cross (aortic sinus). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of average surface of total atherosclerotic lesions (panel A) and Oil Red O-stained areas from the ventricle to the aortic arch (panel B), and mean lesion areas are reported in panel C. FF treatment did not affect atherosclerotic lesion size nor distribution within the aortic sinus of apoE-deficient mice. Moreover, FF treatment did not alter the macrophage content of the atherosclerotic lesion as revealed by macrophage-specific staining of the sections (data not shown). Recent studies indicated that regional differences in atherosclerosis susceptibility can exist (24Barry-Lane P.A. Patterson C. van der M.M. Hu Z. Holland S.M. Yeh E.T. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1513-1522Google Scholar). For instance, deletion of NADPH oxidase in apoE-deficient mice resulted in less atherosclerotic lesion formation in the descending aorta but not in the aortic arch (24Barry-Lane P.A. Patterson C. van der M.M. Hu Z. Holland S.M. Yeh E.T. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1513-1522Google Scholar). Therefore, the influence of FF treatment on aortic cholesterol content was determined also in the descending aorta. Interestingly, FF treatment tended to decrease aortic total and esterified cholesterol content in the descending aortas of these mice (Fig. 2D). Because the relative modest effect of FF treatment on aortic cholesterol content in these apoE-deficient mice may be related to the limited lesion development in the descending aorta at this age (25Nakashima Y. Plump A.S. Raines E.W. Breslow J.L. Ross R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 133-140Google Scholar), it was determined whether FF treatment would be more efficacious to reduce aortic cholesterol content in older mice with more advanced lesions. Thus, apoE-deficient mice were weaned on a Western diet, and, at the age of 20 weeks, treated orally with either FF, at a similar dose as administered in the previous study, or vehicle for another 6 weeks (Fig. 3). As expected, feeding a Western diet for 16 weeks led to a large increase in both total and esterified cholesterol content of the descending aorta compared with baseline (Fig. 3). Most interestingly, FF treatment strongly decreased aortic cholesterol content in Western diet-fed apoE-deficient mice. Total cholesterol was decreased by 39% (533.3 ± 59.4 versus324.5 ± 31.7 nmol/aorta, p = 0.009) and esterified cholesterol by 48% (216.6 ± 22.9 versus112.4 ± 12.9 nmol/aorta, p = 0.002) (Fig. 3). This reduction of aortic cholesterol content by FF treatment occurred in the absence of any decrease in plasma total cholesterol or triglyceride levels (data not shown). Because systemic effects of fibrate treatment leading to an increase in the anti-atherogenic HDL fraction and its major protein component apoA-I may also influence atherogenesis, we next aimed to determine whether induction of apoA-I by the PPARα agonist FF would be efficient to decrease atherosclerotic lesion development in the aortic sinus of apoE-deficient mice. Thus, human apoA-I transgenic mice were crossed with apoE-deficient mice and subsequently fed a control or FF (0.05% w/w corresponding to 100 mg/kg/day) supplemented Western diet for 8 weeks and atherosclerotic lesion surface areas in the aortic sinus were then determined. hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient FF-treated mice showed significantly decreased atherosclerotic lesion surface areas (−31%) when compared with control mice (160,802 ± 19,259versus 110,236 ± 12,856 μm2,p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). To determine whether the reduction in atherosclerotic lesion area in hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice is due to changes in plasma lipids, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined. Analysis of plasma lipid levels demonstrated that total cholesterol levels were not decreased by FF treatment as compared with their respective controls (2091 ± 394versus 2306 ± 271 mg/dl, p = 0.181) (Fig. 5A). For unknown reasons, triglyceride levels were higher in hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient than in apoE-deficient mice (Figs. 1 and 5). However, triglyceride levels were not affected by FF treatment (968 ± 447versus 916 ± 155 mg/dl, p = 0.291) (Fig. 5A). Cholesterol distribution profiles were also analyzed. Although the overall profile was not altered by FF treatment, FF induced a slight increase in the VLDL fraction as well as in the HDL fraction as compared with control (Fig. 5B). In hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice, FF treatment led to a significant increase in plasma human apoA-I levels (834 ± 149versus 1051 ± 140 mg/dl, p < 0.01) (Fig. 6). Concomitantly, hepatic human apoA-I mRNA levels were increased by FF treatment when compared with control mice (>1.5-fold increase) (Fig. 6). These observations are consistent with the slight increase in HDL cholesterol observed by fast-protein liquid chromatography analysis after FF treatment (Fig. 5B). To investigate whether FF treatment reduces atherosclerotic lesion size and aortic cholesterol content by regulating the expression of genes in the vascular wall, mRNA levels of ABCA-1, which mediates cholesterol efflux from foam cells and whose expression is positively controlled by macrophage cholesterol content (26Chinetti G. Lestavel S. Bocher V. Remaley A.T. Neve B. Torra I.P. Teissier E. Minnich A. Jaye M. Duverger N. Brewer H.B. Fruchart J.C. Clavey V. Staels B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 53-58Google Scholar), and MCP-1, a pro-atherogenic chemokine stimulating monocyte recruitment to the atherosclerotic lesion (27Aiello R.J. Bourassa P.A. Lindsey S. Weng W. Natoli E. Rollins B.J. Milos P.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1518-1525Google Scholar), were determined in the descending aortas from apoE-deficient and hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice (Fig. 7). Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, considering the atheroprotective activity of hapoA-I (compare Figs. 2C and 4), aortic ABCA-1 and MCP-1 mRNA levels were significantly lower in hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient compared with apoE-deficient mice (Fig. 7). Although FF treatment led to a reduction of atherosclerotic lesion cholesterol content in apoE-deficient mice (Figs. 2D and 3), ABCA-1 mRNA levels were not reduced compared with control treated apoE-deficient mice (Fig. 7A). By contrast, FF treatment reduced aortic MCP-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 7B). FF treatment did not influence ABCA-1 nor MCP-1 mRNA levels in hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice (Fig. 7), which correlates with the absence of significant lesions in the descending aorta of the hapoA-I Tg mice. PPARα is an important regulator of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, thereby positively affecting plasma lipid risk factors related to atherosclerosis (28Torra I.P. Chinetti G. Duval C. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 245-254Google Scholar). In addition, PPARα is known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects at both systemic and vascular levels (29Delerive P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 453-459Google Scholar). Furthermore, it positively regulates macrophage lipid homeostasis (26Chinetti G. Lestavel S. Bocher V. Remaley A.T. Neve B. Torra I.P. Teissier E. Minnich A. Jaye M. Duverger N. Brewer H.B. Fruchart J.C. Clavey V. Staels B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 53-58Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that both local and systemic effects could account for the clinically observed benefit of fibrate PPARα agonists on cardiovascular disease. In the first part of this study, apoE-deficient mice were used to assess the effect of FF on atherosclerosis. ApoE-deficient mice represent a well-established murine model of hypercholesterolemia (30Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Google Scholar,31Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Google Scholar). These animals develop severe lesions similar to those found in humans, with characteristic evolution from foam cell accumulation over lipid-laden fatty streaks to fibro-proliferative lesions (25Nakashima Y. Plump A.S. Raines E.W. Breslow J.L. Ross R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 133-140Google Scholar, 32Reddick R.L. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 141-147Google Scholar, 33Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Burkey B. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 937-945Google Scholar). As previously reported (33Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Burkey B. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 937-945Google Scholar), apoE-deficient mice fed a Western-type diet were highly susceptible to develop atherosclerotic lesions (Fig. 2). However, FF treatment did not reduce atherosclerotic lesion surface area in the aortic sinus. Because recent studies using NADPH oxidase-deficient mice have demonstrated the existence of regional differences in atherosclerotic lesion susceptibility (24Barry-Lane P.A. Patterson C. van der M.M. Hu Z. Holland S.M. Yeh E.T. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1513-1522Google Scholar), the effect of FF treatment in the descending aortas of these mice was also analyzed. Our results show that FF treatment tended to reduce cholesterol content in the descending aortas of these younger mice. These observations suggested a potential beneficial effect of FF treatment on lesion formation. ApoE-deficient mice develop lesions throughout the arterial tree, with lesions appearing first in the aortic arch in young mice and progressing in the thoracic and abdominal aorta in older mice (25Nakashima Y. Plump A.S. Raines E.W. Breslow J.L. Ross R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 133-140Google Scholar). Furthermore, as the lesions progress, they increase in size and complexity to advanced lesions in older mice (32Reddick R.L. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 141-147Google Scholar). Because the first experiment was performed in relatively young mice with little lesions in the abdominal aorta, a second experiment performed in older mice fed a Western diet for 16 weeks before the treatment period with FF was started. In these mice with more advanced lesions, FF treatment significantly reduced aortic cholesterol content in the descending aortas. FF was given orally in both experiments, mixed in the food in the first and by gavage in the second, at comparable doses of 100 mg/kg/d. Furthermore, the increase in liver weights, which is a parameter for hepatic PPARα activation (34Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Google Scholar), was comparable in both experiments (data not shown). Moreover, in both experiments cholesterol content in the descending aorta decreased, although the effect was more pronounced in the older mice. Therefore, it appears unlikely that galenic differences in drug administration would cause the slight differences in the effects of FF treatment observed in both experiments. Altogether, it appears that the protective effect of FF is more pronounced when analyzed in mice developing more advanced lesions. In the second part of this study, we aimed to determine whether induction of apoA-I expression and the HDL lipoprotein fraction by FF treatment would further influence lesion formation in apoE-deficient mice. Because PPARα agonists stimulate production of HDL and its major protein component apoA-I in human apoA-I transgenic mice (14Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Google Scholar), hapoA-I Tg mice were crossed into the apoE-deficient background and subsequently treated with either FF or control supplemented Western diet. As previously reported (35Plump A.S. Scott C.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9607-9611Google Scholar, 36Paszty C. Maeda N. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 899-903Google Scholar), human apoA-I expression resulted in a reduction of atherosclerotic lesions in the apoE-deficient mice (Figs. 2 and 4). In this model, FF treatment led to an increase in human apoA-I plasma and hepatic mRNA levels as previously shown in human apoA-I transgenic mice on a normal background (14Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Google Scholar). Strikingly, FF treatment resulted in a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic sinus of these hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice. Furthermore, atherosclerotic lesion surface areas were inversely correlated with plasma human apoA-I levels (r = 0.74, data not shown). These data suggest that FF treatment leading to increased human apoA-I production efficiently contributes to a reduction of atherosclerotic lesion size. Interestingly, in these apoE-deficient mice, pharmacological induction of human apoA-I expression by FF resulted in only a slight increase in the HDL fraction. However, because this mouse model has very low levels of HDL-cholesterol, subtle changes in this lipoprotein fraction may have robust effects on atherosclerosis development, due to a stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport and apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. Alternatively, apoA-I may exert lipid-independent anti-atherosclerotic activities, which may contribute to the observed protection by apoA-I induction (37Nofer J.R. Kehrel B. Fobker M. Levkau B. Assmann G. von Eckardstein A. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 1-16Google Scholar). For instance, it has been shown in apoE-deficient mice that macrophage human apoA-I expression within the vessel wall can reduce atherosclerotic lesion area (38Ishiguro H. Yoshida H. Major A.S. Zhu T. Babaev V.R. Linton M.F. Fazio S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36742-36748Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that liver-directed apoA-I gene transfer in LDL receptor-deficient mice led to a significant regression of atherosclerotic lesion despite the fact that HDL-cholesterol was only modestly increased (39Tangirala R.K. Tsukamoto K. Chun S.H. Usher D. Pure E. Rader D.J. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1816-1822Google Scholar). Finally, it has also been shown that apoA-I exerts anti-inflammatory effects (40Hyka N. Dayer J.M. Modoux C. Kohno T. Edwards III, C.K. Roux-Lombard P. Burger D. Blood. 2001; 97: 2381-2389Google Scholar). Interestingly, plasma lipid levels were increased by FF treatment and a slight change in VLDL size distribution occurred. Although the influence of these slight size changes on atherogenicity of the VLDL particles is unknown, an increase in plasma lipid levels usually results in more pronounced lesions. Therefore, it appears plausible that FF exerts anti-atherosclerotic effects beyond its plasma lipid-lowering activity. PPARα agonists have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic activities through a direct action on the vascular cells (41Duval C. Chinetti G. Trottein F. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 422-430Google Scholar), which may provide a potential explanation for these anti-atherosclerotic effects independent of systemic lipid changes. PPARα agonists have been shown to inhibit interleukin-6 production by smooth muscle cells (19Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Lebret M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Google Scholar) and decrease expression of cytokine-induced genes such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and tissue factor in endothelial cells and macrophages (15Marx N. Sukhova G.K. Collins T. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3125-3131Google Scholar, 16Shu H. Wong B. Zhou G. Li Y. Berger J. Woods J.W. Wright S.D. Cai T.Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 345-349Google Scholar, 17Neve B. Corseaux D. Chinetti G. Zawadzki C. Fruchart J.C. Duriez P. Staels B. Jude B. Circulation. 2001; 103: 207-212Google Scholar). In line with these reports, a decrease of aortic MCP-1 mRNA was observed in the descending aortas of the FF-treated apoE-deficient mice. In hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice, however, MCP-1 mRNA levels in the descending aorta were very low compared with apoE-deficient mice, and FF treatment did not further decrease MCP-1 expression. These latter findings are not surprising since hapoA-I Tg mice are protected against atherosclerosis and it is expected that very few lesions are present in the descending aorta. Furthermore, PPARα agonists improve macrophage lipid homeostasis. PPARα activators induce the expression of the HDL receptor CLA-1/SR-BI, which may play a role in macrophage cholesterol effluxin vitro and in vivo in macrophages and as such may have a beneficial effect on atherosclerotic lesion development (42Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S. Mallat Z. Antonucci M. Poulain P. Chapman J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Najib-Fruchart J. Staels B. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Google Scholar). Moreover, PPARα agonists induce the expression of ABCA-1, a transporter involved in apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux and whose expression is positively controlled by macrophage cholesterol content (26Chinetti G. Lestavel S. Bocher V. Remaley A.T. Neve B. Torra I.P. Teissier E. Minnich A. Jaye M. Duverger N. Brewer H.B. Fruchart J.C. Clavey V. Staels B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 53-58Google Scholar). In agreement with the positive effect of PPARα agonists on ABCA-1 expression, aortic ABCA-1 mRNA levels were not decreased in FF-treated apoE-deficient mice compared with controls despite the fact that FF treatment resulted in a significant decrease of aortic cholesterol content. Therefore, it appears that FF treatment maintains ABCA-1 expression levels elevated under conditions where aortic cholesterol contents are decreased. This effect of FF may contribute to the atheroprotective actions of FF. Finally, PPARα agonists may modulate apoptosis susceptibility in tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated human macrophages, which can result in a general inhibition of macrophage activation and prevent foam cell formation (18Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Google Scholar). Hence, fibrate-mediated activation of PPARα inhibits atherogenesis in apoE-deficient mice and in hapoA-I Tg × apoE-deficient mice. This improvement is in line with previous observations from in vitro and animal studies using PPARα agonists, which were shown to improve atherosclerosis risk factors (43Guerre-Millo M. Gervois P. Raspe E. Madsen L. Poulain P. Derudas B. Herbert J.M. Winegar D.A. Willson T.M. Fruchart J.C. Berge R.K. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16638-16642Google Scholar, 44Gervois P. Vu-Dac N. Kleemann R. Kockx M. Dubois G. Laine B. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Kooistra T. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33471-33477Google Scholar, 45Marx N. Kehrle B. Kohlhammer K. Grub M. Koenig W. Hombach V. Libby P. Plutzky J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 703-710Google Scholar). However, apparently conflicting data were recently reported by Semenkovich and co-workers (46Tordjman K. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Zemany L. Weng S. Feng C. Zhang F. Leone T.C. Coleman T. Kelly D.P. Semenkovich C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1025-1034Google Scholar). These authors showed that PPARα deficiency confers protection against atherosclerosis. This discordance may be explained by the fact that PPARα deficiency does not necessarily lead to the opposite phenotype as that resulting from PPARα activation by its ligands. Importantly, the deficiency of PPARα improved insulin sensitivity and lowered blood pressure in the studies of Semenkovich et al., and these effects may have outweighed those on lipid metabolism or vascular inflammation. In conclusion, our results indicate that fenofibrate inhibits atherosclerosis development in vivo, an effect that is most likely independent of the changes in plasma lipid levels. These results provide additional data supporting the clinical benefit of fibrates and novel PPARα agonists under development. Technical assistance and discussions with J. Fremaux, J. Lepage, N.

Specific self-protection (immunity) mechanisms are necessary to protect the lantibiotic-producing organisms from the action of their own lantibiotics. For nisin and subtilin (28Klein C. Entian K.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2793-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) immunity is based on the expression of lanFEG encoding ABC transporter-homologous proteins (13, 15, 17; revised sequence of subtilin immunity genes, EMBL accession number U09819), and lanI encoding non-related lipoproteins with different sizes (for review, see Ref. 29Saris P.E. Immonen T. Reis M. Sahl H.G. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 69: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

Although numerous genes involved in lantibiotic immunity are known, the mechanism by which the encoded proteins confer immunity remain unclear. For full nisin or subtilin immunity, both are required, i.e.the lipoprotein as well as the immunity transporter. The lack of each component diminished the tolerance to nisin (35Ra R. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Vos W.M. Saris P.E. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or subtilin (28Klein C. Entian K.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2793-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) significantly. Here we report for the first time on the establishment of nisin immunity in the heterologous host B. subtilis. Functional analyses of its different components provided evidence that NisI acts as a nisin-sequestering protein and that NisFEG acts as a nisin exporter that expels nisin molecules from the cytoplasmic membrane into the environment.

For subtilin production B. subtilis ATCC 6633 was grown at 37 °C in TY medium (0.8% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). Recombinant plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α, TP611, or M15. E. coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani medium (Invitrogen). Antibiotics were used in the following concentrations: 80 μg/ml ampicillin for E. coli, and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 1 μg/ml erythromycin, and 25 μg/ml lincomycin for B. subtilis.

Biosynthesis of the Peptide Antibiotic Nisin. Ph.D thesis. Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main, Germany1996Google Scholar). A copy of nisI(EcoRV/XbaI) was cloned into pUC19 (42Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J.

Supernatants of stationary grownB. subtilis ATCC 6633 (in TY medium) were separated using semi-preparative RP-HPLC with a C-18 Lichrospher column (particle size 10 μm, 200 × 20 mm; Merck), an analytical ODS Hypersil column (particle size 5 μm, 250 × 2 mm; Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany), and linear gradients of acetonitrile. Nisin was purchased from Sigma. The nisin sensitivity of B. subtilis was determined using agar diffusion tests. Various amounts of nisin in a volume of 60 μl were poured into holes (1.6-mm diameter) of M9 test plates (20 ml). The plates were kept for 2 h at 4 °C for diffusion. 300 μl of stationary grown B. subtilis cultures were inoculated into 5 ml of M9 medium and grown to an A 578 of 0.8. 100 μl of a 10−2 dilution were overlaid onto the test plates in 5 ml of molten M9 agar (50 °C) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. To investigate the molecular mechanism of nisin immunity, a quantitative in vivo peptide release assay described by Otto et al.(43Otto M. Peschel A. Götz F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar) was used with modifications. Stationary B. subtilisstrains grown overnight in TY medium containing 1% (w/v) glucose were harvested and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). The cell density was adjusted to an A 578 of 10 with an incubation buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7), 0.5m NaCl, and 0.5% (w/v) glucose). 1-ml aliquots of the cell suspension were incubated with nisin for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), quantitative HPLC analyses of the supernatants were performed on a Beckman Gold HPLC System using an analytical ODS Hypersil column (Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany). Nisin was eluted using a linear gradient of 30–40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v) over 30-column volumes. Nisin was detected measuring the absorption at 214 nm. The flow rate (0.4 ml/min) was chosen so that a Gauss distribution of the nisin absorption peak was obtained that allowed a quantitative determination of the nisin amount after integration. Nisin attached to the cell sediment was extracted by gently mixing with 1 ml of 20% acetonitrile in water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at room temperature for 5 min. After centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min), nisin was quantitatively determined in the supernatant. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (14Siegers K. Heinzmann S. Entian K.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12294-12301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar); native PAGE was without SDS. Molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Sigma. Membrane vesicles fromB. subtilis were prepared as described previously (45Gutowski-Eckel Z. Klein C. Siegers K. Bohm K. Hammelmann M. Entian K.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AnisI copy was PCR amplified from pHZ39 with primers O8 (5′-GTTTATCAGGATCCTATCAAACAAGTC-3′) and O9 (5′-GAATTTTCTGCAGTCTAGTTTCCTAC-3′) (ARK) and inserted into the pQE9 vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The E. coli strain M15 (pREP4) was transformed with the resulting plasmid and grown in LB to an A 600 of 0.5. After IPTG induction, the cells were incubated for additional 4 h. The cells were harvested, suspended in lysis buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and disrupted by sonication. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 17,000 × g(30 min, 4 °C) the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) with gentle shaking (1 h, 4 °C). The protein was eluted using the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole and dialyzed against the storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol and 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 6.5). NisI membrane vesicles were incubated under gently shaking with 0.17 volumes of 3% (w/v) laurylmaltoside (dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.17 volumes of 2 m 6-aminocaproic acid (Fluka) at room temperature for 2 h. After centrifugation (30 min, 18,000 × g, 4 °C), 15% (w/v) glycerol was added to the supernatant, which contained the dissolved membrane proteins. From this fraction, 30 μl were incubated with different amounts of nisin or subtilin (10 min, 37 °C). The samples were divided 70:30, and the larger sample was loaded onto 9% polyacrylamide gels without SDS, separated at 20 mA for 6 h, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose by using standard buffers with 0.1% SDS. The smaller sample was loaded onto a denaturing 14% SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting. Finally, NisI was visualized with NisI-antisera (41Siegers K. Biosynthesis of the Peptide Antibiotic Nisin. Ph.D thesis. Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main, Germany1996Google Scholar). Different amounts of purified His6-NisI (0–160 μg) were incubated with 20 μg of nisin in a final volume of 20 μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (37 °C, 30 min). After centrifugation (10 min, 13,000 rpm), the pellets were dissolved in 20 μl of 0.02 n HCl. 5-μl aliquots of the supernatants and solubilized pellets were analyzed in a agar diffusion tests using Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 as the test organism. In contrast to subtilin immunity (Fig. 1 A) (46Stein T. Borchert S. Kiesau P. Heinzmann S. Kloss S. Klein C. Helfrich M. Entian K.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the L. lactis nisin immunity genes nisI and nisFEGreside on different transcriptional units (Fig. 1 B) (18Kuipers O.P.

Beerthuyzen M.M. van Alen-Boerrigter I. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3434-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To study nisin immunity without the influence of nisin production, we coexpressed different combinations of nisin immunity genes in the nisin-sensitive B. subtilis hosts MO1099 and ATCC 6633, as exemplified for the nisIFEG construct in Fig. 1 C. The nisin sensitivity levels of the recipient B. subtilis strains were analyzed (Fig. 2). The highest level of tolerance was obtained for B. subtilis MO1099 containing all four immunity genes, nisI, andnisFEG (Fig. 2, A, plate 4, and B, semi-quantitative analyses). This strain tolerates 8 μg of nisin, a quantity that already induced large growth inhibition zones for the control strain without any immunity genes (Fig. 2 A, plate 1). Remarkably, after expression of the lipoprotein NisI alone, a significant nisin tolerance level was obtained (Fig. 2 A, plate 2) that was comparable with B. subtilis cells expressingnisFEG (Fig. 2 A, plate 3). These data clearly showed that B. subtilis MO1099 represents a surrogate host for the functional expression of nisin immunity genes and that the action of two immunity systems, the lipoprotein NisI and the ABC transporter-homologous protein NisFEG, is needed to obtain full nisin tolerance. Additionally, the nisin immunity components were transferred to the subtilin-producing B. subtilis strain ATCC 6633. After coordinated expression of nisIFEG, the recipient cells exhibited significant tolerance to nisin (Fig. 2 C). This showed that the immunity system from L. lactis 6F3 is also effective in B. subtilis cells, which express two lantibiotic immunity systems, nisIFEG andspaIFEG. The different tolerance levels obtained for thenisIFEG-expressing B. subtilis strains MO1099 and the subtilin producer ATCC 6633 were based on the faster growth rate of the ATCC 6633 strain. Remarkably, the expression of nisin immunity genes nisIFEG (Fig. 2 D) as well as other combinations of nisin immunity genes (not shown) in B. subtilis strains MO1099 and ATCC 6633 had no effect on subtilin tolerance. NisI (25.8 kDa, calculated without signal sequence) expressed in B. subtilis was detected in both the membrane fraction (Fig. 3 A, lane 3) and the soluble cell extract (lane 4). Two bands were obtained for NisI (shown in Fig. 3 A, and more pronounced in Fig. 4 A, see below), suggesting that the upper band (I) corresponds to membrane-associated NisI and the lower band (II) to NisI without the membrane anchor. Thus, at least approximately half of NisI seemed to be correctly anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane of B. subtilis. Probably, degradation and/or incomplete modification with the lipid moiety led to a protein with faster migration after SDS-PAGE. In accordance with this probability, prolonged incubation times of nisI-expressing cells led to the observation of NisI within the culture supernatant (not shown).Figure 4Functional analysis of NisI: Interaction with nisin. A, protein fractions solubilized from membrane vesicles (60 μg) of NisI-expressing B. subtilis MO1099 were incubated with different amounts of nisin or subtilin. After splitting into two parts (70:30), the larger part was separated by native PAGE, and the minor part was separated by SDS-PAGE. NisI immunoblots of both gels are shown. The lanes identical for both gels. Solubilized membrane proteins were incubated with a culture supernatant of a subtilin-negative mutant (lane 1), 2, 3, or 4 μg of nisin (lanes 2–4), and 4 or 6 μg of subtilin (lanes 5–6). The position of NisI is indicated by arrows. B, NisI immunoblots of His6-NisI (5 μg) after incubation with increasing amounts of nisin and subsequent native PAGE.Lanes 1–6, 0.05, 5, 10, 20, and 30 μg of nisin.C, after incubation of His6-NisI with nisin, a pellet was formed. The antimicrobial activities within the supernatant and the solubilized pellet were analyzed using M. luteus as the test organism. The complete assays are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays 1–5 contained 20 μg of nisin and 0, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μg of His6-NisI, respectively; assay 6 contained 160 μg of His6-NisI without nisin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NisI is a typical lipoprotein, possessing both a N-terminal signal sequence and a membrane-anchoring Cys residue immediately proceeding the cleavage site. To avoid possible anchoring and export of NisI inE. coli, the NisI lipoprotein signal sequence and the anchoring Cys residue (amino acids 1–20) were substituted by the sequence MRSGSHHHHHH, resulting in the protein His6-NisI. Recombinant His6-NisI from E. coli (Fig. 3 B, lane 2) was found in the soluble protein fraction (lane 3) after cell lysis. His6-NisI was purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography (lane 4) and used for interaction studies with nisin (see below) and immunoaffinity purification of the polyclonal NisI antibody (48Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 267-343Google Scholar). The purified antibody showed no cross-reactivity with components of an SDS-PAGE-separated B. subtilis total cell extract (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), demonstrating its high selectivity. To unravel the function of NisI in nisin immunity, we investigated possible interactions between NisI and nisin. NisI was solubilized fromnisI expressing B. subtilis MO1099 membrane vesicles and incubated with different amounts of nisin and subtilin. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed by parallel native and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A). Incubation of NisI with nisin (lanes 1–4) led to a depletion of the NisI signal, which was not observed if subtilin was used (lanes 5–6). Regardless of a former incubation with nisin (lanes 1–4) or subtilin (lanes 5–6), all samples revealed the same NisI signal intensity after separation under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE in Fig. 4 A). A similar signal depletion was observed for His6-NisI isolated from E. coli (Fig. 4 B), suggesting similar properties for NisI without a lipid anchor. Remarkably, after incubation of nisin with His6-NisI, a small pellet was observed. The pellet contained a portion of the nisin molecules that are easily solubilized under aqueous conditions as demonstrated by M. luteus agar diffusion tests (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–5, pellet). In accordance, after incubation of nisin with increasing amounts of His6-NisI, a slight decrease of the activity in the supernatant was observed (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–5,supernatant). With equal amounts of subtilin, no pellet was formed (not shown). This argues for a specific complex formation between NisI and nisin that reduces the quantity of free nisin molecules. The activity of NisFEG was investigated with a series of quantitative in vivo peptide release assays. After incubation of B. subtilis cells with nisin, the quantities of the nisin in the culture supernatant and the nisin associated with the cell-pellet were determined by quantitative RP-HPLC (Fig. 5 A). ForB. subtilis MO1099 and MO1099 expressing NisI, ∼7.5 μg of nisin were found attached to the cells independently of the quantity of applied nisin (9 or 12 μg, Fig. 5, B and C). After expression of nisFEG or nisIFEG, the quantity of cell-associated nisin was significantly reduced to about 5 μg. In accordance, the nisin quantity in the supernatant increased about 4-fold if 9 μg of nisin was applied (Fig. 5 B) and about 2.5-fold if 12 μg of nisin was applied (Fig. 5 C), suggesting an export function of the transporter-homologous system NisFEG. Remarkably, in all experiments >90% of the applied nisin could be recovered. The structural identities of the nisin in the supernatant and the nisin attached to cells were verified after RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses (m/z3354, not shown). Thus, no nisin modification or degradation systems were present for lowering its toxicity. After application of subtilin (12 μg) in the peptide release assay, about two-thirds (7.5–8 μg) were found cell-associated and about one-third (3–4 μg) in the supernatant, regardless of whether B. subtilisMO1099 wild-type or nisFEG-expressing cells were analyzed. To study the molecular mechanism of nisin self-protection provided by NisIFEG, different combinations of the immunity genes were integrated into the genome of nisin-sensitive B. subtilisstrains. After expression of either the lipoprotein NisI alone or the ABC transporter-homologous system NisFEG, the recipient B. subtilis cells acquired a significant level of nisin tolerance. The strongest tolerance was obtained after coexpression ofnisI and nisFEG, as previously suggested from deletion analyses in the nisin producer L. lactis 6F3 (15Siegers K. Entian K.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,35Ra R. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Vos W.M. Saris P.E. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although B. subtilis expressing the nisin immunity genenisIFEG acquired a >3-fold nisin tolerance level as compared with wild-type B. subtilis (Fig. 2), only ∼30% of the nisin immunity level of L. lactis 6F3 was achieved (15Siegers K. Entian K.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the nisin-producing L. lactis strain, the establishment of nisin immunity is based on two operons,nisABTCIP and nisFEG. The coordinated and IPTG-induced expression of nisIFEG in the B. subtilis host cells is quite different from the autoregulatory control of nisin immunity in L. lactis (18Kuipers O.P. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Ruyter P.G. Luesink E.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27299-27304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the acquired nisin immunity levels of the heterologous host B. subtilis were comparable with the immunity level of nisin non-producing L. lactis strains expressing plasmid-encoded nisI and nisFEG. Also for these cells, an immunity level of only 20% compared with the nisin producer was obtained (49Duan K. Harvey M.L. Liu C.Q. Dunn N.W. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1996; 81: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar). The B. subtilis nisin tolerance level provided by the nisin immunity genes suggests the additive action of two independent systems, the lipoprotein NisI and the transporter NisFEG. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the effect of additional factors that contribute to nisin immunity in the nisin producerL. lactis, for which a rather cooperative effect of NisI and NisFEG was discussed (35Ra R. Beerthuyzen M.M. de Vos W.M. Saris P.E. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 50Qiao M. Immonen T. Koponen O. Saris P.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 75-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the transfer of all components of the nisin immunity system to a subtilin-producingB. subtilis host was successful. The functional expression of two closely related self-protection systems, nisIFEG andspaIFEG (Fig. 2, C and D), demonstrated that cross-immunity between both systems is less likely. A typical lipoprotein signal sequence including the lipobox sequence LSGC (51Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z., Wu, H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was found for NisI, suggesting that NisI becomes a peripheral membrane protein after lipid modification of the lipobox Cys residue, processing, and transport over the cytoplasmic membrane. Although it provides significant nisin tolerance, only 50% of NisI expressed inB. subtilis was localized in the membrane. The other portion of NisI was found in the soluble protein extract and showed a slightly faster migration after SDS-PAGE, suggesting that it represents an incompletely lipid-modified or degraded NisI species (Fig. 3 A). Obviously, the lipid modification is not sufficient for complete attachment of the respective proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane. However, for non-lipo-modified NisI protein species significant activity is also conceivable. The essential majorB. subtilis lipoprotein PrsA in B. subtilis showed at least partial activity without lipid modification (52Leskela S. Wahlstrom E. Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To provide evidence for physical interaction between NisI and nisin, we used two different approaches. NisI could be efficiently extracted fromB. subtilis membranes after treatment with laurylmaltoside and 6-aminocaproic acid. An interaction of NisI with nisin and not with the structurally closely related subtilin could be clearly monitored by the depletion of the NisI signal after native PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 4 A). The detection of NisI signals not entering the native PAGE implies a low solubility of the NisI-nisin complex. A similar behavior was obtained for recombinant His6-NisI from E. coli (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the lipoprotein signal sequence and/or the lipid modification is not necessary for NisI activity. Further evidence for specific interaction of NisI with nisin was provided after incubation of His6-NisI with nisin (Fig. 4 C), which resulted in the formation of an insoluble complex. This argues for an interception of a portion of soluble nisin molecules. Obviously, the complex is easily dissociated in aqueous conditions, thus fully recovering the activity of precipitated nisin. The ABC transporter-homologous system NisFEG seems to work by expelling cell-attached nisin molecules into the environment, a mechanism that is similar to the one described for the epidermin transporter homologue EpiFEG (43Otto M. Peschel A. Götz F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 203-211PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the epidermin self-protection system lacks a lipoprotein LanI, implying a greater necessity for the epidermin immunity transporter in S. epidermidis. Our results suggest that the export capacity of NisFEG is independent of the lipoprotein NisI. After extraction, we could quantitatively recover cell-associated nisin. Even after prolonged incubation times (up to 60 min) ofnisIFEG-expressing cells with nisin, approximately all applied nisin molecules could be recovered quantitatively. This argues against degradation or modification of nisin either by NisIFEG or other systems. The lethal activity of nisin can be described with a four-step mechanism that includes membrane adhesion, membrane integration, pore formation, and pore dissociation (25Breukink E. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Specific binding of nisin to the cell wall precursor lipid II coincides with pore formation (26Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H. de Kruijff B. Science. 1999; 286: 2361-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 27Wiedemann I. Breukink E. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Bierbaum G. de Kruijff B. Sahl H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1772-1779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Our results provided experimental evidence that nisin immunity is based on two independently acting systems. The lipoprotein NisI is orientated to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. NisI would intercept nisin at the surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and, by sequestering nisin, prevent it from inserting into the membrane and/or prevent high local density of nisin molecules necessary for pore formation. The nisin-exporting function of NisFEG would diminish the quantity of nisin molecules that have already entered the cytoplasmic membrane before/during pore formation."

Approximately 25% of the genes in the yeast genome were found to be involved in the response of yeast to low temperature. This finding of a large number of genes being involved in the response to low temperature enabled us to give a functional interpretation to the genetic responses to the stimulus. Functional and clustering analyses of temporal changes in gene expression revealed that global states of the expressions of up-regulated genes could be characterized as having three phases (the early, middle, and late phases). In each phase, genes related to rRNA synthesis, ribosomal proteins, or several stress responses are time-dependently up-regulated, respectively. Through these phases, yeast cells may improve reduced efficiency of translation and enhance cell protection mechanisms to survive under a low temperature condition. Furthermore, these time-dependent regulations of these genes would be controlled by the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway.

Low temperatures are known to have several effects on biochemical and physiological properties in various cells (e.g. low efficiency of protein translation, low fluidity of cellular membrane, stabilization of double helix or secondary structure of DNA or RNA molecule, slow folding of protein, and decrease of enzymatic activities) (1Jones P.G.

Most organisms would have developed adaptive mechanisms to cope with these phenomena. The mechanisms underlying low temperature-dependent gene expression and responses to low temperature have been studied in few organisms (4Thieringer H.A. Jones P.G. Inouye M. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 5Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Browse J. Xin Z. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2001; 4: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, especially Escherichia coli, when cells grown at 37 °C are exposed to a low temperature, such as 15 °C, a set of proteins called cold shock proteins are transiently induced (7Jones P.G. Van Bogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). CspA has been identified as a major cold shock protein (8Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and has been suggested to act as an RNA chaperone to increase efficiency of translation under a low temperature condition (9Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Bacillus and Synechococcus species increase synthesis and stability of desaturases, which catalyze unsaturation of fatty acids in the membrane phopholipids under a low temperature condition (4Thieringer H.A.

Induction of desaturases by low temperature has also been found in eukaryotic species, such as plants (5Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin.

Commun. 2002; 291: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cellular responses to low temperature, such as improvement of reduced translation and decreased membrane fluidity, and their mechanisms are common in various organisms. In yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several cold-inducible genes have been identified. NSR1, one of the cold-inducible genes, encodes a nucleolin-like protein related to rRNA processing and ribosomal biosynthesis (16Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol.

TIP1(temperature-inducible protein) and the other members of its family (TIR1 and TIR2) are also induced by cold shock (19Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol.

These genes encode a serine- and alanine-rich protein and are also induced by an anaerobic growth condition (21Donzeau M. Bourdineaud J.P. Lauquin G.J. Mol.

However, the entire mechanisms of low temperature response and low temperature-dependent gene expression are still unclear in any of organisms. In this study, we analyzed global gene expression in low temperature-exposed yeast cells using a yeast cDNA microarray to obtain fundamental information on low temperature response and low temperature-dependent gene expression in yeast cells. Several sets of cooperatively regulated genes were identified by clustering of time-dependent gene expression profiles and functional analyses. Our findings suggest that several steps of global expression changes play an important role in adaptation to a low temperature environment. An S. cerevisiae cDNA microarray was purchased from DNA Chip Research Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). All other reagents were of the highest grade available. S. cerevisiaeYPH500 (MATα, ura3–52, lys2–801,ade2–101, trp1-Δ63,his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1) (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for all analyses. Unless otherwise noted, yeast cells were cultured aerobically in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) at 30 °C and shaken at 100 rpm. Yeast cells were grown to a midlog phase (A 600 = 2.0), and then 50 ml of the yeast culture was collected for a time 0 reference. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 30 °C. The harvested cells were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA preparation. The remaining cultured cells were cold-shocked at 10 °C in a precooled water bath and were then aerobically cultured at 10 °C at 100 rpm. Cells were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 2, 4, and 8 h after the cold shock by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 10 °C. The harvested cells were also flash-frozen and stored as described above. Total RNA was prepared by an acidic phenol method (29Aiba H. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (15 μg) and 5 μg of oligo(dT) (Amersham Biosciences) were used to prepare fluorophore-labeled cDNA probes for array hybridization. In all experiments, Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences) and Cy5-dUTP (AmershamBiosciences) were used to label the time 0 reference and experimental samples (cold-shocked samples), respectively. Microarray hybridizations were carried out according to the manufacturer's manual for theS. cerevisiae cDNA microarray. After the hybridization, microarrays were sequentially washed at room temperature in the following solutions: 2× SSC for 20 min; 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min; 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min; 0.2× SSC for 5 min; and 0.05× SSC for 5 min. All experiments were carried out in duplicate. Microarrays were scanned by a scanning laser microscope, GenePix 4000A (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Images obtained by the scannings were analyzed by a computer program, GenePix Pro 3.0 (Axon Instruments). Quantified fluorescence intensities for all spots were exported to a microarray data analysis software, GeneSpring 4.2 (Silicon Genetics) and then normalized by the algorithm of a “per chip normalization” method in the analysis software. Expression ratio values from two independent experiments were averaged by the analysis software. The analysis software was also used for further analyses (functional analyses and clustering analyses). In this study, we used the clustering algorithm “Pearson correlation around zero” in the data analysis software with adequate parameters: separation ratio = 0.5, minimum distance = 0.001. After the clustering analysis, we referred to the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) 1The abbreviations used are: MIPS, Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences; RP, ribosomal protein; HSP, heat shock protein; PKA, protein kinase Afunctional data base (available on the World Wide Web at mips.gsf.de/proj/yeast/CYGD/db/index.html) and other databases to determine functional relationships among genes in each cluster using the analysis software. As a result, some gene clusters in which members serve identical or similar cellular functions were found. Changes in global expression of genes in yeast cells after exposure to low temperature were analyzed using a microarray containing cDNAs of 5,803 genes in a yeast genome. RNA samples were prepared from yeast cells collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 2, 4, and 8 h after a temperature downshift from 30 to 10 °C. During a period of 8 h of exposure to low temperature, yeast cells have continuously grown at a midlogarithmic phase (e.g. A 600 = 3.7 at 8 h). SinceA 600 at a stationary phase was over 10, the diauxic shift should not occur in the cells we used. Indeed, mRNA levels of some diauxic shift-inducible genes (ACO1,CIT1, and FUM1) (30DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar) were down-regulated at 10 °C during 8 h of the low temperature exposure (see Fig. 5, cluster 5F). We first labeled the time 0 reference sample with Cy3 or Cy5 for microarray analysis to confirm identical labeling efficiency of transcripts between these dyes. In this experiment, the ratio of fluorescent intensities for these dyes was within 2-fold for 98.5% of all cDNA spots on the microarray (data not shown). From this result, we defined significant gene expression change as ≥2-fold change in signal intensity. Low temperature affected expression levels of ∼25% of the yeast genes on the microarray. During the period of exposure to low temperature, the number of genes that were up-regulated by ≥2-fold increased from 41 (at 15 min) to 536 (at 8 h) (TableI, the line of “Total number of genes” in ≥2 fold up-regulated genes). On the other hand, the number of genes down-regulated by ≤2-fold also increased from 4 (at 15 min) to 488 (at 8 h) (Table I, the line of “Total number of genes” in ≤2-fold down-regulated genes). In total, 934 and 756 genes were ≥2-fold up-regulated and ≤2-fold down-regulated during the 8-h period of exposure to low temperature, respectively (data are available on the World Wide Web at staff.aist.go.jp/t-sahara/). We classified significantly up- or down-regulated genes into some functional categories according to the MIPS functional data base. The number of ≥2-fold up- or ≤2-fold down-regulated genes during the period of exposure to low temperature increased in almost all categories (TableI). This result suggests that drastic changes in gene expression programs at a genome-wide level are elicited by a low temperature stimulus to allow yeast cells to adapt to the low temperature environment, as seen in cells exposed to other environmental stresses such as heat, salinity, hydrogen peroxide, and osmotic stresses (31Posas F.

The number of genes up- or down-regulated by ≥2-fold at each time point is represented. Open table in a new tab Interestingly, ≥2-fold up-regulated genes were divided into three clusters according to their expression profiles (Fig. 1, clusters 1C, 1D, and 1E). In cluster 1C, almost all genes were up-regulated within 30 min (early phase) after exposure to low temperature. Genes in clusters 1D and 1E harbored expression profiles of high up-regulation at 2 h (middle phase) and at 4–8 h (late phase) after exposure to low temperature, respectively. These results suggest that the clustering algorithm successfully identifies cooperatively regulated genes according to the expression profiles of genes. Thus, we performed further clustering analysis of expression profiles for functionally categorized genes to investigate the relevance of the expression profiles to their functions. Significantly up- or down-regulated genes in each functional category of the MIPS functional data base (see Table I) were analyzed by the same clustering method. As we will discuss below, the clustering analyses provided novel insights for understanding cellular functions and the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for several genes in low temperature stress responses of yeast cells. The “RNA polymerase I and RNA processing” cluster (Fig. 1, cluster 1C) contains genes up-regulated at the early phase. A notable feature in this cluster was cooperative regulation of genes for transcriptional machinery, especially RNA polymerase I. In yeast, RNA polymerase I synthesizes large rRNAs. These rRNAs are first transcribed as a precursor 35 S rRNA and then processed into the mature 18, 5.8, and 25 S rRNAs found in ribosomes. Several components of the RNA polymerase I core unit (RPA12, RPA34, RPA43,RPA49, RPB5, RPC19, andRPO31) and a component of the core factor (RRN11) were similarly co-regulated (Fig. 2, cluster 2A). In addition, other RNA polymerase I core components (RPA14, RPA135, and RPA190) and a core factor (RRN7) were also increased by ≥1.5-fold with similar expression profiles (data not shown). The genes for RNA polymerase I components were up-regulated in the early phase of low temperature exposure, and this up-regulation was followed by abrupt down-regulation (Fig. 2, cluster 2A). Similar expression profiles were also observed for genes related to rRNA processing such as RNA helicases (DBP2, DBP3, DBP7, DBP8,DBP10, DHR2, DRS1, HAS1,MAK5, ROK1, RRP3, andPRP43), ribonucleases (RNT1, RRP1, andRRP9), and other rRNA processing components (CSL4, DIM1, IMP3, LCP5,NIP7, NOP1, NSR1, RCL1, andSPB1) (Fig. 2, clusters 2A and 2B). Thirty-four of the 41 genes related to transcription in cluster 1C (Fig. 1) participate directly in rRNA synthesis. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 2, genes involved in mRNA transcription were clearly divided into two clusters (clusters 2C and 2D). Cluster 2D contained genes that were down-regulated by exposure to low temperature, whereas genes in cluster 2C were up-regulated in the late phase. Genes involved in various transcription control factors were found in these clusters. For instance, the HMS2 gene, which encodes a heat shock transcription factor homolog (35Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1443-1457PubMed Google Scholar), and thePDR3 gene, which encodes a transcription factor for multiple drug resistance genes (36Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), were down-regulated (Fig. 2, cluster 2D), whereas genes encoding regulatory proteins for biosynthesis of sulfur amino acids (MET28, MET30, and MET32) (37Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) were cooperatively up-regulated in the late phase (Fig. 2, cluster 2C). The down- or up-regulation of various transcription factors seems to cause various changes in expression states in a large number of their target genes in a later phase. In summary, our findings suggest that the transcriptional machinery and processing machinery for rRNAs are up-regulated in concert in the early phase of low temperature exposure (discussed below), whereas genes for mRNA synthesis and transcriptional regulation made diverse responses in the late phase. Genes for ribosomal proteins (RPs) accounted for the majority of up-regulated genes at 2 h (94 of 323 genes up-regulated by ≥2-fold in Fig. 1, cluster 1D), and these genes were afterward down-regulated in the late phase (Fig.3, clusters 3A and 3B). The transcripts that had increased at 2 h included 40 proteins of a small subunit and 54 proteins of a large subunit comprising cytosolic ribosomes. A comparison of the expression profiles of the 94 up-regulated RPs revealed that almost all of the RPs had very similar expression profiles, suggesting that they are cooperatively regulated by a low temperature stimulus. It has been known that translational ability is greatly reduced at low temperature (38Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Dysfunction of several genes (DRS1,MPP10, NSR1, RPS11A, andRPS11B) encoding RPs and proteins involved in rRNA processing has been reported to cause cold sensitivity (39Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3169) Google Scholar). As described above, transcripts of genes involved in rRNA synthesis and processing were clearly increased in the early phase followed by the cooperative increase of transcripts from genes encoding cytosolic ribosomal proteins in the middle phase. These results suggest that yeast cells recruit transcriptional machinery mainly for cooperative up-regulation of RP genes along with a large set of genes involved in RNA metabolism and protein synthesis in the early to middle phases. We conclude that the primary and important response to low temperature in yeast is to increase ribosomal complex to compensate for the reduced translational ability at low temperature. Among genes in the category “cell rescue, defense, cell death, and aging,” expressions of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are up-regulated by a variety of stresses such as oxidative stress, methyl methanesulfonate treatment, and heat shock (40Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 42Jelinsky S.A. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), were notably down-regulated during the period of exposure to low temperature (Fig.4, cluster 4D). Most HSPs (CIS3, HMS2, HSC82, HSP30,HSP60, HSP78, HSP82,HSP150, SSA1, SSA2, STI1, and YDJ1) were down-regulated at all time points, whereas only HSP12 and HSP26 were up-regulated in the late phase (Fig. 4, cluster 4C). These results indicate that transcriptions of HSP12 and HSP26 are regulated in a different manner from that of other HSPs during exposure to low temperature. It has been reported that transcriptional regulations of these HSPs (HSP12 and HSP26) are negatively controlled by the cAMP-PKA pathway under various stress conditions, including heat, oxidative, and osmotic shocks, and nutrient limitation (43Mager W.H. De Kruijff A.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 506-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Ruis H. Schuller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of these genes controlled by the cAMP-PKA pathway is discussed under “Signal Transduction Components.” A process of protein folding in maturation of proteins is affected not only by heat shock but also by low temperature (1Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 2Graumann P. Schröder K. Schmid R. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4611-4619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Panoff J.M. Thammavongs B. Gueguen M. Boutibonnes P. Cryobiol. 1998; 36: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In prokaryotic cells, it has been reported that peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerases are induced by low temperature and are thought to play an important role in the protein folding process at low temperature (2Graumann P. Schröder K. Schmid R. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4611-4619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that Hsp12p associates with Cpr1p, a peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerase, in yeast cells (45Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutilier K. Yang L. Wolting C. Donaldson I. Schandorff S. Shewnarane J. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino acid sequence of Hsp12p has weak similarity with that of another peptidyl-prolylcis/trans-isomerase, Fpr3p, in yeast. Taken together, although the function of Hsp12p is still unclear, Hsp12p may play a role in protein folding at low temperature. Cooperative regulation of glycogen and trehalose biosynthesis genes was the most notable feature in the clustering analysis of the category “metabolism and energy production.” Glycogen and trehalose are two major reserve carbohydrates in yeast cells and are accumulated a level of up to 25% of dry cell mass, depending on environmental conditions (46Lillie S.H. Pringle J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parrou et al. (47Parrou J.L. Teste M.A. François J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) reported accumulation of glycogen and cooperative regulation of the following genes involved in glycogen synthesis in cells exposed to heat, osmotic and oxidative stresses:GLG1 (a glycogen synthesis initiator), GSY1(glycogen synthase), GLC3(1,4-glucan-6-(1,4-glucano)-transferase), GAC1 (a regulatory subunit for phosphoprotein phosphatase type 1, also known as Glc7p, which regulates glycogen synthase-2), and GPD1(glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). We found that these genes were up-regulated in the middle to late phases (Fig.5, clusters 5C and 5D). However, we also found that GPH1 (glycogen phosphorylase), which is involved in glycogen degradation, was up-regulated similarly to genes involved in glycogen synthesis (Fig. 5, cluster 5D). These paradoxical simultaneous up-regulations of genes involved in synthesis and degradation of glycogen have already been discussed for cells exposed to heat shock (47Parrou J.L. Teste M.A. François J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1891-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 48Hottiger T. Schmuts P. Wiemken A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Those studies demonstrated that glycogen was not abundantly accumulated and was futilely recycled despite significant increases in transcripts for genes involved in synthesis of glycogen by heat, hydroxyperoxide, or salt stress. However, the roles of the recycling of glycogen under some stress conditions have not yet been clarified. It has been reported that trehalose synthesis is stimulated by heat shock and osmotic stress (49Ribeiro M.J. Silva J.T. Panek A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1200: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 50De Virgilio C. Hottiger T. Dominguez J. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 51Gounalaki N. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4036-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and that its accumulation correlates with thermotolerance of yeast cells (52Singer M.A. Lingquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 53Singer M.A. Lingquist S. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 54Piper P. Trends. Microbiol. 1998; 6: 43-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In our analysis, trehalose synthesis seemed to be stimulated by low temperature through cooperative regulation of a trehalose-synthesis multicomplex:PGM2 (phosphoglucomutase), UGP1 (UDP-glucose phrophosphorylase), TPS1 and TPS2(trehalose-6-phosphate synthases), and TSL1 (a 123-kDa regulatory subunit of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase-phosphatase complex) (Fig. 5, cluster 5D). Most genes of the components of this multicomplex were down-regulated in the early to middle phases and then up-regulated in the late phase of low temperature exposure. Furthermore, NTH1, which encodes a cytosolic neutral trehalase that mainly catalyzes hydrolysis of trehalose in yeast cells (55Kopp M. Müller H. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4766-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Nwaka S. Kopp M. Holzer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10193-10198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 57Van Dijck P. Colavizza D. Smet P. Thevelein J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 109-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was down-regulated at all time points by slightly less than 2-fold (data not shown). These results suggest that trehalose synthesis is induced to accumulate trehalose in yeast cells by low temperature stimulus as well as other stresses. As a result, trehalose seems to be accumulated at the late phase, when yeast cells are exposed to low temperature. Recently, it has been reported that trehalose biosynthesis is induced in low temperature-exposed E. coli cells, and trehalose is essential for the viability of the cells at low temperature (58Kandror O. DeLeon A. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9727-9732Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, exogenous trehalose restored viability of yeast cells during freezing by possible protection of cellular membrane (59Diniz-Mendes L. Bernardes E. de Araujo P.S. Panek A.D. Paschoalin V.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 65: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At high temperature, trehalose can protect cells by acting as a “chemical chaperone” (60Welch W.J. Brown C.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), which reduces heat-induced denaturation and aggregation of proteins in yeast cells (61Hottiger T. De Virgilio C. Hall M.N. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 62Benaroudj N. Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24261-24267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Considering these results, trehalose may retain viability of yeast cells at low temperature by similar mechanisms. Expression levels of 27 of the 135 genes related to signal transduction were changed by ≥2-fold during the period of exposure to low temperature (Fig.6). In these genes, several components in the cAMP-PKA pathway (43Mager W.H. De Kruijff A.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 506-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Thevelein J.M. De Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 64Lengeler K.B. Davidson R.C. D'souza C. Harashima T. Shen W.C. Wang P. Pan X. Waugh M. Heitman J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 746-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) were notably up-regulated (Fig. 6, clusters 6B and 6C). For instance, TPK1 (a cAMP-dependent protein kinase; i.e. one of the positive effectors) (Fig. 6, cluster 6C) and PDE2 (a high affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase) (Fig. 5, cluster 5A) were up-regulated. Additionally, TPK2 (another positive effector of cAMP-dependent protein kinase) was also up-regulated by ≥1.5-fold (data not shown). Furthermore, we found that several genes,GPA2 (a nucleotide-binding regulatory protein),RGS2 (a GTPase-activating protein), RAS1 (an RAS small monomeric GTPase), and YVH1 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase) (Fig. 6, clusters 6B and 6C), all of which are upstream regulatory components of PKA, were also up-regulated. Induction of PKA-signaling components (especially TPK1 andTPK2) has been reported as one of the notable features of responses to the environmental stresses, such as heat shock, nitrogen depletion, and diauxic shift, and is controlled by Msn2p/4p transcription factors (32Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar). The cAMP-PKA pathway plays a major role in the control of metabolism, stress resistance, and cell proliferation (64Lengeler K.B. Davidson R.C. D'souza C. Harashima T. Shen W.C. Wang P. Pan X. Waugh M. Heitman J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 746-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Downstream targets of activated PKA include many housekeeping gene products and enzymes as well as proteins that are important for stress resistance and cell cycle control. Low activity of PKA causes expression of stationary phase characteristics (e.g. high trehalose and glycogen concentrations, high stress resistance, and derepression of STRE-controlled genes) during exponential growth in a glucose medium. Recently, Causton et al. (33Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol.

We found that 68 of the Msn2p/4p-regulated genes were up-regulated by ≥2-fold in the late phase of low temperature exposure. These 68 genes included genes involved in glycogen synthesis (GAC1, GLC3, and GPD1) (Fig. 5, clusters 5C and 5D), trehalose synthesis (TPS1 andTPS2) (Fig. 5, cluster 5D), and stress resistance (UBI4, CTT1, HSP12, andHSP26) (Fig. 4, clusters 4B and 4C). It has also been reported that several yeast heat shock gene promoters (e.g.the HSP70 gene SSA3, UBI4, CTT1,HSP12, and HSP26) are suppressed by cAMP through Msn2p/4p transcription factors (64Lengeler K.B.

These results suggest that genes involved in stress response and in glycogen and trehalose biosynthesis are cooperatively regulated via Msn2p/4p and cAMP-PKA pathway in the late phase of the low temperature exposure. It has also been reported that genes involved in protein synthesis are positively controlled by cAMP (65Klein C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As we discussed above (under “Genes Related to Transcription” and “Ribosomal Protein Genes”), genes involved in transcription and protein synthesis were cooperatively up-regulated in the early to middle phases of the low temperature exposure. In addition, it has been reported that PKAs from other organisms, such as insects, frogs, and a bat, were activated in an early phase after low temperature exposure (11Pfister T.D. Storey K.B. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 67Holden C.P. Storey K.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: R1205-R1211PubMed Google Scholar, 68Holden C.P.

In summary, the cAMP-PKA pathway may play an important role in up- and down-regulation of a large number of gene expressions in yeast cells under a low temperature condition. We comprehensively analyzed expression states of genes in yeast cells exposed to low temperature using a microarray and demonstrated that a large number of genes for various cellular functions are diversely up- or down-regulated under a low temperature condition. Interestingly, using a clustering and functional analysis, we found that ≥2-fold up-regulated genes are categorized into three phases according to their expression profiles: (i) in the early phase, genes involved in RNA polymerase I and rRNA processing are up-regulated; (ii) in the middle phase, genes involved in cytosolic ribosomal proteins are up-regulated; (iii) in the late phase, genes involved in general stress response are up-regulated (Fig. 1). The result suggests that adaptation mechanisms for low temperature in yeast cells are composed of three sequential molecular events."

The NMDA receptor also serves as a CaMKII docking site in dendritic spines with high affinity binding sites located on its NR1 and NR2B subunits. We demonstrate that high affinity binding of CaMKII to NR1 requires autophosphorylation of Thr286. This autophosphorylation reduces the off rate to a level (t½ = ∼23 min) that is similar to that observed for dissociation of the T286D mutant CaMKII (t½ = ∼30 min) from spines after its glutamate-induced accumulation (Shen, K., Teruel, M. N., Connor, J. H., Shenolikar, S., and Meyer, T. (2000) Nat. Neurosci. 3, 881–886). CaMKII as well as the previously identified NR1 binding partners calmodulin and α-actinin bind to the short C-terminal portion of the C0 region of NR1. Like Ca2+/calmodulin, autophosphorylated CaMKII competes with α-actinin-2 for binding to NR1. We conclude that the NR1 C0 region is a key site for recruiting CaMKII to the postsynaptic site, where it may act in concert with calmodulin to modulate the stimulatory role of α-actinin interaction with the NMDA receptor.

LTP usually requires Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor and subsequent activation of CaMKII by Ca2+/calmodulin (2Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Google Scholar, 3Lisman J.E.

CaMKII is concentrated at postsynaptic densities (5Kennedy M.B. Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Google Scholar, 6Kelly P.T. McGuinness T.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 945-949Google Scholar). This localization is strategically ideal for activation by Ca2+influx through NMDA receptors and for phosphorylation of neighboring AMPA receptors, which contributes to LTP (3Lisman J.E. Zhabotinsky A.M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 191-201Google Scholar, 7Barria A. Muller D. Derkach V. Griffith L.C. Soderling T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2042-2045Google Scholar, 8Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Google Scholar). Simultaneous binding of two or more Ca2+/calmodulin molecules to neighboring subunits within the same dodecameric CaMKII holoenzyme leads to intersubunit phosphorylation at Thr286 (4Soderling T.R.

Oxford University Press, New York1999: 311-343Google Scholar). This mechanism enables CaMKII to decode Ca2+ spike frequency (10De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Google Scholar). Thr286 phosphorylation keeps the enzyme in a catalytically active conformation independent of the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin in the holoenzyme and thereby of cytosolic Ca2+ levels (4Soderling T.R. Chang B. Brickey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3719-3722Google Scholar, 9Schulman H. Braun A. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 311-343Google Scholar). Coincident with its activation, CaMKII associates with the NMDA receptor subunits NR1 (11Leonard A.S. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3239-3244Google Scholar), NR2A (12Gardoni F. Schrama L.H. van Dalen J.J. Gispen W.H. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M.

Connor J.H. Shenolikar S. Meyer T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 881-886Google Scholar). NMDA receptors in cortex and hippocampus mainly consist of one or two NR1 and two or three NR2A and 2B subunits (16Seeburg P.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 297-303Google Scholar, 17Hollmann M.

Leonard and J. W. Hell, unpublished observations. 2A. S. Leonard and J. W. Hell, unpublished observations. and not easily detectable under several conditions (11Leonard A.S. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E.

CaMKII robustly binds to two independent sites on the 644-amino acid-long intracellular C terminus of NR2B. One site (NR2B/C) is formed by residues 1290–1309; the other site (NR2B/P) is localized within residues 839–1120 but has evaded further identification up to now (11Leonard A.S. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3239-3244Google Scholar, 13Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Google Scholar, 21Strack S.

Ca2+/calmodulin is sufficient to induce high affinity binding of CaMKII to NR2B/C (22Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar). Ca2+/calmodulin binding and Thr286 phosphorylation remove the autoinhibitory segment of CaMKII to various degrees from its catalytic substrate-binding site (S site) and from the endogenous attachment site for Thr286, the T site (23Yang E. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26199-26208Google Scholar). The NR2B1289–1310 sequence binds to the T site in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin. The resulting interaction outlasts dissociation of Ca2+/calmodulin, thereby displacing Thr286 from the T site and the inhibitory segment from the catalytic S site for an extended period of time (22Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar). The result is a lasting increase in the activity of NR2B/C-associated CaMKII independent of cytosolic Ca2+ or Thr286 phosphorylation. The initial Ca2+-induced translocation of CaMKII to postsynaptic sites requires Ca2+/calmodulin binding to CaMKII but not Thr286 phosphorylation (14Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Google Scholar, 15Shen K. Teruel M.N. Connor J.H. Shenolikar S. Meyer T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 881-886Google Scholar). These studies did not identify the postsynaptic attachment sites for CaMKII, but our earlier evidence indicates that the initial Ca2+-induced postsynaptic accumulation is at least in part due to Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent association of CaMKII with the NR2B/C site (22Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar). However, the time course of persistent CaMKII translocation to the postsynaptic site does depend on Thr286 phosphorylation; prolonging autophosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase 1 and mimicking Thr286phosphorylation by introducing a T286D mutation resulted in a much reduced dissociation rate of CaMKII from postsynaptic sites (14Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Google Scholar, 15Shen K. Teruel M.N. Connor J.H. Shenolikar S. Meyer T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 881-886Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of CaMKII increases its affinity for NR2B/C (13Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Google Scholar,21Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Google Scholar, 22Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar). This autophosphorylation-induced increase in NR2B/C binding is comparable with that caused by Ca2+/calmodulin (22Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1C). This autophosphorylation-dependent interaction could therefore contribute to a more enduring association of CaMKII with the postsynaptic site. However, serine 1303 in NR2B/C is the major CaMKII phosphorylation site on NR2B (24Omkumar R.V. Kiely M.J. Rosenstein A.J. Min K.-T. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31670-31678Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of this serine inhibits CaMKII binding to this site (21Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Google Scholar), thereby antagonizing an otherwise potentially lasting interaction between NR2B/C and CaMKII. We now show that autophosphorylation of Thr286 decreases the off rate for CaMKII release from NR1 by a factor of 10 and brings it into a time range similar to that observed for dissociation of Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKII from synaptic sites in neuronal cultures. Together with previous work our results argue for a complex regulatory mechanism of the CaMKII-NMDA receptor interaction. Previous work indicates that calmodulin itself and also α-actinin-2 can directly bind to the C terminus of NR1 (25Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Google Scholar, 26Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Google Scholar, 27Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+/calmodulin appears to reduce NMDA receptor activity by binding to the C0 region (25Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Google Scholar, 27Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Google Scholar), thereby displacing α-actinin (26Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Google Scholar,28Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Google Scholar). The physiological significance of these findings is highlighted by earlier results demonstrating that an intact actin cytoskeleton and interaction with α-actinin support NMDA receptor activity (28Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Google Scholar, 29Rosenmund C. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1993; 10: 805-814Google Scholar). Using peptide libraries to precisely map the NR1 interaction sites for α-actinin, calmodulin, and CaMKII, we demonstrate that all three proteins bind to the membrane-distal portion (residues 845–863) of the 30-residue-long C0 region in the NR1 C terminus. Not only calmodulin but also CaMKII competes with α-actinin for NR1 binding. These results indicate that NR1 constitutes a critical interaction site for lasting relocation of CaMKII to the postsynaptic site, which is regulated in a complex manner by postsynaptic calcium concentrations and the actin cytoskeleton. Our results suggest that CaMKII, in conjunction with calmodulin, displaces α-actinin from NR1, providing a novel mechanism for modulating the channel activity of NR1.

Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells adapted for serum-free growth (Invitrogen) were cultured in Ex-cell 420 serum-free medium (JRH Biosciences). Cultured Sf9 cells (200 ml of 7 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing mouse CaMKIIα (1 × 108plaque-forming units/ml; a gift from Dr. T. R. Soderling, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR (32Brickey D.A. Colbran R.J. Fong Y.-L. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 578-584Google Scholar)). After 1 h at room temperature, the cells were diluted to 1 liter with medium and grown for 72 h at 27 °C in an orbital shaker. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (750 × g for 15 min), and decanted pellets were stored at −80 °C until purification (32Brickey D.A. Colbran R.J. Fong Y.-L. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 578-584Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated on ice three times for 10 s at 10-s intervals with a large tip sonicator (power setting 7). The lysate was centrifuged at 118,000 ×g for 30 min, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to 60% to the supernatant while stirring on ice. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 118,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT). The suspension was added to a 5-ml calmodulin-Sepharose (Sigma) column, equilibrated with buffer A, and incubated for 1 h under tilting. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A followed by a high salt wash (buffer A plus 950 mm NaCl). The CaMKII was eluted by chelating Ca2+ via incubating the column for 1 h in 1 column volume of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT. Additional fractions were eluted with several more column volumes of the same buffer. The protein concentration was determined byA280 reading and with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). The various fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining to control for purity and potential degradation and by immunoblotting to identify CaMKII. CaMKII was dialyzed against 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA and stored at −20 °C in the dialysis buffer with 50% glycerol added to it. Recombinant CaMKIIα (1–2 μg) was preincubated for 5 min at 0 °C (to promote Thr286autophosphorylation in selected samples) in basic phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2) containing, if indicated, 500 μmCaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, and 500 μm ATP. In some samples EGTA was added, which completely removed calcium/calmodulin from the kinase (22Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar). To induce Thr305/306 phosphorylation in selected samples (Fig. 1only), the incubation was continued for another 15 min at 30 °C. The kinase mixture was then added to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin samples loaded with about 1.0 μg of GST fusion proteins or GST alone (as estimated by SDS-PAGE and subsequent staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue in addition to a quantitative bicinchoninic acid-protein assay (Pierce) (11Leonard A.S. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3239-3244Google Scholar)). After incubation for 2–3 h at 0–4 °C in and washing of the samples with TBS (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose for immunoblotting and quantification by ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. Competition by α-actinin was tested by the addition of up to 10 μm α-actinin to the resin samples during the CaMKII-binding step. Binding of α-actinin to GST-NR1 was measured in the same way in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and increasing calmodulin concentrations. To determine dissociation rates, unphosphorylated (no ATP present during preincubation and binding) and autophosphorylated recombinant CaMKIIα was incubated with immobilized GST-NR1 as described in the previous paragraph for 1.5 h at 4 °C (initial experiments revealed that binding equilibrium was reached within less than 1 h; 24 h equilibration time did not result in more CaMKII binding). Matrix-bound NR1-CaMKII complexes were obtained by centrifugation, followed by three quick washing steps, which took less than 3 min. The resin samples were then resuspended in either 1 or 10 ml of TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 corresponding to at least 50× and 500× dilution factors, respectively. The results with the two different dilution factors were comparable, indicating that dissociation rates were independent of final buffer volume following at least a 50× dilution. No molecular weight shifts were visible after 138 min postdilution, indicating that no hyperphosphorylation had occurred. Matrix-bound CaMKII was obtained by centrifugation at the indicated time points, followed by two quick washing steps taking less than 60 s, extraction with SDS sample buffer, immunoblotting, and quantification as described. The koff value was obtained from single exponential best fit curves of experimental data. All of the data fits were performed with PRISM software (version 3.02, GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA). Fmoc peptide synthesis was performed manually in a solid phase approach as described by the manufacturer (Chiron Mimotopes). In brief, the peptides were synthesized on derivatized polypropylene pins arranged in a 96-well plate format. Each condensation reaction began with the removal of the Fmoc protecting group with base (20% piperidine/DMF) and adding a new Fmoc amino acid activated ester along with the appropriate activator (diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole). After synthesis, the final Fmoc protecting group was removed, and the terminal amino group was capped by acetylation (10% (CH3CO)2O in DMF for 10–15 min and 1 drop of pyridine). Removal of the side chain protecting groups was accomplished with trifluoroacetic acid (50% in DMF, 1–2% ethanedithiol or anisole) for 20 min. A wash with isopropyl alcohol (containing 1% ethanedithiol or anisole) followed trifluoroacetic acid treatment and successive washes with 10% triethylamine in DMF, methanol, triethylamine, methanol, and DMF completed the neutralization sequence. Pins with the peptides were utilized for binding assays in 96-well plates by an ELISA procedure with recombinant CaMKIIα, poly-His6-α-actinin-2, or brain calmodulin, followed by antibodies against CaMKIIα, the poly-His6 tag, or calmodulin, respectively, and ultimately by horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies for all three proteins. All binding assays and antibody incubations were done in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20. To detect the horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies, 150 μl of the 1-step slow TMB-ELISA solution (Pierce) was added to each well.A650 readings were taken every 5 min for up to 30 min to follow the reaction. Finally 100 μl of 1 mH2SO4 was added to stop the reaction forA450 readings, which often showed reduced background compared with the readings at A650taken without H2SO4. Because the peptides were synthesized on a noncleavable peptide block, repeated binding assays could be performed after regenerating the block by ultrasound treatment in a bath sonicator in 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, for 30 min at 55 °C (power setting 6). This procedure removed bound target and antibody from the peptide without breaking the bond between the peptide and the pin. Subsequent control ELISA tests with primary and secondary antibodies only confirmed that no antigen remained on the pins. After sonication, the pins were washed five times with water and five times with TBS and stored in TBS containing 0.02% azide. All of the noncleavable peptide blocks contained positive control peptides, including AC3-I (KKALHRQETVID) (11Leonard A.S. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3239-3244Google Scholar) and NR2B1295–1306 (RNKLRRQHSYDT) (21Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Google Scholar,22Bayer K.U. De Koninck P.

Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar). The initial accumulation of CaMKII at postsynaptic sites requires Ca2+/calmodulin binding to CaMKII, but persistent CaMKII clustering depends on Thr286 phosphorylation (14Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Google Scholar, 15Shen K. Teruel M.N. Connor J.H. Shenolikar S. Meyer T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 881-886Google Scholar). To evaluate the binding partners and molecular mechanisms of CaMKII recruitment and retention at postsynaptic sites, we determined the effect of Ca2+/calmodulin and the effect of autophosphorylation of CaMKII on its binding to the three high affinity interaction sites NR1, NR2B/P, and NR2B/C (Fig. 1). The GST fusion proteins NR1, NR2B/P, and NR2B/C were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with recombinant CaMKII in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin and ATP before washing and detection of CaMKII by immunoblotting. CaMKII bound to all three fusion proteins even in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin and ATP. The resulting interactions were rather weak, explaining why they have not been observed in other studies (13Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Google Scholar, 21Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Google Scholar). These Ca2+/calmodulin- and autophosphorylation-independent interactions were nevertheless specific because negative controls with plain GST performed in parallel did not yield signals for CaMKII (data not shown; but see Ref. 11Leonard A.S. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3239-3244Google Scholar). Ca2+ by itself had no effect, but together with calmodulin it increased association of CaMKII with NR2B/C (Fig. 1C). Ca2+/calmodulin was not sufficient to stimulate CaMKII binding to NR2B/P or NR1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Preincubation of CaMKII with Ca2+/calmodulin and ATP under conditions that result in Thr286 phosphorylation was necessary to induce high affinity binding of CaMKII to NR1 and NR2B/P (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate high affinity interactions of NR2B/C with the Ca2+/calmodulin-bound form of CaMKII and of NR1 and NR2B/P with Thr286 phosphorylated CaMKII. Focusing on NR1, we tested whether Thr286 phosphorylation is not only necessary but also sufficient for high affinity interaction of CaMKII with NR1. GST-NR1 and, as negative control, GST alone were immobilized on anti-GST antibody-coated 96-well plates. The samples were incubated with wt and T286A- and T286D-mutated CaMKII before washing and immunoblotting. This procedure is less sensitive in our hands than the pull-down experiments with fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose and only permits detection of the high affinity interaction between CaMKII and NR1. When indicated, CaMKII had been pretreated with Ca2+/calmodulin and ATP under conditions that result in Thr286 phosphorylation in the wild type form. As before, wt CaMKII bound with high affinity to GST-NR1 only after Thr286 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). CaMKII did not show an interaction with NR1 when ATP was omitted during the procedure to prevent Thr286 phosphorylation, whether Ca2+/calmodulin was present or not (lanes 3 and4). The addition of EGTA after pretreatment completely removes Ca2+/calmodulin from CaMKII (22Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar) but did not result in a reduction of Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKII binding to NR1 (compare lanes 1 and 2). These results show that high affinity binding of CaMKII to NR1 requires autophosphorylation of CaMKII but not the continued presence of Ca2+/calmodulin in the CaMKII complex. The T286A mutant did not bind to GST-NR1 under any conditions in this assay (lanes 5–8), indicating that autop"
https://openalex.org/W2004157397,"We describe here the identification and characterization of a novel member of the family of K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, NCKX3(gene SLC24A3). Human NCKX3 encodes a protein of 644 amino acids that displayed a high level of sequence identity to the other family members, rod NCKX1 and cone/neuronal NCKX2, in the hydrophobic regions surrounding the “α -repeat” sequences thought to form the ion-binding pocket for transport. Outside of these regions NCKX3 showed no significant identity to other known proteins. As anticipated from this sequence similarity, NCKX3 displayed K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+exchanger activity when assayed in heterologous expression systems, using digital imaging of fura-2 fluorescence, electrophysiology, or radioactive 45Ca2+ uptake. The N-terminal region of NCKX3, although not essential for expression, increased functional activity at least 10-fold and may represent a cleavable signal sequence. NCKX3 transcripts were most abundant in brain, with highest levels found in selected thalamic nuclei, in hippocampal CA1 neurons, and in layer IV of the cerebral cortex. Many other tissues also expressed NCKX3 at lower levels, especially aorta, uterus, and intestine, which are rich in smooth muscle. The discovery of NCKX3 thus expands the K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family and suggests this class of transporter has a more widespread role in cellular Ca2+ handling than previously appreciated.

Na+/Ca2+ exchanger expressed sequence tags kilobase pair 3-(N-morpholino)propane-sulfonic acid Na+/Ca2+ + K+ exchanger polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction Plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are an important component of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and have been extensively studied in various cell systems (1Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are encoded by a protein superfamily present in organisms ranging from bacteria to man (2Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). All the members of this family share sequence similarity in two hydrophobic and internally homologous domains, commonly referred to as α-repeats (3Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Two groups within the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger superfamily have been characterized so far in considerable detail and consist of structurally and functionally distinct proteins. Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX)1 are thought to catalyze the extrusion of one intracellular Ca2+ ion in exchange for three extracellular Na+ ions (Ref. 1Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar but see Ref. 4Fujioka Y. Komeda M. Matsuoka S. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 523: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Na+/Ca2+ + K+ exchangers (NCKX), on the other hand, are thought to transport one intracellular Ca2+ and one K+ ion in exchange for four extracellular Na+ ions (5Schnetkamp P.P.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The NCX family of exchangers is best exemplified by the mammalian cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1, first cloned from canine heart (6Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), which plays a crucial role in the relaxation process of heart muscle by extruding the Ca2+ that enters at the beginning of systole. NCX1 is also expressed in a variety of other tissues (7Kofuji P. Hadley R.W. Kieval R.S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1241-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lee S.-L., Yu, A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting an important role in the physiological processes of different cell types. The tissue-specific expression pattern of NCX1 has been demonstrated to be under the control of a multipartite promoter (10Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7643-7649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, a complex pattern of alternative splicing in the large intracellular loop of NCX1 generates isoforms of the protein, which are also expressed in a highly tissue-specific way (7Kofuji P. Hadley R.W. Kieval R.S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1241-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lee S.-L., Yu, A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol.

Functional studies have revealed complex regulatory mechanisms of the NCX1 protein, some of which differ between alternatively spliced isoforms (2Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 13Dyck C. Omelchenko A. Elias C.L. Quednau B.D. Philipson K.D. Hnatowich M. Hryshko L.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The NCX protein family contains two other members, products of genes NCX2 andNCX3, whose expression is restricted largely to brain and skeletal muscle (9Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). All three NCX proteins share a high degree of sequence identity, especially within the transmembrane spanning domains, and are believed to share the same overall topology, modeled to have two clusters of hydrophobic membrane-spanning helices separated by a large hydrophilic, intracellular loop. The hydrophobic domains are thought to pack together in the membrane, forming the ion translocation pathway (16Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, the three NCX proteins show very similar functional properties when assayed in heterologous expression systems (17Linck B. Qiu Z. He Z. Tong Q. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C415-C423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The second major group in the Na+/Ca2+exchanger superfamily is exemplified by the Na+/Ca2++K+ exchanger from retinal rod outer segments, NCKX1. NCKX1 was first cloned from bovine retina (19Reiländer H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspeich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and, more recently, from other species including dolphin, rat, buffalo, and man (20Poon S. Leach S. Li X.F. Tucker J.E. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C651-C660Crossref Google Scholar, 21Cooper C.B. Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6276-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Tucker J.E. Winkfein R.J. Cooper C.B. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 435-440PubMed Google Scholar). This protein plays a critical role in the visual transduction process of the mammalian retina (5Schnetkamp P.P.M. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In darkness, the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels of the outer segment are largely open, and both Na+ and Ca2+ ions flow in. Ca2+ homeostasis must still be maintained under these conditions of membrane depolarization and reduced sodium gradient, and NCKX1 is the principal means by which Ca2+ is extruded from rod outer segments. Such a function could not be achieved by a molecule operating with the 3:1 Na+:Ca2+ stoichiometry of NCX1, and indeed it has been demonstrated that NCKX1 couples the entry of four Na+ ions in exchange for the exit of one Ca2+ and one K+ ion (23Cervetto L. Lagnado L. Perry R.J. Robinson D.W. McNaughton P.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C153-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Whereas NCX1 proteins from mammalian species are over 90% identical in their amino acid sequences, NCKX1 orthologs display relatively low sequence identities of around 60%, largely due to differences in the two large hydrophilic loops, an extracellular one near the N terminus and a cytoplasmic one near the center of the molecule. NCKX1 has been modeled to have a similar arrangement of transmembrane-spanning segments as NCX1, although actual amino acid sequence similarity is very limited and restricted only to the two α-repeats, as mentioned above. The cloning of NCKX1 from rat eye (20Poon S. Leach S. Li X.F. Tucker J.E. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C651-C660Crossref Google Scholar) also revealed the presence of alternatively spliced isoforms in this species, which differ by the arrangement of four exons at the N terminus of the large intracellular loop. Interestingly, the equivalent region of bovine NCKX1, but apparently not the alternatively spliced region in rat NCKX1, is responsible for producing a functionally silent protein when expressed in heterologous systems (20Poon S. Leach S. Li X.F. Tucker J.E. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C651-C660Crossref Google Scholar, 21Cooper C.B. Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6276-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Functional measurements have pointed toward the presence of K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+exchangers in tissues other than eye (25Dahan D.

Donnelly R.J. Lytton J. Reeves J.P. Am. J.

Moreover, sequence analysis of the genomes of model organisms, such as Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans, has revealed several new hypothetical proteins with similarity to the NCKX family (2Philipson K.D.

This gene was given the designation NCKX4(SLC24A4), although it has not yet been characterized functionally. These findings lend support to the idea that the NCKX gene family predates the evolution of vertebrate vision and that the encoded proteins are an essential component of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in many different cells and tissues. A more generalized role for NCKX proteins in current schemes of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis has yet to be considered, largely because there has been no systematic analysis of their expression in tissues other than retina (28Prinsen C.F. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1424-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we have identified, starting from genome project EST data in three mammalian species, a novel member of the K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+exchanger gene family, NCKX3. We demonstrate that transcripts from this gene are prominent in brain and other tissues and that, when expressed in HEK293 cells, NCKX3 indeed encodes a K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+exchanger.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have described the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a novel, third, member of the family of K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+exchangers, NCKX3. Like the other two members, rod NCKX1 and cone/neuronal NCKX2, NCKX3 demonstrated K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+exchange activity when measured with the fluorescent Ca2+dye fura2, with ion currents, or with 45Ca2+uptake. Although we did not formally determine whether K+was actually transported together with Na+ and Ca2+, there was an absolute requirement for K+in all of the functional assays. That NCKX3 can be measured electrically, with charge moving in the same direction as Na+, also places limits on the ionic stoichiometry of transport. Combined with the high degree of amino acid sequence similarity to NCKX1, which has been clearly established to transport 4 Na+ in exchange for 1 K+ and 1 Ca2+(23Cervetto L. Lagnado L. Perry R.J. Robinson D.W. McNaughton P.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C153-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seems likely that NCKX3 has a similar stoichiometry.Previous studies with the cardiac Na+/Ca2+exchanger, NCX1, had implicated the so-called α-repeat regions of the molecule in forming the binding pocket for ion translocation (45Nicoll D.A.

Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13385-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Functional studies on a deletion mutant of bovine NCKX1 and a C. elegans paralog (cNCKX) have suggested similar regions also specify the transport sites needed for K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+exchangers (30Szerencsei R.T. Tucker J.E. Cooper C.B. Winkfein R.J. Farrell P.J. Iatrou K. Schnetkamp P.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 669-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A comparison of the sequences between NCKX3 and these molecules (Fig. 2) shows the high sequence similarity anticipated within the α-repeats. NCKX3 is, however, significantly more divergent in these regions than the NCKX1/NCKX2/cNCKX trio. Intriguingly, these positions of divergence often correspond to identities or similarities with NCX1. Nevertheless, NCKX3 is clearly K+-dependent, in contrast to NCX1, and thus this new sequence information places further limits on the amino acids likely to contribute to the ionic specificity of the K+-dependent class of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers.Hydropathy analysis as well as our in vitro translation experiments support a proposed transmembrane topology for NCKX3 that is largely similar to those proposed previously for other family members (Fig. 1). The NCKX3 protein begins with a functionally dispensable region that may encode a putative “signal” peptide, in a manner analogous to that reported for NCX1 (41Sahin-Toth M. Nicoll D.A. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. Friedlander M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 42Loo T.W. Ho C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19120-19127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of this region in the expressed protein significantly improved the level of functional expression of NCKX3 (Fig. 9). Thus, whereas all cDNA constructs demonstrated K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity when assayed using fura-2 fluorescent digital imaging, only the HuNCKX3-L clone expressed activity above background in either electrophysiological or45Ca2+ uptake assays. Since in vitrotranscription and translation experiments (Fig. 5) did not reveal a significant difference in the efficiency of protein expression, the longer NCKX3 protein species containing the N-terminal hydrophobic M0 sequence may be targeted or delivered to the plasma membrane more efficiently than the protein lacking this sequence.The processed NCKX3 protein consists of a short, glycosylated, extracellular loop at the N terminus followed by a cluster of five hydrophobic, putative transmembrane, segments, a long hydrophilic loop, and finally, a second cluster of hydrophobic regions. The long central loop, which is presumed to be cytoplasmic based on a comparison to NCKX1 and NCX1, contains consensus sequences for several protein kinases. Recent studies using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of NCX1 have revealed that the C-terminal hydrophobic region of that molecule is composed of four helical transmembrane segments and a pore-like re-entrant loop structure that extends into the membrane (45Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 47Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of NCKX3 suggests a somewhat different topology, with five transmembrane spans separating the central cytoplasmic loop from the protein C terminus, which would reside on the extracellular side of the membrane. The validity of such a model, and the notion that the K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCKX) may have a topology different from those of the K+-independent (NCX) family, will need to be tested.The exon boundaries for human NCKX3 are indicated in Fig. 1, and their location in genomic sequence on chromosome 20 is shown in Fig. 3. The following two features of the NCKX3 gene are striking: (i) the distance over which the exons, especially the first three, are spaced; (ii) the arrangement of exons in comparison to the genomic structure of other Na+/Ca2+ exchanger genes. The NCX1 (SLC8A1), NCX3(SLC8A3), NCKX1 (SLC24A1), andNCKX2 (SLC24A2) genes all share an unusually large second exon that extends from just before the initiating methionine codon into the central cytoplasmic loop (analyzed by BLAST search; also see Refs. 37Kraev A. Chumakov I. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 38Tucker J.E. Winkfein R.J. Murthy S.K. Friedman J.S. Walter M.A. Demetrick D.J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast, the corresponding sequence of NCKX3 is split into 10 separate exons. Furthermore, the arrangement of exons encoding the C-terminal hydrophobic domain is specific for NCKX3 and differentiates it from either the arrangement conserved between NCKX1 and NCKX2 or the distinct arrangement conserved between NCX1 and NCX3. These differences suggest that, despite the sequence similarity within the α-repeat regions, NCKX3 must have its origins in a very ancient gene duplication event and subsequent divergence from other NCKX and NCX family members.The pattern of expression of NCKX3 transcripts in different tissues was examined in rat and mouse by Northern blot and in human by Multiple Tissue Expression Array dot blot analyses (Fig. 6). From these data it is clear that NCKX3 was most abundantly expressed in various brain regions. Regional distribution was examined in more detail in parasagittal sections of mouse brain using in situhybridization (Fig. 8), which revealed a very specific pattern. The highest levels of NCKX3 mRNA were found in neurons arranged in distinct nuclei of the thalamus, followed by the pyramidal CA1 neurons of the hippocampus, and large neurons of cortical layer IV. This pattern is quite different from published reports of NCX1 and NCKX2 distribution in rat brain (29Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4115-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 49Marlier L.N. Zheng T. Tang J. Grayson D.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 20: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transcripts for both of these exchangers were also abundant in cortex but lacked the laminar pattern evident for NCKX3. All three exchangers were present in hippocampal pyramidal cells, but only NCKX3 was richest in CA1 neurons. In the thalamus, each exchanger had a characteristic regional distribution. NCKX3 and NCKX2 expression largely overlapped in the cerebellar molecular layer. In contrast, NCKX3 was essentially absent from the striatum, where NCKX2 was very abundant, and from the septal nuclei, where NCX1 was highly expressed.A unique feature of NCKX3 expression in comparison to other K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+exchangers was the presence of transcripts in many tissues other than brain, although at lower levels. The precise pattern appeared to vary between human and rodent, although part of this may have been due to the manner in which RNA loading was normalized (to a fixed quantity of total RNA in the case of rodent and to a varying amount of poly(A)+ mRNA, normalized to several control transcripts, in the case of the Multiple Tissue Expression Array), or due to the difference in the probes used. The tissues that had the next most abundant level of NCKX3 mRNA, after brain, were those generally rich in smooth muscle, such as aorta, uterus, and intestine. Many other tissues expressed lower levels, but only liver and kidney consistently appeared to be essentially negative for NCKX3. This rather ubiquitous pattern of expression matches more closely that of NCX1 than it does any of the other family members, which are thought to have quite restricted tissue expression patterns, NCKX1 in eye, NCKX2 in brain neurons (including eye), and NCX2 and NCX3 in brain and skeletal muscle. The selective presence of NCKX3 in specific unique cell types of the vascular wall (smooth muscle, endothelial cells, or innervating neurons) has yet to be examined. To our knowledge, however, there have been no reports of K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity in these tissues or cell types.At present the physiological consequences of the differential tissue-specific expression patterns for different Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family members are unclear. The situation in brain, where at least four different Na+/Ca2+ exchanger gene products (NCX1, NCX2, NCKX2, and NCKX3)3 are present at high levels, is particularly intriguing. It seems likely that unique Ca2+-handling requirements of specific tissues or cell types, combined with kinetic, thermodynamic, or regulatory differences in the function of these exchangers, will provide important clues. The difference in transport stoichiometry between NCKX and NCX families provides an opportunity for NCKX-type exchangers to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis in environments where the Na+gradient and/or the membrane potential are lower than normal. Although this argument was first used to justify the expression of NCKX1 in rod photoreceptors, there may be situations in other neurons where similar conditions exist. Another possible role for different exchanger gene products might be in the transport of Mg2+ instead of Ca2+ (50Tashiro M. Konishi M. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Kurihara S. Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 440: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have not investigated whether NCKX3 might transport Mg2+. It is noteworthy, however, that 1 mm Mg2+ significantly inhibits NCKX3 activity (Fig. 10), although under these conditions it had no significant effect on the amplitude of either NCX1 or NCKX2 currents. 4H. Dong and J. Lytton, unpublished observations. These observations suggest that Mg2+ interacts more selectively with the transport site of NCXK3 than it does with the sites of other family members.The eventual answer to the question of unique physiological roles for the different Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family members will require the development of selective pharmacological blockers and/or of recombinant gene knock-out animals. The recent developments of an agent relatively selective for inhibition of NCX-type Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, KB-R7943 (51Iwamoto T. Watano T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22391-22397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and mice lacking NCX1 (52Wakimoto K. Kobayashi K. Kuro O.M. Yao A. Iwamoto T. Yanaka N. Kita S.

Most notably, planning complex gene knock-out experiments will be greatly facilitated by the completion of the mouse genome sequence (due in 2002) which will set a unique stage for genetic dissection of mammalian Ca2+homeostasis. Plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are an important component of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and have been extensively studied in various cell systems (1Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are encoded by a protein superfamily present in organisms ranging from bacteria to man (2Philipson K.D.

Prominent among them isN ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), which is also known as one of the advanced glycation end products. Because CML is formed from a wide range of precursors, we have attempted to identify unique structures characteristic of the reaction of GA with protein. To this end, monoclonal (GA5 and 1A12) and polyclonal (non-CML-GA) antibodies specific for GA-modified proteins were prepared. These antibodies specifically reacted with GA-modified and with hypochlorous acid-modified BSA, but not with BSA modified by other aldehydes, indicating that the epitope of these antibodies could be a specific marker for myeloperoxidase-induced protein modification. By HPLC purification from GA-modifiedN α-(carbobenzyloxy)-l-lysine, GA5-reactive compound was isolated, and its chemical structure was characterized as 3-hydroxy-4-hydroxymethyl-1-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl) pyridinium cation. This compound named as GA-pyridine was recognized both by 1A12 and non-CML-GA, indicating that GA-pyridine is an important antigenic structure in GA-modified proteins. Immunohistochemical studies with GA5 demonstrated the accumulation of GA-pyridine in the cytoplasm of foam cells and extracellularly in the central region of atheroma in human atherosclerotic lesions.

Modification of proteins with reactive aldehydes is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including diabetes and atherosclerosis. Products of nonenzymatic glycation, Maillard reactions, such as 3-deoxyglucosone (1Niwa T. Takeda N. Yoshizumi H. Tatematsu A. Ohara M. Tomiyama S. Niimura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 480-489Google Scholar). Aldehydes such as GA, which is formed by reaction of HOCl with serine, then react to form chemical modifications in protein. Myeloperoxidase has been detected immunohistochemically in lipid-rich advanced atherosclerotic lesions, and the active myeloperoxidase was purified from atherosclerotic arteries (6Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Google Scholar). A subsequent study by Hazell et al. (7Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Google Scholar) demonstrated that human atherosclerotic lesions were positively stained by a monoclonal antibody against HOCl-modified proteins, suggesting the presence of an epitope(s) specific for HOCl-modified proteins. HOCl generated by the myeloperoxidase system was shown to react withl-threonine to generate acrolein via 2-hydroxypropanol, whereas the similar reaction with l-serine led to formation of glycolaldehyde (GA) (8Anderson M.M. Requena J.R. Crowley J.R. Thorpe S.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 103-113Google Scholar). An immunohistochemical study demonstrated the accumulation of an acrolein-protein adduct(s) in macrophage-derived foam cells as well in thickened neointima of human arterial walls (9Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Sakai K. Matsuda T. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Suzuki D. Miyata T. Noguchi N. Niki E. Osawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4882-4887Google Scholar). However, since acrolein is also formed by a pathway of lipid peroxidation (10Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Morimitsu Y. Osawa T. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16058-16066Google Scholar), acrolein-protein adducts are not specific for myeloperoxidase-induced protein modification in vivo.GA is known to react with protein amino residues to give brown-colored cross-linked structures (11Acharya A.S. Manning J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3590-3594Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that the reaction of myeloperoxidase-derived GA with RNase led toN ε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), indicating that CML is formed in GA-modified protein (8Anderson M.M. Requena J.R. Crowley J.R. Thorpe S.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 103-113Google Scholar). However, since CML is also formed by the Maillard reaction pathways, such as oxidative cleavage of Amadori product (12Nagai R. Ikeda K. Higashi T. Sano H. Jinnouchi Y. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 167-172Google Scholar), Schiff base (13Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Google Scholar), and autoxidation of glucose via glyoxal (14Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Google Scholar), CML is not a specific marker for myeloperoxidase-induced protein modification in vivo. Therefore, in order to obtain a specific marker for myeloperoxidase-induced protein modification in vivo, it is requisite to identify a GA-protein adduct(s) other than CML. Demonstration of such a specific marker in atherosclerotic lesions would establish a role for the myeloperoxidase system in chemical modification of proteins during atherogenesis.To this end, we first attempted to prepare monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against GA-modified proteins, which recognized GA-derived structure(s) other than CML. These antibodies did not show any cross-reactivity to BSA modified with AGE-producing aldehydes such as glucose, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and 3-deoxyglucosone, indicating that the epitope of these antibodies could be specific for GA-modified proteins. We then isolated the epitope for these antibodies and determined its chemical structure. This compound, named as GA-pyridine, turned out to be a novel GA-derived structure. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated accumulation of GA-pyridine in the human atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, these results strongly suggest the active participation of GA in the development and progression of human atherosclerotic lesions.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsd-Glucose, fatty acid-free BSA (Fraction V), ovalbumin, GA, and methylglyoxal were purchased from Sigma, and 3-deoxyglucosone and EDTA were purchased from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan).N α-(Carbobenzyloxy)-l-lysine (CBZ-Lys) and N α-(acetyl)-l-lysine (acetyl-Lys) were purchased from Sigma.N α-t-(Butyloxycarbonyl)-histidine (Boc-His) was purchased from Novabiochem.

All other chemicals were of the highest grade available from commercial sources.General ProcedureUV spectra were recorded on a Beckman (Fullerton, CA) model DU 650 spectrometer. 1H (500 MHz), 13C (126 MHz), 1H-detected heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence, 1H-detected multiple bond heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMBC), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectra were measured with a Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany) model ARX-500 spectrometer in D2O. Mass spectra were measured on an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex (Foster City, CA) API3000 mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray (ESI) interface. Lyophilization was performed by model FZ-6PV, LABCONCO (Kansas City, MO).Modification of Proteins and Amino AcidsGlucose-derived AGE-modified BSA was prepared as described previously (15Nagai R. Matsumoto K. Ling X. Suzuki H. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1714-1723Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.0 g of BSA was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 1.6md-glucose, sterilized by ultrafiltration, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 weeks, followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). GA-BSA, methylglyoxal-modified BSA, glyoxal-modified BSA were prepared by incubating BSA (2 mg/ml; 1.5 mm lysine residues) with 33 mm GA, methylglyoxal, or glyoxal, respectively, at 37 °C for 7 days in PBS (pH 7.4) (15Nagai R. Matsumoto K. Ling X. Suzuki H. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1714-1723Google Scholar). GA-BSA was also prepared by incubating BSA (2 mg/ml) with 10 mm GA at 37 °C for up to 24 h. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were quenched by the addition of 100 mml-lysine, followed by dialysis against PBS. 3-Deoxyglucosone-modified BSA was prepared by incubating BSA (2 mg/ml) with a 200 mm concentration of 3-deoxyglucosone at 37 °C for 4 weeks and dialyzed against PBS. HOCl-modified BSA (HOCl-Ser-BSA) was prepared by the reported method (8Anderson M.M. Requena J.R. Crowley J.R. Thorpe S.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 103-113Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, BSA (2 mg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with 10 mm HOCl in the presence of 10 mml-serine in PBS, followed by dialysis against PBS. Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated from fasting normolipidemic human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation and dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) (15Nagai R. Matsumoto K. Ling X. Suzuki H. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1714-1723Google Scholar). GA-modified LDL and ovalbumin were prepared in the same manner. CML-BSA was prepared as described previously (16Reddy S. Bichler J. Wells-Knecht K.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10872-10878Google Scholar). Briefly, 175 mg of BSA was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with 0.15m glyoxylic acid and 0.45 m NaCNBH3in 1 ml of 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), followed by dialysis against PBS. Amino acid analysis revealed that the CML content of CML-BSA was 12.9 mol of CML/mol of BSA. For preparation of GA-modified amino acids, acetyl-Lys, Boc-His, or acetyl-Arg (50 mm each) were incubated at 37 °C for 4 days with 25 mm GA in 10 ml of PBS. As a control, these amino acids were incubated in parallel without GA.AntibodiesThe experimental protocol was approved by the local ethics review committee for animal experimentation. Monoclonal anti-AGE antibody 6D12 was prepared and purified by protein G-immobilized Sepharose gel to IgG1 as described previously (17Horiuchi S. Araki N. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7329-7332Google Scholar). 6D12 is known to be specific for CML-protein adducts (18Ikeda K. Higashi T. Sano H. Jinnouchi Y. Yoshida M. Araki T. Ueda S. Horiuchi S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8075-8083Google Scholar). To prepare monoclonal antibody against GA-modified protein, splenic lymphocytes from a Balb/c mouse immunized with GA-low density lipoprotein were fused to myeloma P3U1 cells. The hybrid cells were screened, and one cell line, termed GA5, positive to GA-BSA but negative to CML-BSA, was selected through successive subcloning. In the same fashion, another cell line, named 1A12, was obtained by immunization with GA-ovalbumin and was positive to GA-BSA but negative to CML-BSA. GA5 and 1A12 were produced from the ascites fluid of Balb/c mice and further purified by protein G-immobilized Sepharose gel to IgG1. To prepare a polyclonal antibody against GA-derived AGE structures other than CML (non-CML-specific), we injected 1.0 mg of GA-BSA in 50% Freund's complete adjuvant intradermally into 20 skin sites in a rabbit, followed by five booster injections with 0.5 mg of GA-BSA in 50% Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Serum obtained 10 days after the final immunization was subjected to further affinity purification. Formyl-cellulofine gels were coupled to BSA, GA-BSA, and CML-BSA, respectively, as described previously (17Horiuchi S. Araki N. Morino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7329-7332Google Scholar). The anti-GA-BSA antiserum (10 ml) was passed over a column (2.0 × 12 cm) of formyl-cellulofine-BSA gel. The nonadsorbed fraction was then passed over a column (1.2 × 9.0 cm) of formyl-cellulofine-GA-BSA gel. The fraction adsorbed to GA-BSA was eluted with 0.1 mcitric acid buffer (pH 3.0). The pooled antibody fraction was neutralized and further applied to a formyl-cellulofine-CML-BSA gel. The nonadsorbed fraction was concentrated and dialyzed against PBS. Since this antibody fraction was expected to be specific for GA-derived AGE structures other than CML, it was termed non-CML-GA.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)ELISAs were performed as described previously (18Ikeda K. Higashi T. Sano H. Jinnouchi Y. Yoshida M. Araki T. Ueda S. Horiuchi S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8075-8083Google Scholar). Briefly, for noncompetitive ELISAs, each well of a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 100 μl of the test sample in PBS, blocked with 0.5% gelatin in PBS, and washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (washing buffer). Wells were incubated with 0.1 ml of the indicated concentration of the primary antibody dissolved in washing buffer for 1 h. The wells were then washed with washing buffer three times and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), followed by reaction with 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. The reaction was terminated by 1.0 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 492 nm was read by a micro-ELISA plate reader. For competitive ELISAs, each well of a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 100 μl of the indicated concentration of antigen in PBS and incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed three times with washing buffer and then blocked with 0.5% gelatin in PBS for 1 h. After triplicate washing with the washing buffer, 50 μl of the test sample was added, and then the same volume of the antibody solution was also added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The antibodies bound to wells were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody.Purification of Epitope Molecule of GA5 (GA5-epitope)Step OneCBZ-Lys (100 mm) was incubated at 100 °C for 5 min with 50 mm GA (GA-CBZ-Lys) in 0.5m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). For preparative HPLC (Hitachi, Tokyo) (LaChrom system, pump, L-7100; fluorescence detector, L-7485; autosampler, L-7200; column oven, L-7300), the reaction mixture of GA-CBZ-Lys was injected (0.1 ml/each) into the reverse phase column (Mightysil RP-18 GP, 250 × 20 mm, Kanto Chemicals Co., Inc., Tokyo), equilibrated in a solution of 2% acetonitrile, and eluted at 2–70% acetonitrile from 0 to 55 min and 70% acetonitrile from 55 to 110 min. Effluents were monitored for fluorescence of λex/em = 326/406 nm and separated into three fractions (Fraction 1, 17–35 min; Fraction 2, 41–61 min; Fraction 3, 64–98 min). All analyses were performed at 40 °C at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. This fractionation was repeated 20 times, and each fraction was lyophilized and reconstituted in 2 ml of H2O, and the aliquot of each fraction (100 μl) was subjected to competitive ELISA by GA5.Step TwoA portion of Fraction 1 (5 mg) obtained from step one was further applied to HPLC (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) (pump, PU-920; detector, UV-970 and FP-970; autosampler, 851-AS; controller, 802-SC; column oven, 860-CO; solvent mixing module, HG-980–31) using a reverse phase column (Inertsil ODS-3V, 250 × 4.6 mm) (GL Science, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with a linear gradient of 10% acetonitrile in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid from 0 to 40 min, 50% acetonitrile in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid from 40 to 50 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 25 °C. Effluents were monitored by both absorbance at 270 nm and fluorescence of λex/em = 326/406 nm and separated into 25 fractions. This fractionation was repeated five times, and each fraction was lyophilized. After dissolving in 500 μl of H2O, an aliquot of each fraction (100 μl) was subjected to competitive ELISA by GA5.Step ThreeThe immunoreactive fractions (Fractions 11–13, 400 μl each) obtained from step two were mixed and reapplied to the same HPLC system but eluted with 27% acetonitrile in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (isocratic A) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 25 °C and separated into eight fractions based on absorbance at 270 nm and fluorescence at λex/em = 326/406 nm. This fractionation was repeated three times, and the combined lyophilized fractions were reconstituted in 1 ml of H2O for determination of immunoreactivity by competitive ELISA.Extensive Purification of GA5-epitope5 g of GA-modified CBZ-Lys (GA-CBZ-Lys) was prepared by incubating 50 mm GA and 100 mm CBZ-Lys at 100 °C for 5 min in 0.5 m phosphate buffer and then subjected to reversed phase medium pressure liquid chromatography using a Develosil LOP-45S column (500 × 45 mm; Nomura Chemical, Japan) and eluted with a 20% acetonitrile in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min at room temperature. Effluents were monitored by absorbance at 270 nm and separated into 200 fractions (15 ml/fraction). Fractions 96–150 contained the same products as observed in Fraction 5 of step three above; these fractions were pooled and evaporated, and the residue (370 mg) was subjected to preparative reverse phase HPLC (Inertsil ODS-3, 250 × 20 mm) and eluted with 27% acetonitrile in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 8 ml/min at 25 °C, and finally the substance identical to Fraction 5 in step three above was isolated by HPLC with a reverse phase column (Inertsil ODS-3V, 250 × 4.6 mm), eluted with 20% acetonitrile in 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 25 °C, and monitored by absorbance at 270 nm. The pooled product was recovered as a colorless syrup (9.9 mg).Deletion of Benzyloxycarbonyl Group from GA5 EpitopeThe benzyloxycarbonyl group of the epitope molecule (9.6 mg) was hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 30% hydrobromic acid/acetic acid at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated and redissolved in 1 ml of 1 m NaOH for hydrolysis of theO-acetyl ester derivative of the product. The reaction mixture was neutralized with 1 n HCl and then separated by HPLC with a reverse phase column (Inertsil ODS-3, 250 × 10.0 mm), eluted with 5% acetonitrile in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min at 25 °C, and monitored by absorbance at 270 nm. The epitope molecule eluted at a retention time of 15.2 min was mixed with 1 ml of 0.1 n HCl and was evaporated to yield a colorless syrup (6.3 mg).Conjugation of GA5 Epitope to BSATo conjugate the purified GA5-epitope with BSA, 1 mg of GA5-epitope or 1 mg of acetyl-Lys as a control was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 0.5 mg of BSA in the presence of 50 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (Pierce) in 0.5 ml of distilled water. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 2 m2-mercaptoethanol and dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 24 h.Tissue PreparationThe study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of Kumamoto University School of Medicine. Samples of atherosclerotic lesions of human aortas were obtained from three autopsy cases within 2–5 h of death (2 males, 1 female; age 65–85 years). Normal aorta was obtained from a fibrosis patient (1 female; age 32). The specimens were composed of grossly normal regions, fatty streaks, atherosclerotic plaques, or complicated lesions. For immunohistochemistry, tissue samples were fixed with a 2% periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde fixative at 4 °C for 6 h and washed with PBS containing a graded series of sucrose (10, 15, and 20%). After immersion in PBS containing 10% glycerol and 20% sucrose for inhibition of ice crystal formation, the tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Fine Technical Co., Tokyo, Japan), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Sections were cut 5 μm thick by a cryostat (HM-500M; Microm, Walldorf, Germany) and mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides.ImmunohistochemistryFor immunohistochemical analysis, cryostat sections were prepared and examined by the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Briefly, after inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity (19Isobe Y. Chen S.T. Nakane P.K. Brown W.R. Acta Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 10: 161-171Google Scholar), the sections were incubated with GA5, washed with PBS, and reacted with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (AmershamBiosciences) diluted 1:100 as the second antibody. After visualization with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Dojin Chemical Co., Kumamoto, Japan), the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with Malinol (Mutoh Chemical Company, Tokyo, Japan). For negative controls, the same procedures were performed, but the first antibody was omitted. Nonimmune mouse IgG1 was also used as a negative control, and the staining results showed no immunoreaction. For the immunoabsorption test, GA5 was preincubated with 1 mg/ml GA-BSA at 37 °C for 1 h and reacted with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse F(ab′)2.Double Immunohistochemical StainingTo examine for possible accumulation of GA-pyridine in macrophages in vivo, double immunohistochemical staining with GA5 and a monoclonal anti-human CD68/macrophage antibody, KP-1 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), was performed according to the method described previously (20Newman I. Wilkinson P.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 147: 43-50Google Scholar). In the first step, frozen sections were stained with GA5. After visualization of peroxidase activity (3,3′-diaminobenzidine used as the substrate produced a brown color), the sections were rinsed with 0.1 mol/liter glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.2) for 2 h to remove the first and second antibodies. In the second step, the sections were incubated overnight with KP-1 and then washed with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6), reacted at room temperature for 30 min with rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (link antibody), and further incubated at room temperature for 30 min with alkaline phosphatase-mouse anti-alkaline phosphatase immune complex (Dako). The antibody bound to the sections was visualized with a substrate solution of 0.2 mm naphthol AS-MX phosphate, 1 mm fast blue BB salt, and 1 mmol/liter levamisole (Sigma) in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7) at room temperature for 10 min to produce a blue color. The negative control staining was performed in the same manner except that the antibodies, GA5 and KP-1, used in the first and second steps, were omitted.DISCUSSIONMyeloperoxidase was detected in foam cells (6Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Google Scholar) and HOCl-modified proteins was also detected in human atherosclerotic lesions (7Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Google Scholar). HOCl is known to generate reactive aldehydes such as acrolein and GA. Furthermore, GA is known to cause protein cross-linking and produce CML. However, acrolein and CML are not specific markers for myeloperoxidase-induced protein modification because they are also generated from lipid peroxidation (10Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Morimitsu Y. Osawa T. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16058-16066Google Scholar, 21Fu M.X. Requena J.R. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9982-9986Google Scholar) and cleavage of Amadori products in the Maillard reaction (12Nagai R. Ikeda K. Higashi T. Sano H. Jinnouchi Y. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 167-172Google Scholar), respectively. Therefore, a specific marker is required to elucidate the contribution of the myeloperoxidase system to protein modification in vivo. The specific question addressed in the present study was whether a GA-derived AGE structure other than CML is also generated in vivo. Our two monoclonal antibodies, GA5 and 1A12, and a polyclonal antibody, non-CML-GA, significantly reacted with GA- and HOCl/Ser-modified BSA, whereas the reactivity of these antibodies to other modified BSAs was below the limit of detection (Fig. 1A). Our analysis successfully identified a new compound from the reaction mixture of GA with CBZ-lysine, and we named it GA-pyridine. Immunochemical analysis revealed that GA-pyridine was recognized not only by GA5 but also by 1A12 and non-CML-GA, indicating that GA-pyridine is a major immunological epitope in proteins modified with GA. Furthermore, our immunohistochemical studies using GA5 showed the presence of GA-pyridine in the cytoplasm of foam cells and extracellularly in the central atheroma of human atherosclerotic core. Specifically, the positive immunoreactivity of this antibody to these human atherosclerotic lesions was significantly reduced by the pretreatment of GA5 with GA-pyridine-conjugated BSA (Fig. 5E) but not with native BSA (Fig. 5F), providing the solid immunological evidence for the presence of GA-pyridinein vivo. These results therefore strongly suggest that myeloperoxidase is involved in the progression of atherosclerosis by promoting protein modification with GA to form GA-pyridine in the vascular wall.Scheme FS1 depicts a likely mechanism for GA-pyridine formation. First, the addition of two molecules of GA to the ε-amino group of lysine and dehydration forms intermediate 1. The further addition of GA to intermediate 1 and subsequent dehydration yields GA-pyridine via intermediates 2 and 3. For CML formation, the addition of one molecule of GA to the ε-amino group of lysine and dehydration forms GA-alkylimine, a Schiff base adduct of the amine with GA. This compound undergoes a rearrangement reaction to form aldoamine, which is then subjected to oxidative conversion to CML (13Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Google Scholar). Alternatively, GA may first be oxidized to glyoxal and then reacted with the ε-amino group of lysine to form CML. Preliminary experiments showed that CML formation during incubation of GA with BSA (Fig. 1C) were increased by the addition of 0.1 mmcopper, whereas the yield of GA-pyridine, as determined by reactivity with GA5, was suppressed by copper (data not shown). Therefore, oxidation is involved in CML formation during protein modification by GA but not in GA-pyridine formation. In other words, it seems likely that whether protein modification by GA proceeds dominantly to GA-pyridine formation or CML formation is determined by whether the reaction environment is oxidative or anti-oxidative.AGE structures so far identified include pyrraline (22Hayase F. Nagaraj R.H. Miyata S. Njoroge F.G. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3758-3764Google Scholar), pentosidine (23Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Google Scholar), CML (24Ahmed M.U. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fusion of endosome-derived vesicles with the late Golgi depends on a cascade of protein-protein interactions that results in the recruitment to Golgi membranes of a conserved docking complex, VFT. This complex binds to Ypt6-GTP, which is necessary for its localization to the Golgi, and also to the SNARE Tlg1p. We show here that the VFT complex contains a fourth, previously uncharacterized, subunit, Vps51p (Ykr020w). Yeast cells lacking VPS51 have defects in vacuole morphology and recycling of the SNARE Snc1p to the plasma membrane, but still assemble a core VFT complex consisting of Vps52p, Vps53p, and Vps54p that localizes properly to the Golgi. Binding to Ypt6-GTP is a property of Vps52p. In contrast, binding to Tlg1p is mediated by a short sequence at the N terminus of Vps51p. Recent evidence suggests that components of a number of rab/ypt effector complexes share a common, distantly related helical coiled-coil motif. We show that each VFT subunit requires this coiled-coil motif for assembly into the complex.

We show that each VFT subunit requires this coiled-coil motif for assembly into the complex. Membrane traffic within eucaryotic cells requires an elaborate machinery to create transport carriers and to dock and fuse them to the correct membrane. Key components are the SNAREs, integral membrane proteins that, by the formation of helix bundles, draw membranes into close apposition (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 2Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Google Scholar, 3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar, 4Hay J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 10-21Google Scholar). Earlier stages in the targeting process are regulated by peripheral membrane proteins, including the rab/ypt GTPases and their effectors, among which are a set of large protein complexes implicated in vesicle docking (5Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Google Scholar, 6Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Google Scholar). Three such complexes, acting at different stages in the secretory pathway, have recently been shown to contain subunits with regions of weak but detectable similarity (for a review, see Ref. 6Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Google Scholar). These were first characterized in yeast, although each has an animal cell homologue. The exocyst, with eight subunits, is involved in the fusion of vesicles with localized regions of the plasma membrane (7Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Google Scholar). The COG 1The abbreviations used are: COG, conserved oligomeric; SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TEV, tobacco etch virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein. complex (conserved oligomeric complex), also with eight subunits, is found on the Golgi apparatus and is thought to mediate return traffic from late to early Golgi compartments, and also perhaps from endosomes to Golgi (8Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Google Scholar, 9Suvorova E.S. Duden R. Lupashin V.V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 631-643Google Scholar). In yeast, only four of the COG subunits are essential for growth, suggesting that the complex may consist of two tetrameric subcomplexes with distinct functions. The third member of this family is the VFT complex (Vps fifty-three, also named GARP), which is found on late Golgi membranes and is required for the recycling of proteins from endosomes to the late Golgi (10Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 305-323Google Scholar, 11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar). It was originally described as a trimeric complex of Vps52p/Sac2p, Vps53p, and Vps54p/Luv1p. Like many subunits of the COG and exocyst complexes, each of these proteins contains a conserved short potential amphipathic helix. In addition, Vps52p shows homology to a domain of the exocyst component Sec3p (8Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Google Scholar). The extent to which these complexes share structural and functional features remains to be determined. VFT is recruited to membranes by Ypt6p (11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar), and COG is an effector of Ypt1p (9Suvorova E.S. Duden R. Lupashin V.V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 631-643Google Scholar). However, while some exocyst components are bound to vesicles via the GTPase Sec4p, others, notably Sec3p, are targeted to the plasma membrane by a separate mechanism that involves Rho1p and Cdc42p (7Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Google Scholar, 12Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Google Scholar, 13Zhang X. Bi E. Novick P. Du L. Kozminski K.G. Lipschutz J.H. Guo W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46745-46750Google Scholar). Both VFT and COG complexes have been reported to bind SNAREs (9Suvorova E.S. Duden R. Lupashin V.V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 631-643Google Scholar, 11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar), but this does not seem to be a feature of the exocyst. Despite some differences, the complexes may well share common features. It has been suggested that each may be based on a tetrameric organization, with the exocyst and COG complexes containing two tetramers (6Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the VFT complex purified from yeast can bind independently to the GTP form of Ypt6p and to the N-terminal domain of the SNARE Tlg1p (11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar). These interactions suggest that VFT functions either to link endosome-derived vesicles containing Tlg1p with Golgi membranes marked by Ypt6p or to activate Tlg1p and associated SNAREs on the Golgi for subsequent complex formation and membrane fusion. To analyze the interactions in more detail, we attempted to map the binding site for Tlg1p and were surprised to find that none of the known VFT subunits, expressed alone, could bind this SNARE. Here we present further characterization of the VFT complex and show that although originally thought to be a trimer, it normally contains a fourth subunit, Vps51p. This subunit bears a short peptide sequence through which it interacts with Tlg1p. We also show that short amphipathic helices found in each of the four VFT components are necessary, although apparently not sufficient, for the assembly of the complex. The yeast strains used in this work are listed in TableI.

Thevps51::HIS3 alleles, carrying 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, were excised and transformed into the SEY6210 strain. To construct a VPS52 truncation mutant lacking its N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a PCR fragment coding for its promoter and four N-terminal residues was ligated with a second PCR fragment coding for residues 123 to 641. Similarly, theVPS53 truncation mutant was constructed by ligation of a PCR fragment coding for its promoter and four N-terminal residues with a second fragment coding for residues 104–801. The VPS54mutant was constructed by ligating a fragment coding the promoter and the 267 N-terminal residues with a second fragment coding for residues 312–889. In all three cases, the last C-terminal residue was followed by the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site and the protein A tag. To delete the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of VPS51, a PCR fragment the 120 N-terminal residues was ligated with a second fragment encoding the protein A tag. All constructs were cloned into the LEU2-based YCplac111 vector. To construct VPS51-PtA or GFP C-terminal fusions, aBamHI site was introduced just before the VPS51stop codon by PCR and a BamHI fragment coding for the TEV protease cleavage site followed by two IgG binding domains fromStaphylococcus aureus protein A or GFP was inserted. In all experiments, VPS51-PtA or GFP fusions were expressed from the VPS51 promoter on centromere vectors. To express recombinant VPS51, VPS52, orVPS53, the full-length genes were cloned in-frame as PCR fragments into the pGEX6P2 vector. To construct the variousVPS51 truncation mutants as GST fusions, PCR fragments encoding residues 1 to 47, 40, 34, 30, or 27 or 121 to 164, were cloned into pGEX6P2. To express the VPS52/53/54 coiled-coil domains as recombinant His6 fusions, the corresponding residues (1–139 for VPS52, 1–110 for VPS53, and 216–382 for VPS54) were cloned as PCR fragments into the pET10a vector. Affinity purification of Vps52p-, Vps54p-, and Vps51p-PtA from yeast extracts was the same as described previously (11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar). TEV protease-dependent elution of PtA fusions was the same as described in Ref. 15Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4885-4894Google Scholar. All Escherichia coli strains expressing recombinant proteins were grown in 2× TY medium (11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar) and induced at 30 °C with 0.2 mm (GST fusions) or 0.5 mm (His6 fusions) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. In vitro binding experiments using GST-Ypt6p, full-length GST-VPS51/52/53, or the various GST-VPS51 fragments were done as described in Ref. 11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar. To test the assembly of the coiled-coil domains of the various VFT subunits, 10-ml cultures of bacterial cells expressing His6-Vps52-(1–139), His6-Vps53-(1–110), and His6-Vps54-(216–382), were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100). Aliquots (0.3 ml) of the three lysates were mixed together with a 0.3-ml aliquot of a lysate from a 10-ml culture of either full-length GST-Vps51, GST-Vps51 (121–164), or GST-expressing bacteria. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 h. After that 30 μl of glutahione-Sepharose beads were added, and the reactions were incubated for a further 30 min. Beads were then washed four times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. The antibody used to detect protein A fusions was from Dako (catalog number Z0113). The anti-Myc polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz (catalog number sc-789), the penta-His horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from Qiagen (catalog number 34460), and the anti-Tlg1p was as described earlier (16Holthuis J.C. Nichols B.J. Dhruvakumar S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 113-126Google Scholar). Protein identification by mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments was performed as described previously (11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar). Eight tryptic peptides were obtained from the Vps51p band in the Vps54p-PtA pull-down (sequence coverage 50%, mean mass error 9.8 ppm). 26 peptides were obtained from the Vps53p band (sequence coverage 36%, mean error 37 ppm) and 15 peptides from Vps54p (sequence coverage 19%, mean error 12 ppm). To search for novel VFT-interacting proteins we expressed either Vps52p or Vps54p tagged with protein A and purified the complex from yeast cells on IgG-Sepharose. Fig. 1shows a Coomassie-stained gel of the eluted proteins. Analysis by mass spectrometry indicated that many of the minor bands were either irrelevant contaminants or breakdown products (data not shown), but one small protein (Ykr020w) was consistently present. As seen in Fig. 1, tagging of Ykr020w with protein A resulted in co-purification of the other VFT components, confirming the interaction (see also below). We recently learned that Ykr020w is identical to the product ofVPS51, a gene identified in the same genetic screen asVPS52, VPS53, and VPS54 (E. Conibear, personal communication cited in Ref. 6Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Google Scholar; Ref. 10Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 305-323Google Scholar). For simplicity, we shall therefore refer to this protein as Vps51p. The gene was also identified in a screen for mutants that affect apical growth and namedAPI3 (17Bidlingmaier S. Snyder M. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 1: 345-356Google Scholar). Furthermore, a very recent systematic survey of deletion mutants with vacuolar protein sorting defects has identified the same gene, which was named VPS67, since at that time its identity with VPS51 was unknown (18Bonangelino C.J. Chavez E.M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2486-2501Google Scholar). These genetic studies indicate that Vps51p, like the other components of the VFT complex, has a role in the sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins, a process that requires recycling of the sorting receptor Vps10p between Golgi and endosomes. Vps52p, Vps53p, and Vps54p, together with Ypt6p and its heterodimeric exchange factor Ric1p-Rgp1p, are also required for efficient recycling of the exocytic SNARE Snc1p from the plasma membrane back via the Golgi and for proper vacuolar morphology (10Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 305-323Google Scholar, 11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar, 15Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4885-4894Google Scholar). We therefore tested these phenotypes for vps51. Fig. 2A shows that the mutant has fragmented vacuoles and accumulates GFP-Snc1p within cells. Thus, Vps51p has functions similar to those of the other VFT subunits. We next examined the localization of a functional GFP-tagged version of Vps51p, expressed from its own promoter in the absence of endogenous Vps51p. Fig. 2B shows that it had a punctate distribution characteristic of Golgi compartments in yeast, consistent with its association with the VFT complex on Golgi membranes. Despite its apparent role as an integral part of the VFT complex, loss of Vps51p had a milder effect on growth than did deletion of any of the other components. Fig. 2C shows that although deletions ofvps51, vps52, and vps54 were all temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C, at lower temperaturesvps51 cells grew much more strongly than vps52 orvps54 cells. This suggests either that a form of the VFT complex lacking a fourth subunit retains some function or that some other protein can substitute for Vps51p (although no obvious homologues exist in the S. cerevisiae genome). That some of the properties of the VFT complex do not depend on Vps51p was borne out by examination of the intracellular distribution of GFP-tagged proteins. We have previously shown that the complex has a punctate Golgi distribution and that this is dependent on Ypt6p, without which the complex is dispersed throughout the cell (11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar). Significantly, GFP-tagged Vps52p, Vps53p, and Vps54p each retain their punctate distribution in a vps51 null strain (Fig. 3A). In contrast, deletion ofVPS52 resulted in complete dispersal of Vps54-GFP (Fig. 3A), and deletion of VPS54 had a similar effect on Vps53-GFP (data not shown). To examine whether a VFT complex could form in the absence of Vps51p, we purified Vps52-protein A from a vps51 deletion strain. Fig. 3B (left lane) shows that Vps53p and Vps54p could still be found associated with Vps52p, but the level of the complex was substantially reduced relative to cells that contain also Vps51p (right lane). We could detect no new protein associated with the VFT complex in the vps51 null strain; because of the low yield of the complex, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of a minor band. We conclude that a trimeric core VFT complex consisting of Vps52p, Vps53p, and Vps54p can form and that this is sufficient for correct targeting to the Golgi, but that for full stability and function of the complex the presence of Vps51p is essential. We have previously shown that the VFT complex, purified from yeast cells, can directly bind to the N-terminal domain of the SNARE Tlg1p and that this interaction can also be detected in cells by cross-linking (11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar). To identify the Tlg1p-binding subunit within the VFT complex, we expressed full-length Vps51p, Vps52p, and Vps53p as GST fusions in E. coli and examined the ability of Tlg1p from cell lysates to bind to these fusions immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Vps54p was not included in this analysis because we were not able to stably express GST-Vps54p. Fig. 4A shows that Tlg1p binds specifically only to Vps51p. Comparison of the sequences of Vps51p homologues from relatedSaccharomyces species (paradoxus,mikatae, and bayanus) available from theSaccharomyces Genome Data base reveals regions at the N and C terminus in which 90% of the residues are identical in all these species, in contrast to the central portion of the proteins which is much more divergent. In addition, the last 40 residues have the potential to form an amphipathic coiled-coil (Fig. 5A). Like a number of other SNAREs, the N-terminal domain of Tlg1p is predicted to form a three-helix bundle (19Misura K.M. Bock J.B. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9184-9189Google Scholar), and thus one possible mode of binding would be for a helix from Vps51p to pack against this bundle. To map the domain responsible for binding, we expressed various portions of Vps51p as GST fusions and checked binding as for the full-length protein. As shown in Fig. 4B, the Tlg1p binding site mapped not to the C-terminal coiled-coil, but to the N terminus of Vps51p. More detailed mapping showed that residues 1–30, which are highly conserved, bound to Tlg1p as efficiently as did the full-length protein. In contrast, residues 1–27 were not sufficient for binding. Residues 15–30 are predicted to be helical, and if helical the whole region would have an amphipathic character (Fig. 4B). Binding of such a structure to Tlg1p might be sufficient to alter the conformation, and hence activity, of this SNARE (see “Discussion”). One intriguing recent finding is that a number of tethering complexes, including VFT, may be structurally related to each other (8Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Google Scholar). All VFT subunits contain short regions predicted to form amphipathic helices or coiled coils (see Fig. 5, A andB). The Vps53p and Vps54p N-terminal helices exhibit distant homology with similar domains found in components of the Sec34/35 complex and the exocyst. Furthermore, the Vps52p coiled-coil is related to that of the exocyst component Sec3p. The function of these short helices is not understood. Since coiled-coils tend to assemble with each other, and each VFT subunit contains such a domain, one possibility is that they form a four-helix bundle that is required for complex assembly. Alternatively, these coiled-coil domains might interact with other proteins involved in membrane docking and fusion, such as Rabs/Ypts or SNAREs. To address these questions we performed a systematic deletion of the coiled-coil domains found in the four VFT subunits (Fig. 5, A and C). We did not include in this analysis the second predicted coiled-coil found in the middle of Vps53p, because the amphipathic nature of this region is not conserved in related yeast species and also because, unlike the other helical domains, we were unable to express it in bacteria. The short coiled-coil domains within the different VFT subunits are evidently important for function because their removal abolished the ability of Vps51p, Vps52p, Vps53p, and Vps54p to complement the growth of the respective null mutants at 37 °C (data not shown). The truncated proteins did, however, accumulate to the same levels in cells as the full-length proteins and thus were unlikely to be grossly misfolded, since this usually leads to rapid degradation (Fig. 5C). 2S. Siniossoglou and H. R. B. Pelham, unpublished data. We next tested the ability of the protein A-tagged full-length and truncated Vps51p, Vps52p, and Vps53p to co-precipitate Myc-tagged Vps54p or of protein A-tagged full-length and truncated Vps54p to co-precipitate Myc-tagged Vps53p. As shown in Fig. 5C, in each case removal of the coiled-coil domain from a subunit prevented its association with the VFT complex. In the case of Vps52p, the deletion also removed a short region on the N-terminal side of the coiled-coil, but deletion of this alone (residues 2–50) did not affect complex formation (data not shown). We conclude that the coiled-coil motifs are essential for assembly into the VFT complex. Since coiled-coils tend to assemble with each other, we then examined whether the isolated VFT coiled-coils would bind to each other and form a four helix bundle, similar to the one formed by SNARE helices. For this purpose, the predicted coiled-coil regions from Vps52p (residues 1–139), Vps53p (residues 1–110), and Vps54p (residues 216–382), expressed as His6 fusions, were incubated with either the Vps51p coiled-coil domain (residues 121–164), expressed as a GST fusion or GST alone. No association of the helical domains could be detected when the GST proteins were pulled down on glutathione beads, indicating that at least under these conditions spontaneous assembly of the four helices did not occur (Fig. 5D). Overall, these data show that the coiled-coil domains mediate interactions that are necessary for the assembly and function of the VFT complex in vivo. However, it seems that interactions outside the helical regions are also required for the formation of a tetrameric structure. An important interaction of the VFT complex is with Ypt6p in its GTP-bound form on Golgi membranes (11Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Google Scholar). Since Golgi targeting of the complex occurs in the absence of Vps51p, the Ypt6p interaction must involve one of the other subunits. To identify which one, we expressed protein A-tagged versions of Vps52p in a vps53 mutant and Vps53p and Vps54p in a vps52mutant. The absence of an essential VFT subunit in each case ensured that assembly of the complex could not occur, thus allowing the binding properties of the single proteins to be assessed. Cell extracts were then incubated with beads containing GST-Ypt6p. As shown in Fig. 6, Vps52p had the ability to bind to Ypt6p and retained a preference for the GTP form, whereas the other subunits showed only background binding. This confirms our previous conclusion that binding to Tlg1p and Ypt6p are independent properties of the complex, now revealed to be mediated by different subunits, Vps51p and Vps52p. We have shown that the VFT complex is normally not trimeric but tetrameric. The fourth subunit previously escaped attention, probably because of its small size and the fact that it lacks internal methionine or cysteine residues and thus cannot be labeled with35S. This subunit, Vps51p, is unusual in that it is not absolutely required for assembly, localization, or even partial function of the VFT complex. Also, unlike the other subunits it is poorly conserved. Homologues can be found in closely related yeasts (20Souciet J. Aigle M. Artiguenave F. Blandin G. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Bon E. Brottier P. Casaregola S. de Montigny J. Dujon B. Durrens P. Gaillardin C. Lepingle A. Llorente B. Malpertuy A. Neuveglise C. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Potier S. Saurin W. Tekaia F. Toffano-Nioche C. Wesolowski-Louvel M. Wincker P. Weissenbach J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 3-12Google Scholar), but divergence is considerable, and we have been unable to identify any homologue in higher eucaryotes. Like the other subunits, Vps51p contains a coiled-coil motif. We have shown that each subunit requires its coiled-coil domain for assembly into the VFT complex, but that a Vps52/53/54p complex can form, albeit inefficiently, in the absence of Vps51p. Although indirect effects on the structures of the proteins cannot be ruled out, the simplest explanation is that the complex is stabilized by the formation of a four-helix bundle or in the absence of Vps51p a three-helix bundle. Since similar coiled-coil motifs are a feature of the COG and exocyst components, this may be a general feature of these complexes. The coiled-coil motifs invite comparison with the SNAREs, which also form four-helix bundles. However, the isolated helical domains of the VFT components did not form bundles when tested under conditions in which SNAREs readily do so (21Tsui M.M. Tai W.C. Banfield D.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 521-538Google Scholar). There are also other significant differences. Whereas the coiled-coil “SNARE motif” is the most strongly conserved part of these molecules and easily recognizable, reflecting formation of stable bundles recognized by a universal dissociation machinery, the coiled-coils in the VFT complex are no more conserved than the rest of the proteins and seem to vary in length and exact position in different species. Furthermore, although some weak similarity between the subunits can be seen (Fig. 5B), its significance is unclear, and alignment of these yeast proteins with the mammalian COG and exocyst coiled-coil consensus is difficult. Thus, there may be additional interactions that drive assembly of these complexes, the coils adding a relatively nonspecific stabilizing influence. Indeed, we noticed that while complete removal of one subunit results in reduced yield of the others (10Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 305-323Google Scholar), removal of the coiled-coil from any one protein did not significantly destabilize either it or other components of the complex (Fig. 5C), perhaps because weak interactions between the proteins are still possible. SNAREs undergo reversible assembly, and there is also evidence that the exocyst is assembled during the process of vesicle docking (7Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Google Scholar). Similarly, one could imagine that Vps51p binds to Tlg1p on vesicles, while the remaining VFT subunits are recruited to the Golgi membrane via the Ypt6p binding site of Vps52p and that docking is mediated by VFT assembly. We have not, however, been able to find circumstances under which the complex dissociates in vivo or under physiological conditions in vitro. Furthermore, the fact that vps51 mutants have a less severe growth phenotype than other VFT mutants implies that the complex has at least some activity that does not involve Vps51p. Perhaps the most striking feature of Vps51p is its ability to bind, via a short N-terminal peptide, to the N-terminal domain of Tlg1p. Loss of this interaction may account for the observation that vps51cells have severe trafficking defects even though they can still assemble and localize a core VFT complex. The N-terminal domain of Tlg1p is predicted to have a three-helix structure like that of syntaxin and thus might, as with the neuronal syntaxin 1a and yeast Sso1p, bind to and sequester the C-terminal SNARE motif (22Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Google Scholar, 23Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Google Scholar). In such a scenario the N terminus of Vps51p, which also has the potential to form an amphipathic helix, could compete for the same binding site as the SNARE motif and hence release this motif for interaction with other SNAREs. It has also been shown that interaction of a preformed complex of Tlg1p, Tlg2p, and Vti1p with Snc1p is markedly stimulated by peptides corresponding to the C-terminal portion of Snc1p (24Paumet F. Brugger B. Parlati F. McNew J.A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 961-968Google Scholar), an effect that has been ascribed to subtle conformational changes in the SNARE helices (25Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 929-940Google Scholar). Further studies may reveal whether the N-terminal peptide of Vps51p has any effect on the assembly of Tlg1p-containing SNARE complexes and thus whether the VFT complex can directly modulate SNARE activity.

To approach the functional analysis, in particular the involvement in CO/CN ligand synthesis, HypF was purified from an overproducing strain to apparent homogeneity. The purified protein behaves as a monomer on size exclusion chromatography, and it is devoid of nickel or other cofactors. As indicated by the existence of a sequence motif also present in several O-carbamoyltransferases, HypF interacts with carbamoyl phosphate as a substrate and releases inorganic phosphate. In addition, HypF also possesses ATP cleavage activity that gives rise to AMP and pyrophosphate as products and that is dependent on the presence of carbamoyl phosphate. This and the fact that HypF catalyzes a carbamoyl phosphate-dependent pyrophosphate ATP exchange reaction suggest that the protein catalyzes activation of carbamoyl phosphate. Extensive mutagenesis of the putative functional motifs deduced from the derived amino acid sequence showed a full correlation of the resulting variants between their activity in hydrogenase maturation and the in vitro reactivity with carbamoyl phosphate. The results are discussed in terms of the involvement of HypF in the conversion of carbamoyl phosphate to the CN ligand.

Hydrogen metabolism in enterobacteria involves the activity of the products of three functional classes of genes that code for structural proteins, regulatory proteins, or for proteins involved in metal center biosynthesis and enzyme maturation. In Escherichia coli, the structural genes are organized in four operons, responsible for the formation of hydrogenase 1 (hya operon), hydrogenase 2 (hyb operon), hydrogenase 3 (hyc operon), and the putative hydrogenase 4 (hyf operon). Each operon contains the genes for the large and small hydrogenase subunit, for redox carriers, membrane anchor proteins plus components required for the maturation of the hydrogenase encoded by that specific operon, like the endopeptidase involved in proteolytic processing of the large subunit (for review see Refs. 1Maier T.

FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 455-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the hydrogenases in E. coli serve different physiological functions, the expression of these operons is differentially regulated. Hydrogenase 3, for example, which is a component of the formate hydrogen lyase system, is synthesized under fermentative conditions. Its formation requires the activity of the transcriptional activator FhlA and formate as inducer (3Böck A. Sawers G. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 262-282Google Scholar). Considerable efforts have been directed to understand the incorporation of the [NiFe] metal center into the large hydrogenase subunit. A scenario is emerging indicating that iron and nickel insertion proceeds separately, whereby the incorporation of iron together with its CO and CN ligands precedes that of nickel (1Maier T. Böck A. Hausinger R.P. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Mechanisms of Metallocenter Assembly. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 173-192Google Scholar, 4Maier T. Böck A.

Biol. 1999; 288: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The function of the HypA and HypB proteins has been related to nickel insertion becausehypA and hypB mutations can be phenotypically complemented by inclusion of high nickel concentrations in the medium (6Waugh R. Boxer D.H. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Hube M. Blokesch M. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3879-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and because the HypB protein binds nickel (8Olson J.W. Fu C. Maier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HypC, which is a small acidic protein, forms a complex with the precursor of the large hydrogenase subunit and, accordingly, has been postulated to play the function of a specific chaperone, maintaining a folding state to render the large subunit amenable for metal acquisition (9Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Magalon A. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21114-21120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The most detailed information for all maturation proteins is available for the endopeptidase which cleaves the C-terminal extension from the precursor of the large subunit once nickel has been inserted (5Fritsche E. Paschos A. Beisel H.G. Böck A. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Rossmann R. Maier T. Lottspeich F. Böck A. Eur. J.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is thought that the endopeptidase controls the fidelity of nickel insertion (13Magalon A. Blokesch M. Zehelein E. Böck A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and also, by cleavage, induces the conformational shift required to thread the finished metal center into the interior of the large subunit (1Maier T. Böck A. Hausinger R.P. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Mechanisms of Metallocenter Assembly. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 173-192Google Scholar, 5Fritsche E. Paschos A. Beisel H.G. Böck A.

Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). An intriguing issue of [NiFe] center synthesis concerns the source and the pathway of biosynthesis of the CO and CN ligands. Circumstantial evidence indicates that the HypD, HypF, and HypE proteins are involved in this process. HypD is an Fe/S protein with unusual spectroscopy properties, 1N. Drapal, S. P. P. Albracht, and A. Böck, unpublished results.1N. Drapal, S. P. P. Albracht, and A. Böck, unpublished results. and HypF and HypE display sequence signatures that implicate functions in organic synthesis. HypF, for example, has been reported to carry a sequence motif characteristic of acyl phosphatases (15Wolf I. Buhrke T. Dernedde J. Pohlmann A. Friedrich B. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and HypE shares motifs that are also found in aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase and thiamin-phosphate kinase (16Li C.

Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London2001: 57-72Google Scholar). An important discovery in this connection was the finding that maturation of [NiFe] hydrogenases requires the availability of carbamoyl phosphate (CP). 2The abbreviations used are: CP, carbamoyl phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol2The abbreviations used are: CP, carbamoyl phosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol A mutant of E. coli lacking CP synthetase (carABgenes) activity was unable to synthesize active hydrogenases 1–3. The deficiency was shown to be caused by a blockade of the maturation process (18Paschos A. Glass R.S. Böck A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Citrulline in the medium was able to complement the lesion of the carAB mutant indicating that the carbamoyl moiety was crucial. It was postulated that CP is the precursor of either CO or CN or of both of them (18Paschos A. Glass R.S. Böck A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present communication we show that the HypF protein recognizes CP as a substrate. A detailed mutational analysis of conserved sequence traits was performed, and it is shown that abolition of HypF function in the maturation process is fully correlated with its ability to interact with CP as a substrate. It is further shown that HypF cleaves ATP into AMP and pyrophosphate in the presence of CP. Strain MC4100 (19Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4530-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) from E. coli was used as wild type, and strains JM109 (20Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) and DH5α (21Woodcock D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3469-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) served as hosts for transformations. DHP-F (22Maier T. Binder U. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and DHP-F2 are derivatives of MC4100 with different deletions in the hypF gene; DHP-F lacks the segment of the gene reaching from amino acids 289 to 629, and DHP-F2 lacks the region from amino acids 59 to 629. DHP-F thus forms a shortened version of HypF that is detectable by anti-HypF antibodies in immunoblotting experiments of crude extracts, whereas no immunologically reacting material can be found in extracts from DHP-F2. The plasmids employed in this work are listed in TableI, together with their genotype and source or derivation. Maintenance of plasmids in the transformants was selected for by inclusion of the appropriate antibiotics into the medium, ampicillin at 150 μg/ml and chloramphenicol at 30 μg/ml. If not indicated otherwise, bacteria were grown aerobically in LB medium (23Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 439Google Scholar) or anaerobically in TGYEP medium (24Begg Y.A. Whyte J.N. Haddock B.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1977; 2: 47-50Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Aerobic cultures were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks under rigorous rotatory shaking, and anaerobic growth took place in bottles filled with the medium to the top. Growth temperature was 37 °C throughout.Table IPlasmids usedPlasmidsGenotypeRef.pACYC184CmR, TcR38Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J.

For this purpose, a 2.6-kbEcoRI-BamHI fragment from plasmid pTF5 (22Maier T. Binder U. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was inserted into plasmid pUC18 linearized by digestion with the same endonucleases. pUCF18, therefore, carries a hypF gene whose expression is under the control of the lac promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of the hypF gene was performed via inverse PCR using primers that carried the desired mutation (25Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1998; 120: 621-623Crossref Google Scholar). Alternatively, mutations were introduced with the aid of overlapping primers according to Ansaldi et al. (26Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Mejean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In each instance, plasmid pAF1 (22Maier T. Binder U. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was used as template, and the Expand High Fidelity PCR System from Roche Biochemicals (Penzberg, Germany) was employed. The amplified segment was phosphorylated, religated, and transferred into host DH5α via electroporation. Amplified fragments generated with the use of overlapping primers (26Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Mejean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were purified by passage over a QIAquick Spin column (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and directly used to transform strain DH5α. The authenticity of the mutanthypF gene versions was verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISMTM 310 sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Cultures of strain JM109 transformed with plasmid pUCF18 were grown in 300 ml of LB medium in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. After reaching anA 600 of 1.0, expression of hypF was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 1 mm final concentration. The cells were harvested after 3 h by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, and sedimented again. The washed cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT (1% of the cultivation volume), and the suspension was brought to 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and DNase I each. The cells were broken by passage through a French press cell at 118 MPa, and the homogenate was clarified first by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min (S10 supernatant) and subsequently for 2 h at 100,000 × g (S100). The S100 fraction was adjusted to a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml and brought to an ammonium sulfate saturation of 35% by the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 followed by stirring at 0 °C for 30 min. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation (30 min at 15,000 × g), dissolved in a minimum of buffer (10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mmDTT), and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialysate was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) column (1 ml) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT. Elution was with a gradient from 0 to 1 m sodium chloride at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. Fractions (1.5 ml) were monitored for presence of HypF by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue. HypF-containing fractions were combined and subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation at 50% saturation, and the precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation. The sediment was dissolved in a small volume of Tris/Cl (10 mm, pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT containing ammonium sulfate at 20% saturation and applied to a 1-ml phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a decreasing linear gradient from 20 to 0% ammonium sulfate at a flow rate of 30 ml per min. The elution of the HypF protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing HypF were combined, and the protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration with the aid of the MICROSEPTM-Microconcentration system (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Dreieich, Germany). The final purification step consisted of a gel filtration over a 300-ml Superdex XK 26/60 (Amersham Biosciences) column. It was developed with 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm DTT at a flow rate of 0.5 ml per min. 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed for HypF content by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing HypF of apparent homogeneity were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol (v/v) and stored at −20 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and non-denaturing PAGE as described by Drapal and Böck (9Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Immunological detection of HypF in polyacrylamide gels after electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes was achieved with anti-HypF antibodies in a 1:1000 dilution and the use of the Lumi-Light Western blotting Substrate (Roche Diagnostics). Antibodies directed against HypF were generated by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). CP phosphatase activity was followed via the liberation of inorganic phosphate, determined according to Heinonen and Lahti (28Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Cell extracts or purified HypF proteins were incubated in 1-ml reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, and the CP concentration indicated at 30 °C. At intervals of 15 min, 200-μl samples were taken, mixed with 40 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 ×g. 200 μl of the supernatant were used for the colorimetric determination of phosphate. To account for the chemical instability of CP, parallel samples were incubated without HypF protein, and the values obtained were subtracted to correct for chemical hydrolysis. Analysis of CP phosphatase activity in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels was carried out as described by Mizuno et al. (29Mizuno Y. Ohba Y. Fujita H. Kanesaka Y. Tamura T. Shiokawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). ATP cleavage by HypF was measured in 1-ml reaction volumes containing 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 25 nm HypF, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin per ml, and [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity of 16.1 μCi/μmol) and carbamoyl phosphate at the indicated concentrations. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 100-μl samples were taken at the given intervals, mixed with 300 μl of perchloric acid-washed charcoal suspension for 1 min, and centrifuged. The radioactivity of 200-μl supernatant samples was determined in the scintillation counter. For control, samples without HypF protein or CP were analyzed. They were devoid of ATP cleavage activity. PPi-ATP exchange activity catalyzed by HypF was determined in 1-ml assays containing 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm[32P]PPi (specific radioactivity 25 μCi/μmol), carbamoyl phosphate at the indicated concentrations, and 62.5 nm HypF protein. After 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 min of incubation at 37 °C, 100-μl samples were mixed with 25 μl of HClO4 (30%), and the mixture was combined with 30 μl of acid-washed charcoal (12% suspension in water). After 5 min, 100 μl of 1% cold sodium pyrophosphate solution in 14% HClO4 was added, followed by incubation for 10 min with mixing and collection of the charcoal on Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. The filters were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold 1% sodium pyrophosphate in 14% HClO4, once with 5 ml of ice-cold 1% sodium pyrophosphate in 1.4% HClO4, once with 5 ml of ice-cold distilled water, and dried. Their radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Homology searches were conducted with the aid of the NCBI data base of the National Institutes of Health and the ERGO data base of Integrated Genomics Inc. (Chicago, IL). DNA sequence analyses were performed with the GENEWORKS 2.5 program (Intelligenetics Inc., Geel, Belgium) or the Gene Tool Lite 1.D (Bio Tools Inc., Edmonton, Canada). Protein sequence alignments were calculated with either GENEWORKS 2.5 (or with MEGALIGN (DNAstar Inc., Madison, WI). The computer-based alignments were checked and amended “by hand” if appropriate. Enzymes for restriction and modification of DNA were purchased from one of the following companies: MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany), New England Biolabs (Frankfurt am Main, Germany), Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Eurogentec (Köln, Germany). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany) and Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). Acetyl phosphate and other phosphorylated compounds were obtained from Sigma. Carbamoyl phosphate was used as the di-lithium salt and had a purity of 90–95%. It was purchased from Sigma or from ICN Biomedical Inc. (Eschwege, Germany). [α-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and labeled inorganic pyrophosphate were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A schematic representation of sequence motifs strongly conserved in HypF homologs from bacteria and archaea is given in Fig.1. The most intriguing characteristic is the existence of two perfect apparent “zinc finger” motifs from amino acid positions 109–184 (30Yamamoto T. Tomiyama M. Mita H. Sode K. Karube I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 66: 187-192Crossref Google Scholar). They have been implicated in the binding of some bivalent cation, but experimental studies on such a function are lacking thus far. On the N-terminal side of these motifs a putative acyl phosphatase motif ranging from position 13–23 was discovered (15Wolf I. Buhrke T. Dernedde J. Pohlmann A. Friedrich B. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but biochemical results demonstrating such an activity and its role in hydrogenase maturation are not available yet. Finally, in the C-terminal one-third of the protein there is a conserved sequence segment containing three histidine residues in a characteristic pattern. A data base search delivered best hits for enzymes with an O-carbamoylation activity in the synthesis of antibiotics or nodulation factors (see Fig. 1, top). Proteins possessing a similar motif, however, are also present in organisms like Pyrococcus horikoshii (31Kawarabayasi Y. Sawada M. Horikawa H. Haikawa Y. Hino Y. Yamamoto S. Sekine M. Baba S. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Nagai Y. Sakai M. Ogura K. Otsuka R. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Ohfuku Y. Funahashi T. Tanaka T. Kudoh Y. Yamazaki J. Kushida N. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Kikuchi H. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) orSulfolobus tokodaii (32Kawarabayasi Y. Hino Y. Horikawa H. Jin-No K. Takahashi M. Sekine M. Baba S. Ankai A. Kosugi H. Hosoyama A. Fukui S. Nagai Y. Nishijima K. Otsuka R. Nakazawa H. Takamiya M. Kato Y. Yoshizawa T. Tanaka T. Kudoh Y. Yamazaki J. Kushida N. Oguchi A. Aoki K. Masuda S. Yanagii M. Nishimura M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kikuchi H. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which are not known to synthesize antibiotics or nodulation factors. The existence of this motif had prompted us to investigate whether CP is required for maturation of hydrogenases. Indeed, a mutant of E. coli devoid of CP synthetase activity was unable to develop active hydrogenases (18Paschos A. Glass R.S. Böck A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The hypF gene on plasmid pUCF18 was overexpressed in strain JM109, and purified HypF was isolated from crude extracts by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Mono-Q HR anion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 residue, and gel filtration over a Superose XK 26/60 column, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The path of purification is displayed by Fig.2 A which presents a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel in which the pooled fractions of each purification step were separated. Characteristically, from 142 mg of protein of a crude 30,000 × g supernatant 9 mg of apparently purified HypF protein were obtained. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the purified protein, taken between 200 and 500 nm, did not indicate the presence of any cofactor absorbing in this range (data not shown). Size exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Superdex 200 column showed that HypF eluted at a position characteristic of a molecular mass of about 80 kDa that corresponds with the size retrieved from the migration in SDS gels and that delineated from the gene sequence, namely 81.9 kDa. Therefore, HypF as purified appears to be a monomeric protein. Analysis of purified HypF by atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy revealed that the protein (dialyzed against buffer lacking chelators) does not contain nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, or molybdenum. However, the protein contained 1 iron atom per 7.8 HypF and 1 zinc atom per 2.5 HypF molecules. The substoichiometric ratio of the two metals may indicate that they are bound non-specifically. However, this needs further experimental analysis. HypF shares a sequence signature motif withO-carbamoyltransferases, and it was tested to determine whether the protein purified can interact with CP. The liberation of inorganic phosphate was taken as a measure. TableII shows that HypF cleaves carbamoyl phosphate rather specifically; other acylphosphates or phosphoesters are only marginally hydrolyzed. The kinetics of CP cleavage by HypF were determined by assaying the hydrolysis rate at different substrate concentrations (Fig. 3). The liberation of phosphate followed Michaelis-Menten-type saturation kinetics. In several experiments K m values ranging from 260 to 330 μm were obtained.Table IILiberation by HypF protein of inorganic phosphate from acylphosphates and phosphoestersSubstrate2-a2.5 mm final concentration each.Phosphatase activitypmol Pi × pmol HypF−1 × s−1Phosphoenolpyruvate<0.01Creatine phosphate<0.01Acetyl phosphate<0.01Glycerol 2-phosphate<0.01Carbamoyl phosphate6.72-a 2.5 mm final concentration each. Open table in a new tab Next it was tested whether the CP phosphatase activity exhibited by purified HypF was also present in a freshly prepared crude extract. Cells of a mutant of E. coli (DHP-F) carrying a deletion in the chromosomal hypF gene were transformed either with plasmid pAF1 carrying hypF or with the vector. Extracts were prepared, and samples from S30 extracts were loaded on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were analyzed for CP phosphatase activity (Fig. 2 B). Enzyme activity developed specifically in the extract of the transformant carrying hypF on a plasmid, and it migrated in a position where the major band of the purified HypF was detected. Therefore, CP hydrolysis in the crude extract is catalyzed by the hypF gene product, and the purified HypF protein exhibits the same activity. The primary structure of HypF also contains a sequence motif (GXGXXGA) that resembles the “glycine-rich loop” motif of a family of ATP-binding proteins (GXGXXG(R/K)) (33Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Its presence prompted the investigation whether HypF possesses ATP cleavage activity. [α-32P]ATP was therefore incubated with HypF protein, and the samples were applied to polyethyleneimine thin layer plates and separated with a solvent of 0.5 mKH2PO4 (pH 3.4). Hydrolysis of ATP with the liberation of AMP could be observed but only when CP was included in the reaction mixture. In its absence, no significant ATP hydrolysis took place (data not shown). To characterize the CP-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the HypF protein, initial reaction velocities were followed at different ATP concentrations keeping CP constant at 100 μm and also at varying CP concentrations in the presence of 100 μm ATP. Fig. 4 shows that the reaction follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with both substrates. The kinetic constants of HypF in the CP p"
https://openalex.org/W2150667140,"The acrosome reaction is a unique type of regulated exocytosis. The single secretory granule of the sperm fuses at multiple points with the overlying plasma membrane. In the past few years we have characterized several aspects of this process using streptolysin O-permeabilized human spermatozoa. Here we show that Rab3A triggers acrosomal exocytosis in the virtual absence of calcium in the cytosolic compartment. Interestingly, exocytosis is blocked when calcium is depleted from intracellular stores. By using a membrane-permeant fluorescent calcium probe, we observed that the acrosome actually behaves as a calcium store. Depleting calcium from this compartment by using a light-sensitive chelator prevents secretion promoted by Rab3A. UV inactivation of the chelator restores exocytosis. Rab3A-triggered exocytosis is blocked by calcium pump and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive calcium channel inhibitors. Calcium measurements inside and outside the acrosome showed that Rab3A promotes a calcium efflux from the granule. Interestingly, release of calcium through IP3-sensitive calcium channels was necessary even when exocytosis was initiated by increasing free calcium in the extraacrosomal compartment in both permeabilized and intact spermatozoa. Our results show that a calcium efflux from the acrosome through IP3-sensitive channels is necessary downstream Rab3A activation during the membrane fusion process leading to acrosomal exocytosis. The acrosome reaction is a unique type of regulated exocytosis. The single secretory granule of the sperm fuses at multiple points with the overlying plasma membrane. In the past few years we have characterized several aspects of this process using streptolysin O-permeabilized human spermatozoa. Here we show that Rab3A triggers acrosomal exocytosis in the virtual absence of calcium in the cytosolic compartment. Interestingly, exocytosis is blocked when calcium is depleted from intracellular stores.

Our results show that a calcium efflux from the acrosome through IP3-sensitive channels is necessary downstream Rab3A activation during the membrane fusion process leading to acrosomal exocytosis. The acrosome reaction is an exocytotic process induced physiologically by the activation of sperm receptors by ligands in the zona pellucida of the oocyte. This interaction initiates a complex transduction mechanism leading to multiple fusions between the outer acrosomal membrane and the overlying plasmalemma resulting in the release of the acrosomal content and exposure of the molecules present on the inner acrosomal membrane. As in other regulated secretory events, calcium plays a central role in acrosome reaction (1Darszon A. Beltran C. Felix R. Nishigaki T. Trevino C.L. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recent results from different laboratories suggest that a first transient cytosolic calcium increase (probably mediated by T-type calcium channels (2Jagannathan S. Punt E.L. Gu Y. Arnoult C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8449-8456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)) leads to a second sustained increase of cytosolic calcium that is necessary for the acrosome reaction (3Meizel S.

Reprod. 2001; 7: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the connection between the two events is not completely clear, the current hypothesis is that the first calcium increase causes the activation of a phospholipase C (PLC). 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; SOC, store-operated calcium; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate; SLO, streptolysin O; GMP gamete preparation medium, CPA, cyclopiazonic acid; AM, acetoxymethyl ester There are several isoforms of PLC in the spermatozoa (10Tomes C.N. McMaster C.R. Saling P.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 43: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PLCδ4, in particular, has been implicated in the early events of the acrosome reaction (12Fukami K. Nakao K. Inoue T.

Active PLC would produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) that would open IP3-sensitive calcium channels in the membrane of intracellular stores. The emptying of these stores would trigger the opening of store-operated calcium (SOC) channels in the plasma membrane causing a second and sustained calcium increase that would trigger acrosomal exocytosis (1Darszon A. Beltran C. Felix R. Nishigaki T. Trevino C.L. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Jungnickel M.K. Marrero H. Birnbaumer L. Lemos J.R. Florman H.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although direct proof for the nature of the calcium stores involved in this mechanism is lacking, several lines of evidence point to the acrosome. This secretory granule possesses a calcium pump (9Rossato M. Di Virgilio F. Rizzuto R. Galeazzi C. Foresta C. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and IP3-sensitive calcium channels (5Dragileva E. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1226-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Trevino C.L. Santi C.M. Beltran C. Hernandez-Cruz A. Darszon A. Lomeli H. Zygote. 1998; 6: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A rise in cytoplasmic calcium levels triggers exocytosis in most cell types, including neurotransmitter and hormone-secreting cells (14Gerber S.H. Sudhof T.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S3-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several calcium-binding proteins have been implicated in the membrane fusion mechanism underlying exocytosis. These include the synaptotagmins, a family of transmembrane proteins that have been postulated to be the calcium sensors responsible for triggering exocytosis (15Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The calcium binding domains of synaptotagmins interact with members of the SNARE complex (16Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). SNAREs are key proteins involved in the docking of membranes that are going to fuse (17Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Another family of proteins involved in membrane fusion are the Rabs, small GTPases that upon activation by exchanging GDP for GTP, cause the formation of large aggregates of proteins that contribute bringing together the membranes participating in fusion (18Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In most membrane fusion events, both Rab-mediated tethering and SNARE-dependent docking are necessary steps for fusion to proceed. In previous reports, we have shown that calcium can trigger acrosomal exocytosis in streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized human sperm cells (19Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The same effect can be obtained by adding GTP-bound Rab3A, a member of the Rab family present in acrosomal membranes (19Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Ward C.R. Faundes D. Foster J.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 53: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Iida H.

S. A. 2000; 97: 9996-10001Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the acrosome is a calcium store and that a calcium efflux from this compartment through IP3-sensitive channels is a necessary event for Rab3A-triggered acrosomal exocytosis. The results indicate that acrosomal calcium is important not only for opening SOC channels but also for a later step related to the membrane fusion process leading to acrosomal exocytosis. Fura2, EGTA-AM, O-nitrophenyl EGTA-AM (EGTA-NP), BAPTA, BAPTA-AM, caged Br-A23187, and calcium sponge S were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fluo3-AM, xestospongin C, cyclopiazonic acid and 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2-APB) were fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA). SLO was obtained from Murex (Dartford, UK). Gamete preparation medium (GPM, Serono, Madrid, Spain) was used as culture medium. All other reagents were from Sigma or from ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Plasmids encoding human Rab3A and the light chain of botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) were generously provided by Dr. P. D. Stahl (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and Dr. T. Binz (Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany), respectively. Human semen samples were obtained from normal healthy donors. Highly motile sperm were recovered following swim-up separation for 1 h in GPM at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Cell concentration was then adjusted to 5–10 × 106/ml, and incubation proceeded for at least 2 h under conditions that support capacitation (GPM, 37 °C, 5% CO2/95% air). In some experiments, spermatozoa without further treatment were used to study thapsigargin-induced acrosome reaction. In other experiments, sperm were permeabilized as described (19Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 20 mmHepes-K, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7 (SB). Acrosomal status was evaluated by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupledPisum sativum as described (23Mendoza C. Carreras A. Moos J. Tesarik J. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1992; 95: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). At least 200 cells were scored using a Nikon microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. Negative (no stimulation) and positive (calcium in permeabilized spermatozoa and A23187 in intact cells) controls were included in all experiments. For each experiment, the data were normalized by subtracting the number of reacted spermatozoa in the negative control (range 18–30%) from all values and expressing the resulting values as a percentage of the acrosome reaction observed in the positive control (range 30–50%). Recombinant Rab3A was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by following standard procedures (19Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rab3A was prenylated in vitro as described (19Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Just before use, aliquots of the prenylated protein were loaded with the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)(GTPγS) as described (19Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1084-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The light chain of BoNT/E was expressed and purified as previously described (24Vaidyanathan V.V. Yoshino K. Jahnz M. Dorries C. Bade S. Nauenburg S. Niemann H. Binz T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). SLO-permeabilized sperm were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm Fluo3-AM. The cells were then washed with SB at the same temperature and immobilized on glutaraldehyde-coated glass coverslips. Fluorescence was recorded in an inverted Eclipse TE300 Nikon microscope equipped with a CCD Hamamatsu Orca 100 camera operated with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Time lapse images were taken every 30–60 s with B-2A filters (excitation 450–490, barrier 515) and processed with MetaMorph and Paint Shop Pro (Jasc Software, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN). To measure calcium release from SLO-permeabilized spermatozoa, the cells were resuspended in SB buffer without EGTA. The free calcium concentration in this buffer was equilibrated with calcium sponge S to minimize contaminant calcium ions in the system. Sperm were treated for 15 min at 37 °C with 10 nm BoNT/E followed by 2 μmmembrane-impermeant Fura2. The samples were then transferred to the cuvette of an Aminco SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer, and fluorescence at 510 nm (emission) was registered exciting at 340 nm and 380 nm. At the appropriate times, 300 nm GTPγS-loaded Rab3A was added to the medium. As a negative control, the Rab3A buffer, having the same composition as the Rab3A preparation but lacking the protein, was used in some experiments. At the end of the incubation, dye fluorescence at zero and saturating calcium concentrations were obtained by adding 5 mm BAPTA and 6 mm CaCl2, respectively. Data were used to calculate free calcium concentration in the medium at each time point by using the algorithm of Grynkiewiczet al. (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Differences between experimental and control conditions were tested by a two-way analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least significant difference tests. Percentages (not normalized) were transformed to the arc-sine prior to analysis. Only significant differences (p < 0.05) among experimental groups are discussed in the text. Addition of micromolar concentrations of calcium triggers acrosomal exocytosis in permeabilized spermatozoa (Fig.1 A). The same effect is observed without calcium addition when recombinant Rab3A in the GTP-bound form is included in the assay. Under the latter condition, free calcium concentration in the buffer, which contains 0.5 mm EGTA, is in the 100 nm range (Fig.1 B). When 5 mm EGTA was added to the medium, the free calcium concentration dropped to less than 10 nm (Fig.1 B). At these very low calcium concentrations, there was still a significant percentage of sperm cells that underwent exocytosis in response to Rab3A (Fig. 1 A). BAPTA is another calcium chelator with similar affinity for the ion but with a faster binding rate. In the acrosomal exocytosis assay, BAPTA diminished calcium concentration below the sensitivity of the method used to determine this divalent ion. However, it did not inhibit acrosomal exocytosis more efficiently than EGTA (Fig. 1, A and B). Taken together, these data show that active Rab3A can trigger acrosomal exocytosis in the virtual absence of calcium in the medium. To assess whether calcium from an intracellular reservoir has a role in Rab3A-triggered acrosomal exocytosis, calcium from membrane-bound stores was depleted by pretreating with the ionophore A23187 in the presence of 5 mm EGTA. This treatment significantly inhibited acrosomal exocytosis (Fig. 2). Even more inhibition was observed after chelating calcium in the lumen of intracellular stores with BAPTA-AM or EGTA-AM, two membrane-permeant chelating agents that accumulate in membrane-bound compartments (Fig. 2). EGTA-NP, a photosensitive EGTA-AM analog, was used to demonstrate that the effect was reversible. In the dark, the membrane-bound chelator was active, and exocytosis was inhibited (Fig. 2). Upon illumination, a treatment that decreases the affinity of EGTA-NP for calcium about 10,000-fold, Rab3A-stimulated exocytosis was recovered (Fig. 2). These results indicate that depletion of calcium from intracellular stores prevents acrosomal exocytosis. Despite the fact that several reports postulate the existence of an acrosomal calcium reservoir, this pool has never been visualized. Permeabilized spermatozoa are an ideal system to assess the existence and regulation of such a store. When permeabilized sperm cells were incubated with Fluo3-AM, the acrosomal region of the spermatozoa showed a very distinct labeling (Fig.3 A, 0s). The fluorescence pattern in permeabilized spermatozoa was different from that observed in intact cells where the entire cell was fluorescent (data not shown). By using time lapse microscopy of single cells, we observed that addition of membrane-impermeant EGTA did not significantly decrease intraacrosomal calcium (Fig. 3 A,60s). In contrast, BAPTA-AM depleted the acrosomal pool (Fig. 3 A, 180sand onward). Although Fluo3-AM also labeled the midpiece, this signal was virtually insensitive to BAPTA-AM (Fig. 3 A). The relative changes in fluorescence in the acrosome and midpiece of the two spermatozoa shown in Fig.3 A are plotted in Fig. 3 B. Similar results were observed when the experiment was repeated in other sperm batches (Fig.3 C). Intraacrosomal calcium was also efficiently depleted by the combination of EGTA plus the calcium ionophore Br-A23187 (Fig.3 C). This combination caused a modest but statistically significant decrease in the midpiece fluorescence. The images demonstrate that the acrosome is a calcium reservoir. They also show that the experimental conditions in Fig. 2 that prevent acrosomal exocytosis efficiently deplete intraacrosomal calcium. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that intraacrosomal calcium is important for acrosomal content release. If the intraacrosomal calcium pool is important for exocytosis, the activity of the Ca2+-ATPase pump, responsible for maintaining intracellular calcium stores, should be necessary for acrosomal exocytosis. In agreement with this hypothesis, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, two inhibitors of this pump, inhibited Rab3-triggered exocytosis (Fig.4 A). It is worth noticing that although ATP is not added to the system, we have previously shown that permeabilized sperm cells produce enough ATP to sustain ATP-dependent processes (22Michaut M. Tomes C.N. De Blas G. Yunes R. Mayorga L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9996-10001Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). If calcium is pumped by an active mechanism, the effect of BAPTA-AM should be reversible provided that the sperm are incubated under conditions that permit the calcium pump to overcome the chelating capacity of the BAPTA present in the acrosome. To test this hypothesis, the cells were first incubated at 20 °C with BAPTA-AM. Subsequently, sperm cells were incubated at the same temperature in the presence of 10 μm free calcium to allow the pump to compensate for the effect of intraacrosomal BAPTA. At 20 °C, no acrosomal exocytosis is expected to occur even in the presence of calcium. Finally, an excess of impermeant EGTA was added to chelate the calcium remaining in the buffer, and the cells were transferred to 37 °C with Rab3A added to initiate exocytosis. Under these conditions, the effect of BAPTA-AM was overridden (Fig. 4 B). The recovery was sensitive to calcium pump inhibitors as would be expected if the pump were involved in the inward transport of calcium. When Rab3A was not added during the incubation at 37 °C, no exocytosis was observed, ruling out the possibility that calcium had triggered exocytosis during the 20 °C incubation (Fig. 4 B). When EGTA was added before calcium, no exocytosis was observed even in the presence of Rab3A indicating that the presence of calcium during the preincubation was necessary to overcome BAPTA-AM inhibition (Fig.4 B). Another prediction is that if the acrosomal calcium store is replenished by a mechanism that does not require the pumping of calcium from the medium, then the exocytosis should not be sensitive to inhibitors of the pump. In fact, when intraacrosomal free calcium was increased by photo inhibition of intraacrosomal EGTA-NP, exocytosis proceeded even in the presence of cyclopiazonic acid (Fig.4 C). These results are consistent with a role for an acrosomal calcium pump sensitive to thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid in the mechanism of Rab3A activation of exocytosis. We have shown that an acrosomal calcium store is necessary for the Rab3A effect on acrosomal exocytosis. We then assessed whether the process requires the release of calcium from the acrosomal store through calcium channels. Rab3A-dependent acrosomal exocytosis was sensitive to lanthanum, a general calcium channel blocker, and to xestospongin C and 2-APB, two inhibitors of IP3-dependent calcium channels (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, the process was not affected by nifedipine and verapamil, two inhibitors of voltage-dependent calcium channels. As expected, lanthanum, xestospongin C and 2-APB inhibited the process under conditions where the intraacrosomal calcium pool was replenished either by preincubation with calcium (Fig. 5 B) or by photoinhibition of intraacrosomal EGTA-NP (Fig. 5 C). These observations indicate that a release of calcium from the acrosomal store is necessary for Rab3A-stimulated acrosomal exocytosis. Therefore, we should be able to overcome the inhibitory effect of calcium channels inhibitors by using a calcium ionophore. We took advantage of a photo-activable calcium ionophore to test this hypothesis. Permeabilized sperm cells were incubated in the presence of xestospongin C, to inhibit calcium channels, and with a photo-activable calcium ionophore in the dark (inactive ionophore). The cells were then incubated with Rab3A. According to the hypothesis, under these conditions, the exocytic process should be arrested at a step that requires a calcium efflux from the acrosome. The calcium ionophore was then activated by a short exposure to the appropriate light source, and the incubation continued for a few minutes. The results indicate that an efflux of calcium ions after Rab3A activation overcomes the inhibition of calcium channels (Fig. 5 D). If Rab3A activation of acrosomal exocytosis requires the opening of calcium channels, a calcium efflux from the acrosome into the incubation medium would be expected upon addition of Rab3A. To test this prediction, changes in intraacrosomal calcium were measured in BoNT/E-treated spermatozoa after addition of Rab3A loaded with GTPγS. Sperm were treated with the toxin to prevent acrosomal exocytosis (26Tomes C.N. Michaut M. De Blas G. Visconti P. Matti U. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 243: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that would cause the release of intraacrosomal calcium. Addition of Rab3A significantly decreased calcium in the acrosome (Fig.6, A and B) as assessed by single cell imaging under conditions where exocytosis was blocked (Fig. 6 C). The effect was sensitive to xestospongin C and 2-APB (data not shown). The calcium released by Rab3A addition caused a measurable increase of calcium in the medium (Fig. 6,D and E). In conclusion, the experiments shown in Fig. 6 indicate that Rab3A facilitates the release of calcium from the acrosomal reservoir. We have presented consistent evidence that Rab3A-triggered acrosomal exocytosis requires the release of calcium from the acrosome. In a more physiological scenario, endogenous Rab3A is probably activated as part of the events initiated by the sustained cytosolic calcium increase caused by the opening of SOC channels. This means that the calcium efflux would be necessary even when calcium is present outside the acrosome. Consistent with this hypothesis, calcium-triggered acrosomal exocytosis was abrogated by chelating the acrosomal calcium pool or by inhibiting IP3-sensitive calcium channels (Fig.7 A). In intact spermatozoa, thapsigargin triggers exocytosis by opening SOC channels. If IP3-sensitive calcium channels are required after SOC channels are opened, thapsigargin-stimulated acrosome reaction should be inhibited by xestospongin C and 2-APB. To directly assess this possibility, nonpermeabilized sperm cells were treated with thapsigargin in the presence or absence of these inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 7 B, thapsigargin promoted exocytosis, an effect that was hampered by addition of IP3-sensitive calcium channels inhibitors. A possible shortcoming for this approach is that these inhibitors could interfere with the effect of thapsigargin on SOC channels by preventing calcium efflux from intracellular stores. To address this possibility, sperm were incubated with thapsigargin in the absence of calcium in the medium, a condition that opens SOC channels but does not trigger acrosomal exocytosis. Subsequently, IP3-sensitive calcium channels inhibitors were added, and finally the free calcium concentration in the medium was increased. As shown in Fig. 7 C, the inhibitors abrogated exocytosis even when added after SOC channels were open and calcium could permeate into the spermatozoa. These results suggest that acrosome reaction requires a release of calcium from the acrosome through IP3-sensitive calcium channels at a step downstream of SOC channels activation. The acrosomal granule has been postulated to be a calcium store for several years. A thapsigargin-sensitive calcium pump (9Rossato M. Di Virgilio F. Rizzuto R. Galeazzi C. Foresta C. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and IP3-sensitive calcium channels (5Dragileva E. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1226-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Trevino C.L. Santi C.M. Beltran C. Hernandez-Cruz A. Darszon A. Lomeli H. Zygote. 1998; 6: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) are present in the acrosomal membrane. Moreover, it has been shown that digitonin-permeabilized sperm cells can accumulate calcium in the presence of a mitochondria uncoupler, a process that has been ascribed to the acrosome (5Dragileva E. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1226-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, direct visualization of the acrosomal pool and its regulation was lacking. The opening of SLO pores in the plasma membrane of sperm cells allowed us to load intracellular membrane-bound compartments, including the acrosome, with AM derivatives. This procedure permitted us to visualize directly the presence of a calcium pool inside the acrosome and to monitor the changes in the acrosomal pool under different experimental conditions that affect acrosomal exocytosis. Our results show a direct correlation between disappearance of the acrosomal calcium pool and inhibition of acrosomal exocytosis. In contrast, changes in the midpiece calcium store were less significant under the same conditions. We speculate that the free calcium concentration inside the mitochondria may be more resistant to depletion due to the presence of putative calcium-releasing sources such as calcium-protein complexes or calcium phosphate precipitates. Whatever the reason for the midpiece resistance to calcium depletion, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the acrosome is the calcium store necessary for acrosomal exocytosis. It has been proposed that a putative acrosomal calcium store has an important role in the acrosome reaction. A decrease in this pool is supposed to mediate the opening of SOC channels in the plasma membrane causing a sustained calcium increase responsible for acrosomal exocytosis (1Darszon A. Beltran C. Felix R. Nishigaki T. Trevino C.L. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Jungnickel M.K. Marrero H. Birnbaumer L. Lemos J.R. Florman H.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). According to this model, the role of the acrosomal calcium pool is limited to a step prior to the opening of SOC channels. However, several lines of evidence presented in this paper indicate that acrosomal calcium has a direct role in the membrane fusion events leading to exocytosis. In our system, regulation of the acrosome reaction by channels in the plasma membrane is excluded because SLO opens large pores that permit the free diffusion of ions and proteins. The present findings are not in conflict with the postulated role of the intraacrosomal calcium store in the regulation of SOC channels. However, some contrary effects are observed in intact and permeabilized spermatozoa with inhibitors of the calcium pump. A plausible explanation for this difference is that, in intact cells, these compounds quickly trigger SOC channel opening (5Dragileva E. Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Biol.

Therefore, acrosomal exocytosis may occur long before the acrosomal calcium store has been depleted to a point that precludes membrane fusion. According to our results, activation of Rab3A triggers acrosomal exocytosis in a process that requires the opening of IP3-sensitive calcium channels. These channels have been implicated in the efflux of calcium necessary for the fusion of vesicles during nuclear envelope assembly (27Sullivan K.M. Lin D.D. Agnew W. Wilson K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8611-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in the release of calcium from secretory granules (28Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The molecular processes connecting Rab3A and IP3-sensitive calcium channels are at present unknown. There are some reports that peptides from the effector domain of Rab3 increase IP3 levels in several cell types, although direct evidence that the effect is mediated by a Rab3-dependent mechanism is missing (29Piiper A. Stryjekkaminska D. Zeuzem S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The assembly of the fusion complex initiated by activation of Rab3A could encompass IP3-sensitive calcium channels that may mediate the calcium efflux necessary for acrosomal exocytosis, as it has been postulated for voltage-operated calcium channels in neurotransmitter release (30Leveque C.

Why would a calcium efflux from the acrosome would be necessary for exocytosis? A direct role for intravesicular calcium in membrane fusion has been proposed in several other transport events (32Mayer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), including the secretion of exocytic granules (33Mills I.G. Urbe S. Clague M.J. J.

During the fusion process, membranes that are going to fuse are maintained in close proximity creating a partially isolated environment where the calcium concentration may be strongly altered by the local action of calcium pumps or the opening of calcium channels. More experiments are necessary to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying acrosomal exocytosis that is activated by the efflux of calcium from the acrosome. We thank T.

To characterize the requirements for photodamage, we transiently transfected epitope-tagged Bcl-2 deletion mutants into DU-145 cells. Using confocal microscopy and Western blots, wild-type Bcl-2 and mutants with deletions near the N terminus were found in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membranes and were photodamaged. A mutant missing the C terminus, including the transmembrane domain, spread diffusely in cells and was not photodamaged. Bcl-2 missing α-helices 5/6 was also not photodamaged. Bcl-2 missing only one of those α-helices, with or without substitutions of the singlet oxygen-targeted amino acids, behaved like wild-type Bcl-2 with respect to localization and photodamage. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Bcl-2 or mutants in live cells, no change in either the localization or the intensity of GFP fluorescence was observed in response to Pc 4 photodynamic therapy. Western blot analysis of either GFP- or Xpress-tagged Bcl-2 revealed that the photodynamic therapy-induced disappearance of the Bcl-2 band was accompanied by the appearance of bands indicative of heavily cross-linked Bcl-2 protein. Therefore, the α5/α6 region of Bcl-2 is required for photodamage and cross-linking, and domain-dependent photodamage to Bcl-2 offers a unique mechanism for activation of apoptosis.

Gomer C.J. Henderson B.W. Jori G. Kessel D. Korbelik M. Moan J. Peng Q. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 889-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (4719) Google Scholar, 2Oleinick N.L. Morris R.L. Belichenko I. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2002; 1: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The procedure requires exposure of cells or tissues to a photosensitizing drug followed by irradiation with visible light of the appropriate wavelength, usually in the red or near infrared region and compatible with the absorption spectrum of the drug. Since the first modern clinical trial of PDT by Dougherty et al. (3Dougherty T.J. Cancer Res. 1978; 36: 2628-2635Google Scholar) was reported in 1978, PDT with the photosensitizer Photofrin® has been applied to many solid tumors and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced esophageal, early lung, and late lung cancers. In order to enhance the efficacy of PDT and extend its applications, a variety of second generation photosensitizers, such as the silicon phthalocyanine Pc 4, are now being assessed for their efficacy in cancer therapy, and it is important to elucidate their mechanisms of action in PDT. The photosensitizers for PDT are primarily porphyrins or porphyrin-related macrocycles, such as phthalocyanines, benzoporphyrins, purpurins, and pyropheophorbides (4Berg K. Moan J. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Kessel D. Luo Y. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1998; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Because of their hydrophobic aromatic ring structures, they localize to one or more cellular membranes. We have reported that Pc 4 preferentially binds to the mitochondrial membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complexes in cancer cells (6Trivedi N.S. Wang H.W. Nieminen A.L. Oleinick N.L. Izatt J.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Lam M. Oleinick N.L. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47379-47386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Upon photoactivation, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are produced, and these are critical in initiating mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilization, which leads to mitochondrial swelling, cytochrome c release to the cytosol, and apoptotic death (7Lam M. Oleinick N.L. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47379-47386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). PDT produces singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species in the membranes and causes photooxidative damage to proteins and lipids that reside within a few nm of the photosensitizer binding sites (8Moan J. Berg K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 931-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 9He X.Y. Sikes R.A. Thomsen S. Chung L.W. Jacques S.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1994; 59: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). One important target of Pc 4-PDT (10Xue L.Y. Chiu S.M. Oleinick N.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3420-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) as well as PDT with certain other photosensitizers (11Kim H.R. Luo Y. Kessel D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3429-3432PubMed Google Scholar) is the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. The Bcl-2 family consists of proteins that either promote or inhibit apoptosis. Proapoptotic members include Bax and Bak, whereas antiapoptotic members include Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. They share 1–4 α-helical Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains, whose subtle differences in primary sequence and spatial arrangements may determine the pro- and antiapoptotic functions. The antiapoptotic proteins, like Bcl-2, possess four BH domains (BH1–BH4) (12Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The C-terminal regions of many members of the Bcl-2 family consist of a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that serves to anchor the proteins to intracellular membranes, specifically the outer mitochondrial membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear envelope (13Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 contains a transmembrane domain of 19 amino acids at the C terminus, and it has been reported that deletion of the C-terminal 22 amino acids of Bcl-2 abrogates cellular membrane attachment (14Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Choi W.S. Yoon S.Y. Chang I.I. Choi E.J.

Structural analysis of Bcl-xL reveals its resemblance to the bacterial pore-forming toxins, colicin and diphtheria toxin, especially in the α-helical region that mediates membrane insertion of the toxins (16Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L., Ng, S.C. Fesik S.W.

This region corresponds to the BH1 domain and part of the BH2 domain of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and is called the α5/α6 region. This region is thought to be inserted into the membrane and form ion channels (18Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 19Matsuyama S. Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 632-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It has been reported that mutations within the α5/α6 region of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL abrogate the antiapoptotic activity and block the heterodimerization with other members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax or Bak, which are death-promoting proteins. The region between the BH1 and BH2 domains forms part of a hydrophobic cleft and may be the site of interaction with Bax or Bak (16Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S.

Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). The role of Bcl-2 in the apoptotic response caused by PDT has remained controversial. He et al. (21He J. Agarwal M.E. Larkin H.E. Friedman L.R. Oleinick N.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 64: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) first reported that overexpressing human Bcl-2 made Chinese hamster ovary cells more resistant to apoptosis and to loss of clonogenicity upon exposure to Pc 4-PDT. In contrast, Kim et al. (11Kim H.R. Luo Y. Kessel D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3429-3432PubMed Google Scholar) found that overexpression of Bcl-2 in MCF-10A cells caused the up-regulation of Bax and enhanced cell killing and apoptosis by PDT with AlPc. Recently, Srivastava et al. reported that antisense-Bcl-2 sensitized A431 cells to Pc 4-PDT (22Srivastava M. Ahmad N. Gupta S. Mukhtar H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15481-15488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As in the study by Kim et al.(11Kim H.R. Luo Y. Kessel D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3429-3432PubMed Google Scholar), the cells overexpressing Bcl-2 were more sensitive to induction of apoptosis than were the parental cells, because of up-regulation of Bax; however, no studies were done to determine whether those cells were sensitized to overall cell death. We have reported that Pc 4-PDT photodamages Bcl-2, as detected by Western blot analysis as the immediate loss of the native 26-kDa protein (10Xue L.Y. Chiu S.M. Oleinick N.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3420-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 photodamage was selective, in that several other mitochondrial proteins were not affected. Kessel and Castelli (23Kessel D. Castelli M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) found that PDT with three different photosensitizers destroyed Bcl-2 but not Bax. In contrast, a recent report from Antieghem et al. (24Vantieghem A., Xu, Y. Assefa Z. Piette J. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. de Witte P.A.M. Agostinis P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37718-37731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that PDT with the nonporphyrin photosensitizer, hypericin, does not cause Bcl-2 destruction but produces a G2/M delay, during which Bcl-2 becomes transiently phosphorylated. Although it is now clear that Bcl-2 is one target of PDT with Pc 4 and some other photosensitizers, the mechanism of the photodestruction of Bcl-2 has not been defined. In order to elucidate the structural features that determine photosensitivity, we constructed Bcl-2 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis and examined the association between their subcellular localization and their sensitivity to photodestruction by Pc 4-PDT. Furthermore, we compared the responses of wild-type and mutant Bcl-2 to those of the proapoptotic proteins, Bak and Bax. Our photobiological analysis of the Bcl-2 family members suggests a relationship between membrane localization and photosensitivity. Human prostate cancer DU-145 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells transfected with human procaspase-3 cDNA (MCF-7c3 cells) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (25Xue L.Y. Chiu S.M. Oleinick N.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Human breast epithelial MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. An expression vector housing full-length human Bcl-2 cDNA inserted at the EcoRI site, pUC19-Bcl-2, was kindly provided by Dr. C. W. Distelhorst (Case Western Reserve University) (26Wang N.S.

Bcl-2 cDNA was digested withEcoRI and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax (Invitrogen), which encodes an N-terminal peptide containing a polyhistidine metal-binding tag and the Xpress epitope. It was also cloned into the N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). To generate the Bcl-2 mutants, mutations were amplified from pUC19-Bcl-2 using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (18Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O.

Additional Bcl-2 mutants were constructed to mutate specific amino acids. In order to generate mutant i, pUC19-Bcl-2 (Δ168–179) was amplified, and to generate mutant j, pUC19-Bcl-2 (Δ153–168) was amplified as a template for the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. The following mutagenic primers were used: for mutant i, Bcl-2 (Δ168–179, F153L,M157I,C158V) (5′-CTTCTTTGAGCCGGTGGGGTCATCGTTGTGGAGAGCGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACGCTCTCCACAACGATGACCCCACCGAGCTCAAAGAAG-3′ (reverse)); for mutant j, Bcl-2 (Δ153–168, W176L,M177L) (5′-GTGGACAACATCGCCCTGTTACTGACTGAGTACCTGAACC-3′) (forward) and 5′-GGTTCAGGTACTCAGTCAGTAACAGGGCGATGTTGTCCAC-3′ (reverse)). The reactions were carried out by 24 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 12 min at 68 °C using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amplified products were digested withDpnI (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the products were transfected into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amplified regions were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis and digested with EcoRI and then cloned to the mammalian expression vectors, pCDNA4/HisMax and pEGFP-C3. The phthalocyanine photosensitizer Pc 4, HOSiPcOSi(CH3)2(CH2)3N(CH3)2, was provided by Dr. M. E. Kenney (Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University). Pc 4 was dissolved in dimethyl formamide to 0.5 mm. Cells were loaded with Pc 4 by the addition of an aliquot of the stock solution to the culture medium 16 h before irradiation. For all experiments, the light source was an EFOS light-emitting diode array (EFOS; Mississauga, Canada) delivering red light (λmax 670–675 nm; bandwidth at half-maximum 24 nm; fluence rate at the level of the cell monolayer, 6–7 milliwatts/cm2). The dose of PDT used in most of these experiments (200 nm Pc 4 plus 200 mJ/cm2) was demonstrated to produce 98 ± 4% killing of MCF-7c3 cells and 92 ± 2% killing of DU-145 cells, as determined by clonogenic assay. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell pellets were incubated in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF) on ice for 30 min and then sonicated. The protein content of the whole cell lysates was measured using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). An aliquot (20 μg) of the whole cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with one of the following antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen), rabbit polyclonal anti-human Bax antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-human Bak antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody, and mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at appropriate concentrations for 1 h. After rinsing with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed and developed with Western blotting enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Independent experiments were repeated at least three times. DU-145 cells were grown on glass coverslips and then were transiently transfected with an expression vector (pcDNA/HisMax) encoding wild-type Bcl-2 or Bcl-2 mutants. Eight h after the transfection, Pc 4 was added to the cultures, which were further incubated for 16 h and then incubated with 100 nm MitoTracker Green (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 45 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed in PBS and fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min. After rinsing twice with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated in IFA buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 min and then IFA containing mouse anti-XpressTM antibody (1:300 dilution; Invitrogen, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing with IFA buffer to remove excess unbound antibody, the coverslips were incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature in IFA containing the second antibody, which was anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Texas Red (1:300 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). In all experiments, there was no detectable immunofluorescence signal above background in the absence of anti-XpressTM antibody. To investigate the subcellular sites of Pc 4 localization, DU-145 cells were plated on 35-mm coverslip dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and exposed to 200 nm Pc 4 at 37 °C for 16 h. To assess specific localization to mitochondria, cells were also incubated with 100 nm MitoTracker Green for 45 min at 37 °C. All fluorescence images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscope in the Case Western Reserve University Ireland Comprehensive Cancer Center confocal microscopy facility. A ×63 numerical aperture 1.4 oil immersion planapochromat objective was used. Confocal images of Pc 4 fluorescence were collected using 633-nm excitation light from a HeNe laser and a 650-nm long pass filter. Images of MitoTracker Green fluorescence were collected using 488-nm excitation light from an argon laser and a 500–550-nm band pass barrier filter. To investigate the localization of wild-type Bcl-2 and mutants, images of Texas Red were collected using 543-nm excitation light from a HeNe laser and a 560-nm long pass filter. For live cell fluorescence imaging of DU-145 cells transiently transfected with GFP-wild-type Bcl-2 or with GFP-Bcl-2 mutants, cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Cop., Ashland, MA) and transiently transfected (27Usuda J.

Eight h after the transfection, Pc 4 was added to the cultures, which were further incubated for 16 h and then incubated with 100 nmMitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 45 min at 37 °C. Images of GFP fluorescence and MitoTracker Red fluorescence were collected using the same filter settings as for MitoTracker Green plus Texas Red, respectively (27Usuda J. Chiu S.M. Azizuddin K. Xue L.Y. Lam M. Nieminen A.-L. Oleinick N.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 76: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After taking these images, the cells were photoirradiated, and the same cells were imaged immediately and 1 h later. In cells, PDT causes oxidative damage to target molecules that reside within a few nm of the sites of photoactivation of the photosensitizer (7Lam M. Oleinick N.L. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that Pc 4 binds to mitochondria but also to various other organellar membranes, including the nuclear membrane and ER/Golgi membranes of murine lymphoma L5178Y-R cells (6Trivedi N.S.

Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47379-47386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined the localization of Pc 4 in DU-145 cells using confocal microscopy (Fig. 1). To assess whether Pc 4 binds to the mitochondria, DU-145 cells were co-loaded with MitoTracker Green, a mitochondrion-specific dye. The images of Pc 4 displayed a punctate pattern, but Pc 4 fluorescence only partially co-localized with MitoTracker Green fluorescence. These results suggest that in DU-145 cells Pc 4 localizes not only to mitochondria but also to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complexes, nuclear membrane, and possibly other intracellular organelles but to neither the plasma membrane nor the nucleus. The data are consistent with our earlier findings in other cell lines (6Trivedi N.S. Wang H.W. Nieminen A.L. Oleinick N.L. Izatt J.A. Photochem.

We have reported that the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 disappears from Western blots immediately upon Pc 4-PDT (10Xue L.Y. Chiu S.M. Oleinick N.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3420-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of the photodamage and reveal the target site, we constructed Bcl-2 mutants in which regions of the protein are deleted (Fig. 2, A and B). We used pcDNA4/HisMax plasmid, which encodes the XpressTMepitope and a polyhistidine metal-binding tag at the N-terminal region of the multiple cloning site. We transiently transfected pcDNA4/HisMax-full-length human Bcl-2 (239 amino acids) and Bcl-2 mutants into DU-145 cells, which have very low endogenous levels of Bcl-2 (29Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A.

The subcellular localization of Bcl-2 in DU-145 cells was determined by immunocytochemical analysis with the anti-Xpress antibody and confocal microscopy. Bcl-2 co-localized with mitochondria and also localized to the nuclear envelope and other cellular organelles, as previously reported (17Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat.

All of the mutants with deletions in the N-terminal half of Bcl-2 (mutants a, b, and c) localized in DU-145 cells similarly to wild-type Bcl-2. In control DU-145 cells transfected with empty vector, there was no detectable immunofluorescence signal above background (data not shown).Figure 3The subcellular localization and photosensitivity of mutant Bcl-2 having deletions within the N-terminal half of the protein. DU-145 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA4/HisMax expression vector containing Bcl-2, Bcl-2 (Δ33–54), Bcl-2 (Δ37–63), or Bcl-2 (Δ10–125). A, 24 h after transfection, subcellular localization of wild-type Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 mutant proteins was determined by imaging the fluorescence of Texas Red, and localization of mitochondria was determined by imaging the fluorescence of MitoTracker Green. Texas Red and MitoTracker Green images were overlaid to show the extent of co-localization in yellow. Scale bar, 5 μm. B, other groups of cells were exposed to Pc 4-PDT (200 nm plus 200 mJ/cm2 photoirradiation) 24 h after transfection. The Bcl-2 level was examined using a mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress tag antibody by Western blot analysis before (−PDT), immediately after (t 0), and 1 h after (t 1h) Pc 4-PDT. The control received Pc 4 but was not irradiated (−PDT).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Twenty-four h after the transfection, we performed PDT. The dose of PDT in all experiments (200 nm Pc 4 plus 200 mJ/cm2) was demonstrated to produce 92 ± 2% killing of untransfected DU-145 cells, as determined by clonogenic assay. The extent of photodamage was assessed by Western blot analysis. Similarly to the overexpressed wild-type Bcl-2, mutants with deletions in the N-terminal half of Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 (Δ33–54), Bcl-2 (Δ37–63) and Bcl-2 (Δ10–125)) were immediately photodamaged by Pc 4-PDT (Fig. 3 B). One h after PDT, neither the wild-type Bcl-2 protein nor any of the mutant proteins had been restored to their previous levels (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that there is no essential target site of Pc 4-PDT in the N-terminal half of Bcl-2, and furthermore, Asp-34, a known caspase cleavage site (30Kirsch D.G. Doseff A. Chau B.N.

Moreover, since essentially all of the Bcl-2 in the cell is damaged by the chosen dose of Pc 4-PDT, the results show that all of the sites of Bcl-2 localization are accessible for photodamage and that Pc 4 must reside within a few nm of Bcl-2 binding sites in the mitochondrial, ER, and nuclear membranes. A mutant (g) missing the C-terminal region, Bcl-2 (Δ210–239), including the entire TM domain, was found throughout the cell in a diffuse nonmitochondrial pattern, as previously reported for a similar mutant (33Conus S. Kaufmann T. Fellay I. Otter I. Rosse T. Borner C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1534-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). Although some of the image of this mutant appeared punctate, there was no co-localization with MitoTracker Green. Mutant g displayed apparently complete resistance to photodamage by Pc 4-PDT, since there was no decrease in the amount of the protein either immediately after or 1 h after treatment of the cells with Pc 4-PDT (Fig. 4 B). However, another C-terminal mutant (mutant h, Bcl-2 (Δ218–233)), was found in mitochondrial and nuclear membranes and was destroyed immediately after PDT (Fig. 4, A and B). Mutant h retains 4 amino acids (positions 234–237) within the TM domain, which is evidently sufficient for attachment to the membran"

The synthesis of gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides as an immune strategy is widely used in nature and has been conserved during evolution. Antimicrobial peptides have been produced by a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria for billions of years to hinder the proliferation of other microorganisms that are closely related or confined within the same ecological niche (1Jung G.

In vertebrates, these peptides are synthesized by lymphoid cells, granular epithelial cells of the skin, respiratory and urogenital tracts, and also by the gastrointestinal system (7Ammar B.

A defense strategy against invading microorganisms is well documented in amphibians and consists of the biosynthesis of a large number of small polycationic peptides integrated with the cell-mediated immune system. Several antimicrobial peptides have been isolated from anuran species, and among the most studied are the ones from the dermaseptin family. Dermaseptins are molecules found in the skin secretion of tree frogs from the Phyllomedusinae subfamily. They consist of a characteristic polypeptide chain of 28–34 amino acids with 3–6 lysine residues and a very conserved tryptophan residue in the third position from the N terminus (10Mor A. Amiche M. Nicolas P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6642-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Mor A. Hani K. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31635-31641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides exert a lytic action on bacteria, protozoa, yeast, and filamentous fungi at micromolar concentrations. Unlike polylysines, the dermaseptins show little or no detectable hemolytic activity (11Mor A. Hani K. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31635-31641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mor A. Nicolas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The capacity of the dermaseptins to discriminate between mammalian and microbial cells has been known for more than a decade (13Daly J.W. Caceres J. Moni R.W. Gusovsky F. Moos Jr., M. Seamon K.B.

Caceres J. Moni R.W. Gusovsky F. Moos Jr., M. Seamon K.B. Milton K. Myers C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10960-10963Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Mor A. Nguyen V.H.

Besides the phospholipid content, the cell lysis mediated by amphiphilic antimicrobial peptides such as the dermaseptins is attenuated by increasing amounts of membrane cholesterol (21Prenner E.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The membrane of the Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigote forms was demonstrated to be composed mostly of phosphatidylcholine and to a lesser extent phosphatidylethanolamine (23Agusti R. Couto A.S. Alves M.J.M. Colli W. de Lederkremer R.M. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2000; 95: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There are no published data regarding the presence of cholesterol in T. cruzibloodstream forms, although it has been shown to exist in high molar ratios in Trypanosoma brucei (24Voorheis H.P. Gale J.S. Owen M.J. Edwards W. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since T. cruzicannot synthesize cholesterol, its source is restricted to the growth medium extraction (25Rodrigues C.O. Catisti R. Uyemura S.A. Vercesi A.E. Lira R. Rodriguez C. Urbina J.A. Docampo R. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2001; 48: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas in T. brucei, it is derived from host low density lipoprotein particles (26Coppens I. Courtoy P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The potential susceptibility ofTrypanosomatidae to cationic amphiphilic peptides was stated by the discovery that apolipoprotein-A, which shares many features with antimicrobial peptides, has a trypanocidal effect on T. brucei (27Gillett M.P. Owen J.S. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1991; 85: 612-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Ultimately, there has been a growing interest in using dermaseptins as therapeutical agents in diseases caused by protozoa (28Hernandez C. Mor A. Dagger F. Nicolas P. Hernandez A. Benedetti E.L. Dunia I. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 414-424PubMed Google Scholar, 29Krugliak M. Feder R. Zolotarev V.Y. Gaidukov L. Dagan A. Ginsburg H. Mor A. Antimicrob.

Indeed, chemically modified dermaseptins have already been shown to effectively lyse the intra-erythrocytic form of Plasmodium falciparum, leaving the host cell unharmed (30Efron L. Dagan A.

However, there is still a long way before dermaseptins can be considered as an actual and efficient therapy against protozoa infections since their interactions with mammalian blood cells are still poorly investigated. The present work describes the isolation, molecular mass determination, and complete amino acid sequencing of a new dermaseptin, named DS 01, 1The abbreviations used are: DS 01, dermaseptin 01; DD K, dermadistinctin K; DD L, dermadistinctin L; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase HPLC; MALDI-TOF/MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; AFM, atomic force microscopy1The abbreviations used are: DS 01, dermaseptin 01; DD K, dermadistinctin K; DD L, dermadistinctin L; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reverse-phase HPLC; MALDI-TOF/MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; AFM, atomic force microscopy isolated from the skin secretion of the recently identified species Phyllomedusa oreades (31Brandão R.A.A. J. Herpetol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Due to the observed lytic action against a wide range of microorganisms, we also investigated the activity of DS 01 against T. cruzi. This protozoan pathogen is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, which affects 16–18 million people in Central and South America (32Mocaio A. World Health Stat. Q. 1997; 50: 195-198PubMed Google Scholar). About 20,000 new cases are reported each year, all due to contaminated blood transfusions (33Storino R. Auger S. Miguel J. Medicina (B. Aires). 1997; 57: 512-516Google Scholar), thus creating a strong demand for effective trypanocidal agents that are non-toxic for blood cells and have little or no side effects. The interaction of DS 01 with blood cells is investigated in a more comprehensive way than the conventional hemolysis assay. Possible cytotoxic effects on white blood cells and platelets were investigated by the use of flow cytometry, complemented by morphological observations under light microscope. Atomic force microscopy was also used to investigate any detectable morphological alterations of mice erythrocytes exposed to dermaseptins at high concentrations. Frog skin secretion (crude extract) was obtained from adult specimens of P. oreades, a new specimen of thePhyllomedusinae subfamily captured in Serra da Mesa (Goiás), Central Brazil and described by Brandão (31Brandão R.A.A. J. Herpetol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Renováveis (IBAMA) license number was 097/96-DIFAS, and the process number was 0637/91A.C. Frog secretion was obtained by mild electric stimulation of the granular skin glands of P. oreades and freshly collected in distilled water as a soluble extract. The extract was filtered by gravity through filter paper, frozen, and lyophilized (Centrivap Concentrador, Labconco, Kansas City, MO). Peptide separation was performed by injecting 250 μl of the crude extract to a semipreparative Vydac 218 TP 510 (Hesperia, CA) reverse-phase chromatographic column, C18, 10 μ (10 × 250 mm) in HPLC1 system (Class LC-10VP from Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto City, Japan). Peptides were purified by using a linear gradient from 0 to 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 75 min. RP-HPLC experiments were monitored in two different wavelengths (216 and 280 nm), and fractions were collected manually and subsequently lyophilized. The isolated fractions were submitted to a second chromatographic step using a Vydac 218 TP 54, C18, 5 μ (0.46 × 25 cm) column with optimized gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 40 min. Sample purity and mass analyses were made by MALDI-TOF/MS. The purified peptide was incubated with 0.5 μg/μl endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18 h at 25 °C. The buffer used was 25 mm ammonium carbonate at pH 7.8 (34Sorensen S.B. Sorensen T.L. Bredd K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Houmard J. Drapeau J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3506-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of DS 01 and of the two fragments produced by endoproteinase Glu-C from digestion were determined by MALDI-TOF/MS (Voyager DE-STR, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using close external calibration under reflector mode. Approximately 20 nmol of lyophilized peptide was dissolved in Milli-Q water, mixed to a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid, spotted on a MALDI sample plate, and dried at room temperature. Amino acid sequencing was performed by the automated Edman degradation method on a PPSQ-23 protein peptide sequencer (from Shimadzu Corp.). C-terminal ladder sequencing was also performed on DS 01 using Perseptive Biosystems SequazymeTM C-peptide kit and MALDI-TOF/MS. Dermaseptin DS 01 sequence alignment and similarity searches were performed using the FASTA 3 program on the Expasy Molecular Server (www.expasy.ch). Secondary structure prediction was performed using SOPMA, also at Expasy. Amidated DS 01 was synthesized on a Pioneer Synthesis System from Applied Biosystems. Fmoc amino acids and Fmoc-PAL-poly(ethyleneglycol)-polystyrene (FmocPAL-PEG-PS) resin were also purchased from Applied Biosystems. The resin leaves the amidated C-terminal after peptide extraction. The cleavage and deprotection procedures, after chemical synthesis, involve the addition of three scavengers, anisole, ethanedithiol, and thioanisole, in 100% trifluoroacetic acid (2:3:5:90, v/v). For 0.5 g of resin, 5 ml of cleavage mixture is needed, and reaction time lasted around 2 h. The resin was then washed with cold diisopropilic ether, causing peptide precipitation. 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile were then used to recover the crude synthetic peptide. To purify the peptide, the usage of a preparative C18 column (Vydac 218 TP 1022) on an HPLC system was required. Molecular mass and sample purity were checked by MALDI/TOF-MS. DD K and DD L were synthesized using T-Boc amino acids as reported by Batista et al. (9Batista C.V.F. Rosendo da Silva L. Sebben A. Scaloni A. Ferrara L. Paiva G.R. Orlamendi-Portugal T. Possani L.D. Bloch Jr., C. Peptides (Elmsford). 1999; 20: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purification of these two synthetic peptides was performed by RP-HPLC in a Vydac 218 TP 54 analytical column, and the purity was checked by MALDI-TOF/MS. Six bacterial strains were used to investigate the DS 01 antimicrobial activity. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25992 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Acetobacter calcoaceticuswild type, E. coli MR, and S. aureus MRSA (methycilin/oxacylin resistant) were isolated from patients of the Laboratório SABIN de Análises Clı́nicas/Brası́lia-DF, Brası́lia, Brazil. Microorganisms were grown in stationary culture at 37 °C and then transferred to the Mueller-Hinton liquid medium (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)-approved standard M100-S9) in which the tests were performed (36National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, NCCLS-approved standard M100-S9. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Wayne, PA1999Google Scholar). The bacterial liquid growth inhibition assay was performed as described by Bulet et al. (37Bulet P. Cociancich S. Dimarcq J.-L. Lambert J. Hoffmann D. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 236: 24520-24525Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Synthetic DS 01 was dissolved and diluted 8-fold in Mueller-Hinton broth. The highest peptide concentration used for the assay was 64 μg/ml. The initial inoculum was ∼1.8 × 107 colony forming units/ml. The final volume was 200 μl, 50 μl of the peptide test in broth, 150 μl of the inoculum in Mueller-Hinton. The experiment was carried on in stationary culture at 37 °C, and the spectrophotometric readings were performed 12 h after incubation. The minimal inhibitory concentration, as introduced by Park et al. (38Park C.B. Kim M.S. Kim S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), was measured from optical density (A 595) and is the result of three independent measurements. Conventional antibiotics had their minimum inhibitory concentrations determined against the six experimental bacterial strains by automated biochemical analysis (Vitek, bioMériuex Inc.). Initial inoculum was adjusted to match 0.5 in the McFarland scale. The Mueller-Hinton broth was the chosen medium. Bloodstream forms of T. cruzi (Y strain) were harvested from BALB/c mice 7–10 days after the infection with 105 parasites. The infected blood was diluted to a final concentration of 5 × 105parasites/ml with phosphate-buffered saline. The biological tests were performed as described previously (39Silva J.S. Ferrioli-Filho F. Kanesiro M.M. Santos S.C. Pinto C.N. Gilbert B. Ribeiro F.W. Pinto A.V. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 1992; 87: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The plates were incubated at 37 °C followed by counting the parasites under a light microscope. Disappearance or immobility of parasites was judged to indicate drug action. The experiment was done in triplicate. Investigation of the hemolytic activity of synthetic DS 01 was done as reported by Bignami (40Bignami G.S. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The peptide was diluted serially and incubated with human red blood cells at 37 °C for 30 min. After a 900 × g centrifugation for 10 min, the absorbance of the supernatant phase was measured by spectrophotometry (Microplate Reader 3550, Bio-Rad) at 567 nm. Maximum hemolysis was determined by adding distilled water to a red blood cell sample. Leukocyte counts were done as described by Ben-Ezra et al.(41Ben-Ezra J. Louis M.S. Riley R.S. Lab. Hematol. 2001; 7: 61-64Google Scholar) and Hove et al. (42Hove L.V. Chisano T.S. Brace L. Lab. Hematol. 2000; 6: 93-108Google Scholar). Aliquots of human fresh blood were collected, preserved in heparin as anticoagulant, and incubated with synthetic DS 01 at 37 °C during 4 h. The final peptide concentration in solution was 128 μg/ml. Total leukocytes and platelets counts were done in 200 μl of blood using Cell-Dyn 3500 SC/SL flow cytometry automated hematology analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). The data obtained are the result of two independent measurements. Aliquots of blood subjected to incubation with synthetic DS 01 were collected and stained by routine Wright's eosin methylene blue. Morphological monitoring of white blood cells was done by light microscopy. Mouse erythrocytes were freshly prepared as described by Aboudy et al. (43Aboudy Y. Mendelson E. Shalit I. Bessalle R. Fridikin M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 3 ml of freshly prepared erythrocytes were mixed with an anticoagulant (EDTA) and washed with isotonic phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (phosphate-buffered saline), until the color of the supernatant turned clear. The washed erythrocytes were then diluted to a final volume of 20 ml with the same buffer. Peptide samples diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (12.4 μg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with the cell suspension in a total volume of 190 μl. Another erythrocyte sample was treated for 5 min with 0.05% Triton X-100 as positive control to indicate topographic alterations. Control samples were made in the absence of both peptide and Triton X-100. An aliquot (4 μl) of each sample was manually spread onto a polished microscope glass slide to create a blood film, which was rapidly fixed by air drying. The film was examined under the optical microscope, and regions with a single layer of red blood cells were marked using a lens-mounted inking device. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed in air on the blood film using a AFM (Explorer model, TopoMetrix, Santa Clara, CA) in contact mode. The glass slide carrying the blood film was mounted onto the XY scanner of the AFM, and the integral camera was used to locate the regions of interest. Contact mode silicon tips with a spring constant of ∼0.3 newtons/m were used. The force applied to the sample during imaging was typically 15 nanonewtons. Repeated scanning of the same red blood cells confirmed that no physical damage occurred during AFM. AFM images were processed and analyzed using the software SPMLab Version 4.0 (TopoMetrix). The crude skin secretion fractionation obtained by RP-HPLC yielded more than 50 fractions (Fig.1). The DS 01 fraction was submitted to further purification by using analytical RP-HPLC (Fig.2 A). MALDI-TOF monoisotopic mass analysis of DS 01 showed an intense ion of [M+H]+ = 2793.39 (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Further DS 01 purification.

Both fragments were separated by HPLC and showed molecular mass values of [M+H]+ = 1374.49 and [M+H]+ = 1437.62 Da, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). The primary structure of the intact DS 01 and its enzymatic fragments were determined by Edman degradation and carboxypeptidase Y ladder sequencing and are shown in Figs. 4and 5. The calculated monoisotopic mass of DS 01 and its fragments (DS 01a and DS 01b) after the N-terminal sequencing was [M+H]+ = 2794.59 Da. However, MALDI-TOF/MS data revealed a discrepancy of 1.2 Da for DS01 monoisotopic molecular mass value ([M+H]+ = 2793.39 Da). A similar difference in mass was also observed when the molecular mass values for the calculated DS 01b C-terminal fragment ([M+H]+ = 1438.84 Da) were compared with the experimental result ([M+H]+ = 1437.62 Da) shown in Fig.3 C.Figure 5The complete amino acid sequence of DS 01.

Sequence similarity searches were performed using FASTA 3 program that runs under the Expasy Molecular Server. This procedure revealed up to 76% sequence identity with the adenoregulin precursor ofPhyllomedusa bicolor (14Mor A. Nguyen V.H. Delfour A. Migliori-Smour D. Nicolas P.

The sequences of DD K and DD L, both isolated from P. distincta are also shown for comparison purposes. The secondary structure prediction (performed by SOPMA) of the three peptides investigated in this work (DS 01, DD K, and DD L) indicates a strong propensity to assume helical conformation. This tendency toward an α-helical arrangement, obtained upon contact with some organic solvents or the lipid bilayer (44Dathe M. Nikolenko H. Meyer J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. FEBBS Lett. 2001; 501: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also gives the peptides a strong amphiphilic character, as demonstrated by the helix-wheel plot (Fig.6). Synthetic DS 01 exhibited a broad spectrum antibacterial activity given that it inhibited the growth of most of the bacterial strains studied, which included Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains (Table II). However, significant differences in the growth inhibition of the different bacterial strains were observed, in accordance with the literature published for other dermaseptins (9Batista C.V.F.

The molecular details underlying this phenotype are not understood. However, in the absence of calreticulin, cells have markedly impaired inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)1-dependent Ca2+ release, which prohibits the nuclear translocation of NF-AT in response to Ca2+ stimulation (2Mesaeli N.

These observations indicate that Ca2+- and calcineurin-dependent signaling pathways in the heart may underlie the embryonic lethality displayed by calreticulin-deficient mice. Here we tested this hypothesis and reconstituted the hearts of calreticulin-deficient mice with a truncated constitutively active form of calcineurin to reestablish the Ca2+-dependent cascade downstream of calreticulin. We show that the overexpression of activated calcineurin reverses the defect in cardiac development observed in calreticulin-deficient mice and rescues them from embryonic lethality. Mice with cardiac-specific expression of activated calcineurin (amino acid residues 1–389) were created using the α-MHC promoter (8Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J.

Homozygote transgenic mice with respect to the activated calcineurin transgene were used in all experiments. The creation of calreticulin-deficient mice was described previously (2Mesaeli N.

Mice bearing the activated calcineurin transgene (FVB/N strain) were crossed withcrt +/− (C57BL/6J strain) mice. The progeny of this cross were interbred to generate calreticulin-deficient mice expressing activated calcineurin in the heart. The breeding of the transgenic animals was carried out the University of Alberta Health Sciences Transgenic Facility. Histological analysis of cardiac tissue was carried out as described previously (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. cDNA encoding NF-ATc1 was inserted into theBamH1 site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to generate a GFP-NF-ATc1. SV40 immortalized (9Conzen S.D. Cole C.N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2295-2302PubMed Google Scholar)crt +/− and crt −/− fibroblasts were transiently transfected with the GFP-NF-ATc1 expression vector using Effectene Transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were also transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing cDNA encoding constitutively active calcineurin (activated calcineurin) (10O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). As a control, cells were transfected with a pEGFP-C1 with cDNA encoding NF-ATc1 cloned in non-sense orientation. Cells were grown on 25-mm circular coverslips (Fisher Scientific) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescent microscope using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm. All of the pictures were pseudo-colored using Northern Eclipse 5.0 software. Blood was collected and glucose was measured using Glucometer Elite Blood Glucose Meter (model 3903E, Bayer) with Glucometer Elite blood glucose test strips with 1.1–33.3 mmol/liter sensitivity. Serum total cholesterol and triacyglycerol concentrations were measured using a commercial diagnostic assay (kit number 352 for total cholesterol and kit number 339 for triacylglycerols, respectively, from Sigma). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and stained by immunoblotting with affinity-purified rabbit anti-calreticulin or anti-calcineurin antibodies (12Michalak M.

Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tissue, and the presence of the disrupted calreticulin gene was verified either by Southern blotting or PCR (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The calcineurin transgene was detected by PCR using the 5′ primer 5′-TATCTCCCCCATAAGAGTTT-3′ (α-MHC promoter region) and the 3′ primer 5′-TGATCCCCCAACTTCAAACAACTTCA-3′ (calcineurin-coding region) using Pfu polymerase. Southern blot analysis was also carried out using theXbaI-SalI (430 bp) DNA fragment derived from pBS-α-MHC calcineurin plasmid (originally used to generate the transgenic mice) as a probe. The activation of calcineurin normally requires a sustained Ca2+ release by the IP3-dependent pathway (13Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A., Ho, S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), but the deletion of the C-terminal 200 amino acid residues from calcineurin yields a fully active and constitutive phosphatase (referred to throughout this paper as “activated calcineurin”) (10O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The functionality of activated calcineurin in the absence of calreticulin was established by analysis of the nuclear translocation of GFP-NF-ATc1, a substrate of calcineurin (5Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In the absence of activated calcineurin, GFP-NF-ATc1 did not translocate to the nucleus in wild-type or calreticulin-deficient cells (Fig. 1, left panels). However, in the presence of activated calcineurin, GFP-NF-ATc1 rapidly translocated to the nucleus in both cell types (Fig. 1, right panels). These results demonstrate that activated calcineurin does not require agonist-induced Ca2+ signal and it is fully functional in the absence of calreticulin. Cardiac-specific expression of activated calcineurin was achieved using the α-MHC promoter (8Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N.

The progeny of this cross were interbred with crt +/− mice to produce calcineurin transgenic mice that were heterozygous for the inactivated calreticulin allele. The crt +/− mice expressing activated calcineurin in the heart (designatedcrt +/− :activated CaN) were viable and fertile. These mice were crossed to produce calreticulin-deficient mice with active calcineurin in the heart (crt −/− :activated CaN). Surprisingly, the expected Mendelian ratios ofcrt +/+ , crt +/− , andcrt −/− mice were obtained up to embryonic day (E) 17.5 from serial-timed mating experiments (TableI). This feature was not evident in calreticulin-deficient mice with normal calcineurin at E14.5 (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J.

Western blot analysis with anti-calcineurin antibodies revealed that a low level of endogenous calcineurin was expressed in hearts from wild-type and crt −/− E17.5 embryos (Fig. 2 A). Importantly, there was a significant expression of activated (truncated) calcineurin in hearts from crt +/− :activated CaN andcrt −/− :activated CaN E17.5 embryos (Fig. 2 A). In agreement with previous reports, the histological analysis of heart from the crt −/− embryos revealed deep intertrabecular recesses and increased fenestration associated with the thinner ventricular wall (Fig. 2 B) (2Mesaeli N.

In stark contrast to the crt −/− embryos, thecrt −/− :activated CaN embryos did not show these defects in cardiac development (Fig. 2 B). Histological analysis of crt +/− :activated CaN andcrt −/− :activated CaN embryos showed normal development of the ventricular wall with signs of early hypertrophy probably due to the expression of activated calcineurin (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, we examined whether the overexpression of activated calcineurin permitted the completion of the embryonic program to allow for live birth of crt −/− pups. Surprisingly, the crossing of crt +/− :activated CaN males with crt +/− :activated CaN females produced live crt −/− :activated CaN pups. Thus, full-term development in this mouse strain was no longer dependent on calreticulin. Immunoblot analysis of cardiac tissue taken from 4-week-old crt +/− :activated CaN andcrt −/− :activated CaN showed that endogenous calcineurin and activated calcineurin transgene were expressed in the heart in these mice (Fig. 3). Furthermore, there was a >15-fold increased expression of activated calcineurin when compared with the endogenous protein. The expression of activated calcineurin was also significantly increased in comparison with expression of the protein in E17.5 embryonic heart.Table IGenotypes of progeny from intercrosses between crt +/− :activated-CaN males and crt +/− :activated-CaN femalesAgeNumber of littermatescrt +/+1crt +/−1crt −/−1E14.54584 (25%)162 (49%)77 (24%)E17.52036 (24%)80 (54%)34 (23%)Cardiac-specific expression of activated calcineurin was driven by the α-MHC promoter (8Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R.

At birth, calreticulin-deficient mice (crt −/− :activated CaN) were overtly indistinguishable from their wild-type (crt +/+ :activated CaN) and heterozygous (crt +/− :activated CaN) littermates. However, all of the homozygote calreticulin knock-out mice (crt −/− :activated CaN) showed significant growth retardation after the first week of life (Fig. 3) and died 3–5 weeks after birth. Importantly, histological analysis did not show any significant differences in cardiac morphology amongcrt +/+ :activated CaN,crt +/− :activated CaN, andcrt −/− :activated CaN mice (Fig. 4). Cardiac hypertrophy was noted in these mice (Fig. 4), and this is probably attributable to marked overexpression of activated calcineurin (8Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). Remarkably,crt −/− :activated CaN mice had a thick ventricular wall comprised of several layers of cardiomyocytes. These observations are in sharp contrast to the severely impaired development of the ventricular wall in the hearts of crt −/− -deficient mice as documented in our earlier study (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). These findings illustrate that the expression of activated calcineurin in calreticulin-deficient hearts is sufficient to restore ventricular development in the absence of calreticulin. Intercrosses betweencrt +/− :activated CaN males andcrt +/− :activated CaN females was essential for the rescue. Importantly, homozygote transgenic mice with respect to the activated calcineurin transgene had to be used in all experiments. This is probably because a higher gene dosage of activated CaN was required for efficient rescue of calreticulin-deficient mice. Interestingly, the overexpression of calcineurin and calreticulin are detrimental to normal function of mature heart. High calcineurin phosphatase activity in postnatal hearts leads to hypertrophy and heart failure (8Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar), and forced expression of calreticulin in newborn heart causes complete heart block and sudden death (16Nakamura K. Robertson M. Liu G. Dickie P. Guo J.Q. Duff H.J. Opas M. Kavanagh K. Michalak M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The concept that emerges from these studies is that the temporal regulation of calreticulin gene expression is critical for normal heart development and function. Although expression of activated calcineurin reversed embryonic lethality because of calreticulin deficiency, the surviving mice exhibited postnatal pathology. Of the fivecrt −/− :activated CaN mice born, two died after 5 weeks, two died after 3 weeks, and one died after 1 week. An analysis of blood from crt −/− :activated CaN mice indicated hypoglycemia as early as the first week of postnatal life (Fig. 5). In addition, the “milky” appearance of the serum was indicative of aberrant lipid metabolism. Indeed, biochemical analysis of serum fromcrt −/− :activated CaN mice revealed significantly increased levels of cholesterol (over 4-fold) and triacylglycerols (over 9-fold) (Fig. 5). The underlying cause for these metabolic aberrations is not yet clear, but the results suggest the importance of calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum for normal energy homeostasis after birth. The remarkable finding in this study is that the reconstitution of the Ca2+-signaling cascade in crt −/− mice with a constitutively active variant of calcineurin permits the proper progression of cardiac development during embryogenesis. These findings support our view that Ca2+-dependent cardiac-specific transcriptional processes may be impaired in the absence of calreticulin (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Studies on cardiac differentiation of calreticulin-deficient embryonic stem cells further support this notion (17Li J. Puceat M. Perez-Terzic C. Mery A. Nakamura K. Michalak M. Krause K.-H. Jaconi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes derived from calreticulin-deficient cells have severely disrupted myofibrillogenesis and impaired nuclear translocation of Mef2c transcription factor (17Li J. Puceat M. Perez-Terzic C. Mery A. Nakamura K. Michalak M. Krause K.-H. Jaconi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most importantly, this phenotype can be rescued with Ca2+ionophore, indicating that specific Ca2+-dependent pathways essential for cardiac development may not be functional in the absence of calreticulin (17Li J. Puceat M. Perez-Terzic C. Mery A. Nakamura K. Michalak M. Krause K.-H. Jaconi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here we show that the expression of activated calcineurin, a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, reverses embryonic lethality in calreticulin-deficient mice. Fig. 6 shows a putative model describing the relationship between calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and calcineurin in the cytoplasm during cardiac development. Under normal physiological conditions, calreticulin is an important Ca2+ storage chaperone in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for agonist-induced IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura K. Zuppini A.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Sustained Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum is required for the activation of calcineurin and subsequent activation of calcineurin-dependent pathways including transcriptional processes (Fig. 6, left panel). In the absence of calreticulin, IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum in response to agonists is severely impaired (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S. Lynch J. Ahsan I. Krause R.

Consequently, the endogenous calcineurin may not be fully activated, resulting in the failure to stimulate key Ca2+- and calcineurin-dependent pathways critical for cardiac development (Fig. 6, middle panel). Incrt −/− mice, this defect in Ca2+signaling manifests in impaired cardiac development, leading to embryonic lethality (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the expression of activated calcineurin bypasses the requirement for agonist-induced InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release (2Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar,7Nakamura K. Zuppini A. Arnaudeau S. Lynch J. Ahsan I. Krause R.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), thereby allowing activation of calcineurin-dependent pathways to occur in the absence of calreticulin (Fig. 6, right panel). The importance of calreticulin in Ca2+homeostasis as well as in protein folding and quality control are generally accepted (1Michalak M. Corbett E.F. Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that calcineurin-dependent pathways are the molecular basis for the rescue of calreticulin-deficient phenotype in mice. Calreticulin is an integral and essential component of cellular Ca2+homeostasis, and it may be a key upstream regulator of calcineurin function in the Ca2+ signaling cascade.

https://openalex.org/W2057924177,"We present evidence here that Erbin is a negative regulator of the Ras-Raf-Erk signaling pathway. Expression of Erbin decreases transcription of the AChR ε-subunit gene, an event that is mediated by Erk activation. Although it interacts with the ErbB2 C terminus through the PDZ domain, Erbin has no effect on ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation or binding to the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2. In contrast, expression of Erbin greatly impairs activation of Erk, but not Akt, by ligands that activate receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, Erbin inhibits the Erk activation by active Ras, while it fails to do so in the presence of active Raf-1. Erbin associates with active Ras, but not inactive Ras nor Raf. Consistently, Erbin interferes with the interaction between Ras and Raf both in vivo and in vitro. Finally, overexpression of Erbin leads to inhibition of NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, whereas down-regulation of endogenous Erbin by specific siRNA exhibits an opposite effect.

Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 2Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). As exemplified by binding to growth factors such as EGF, receptor tyrosine kinases are activated and undergo autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues (3Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar, 4Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues recruit adaptor proteins to the plasma membrane by directly interacting with modules including Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB). Grb2, one of such adaptors, brings guanyl nucleotide exchange factor (SOS) to the plasma membrane in proximity with Ras and expedites exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras (5Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Activated Ras (GTP-bound) then directly binds to Raf and allows the latter to be activated (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar,6Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Active Raf triggers sequential activation of MEK, a MAPK kinase, and Erk, leading to phosphorylation of various regulatory proteins including nuclear transcription factors such as Elk-1 and Myc as well as many cytoplasmic proteins (7Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 8Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Loffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the past, extensive efforts have been made to identify factors that participate in regulation of the Ras-Raf-Erk pathway. Several modulators have been identified that positively influence the pathway at different levels. For example, the MEK partner 1 (MP1) was isolated as a binding protein that interacts with both MEK1 and Erk1 to enhance the efficiency of Erk phosphorylation by MEK (9Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). A second protein is the kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) that is believed to act as a scaffold for Raf-1, MEK, and Erk (10Li W. Han M. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). The Connector enhancer of KSR (CNK) directly binds to Raf and is involved in activation of the Raf/MEK/Erk pathway (11Therrien M. Wong A.M. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 343-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Sur-8 is an interesting protein that contains multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (12Sieburth D.S. Sun Q. Han M. Cell. 1998; 94: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and binds to both Ras and Raf-1. Although Ras can directly associates with Raf upon activation, the presence of Sur-8 increases the interaction between Ras and Raf and the activation of downstream signaling events (10Li W. Han M. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 895-900PubMed Google Scholar). These non-enzymatic factors are important regulators for normal cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, there are negative regulators of the Ras pathway in cells. Sprouty, a Ras suppressor in Drosophila and its mammalian homologue Spred (Sprouty-relatedEVH1 domain-containing protein) appear to serve as negative feedback regulators of growth factor-mediated Erk pathway (13Wakioka T.

Wakioka T. Kato R. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36804-36808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Ras effector RIN1 has been shown to inhibit Ras-induced activation of Raf by competitively binding to active Ras (15Wang Y. Waldron R.T. Dhaka A. Patel A. Riley M.M. Rozengurt E. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Additionally, the Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), initially isolated as a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, binds directly to the kinase domains of both Raf and MEK and inhibit MEK phosphorylation (16Yeung K. Seitz T., Li, S. Janosch P. McFerran B. Kaiser C. Fee F. Katsanakis K.D. Rose D.W. Mischak H. Sedivy J.M. Kolch W. Nature. 1999; 401: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). These negative regulators are important to ensure that all programs are adequately executed through autonomous turn-on and -off mechanisms. In addition, they may counterbalance overamplified proliferative signals that are caused by Ras mutation frequently occurring in human cancers. Such an inhibitory mechanism is key to maintaining normal cell growth rate or function. Erbin is a protein that was identified as a binding partner for ErbB2, delta-catenin, and ARVCF (17Borg J.-P.

Unexpectedly, Erbin was found to inhibit AChR subunit transcription, an event that requires Erk activation (23Altiok N. Altiok S. Changeux J.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Si J.

This study presents evidence that Ras-mediated Erk activation is indeed negatively regulated by Erbin. We have explored the possible mechanism by which Erbin inhibits Erk activation. Our results identify Erbin as a novel suppressor of the Ras signaling. The human Erbin N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–391) consisting of 16 LRRs was generated by PCR amplification using sense primer containing BamHI and antisense primer containing XhoI. The resulting 1.2 kb-fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI, and subcloned in the BamHI-SalI sites of yeast vector pGBT9 downstream of the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Clontech). Myc-Erbin LRR, Myc-ErbinΔ965–1371 and Myc-ErbinΔPDZ were generated by introducing a stop codon after the LRR domain following amino acids 965 or 1279 in pRK5-Myc-Erbin (19Huang Y.Z. Wang Q.

The N-terminal deletion mutant (pRK5-Erbin965) was described previously (19Huang Y.Z. Wang Q. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4395-4405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells and COS-1 cells were cultured as described previously (29Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W.

The C2C12 cells were maintained as undifferentiated myoblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5% chicken embryo extract. Fusing of myoblasts into myotubes was induced by culturing myoblasts for 48 h in differentiation medium DM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 4% horse serum). Mouse lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells and breast cancer MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. HEK293, COS-1, and C2C12 cells were transfected with the standard calcium phosphate technique (29Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M., Du, Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). PC12 cells and Mv1Lu cells were transfected with SuperFect (Qiagen). Two days after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the modified RIPA buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and protease inhibitors (25Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Lysed cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant was designated as cell lysates. Cell lysates (∼400 μg of protein) were incubated without or with indicated antibodies 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently with protein A- or protein G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. After centrifugation, beads were washed five times with the modified RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with the SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the blocking buffer containing Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) containing 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with indicated antibodies in the blocking buffer. After washing three times for 5 min each with TBS-T, membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit IgG (AmershamBiosciences), or anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by washing. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). In some experiments, the nitrocellulose filter was incubated in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min, and washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in 50 mm TBS at room temperature for 1 h, and reblotted with different antibodies. The following antibodies were used: FLAG (M2, Sigma), Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-MAPK (Promega), phospho-Akt (Ser-473, New England Biolab), H-Ras (238, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Erbin (19Huang Y.Z. Wang Q. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19318-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with or without Myc-Erbin, plus the ε-subunit promoter-luciferase transgene that contains 416 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region of the ε-subunit gene (25Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and a control plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega). 24 h after transfection, myoblasts were incubated in DM to induce myotube formation. Myotube formation was complete 48 h after switch to DM. The C2C12 myotubes were stimulated with NRG at a final concentration of 10 nm at 37 °C for 24 h. Mv1Lu cells were transiently transfected with the promoter reporter construct p3TP-Lux, which contains three AP-1 sites and the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter (30Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), and firefly luciferase gene. pRL-SV40 (Promega) that express Renilla luciferase under the control of SV40 promoter was cotransfected as a control to monitor the transfection efficiency. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and activities of the two different luciferases were assayed with respective substrates with a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). PC12 cells were cotransfected pEGFP-C1 with empty vector pRK5-Myc, Myc-Erbin or its mutants, or Erbin-siRNA duplex. 48 h after transfection, PC12 cells were stimulated by 100 ng/ml or 20 ng/ml NGF for 2 days. Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Cells with processes 1.5 times longer than the diameter of the cell body were considered to be differentiated. The target region of siRNA was 540 nucleotides downstream of the start codon (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar), which contained ∼50% G/C content. The nucleotide sequence was 5′-UAG ACU GAC CCA GCU GGA A dTdT-3′ (nucleotides 866–884) (27Borg J.P. Marchetto S., Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We searched the NCBI sequence bank against this segment of DNA using the BLAST program, which revealed no match, suggesting of the specificity of target recognition by siRNA. The 21-nucleotide RNAs were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. Synthetic oligonucleotides were deprotected and gel-purified. To demonstrate the silencing effect of endogenous Erbin expression by siRNA, cells in a 60-mm culture dish were co-transfected with empty vector pEGFP-C1 and with siRNA duplex using SuperFect. Briefly, 2 μg of pEGFP-C1 and 30 μl of 20 μm Erbin-siRNA duplex were mixed with 300 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After incubating 10 min at room temperature, add Opti-MEM to obtain a final volume of 1 ml. Cells were incubated with the mixture for 2–3 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before the addition of 5 ml of growth medium. 72 h after transfection, cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. GFP-positive cells were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with the CellQuest software. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer, and lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for expression of Erbin. In parallel experiments, GFP-positive PC12 cells were scored for differentiation. Protein was assayed with Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that NRG-induced AChR expression requires ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Ras-Raf-Erk signaling pathway (23–26,33). We speculated that Erbin, interacting with ErbB2, may play a role in regulating NRG signaling. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of Erbin on the promoter activity of ε416-Luc, a transgene reporter that contains 416 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region of the ε-subunit gene (25Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Expression of this transgene is up-regulated by NRG or active forms of Ras and Raf and requires Erk activation (25Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Fu A.K., Fu, W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W., Ip, F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that Erbin inhibited expression of the ε416-Luc transgene in control as well as NRG-stimulated muscle cells (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that Erbin may regulate the Erk activation. To test this hypothesis, we characterized effects of Erbin on Erk1 activation in COS-1 cells. FLAG-Erk1 was activated in response to NRG in cells cotransfected with ErbB4 (Fig. 1 B) (29Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M., Du, Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Erbin caused a decrease in phospho-Erk (Fig. 1 B) and as well as Erk kinase activity (Fig. 1 C), indicating that Erbin negatively regulates the Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk pathway. The inhibitory effect of Erbin featured the following: 1) It was dose-dependent (Fig. 1 D). 2) Erbin did not seem to delay the peak Erk activation that usually occurred within 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 1 E, Ref. 25Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 3) The inhibition was not growth factor-specific. The expression of Erbin inhibited EGF- and NGF-induced Erk activation (Fig. 1 F and data not shown); and 4) it was Erk activation-specific, since expression of Erbin had no apparent effect on NRG activation of Akt (Fig. 1 G). Thus, the results demonstrate that Erbin specifically inhibits Erk activation with no effect on the PI 3-kinase pathway. To identify the domain that inhibits the Erk activation, we examined the effect of a series of Erbin mutants (Fig. 2 A). The results revealed that the inhibition of Erk did not require PDZ domain (Fig. 2 B), which is essential for interaction with ErbB2 (19Huang Y.Z. Wang Q. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19318-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Borg J.P. Marchetto S., Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) or the region between the LRR domain and the PDZ domain (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, deletion of the LRR domain disabled Erbin to inhibit Erk activation (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the LRR domain was sufficient to mediate the inhibitory effect (Fig. 2 B). These results are in agreement with the differentiation assay (see Fig. 5) and point to an important role of Erbin in regulating the Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk pathway.Figure 5Erbin inhibition of PC12 cell differentiation. A, PC12 cells were cotransfected with pEGFP-C1 and empty vector pRK5-Myc or wild-type Erbin, LRR domain, or C-terminal domain of Erbin.

Two days after transfection, GFP-positive cells were sorted and lysed in RIPA buffer. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Erbin, Erk1, and GFP antibodies. D, increase in NRG-activated Erk activity in Erbin-siRNA expressing cells. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-Erk1 and Erbin-siRNA, which were then challenged with NRG for 10 min. Erk activation was assayed as in the legend to Fig. 1. Equal amounts of FLAG-Erk1 was shown in a reblot of the same membrane in a representative experiment. E, increase in differentiated PC12 cells by Erbin-siRNA. PC12 cells cultured on 12-well plates were cotransfected with pEGFP-C1 either alone or with Erbin-siRNA (10 μm), or with missense RNA (10 μm) as a control.

Asterisk,p < 0.01, Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we attempted to dissect the position for Erbin action by walking upstream of Erk. Since Erbin directly interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of ErbB2, it is possible that Erbin interferes with the tyrosine kinase activation and/or subsequently binding to adaptor proteins. To test these hypotheses, we employed NeuT, an active form of ErbB2 (34Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). When expressed in COS-1 cells, NeuT was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3 A), resulting in an increase in the promoter activity of p3TP-Lux (Fig. 3 B). When NeuT was immunoprecipitated, association of Shc and Grb2 could be easily detected (Fig. 3 A). Coexpression of Erbin had no effect on either tyrosine phosphorylation of NeuT or its association with Shc and Grb2 (Fig. 3 A). However, the NeuT-induced promoter activity of 3TP was greatly inhibited by Erbin (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the site of Erbin action is downstream of the adaptor proteins. Thus, we examined whether Erbin inhibits Erk activation by Raf or Ras. Since expression of the active Raf can bypass the requirement of upstream components for the MEK/Erk activation (7Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), Erbin would attenuate Erk activation by active Raf, if Erbin acts downstream of Raf. The results in Fig. 3, C and D showed that coexpression of Erbin with active Raf did not have an effect on Erk activation. In contrast, Erk activation by active Ras was evidently inhibited (lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 3, Cand D). These results suggest that Erbin acts between Raf and Ras. In considering the mechanism of Erbin-induced inhibition of the Erk pathway, it is reasonable to postulate that Erbin inhibits the interaction between active Ras and Raf by competitive binding to either of them. To test this, active Ras (FLAG-RasV12) was coexpressed with GST-Raf1 into HEK293 cell. As shown in Fig. 4 A, FLAG-RasV12 was found to copurify with GST-Raf1. In a reciprocal experiment, Raf1 was also detected in the immunoprecipitates of active Ras. Remarkably, coexpression of Erbin decreased the interaction between active Ras and Raf. In an alternative experiment, we employed the Ras pull-down assay developed by Rooij and Bos, which takes advantage of high affinity of GTP-Ras for the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 as compared with GDP-Ras (35de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The RBD (amino acids 50–150) was expressed as a GST fusion protein and used to pull down GTP-Ras that had been activated in cells cotransfected with or without Erbin. Basal Ras binding to RBD was usually very low in control or Erbin-expressing cells. The effect of Erbin, if any, on Ras-RBD binding was inconsistence. However, in cells transfected with FLAG-Ras, GST-Raf-RBD could pull-down activated Ras (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Expression of Erbin inhibited the interaction of Raf with growth factor-activated Ras, which was accompanied by a decrease in phospho-Erk (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). These results suggest that Erbin inhibits the Erk pathway by disrupting the interaction between active Ras and Raf. Because our data did not support Erbin interaction with Raf1 (Fig. 4 A), we attempted to determine whether Erbin associated with Ras. In this experiment recombinant Erbin was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells cotransfected with a constitutively active mutant of Ras (V12) or a dominant negative mutant of Ras (N17). The resulting immunocomplex was probed with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 C, only the active Ras (V12) was co-immunoprecipitated with Erbin, suggesting that transfected Erbin and active Ras may interact in cells. We employed the yeast two-hybrid system to determine whether Erbin and active Ras interact directly. Yeast Y190 cells were cotransformed with pACT2-RasV12 and pGBT9-LRR, which contains the LRR domain of Erbin. Cotransformation of Ras and Erbin did not result in a significant change in β-galactosidase activity as compared with the negative control, while the interaction between Ras and Raf was evidently detected (36Luo Z.J.

The Nef-1, Nef-2, and Nef-3 proteins were expressed in High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) infected with the baculoviruses and bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences). The bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 mglycine/HCl, pH 2.5, and immediately neutralized to pH 7.5 with 1.5m Tris followed by dialysis against PBS. The purified proteins were frozen and stored at −80 °C until use. pGEX-PAK-CRIB was a gift of Dr. S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan).

For the assay by scanning electron microscopy, Nef-3- or human IgG-coated microbeads were prepared2 (38Fukuhara A. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takekuni K. Kawakatsu T. Ikeda W. Yamada A. Katata T. Honda T.

Briefly, latex-sulfate micro-beads (3 × 108; 5.2-μm diameter; Interfacial Dynamics Corporation, Portland, OR) were washed, resuspended in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated with 0.1 mg of a goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) polyclonal antibody (pAb) (Sigma) with gentle mixing at room temperature for 18 h. The beads were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and washed with 1 ml of PBS three times. The beads were incubated with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 3 h. The bead suspension (0.2 ml, 6 × 107 beads) was then incubated with 30 μg of Nef-3 or 50 μg of human IgG at room temperature for 3 h. After the incubation, the beads were washed with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.5% BSA three times and re-suspended in 0.2 ml of PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The human IgG-coated beads were used as control beads. Nectin-1-EL cells were cultured on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS for 12 h, and then Nef-3- or human IgG-coated beads were added. The cells were further cultured for 60 min and then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol and dried with liquid CO2. The samples were then coated with platinum (EIKO, IB-5) and analyzed at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV by a Hitachi S-800 scanning electron microscope. For the assay by confocal laser scanning microscopy, coverslips were coated with Nef-1, Nef-2, Nef-3, or human IgG (50 μg/ml) for 15 h and blocked with 1% BSA in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 1 h. Each cell line except the nectin-1-EL cell line was washed with PBS, incubated with 0.2% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min, and dispersed gently by pipetting. Nectin-1-EL cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 0.01% trypsin and 1 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C for 15 min, and dispersed by pipetting. The dispersed cells were then suspended in DMEM containing 10% FCS. The cells (1.0 × 104) were placed on the coverslip pre-coated with each Nef or human IgG as a control in a 24-well dish and cultured for indicated periods of time. The cells were then fixed, followed by immunostaining. Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured cells was done as described (4Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M.

Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of Nef-3 or human IgG (Sigma) was preclustered using 10 μg of the anti-human IgG pAb in 50 μl of PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Nectin-1-MDCK cells (3 × 106) were cultured in DMEM without FCS for 24 h. The cells were further cultured with Nef-3 or human IgG preclustered by the anti-human IgG pAb in 1 ml of DMEM for indicated periods of time. After being washed with ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm(p-amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) containing 20 μg of recombinant GST·PAK·CRIB and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The cleared lysates were then incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, the beads were washed with 0.5 ml of the lysis buffer three times. Cdc42 and Rac bound to the beads were eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Cdc42 (Transduction Laboratories) and anti-Rac (Upstate Biotechnology) monoclonal Abs, respectively. The whole cell lysates were also analyzed for the presence of Cdc42 and Rac for normalization. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done as described (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The amounts of recombinant proteins were determined with BSA as a standard protein by densitometric tracing of protein bands stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (41Weber K. Pringle J.R. Osborn M. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that when the microbeads coated with Nef-3 are put on the surface of nectin-1-EL cells (L cells stably expressing exogenous nectin-1α and E-cadherin) and the cells are cultured, Nef-3 trans-interacts with cellular nectin-1 and recruits cellular nectin-1 and then E-cadherin to the bead-cell contact sites.2 When these bead-cell contact sites were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, filopodia and lamellipodia were observed over the surface of the beads (Fig. 1 a). Such structures were not observed with the microbeads coated with human IgG as a control (Fig. 1 b). When nectin-1-EL cells were cultured on the coverslips coated with Nef-3 in the dishes, the cells first formed filopodia and then lamellipodia (Fig. 2,a1, b1, and c1). In the control experiments using IgG instead of Nef-3, the cells formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a much lesser extent (Fig. 2, a2,b2, and c2). Nef-3 formed filopodia and lamellipodia in wild-type EL cells but less than in nectin-1-EL cells(Fig. 3 a1, and see also Fig. 2 c1), whereas IgG formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a lesser extent in wild-type EL cells (Fig. 3 a2). When nectin-1-L cells (L cells stably expressing exogenous nectin-1α alone) were used instead of nectin-1-EL cells, Nef-3 showed similar effects to those obtained with nectin-1-EL cells (Fig. 3 b1, and see also Fig. 2 c1), whereas IgG formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a much lesser extent (Fig. 3 b2). When wild-type L cells were used, Nef-3 showed similar effects to those obtained with wild-type EL cells (Fig. 3 c1, and see also Fig. 3 a1), whereas IgG formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a lesser extent (Fig. 3 c2). These results indicate that the trans-interaction of nectin-1 and nectin-3 forms filopodia and lamellipodia in a manner independent of E-cadherin.Figure 2Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis on the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia by thetrans-interaction of nectin-1 with Nef-3.Nectin-1-EL cells were cultured on the coverslips coated with Nef-3 or human IgG for indicated periods of time.

Wild-type 3Y1 cells expressed the endogenous nectin-1 protein (data not shown). Nef-3 furthermore formed filopodia and lamellipodia in nectin-1-MDCK cells (MDCK cells stably expressing exogenous nectin-1α) (Fig. 4B, a1, b1, andc1 ), whereas IgG formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a negligible extent (Fig. 4 B, a2,b2, and c2). The time courses of the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia in nectin-1-MDCK cells were not significantly different. These results indicate that thetrans-interaction of nectin-1 and nectin-3 forms filopodia and lamellipodia in a variety of cell lines. When nectin-3-L cells and Nef-1 were used, essentially the same results as those observed with nectin-1-L cells and Nef-3 (Fig. 5 a3 ) were obtained (Fig. 5 c1). When nectin-1-L cells and Nef-3 were used, essentially the same results were obtained, although the Nef-3 effects were less than those on nectin-1-L cells (Fig. 5 b3, and see also Fig. 5 a3). Essentially the same results were obtained with other combinations such as nectin-1-L cells and Nef-1 (Fig. 5 a1), nectin-2-L cells and Nef-2 (Fig. 5 b2), nectin-3-L cells and Nef-2 (Fig. 5 c2), and nectin-3-L cells and Nef-3 (Fig. 5 c3), although their effects and the time courses varied depending on nectins and Nefs. Nectin-1 does nottrans-interact with nectin-2 (15Satoh-Horikawa K. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishimura M. Tachibana K. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10291-10299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Nef-1 and Nef-2 were inactive on nectin-2-L and nectin-1-L cells, respectively (Fig. 5,b1 and a2). IgG as a control formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a much lesser extent in nectin-1-L, nectin-2-L, and nectin-3-L cells (Fig. 5, a4, b4, andc4). These effects of Nefs were apparently parallel to the activities of homo- and hetero-trans-interactions of nectins to induce the aggregation of L cells2 (15Satoh-Horikawa K. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishimura M. Tachibana K. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10291-10299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the homo- and hetero-trans-interactions of nectins transduce signals bidirectionally and form filopodia and lamellipodia. Cdc42 and Rac are involved in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively (for a review, see Ref. 42Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). We next examined with the use of nectin-1-L cells and Nef-3 whether these small G proteins are involved in the Nef-3 effects. NWASP-CRIB specifically binds to GTP-Cdc42 and suppresses the Cdc42 action (for a review, see Ref. 43Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NWASP-CRIB in nectin-1-L cells cultured on the Nef-3-coated coverslips reduced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia (Fig. 6,a1–a4). N17Rac1, a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, inhibits the production of GTP-Rac (44Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GFP-N17Rac1 reduced the formation of lamellipodia but not that of filopodia (Fig. 6, b1–b4). In contrast, overexpression of GFP alone inhibited neither the formation of filopodia nor that of lamellipodia (Fig. 6,c1–c4). These results suggest that Nef-3-formed filopodia and lamellipodia are mediated through the activation of Cdc42 and Rac, respectively. Overexpression of C3, which inhibits the Rho actions, resulted in rounding up the cells, and we could not judge whether Rho is involved in the Nef-3 effects (data not shown). We then examined whether Nef-3 induces the activation of Cdc42 and Rac in nectin-1-L cells. When GFP-Cdc42 or GFP-Rac1 was transiently expressed in nectin-1-L cells, and these cells were cultured with the Nef-3-coated beads, GFP-Cdc42 and GFP-Rac1 were highly concentrated at the bead-cell contact sites (Fig. 7 A,a1 and b1 ). However, neither GFP-Cdc42 nor GFP-Rac1 was concentrated at the IgG-coated bead-cell contact sites (Fig. 7 A, a2 and b2). These results suggest that the trans-interaction of nectin-1 with Nef-3 induces the activation of Cdc42 and Rac at the Nef-3-coated bead-cell contact sites. We next measured the formation of GTP-Cdc42 and GTP-Rac by pull-down assay using GST·PAK·CRIB. The expression levels of the endogenous Cdc42 and Rac proteins in nectin-1-L cells were hardly detectable by Western blotting (data not shown), whereas the expression levels of these proteins in nectin-1-MDCK cells were detectable (Fig. 7 B, a and b). Therefore, we used nectin-1-MDCK cells for the pull-down assay. First, we detached nectin-1-MDCK cells from a cell culture dish and then replated them on the Nef-3-coated dish in the same way as that shown in Fig. 4 B. This detachment caused elevation of the levels of GTP-Cdc42 and GTP-Rac, and the elevated levels did not decrease to the basal levels for at least 1 h after the replating (data not shown). Therefore, we cultured nectin-1-MDCK cells for 24 h and then stimulated the cells by adding the medium containing soluble Nef-3, which was preclustered by the anti-human IgG pAb. After being stimulated by soluble Nef-3 for 15, 30, and 60 min, nectin-1-MDCK cells were washed with PBS and immediately lysed on the dish with the lysis buffer containing GST·PAK·CRIB. The lysates were subjected to the pull-down assay. The level of GTP-Cdc42 started to increase at 30 min after the addition of soluble Nef-3 (Fig. 7 Ba), whereas the level of GTP-Cdc42 did not change by the addition of human IgG as a control. The level of GTP-Rac also started to increase at 30 min after the addition of soluble Nef-3 (Fig. 7 Bb), whereas the level of GTP-Rac did not change with the addition of human IgG. These results indicate that Nef-3 indeed induces the activation of Cdc42 and Rac. We could not practically observe different time courses between the activation of Cdc42 and Rac by this assay. We examined whether the Nef-3 effects are dependent on the association of nectins with afadin. In nectin-1-ΔC-L cells stably expressing C-terminal four aa-deleted nectin-1α incapable of binding afadin, Nef-3 formed filopodia and lamellipodia to extents similar to those observed with nectin-1-L cells (Fig. 8 a1, and see also Fig.3b1), indicating that the association of nectins with afadin is not essential for the Nef-3 effects. In contrast, nectin-1-ΔC-L cells on the IgG-coated coverslips formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a much lesser extent (Fig. 8 a2). We then examined whether the Nef-3 effects are dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of nectins. For this experiment, we used nectin-2-L cells. Nef-3 formed filopodia and lamellipodia in nectin-2-L cells (see Fig. 5 b3), whereas IgG formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a much lesser extent (see Fig. 5 b4). We attempted to make L cells stably expressing the nectin-2α mutant consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains and the first six aa of the cytoplasmic tail (aa 1–383). However, this mutant was not sorted into the plasma membrane (data not shown). Therefore, we expressed the nectin-2/TEM5 chimera protein, the fragment of nectin-2α containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains, which is fused to the cytoplasmic tail of TEM5 in L cells. This protein was sorted into the plasma membrane (data not shown). TEM5 is a seven-pass transmembrane protein of which function is unknown (45Carson-Walter E. Watkins D.N. Nanda A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. St. Croix B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6649-6655PubMed Google Scholar). Nef-3 formed filopodia and lamellipodia to a small extent in L cells transiently expressing the nectin-2/TEM5 chimera protein (Fig. 8 b1). The extent of this effect of Nef-3 was less than that obtained with nectin-2-L cells (see Fig. 5 b3) and similar to that obtained with wild-type L cells (see Fig. 3 c1). The effect of Nef-3 on L cells expressing the nectin-2/TEM5 chimera protein may be due to the endogenously expressed nectins in L cells. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of nectins is essential for the Nef-3 effects. We have shown here by the use of Nefs that the homo- and hetero-trans-interactions of nectins form filopodia and lamellipodia in a manner independent of E-cadherin. The formation of filopodia and lamellipodia in this way is reduced by an inhibitor of Cdc42 (NWASP-CRIB), whereas the formation of lamellipodia but not of filopodia is reduced by a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (N17Rac1). We have moreover shown that the trans-interactions of nectins induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac. We have previously shown in L cells that a dominant active mutant of Cdc42 (V12Cdc42) induces the formation of filopodia but not of lamellipodia, whereas a dominant active mutant of Rac1 (V12Rac1) induces only the formation of lamellipodia, indicating that Cdc42 alone does not activate Rac in this cell line (36Ono Y. Nakanishi H. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Satoh-Horikawa K. Mandai K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3050-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is likely in L cells that thetrans-interactions of nectins induce the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia through the respective activation of Cdc42 and Rac and that the activation of Cdc42 is necessary, but not sufficient, for the activation of Rac, whereas the activation of Rac is not necessary for the activation of Cdc42. We have moreover shown here that the effects of the trans-interactions of nectins require their cytoplasmic tail but not their association with afadin. It remains unknown how Cdc42 is activated by thetrans-interactions of nectins, but thetrans-interactions of nectins may induce the activation of a GDP/GTP exchange protein (GEP) for Cdc42 by the direct or indirect binding of the GEP to the cytoplasmic tail of nectins. It also remains unknown how Rac1 is activated by the trans-interactions of nectins, but the trans-interactions of nectins may induce the activation of a GEP for Rac1 in cooperation with Cdc42. Three functions of the nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 are conceivable. 1) the nectin-induced activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton through their F-actin-binding downstream effectors such as NWASP, IQGAP, and IRSp53-WAVE (43Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the process of the AJ formation. When the two migrating cells meet through the protrusions, such as Cdc42-induced filopodia and Rac1-induced lamellipodia, primordial spot-like junctions are formed followed by maturation to AJs. We have previously proposed that nectins firsttrans-interact to form micro-clusters, which then recruit E-cadherin at the initial cell-cell contact sites, resulting in the formation of the mixture of the nectin- and cadherin-based micro-clusters.2 These primordial junctions fuse with each other to form short line-like junctions, which develop into more maturated AJs. Once nectins trans-interact, they reorganize the actin cytoskeleton through the respective activation of Cdc42 and Rac1, which in turn enhance the formation of maturated AJs. Thetrans-interaction of E-cadherin further reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton through the activation of Rac1 (26Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Par6 is a downstream effector of Cdc42 and Rac (46Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Par3 has recently been shown to directly associate with the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) (46Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and we have recently found that nectins are involved in the localization of JAM at tight junctions (38Fukuhara A. Irie K.

https://openalex.org/W2090484067,"The nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B associates with the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin and may regulate cadherin function through dephosphorylation of β-catenin. We have now identified the domain on N-cadherin to which PTP1B binds and characterized the effect of perturbing this domain on cadherin function. Deletion constructs lacking amino acids 872–891 fail to bind PTP1B. This domain partially overlaps with the β-catenin binding domain. To further define the relationship of these two sites, we used peptides to compete <i>in vitro</i> binding. A peptide representing the most NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal 8 amino acids of the PTP1B binding site, the region of overlap with the β-catenin target, effectively competes for binding of β-catenin but is much less effective in competing PTP1B, whereas two peptides representing the remaining 12 amino acids have no effect on β-catenin binding but effectively compete for PTP1B binding. Introduction into embryonic chick retina cells of a cell-permeable peptide mimicking the 8 most COOH-terminal amino acids in the PTP1B target domain, the region most distant from the β-catenin target site, prevents binding of PTP1B, increases the pool of free, tyrosine-phosphorylated β-catenin, and results in loss of N-cadherin function. N-cadherin lacking this same region of the PTP1B target site does not associate with PTP1B or β-catenin and is not efficiently expressed at the cell surface of transfected L cells. Thus, interaction of PTP1B with N-cadherin is essential for its association with β-catenin, stable expression at the cell surface, and consequently, cadherin function."
https://openalex.org/W2035555613,"The Zn2+- and Ca2+-binding S100B protein is implicated in multiple intracellular and extracellular regulatory events. In glial cells, a relationship exists between cytoplasmic S100B accumulation and cell morphological changes. We have identified the IQGAP1 protein as the major cytoplasmic S100B target protein in different rat and human glial cell lines in the presence of Zn2+ and Ca2+. Zn2+ binding to S100B is sufficient to promote interaction with IQGAP1. IQ motifs on IQGAP1 represent the minimal interaction sites for S100B. We also provide evidence that, in human astrocytoma cell lines, S100B co-localizes with IQGAP1 at the polarized leading edge and areas of membrane ruffling and that both proteins relocate in a Ca2+-dependent manner within newly formed vesicle-like structures. Our data identify IQGAP1 as a potential target protein of S100B during processes of dynamic rearrangement of cell membrane morphology. They also reveal an additional cellular function for IQGAP1 associated with Zn2+/Ca2+-dependent relocation of S100B.

Our data identify IQGAP1 as a potential target protein of S100B during processes of dynamic rearrangement of cell membrane morphology. They also reveal an additional cellular function for IQGAP1 associated with Zn2+/Ca2+-dependent relocation of S100B. S100B is a member of the S100 family of proteins containing two EF-hand-type calcium-binding domains (1Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). This protein interacts not only with Ca2+ but also with Zn2+ ions, binding Zn2+ ions with an affinity in the nanomolar range (2Baudier J. Glasser N. Gérard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of S100B to bind and release Zn2+ suggests that Zn2+ may not only play a structural role but might also be involved, together with Ca2+, in concerted regulation of S100B function. The S100B protein is naturally highly expressed in the vertebrate nervous system, where it is present in astrocytes and Schwann cells (3Haglid K.G. Hamberger A. Hansson H.A. Hyden H. Persson L. Ronnback L. Nature. 1975; 258: 748-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the adult central nervous system, the S100B protein is present in the nuclei and cytoplasm of astrocytes and accumulates in the astrocytic dendrites in the perivascular processes (4Rickmann M. Wolff J.R. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Studies in different laboratories suggest a variety of intracellular regulations by S100B, including negative cell growth regulation (5Scotto C. Delphin C. Deloulme J.C. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7168-7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), cell structure (6Selinfreund R.H. Barger S.W. Welsh M.J. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and calcium homeostasis (7Xiong Z. O'Hanlon D. Becker L.E. Roder J. MacDonald J.F. Marks A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The S100B protein is also secreted from astrocytes and has extracellular functions (8Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Extracellular S100B acts as a modulator of neuronal synaptic plasticity (9Nishiyama H. Knopfel T. Endo S. Itohara S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4037-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although nanomolar quantities have beneficial neurotrophic effects on nerve cells, high levels of this protein have been implicated in glia activation and could contribute to the development of brain pathology as observed in Down's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease (10Griffin W.S. Stanley L.C. Ling C. White L. MacLeod V. Perrot L.J. White C.L. Araoz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7611-7615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). The recent observation that S100B triggers activation of the pro-inflammatory cell surface receptor receptor for advanced glycation end products has shed more light on its extracellular function (11Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M.F. Slattery T. Beach D. McClary J. Nagashima M. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). In cultured human astrocytoma U87 cells, S100B secretion is dependent on relocation of S100B toward vesicle-like structures at the periphery of the cells and is regulated by Ca2+ and Zn2+ (12Davey G.E. Murmann P. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30819-30826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). S100B can also be secreted into the bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid and is a biochemical marker of brain damage or dysfunction in acute and chronic diseases (13Peskind E.R. Griffin W.S. Akama K.T. Raskind M.A. Van Eldik L.J. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 39: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Portela L.V. Brenol J.C. Walz R. Bianchin M. Tort A.B. Canabarro U.P. Beheregaray S. Marasca J.A. Xavier R.M. Neto E.C. Goncalves C.A. Souza D.O. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2002; 9: 164-166PubMed Google Scholar). A relationship between S100B accumulation in the astrocytic end-feet and morphological changes of astrocytes in the perivascular regions has been reported previously (15Abdul-Khaliq H. Schubert S. Stoltenburg-Didinger G. Troitzsch D. Bottcher W. Hubler M. Meissler M. Grosse-Siestrop C. Alexi-Meskishvili V. Hetzer R. Lange P.E. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2000; 38: 1169-1172PubMed Google Scholar). These changes may be related to the release of S100B into the blood stream (15Abdul-Khaliq H. Schubert S. Stoltenburg-Didinger G. Troitzsch D. Bottcher W. Hubler M. Meissler M. Grosse-Siestrop C. Alexi-Meskishvili V. Hetzer R. Lange P.E. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2000; 38: 1169-1172PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with dynamic regulation of astrocyte cell shape by S100B, antisense inhibition of S100B production in cultured rat glial C6 cells is correlated with alterations in cellular morphology (6Selinfreund R.H. Barger S.W. Welsh M.J. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of regulation of astrocyte cell morphology by S100B and its secretion pathway remain unclear. By analogy with other EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins, such as calmodulin, one might suppose that the biological activity of S100B is related to Ca2+/Zn2+-dependent interaction with target proteins. In this study, we identify IQGAP1 protein as the first S100B target protein identified to date whose interaction with S100B is regulated by Zn2+ and Ca2+. IQGAP1 is also the major specific cytoplasmic S100B target protein present in both rat glial C6 and human U373 or U87 astrocytoma cell lines. We also provide evidence that cytoplasmic S100B specifically binds to a sub-population of IQGAP1 molecules that localize at the polarized leading edge and areas of membrane ruffling and that both S100B and IQGAP1 proteins are relocated in a Ca2+-dependent manner within vesicle-like structures. The interaction of S100B with IQGAP1 may have important implications for understanding the roles played by S100B in processes of dynamic rearrangement of cell membranes and in the mechanisms of Zn2+/Ca2+-dependent relocation and secretion of S100B. Human astrocytoma U-373MG, U-87MG cells, rat glioma C6 cells, mammary carcinoma MCF7 cells, and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen).

The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with the primary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using an ECL kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following constructs were used for in vitro translation using the TnT T7 Quick system (Promega): (i) pCAN-myc-IQGAP1 containing a cDNA encoding IQGAP1 was a gift from J. Erickson (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY); (ii) the pcDNA vector containing a cDNA coding for the IQGAP1-N terminus (amino acids 1–863) was generated by digesting pCAN-myc-IQGAP1 with BamHI and subcloning theBamHI-BamHI fragment into a BamHI site in pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen); (iii) the pcDNA containing a cDNA coding for the IQGAP1-IQ domains (amino acids 740–869) was generated by digesting the pcDNA/N-ter with StuI andBamHI and subcloning the StuI/BamHI fragment into the EcoRV/BamHI sites in pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen); (iv) the pcDNA/CHD-IQ was obtained by digesting pcDNA/N-ter with StuI and by religating the vector; (v) the pcDNA/IR-IQ (amino acids 232–740) was obtained by digesting pcDNA/N-ter with StuI and BamHI. Then the StuI/StuI andStuI/BamHI fragments were subcloned intoEcoRV/BamHI sites in pcDNA3.1(−). The 170-kDa protein that binds to S100B-Sepharose in the absence of calcium was excised from Coomassie Blue-stained gels and washed with 50% acetonitrile. Gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and re-hydrated in 20 μl of 25 mmNH4HCO3 containing 0.5 μg of trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade). After 4-h incubation at 37 °C, a 0.5-μl aliquot was removed for MALDI-TOF analysis and spotted onto the MALDI sample probe on top of a dried 0.5-μl mixture of 4:3 saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid in acetone/10 mg/ml nitrocellulose in acetone/isopropanol 1:1. Samples were rinsed by placing a 5-μl volume of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on the matrix surface after the analyte solution had dried completely. After 2 min, the liquid was blown off by pressurized air. MALDI mass spectra of peptide mixtures were obtained using a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analityk, Bremen, Germany). Internal calibration was applied to each spectrum using trypsin autodigestion peptides (MH+ 842.50, MH+ 1045.55, MH+ 2211.11). Protein identification was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry experiments. After in-gel tryptic digestion, the gel pieces were extracted with 5% formic acid solution and then with acetonitrile. The extracts were combined with the original digest, and the sample was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge. The residues were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid and desalted using a Zip Tip (Millipore). Elution of the peptides was performed with 5–10 μl of 50% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid solution. The peptide solution was introduced into a glass capillary (Protana) for nanoelectrospray ionization. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were carried out on a quadruple time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, UK) to obtain sequence information. Collision-induced dissociation of selected precursor ions was performed using argon as the collision gas and collision energies of 40–60 eV. Protein identification was achieved using both MALDI peptide mass fingerprints and MS/MS sequence information. Mass spectrometric data were compared with known sequences using the programs MS-Fit and MS-Edman located at the University of California San Francisco (available at prospector.ucsf.edu/). Tandem mass spectrometry sequencing of three different peptides (LGLAPQIQDLYGK, LEGVLAEVAQHYQDTLIR, and FPDAGEDELLK) confirmed the strict identity of the 170-kDa protein with IQGAP1. These peptides are not found in other human protein sequences, including IQGAP2 and the putative IQGAP3 sequence. For binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed at 4 °C in TTBS buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml each) and centrifuged for 10 min. Cell lysates were precleared by incubation for 10 min with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. 500-μl aliquots of precleared supernatant were supplemented with either 5 mmEDTA/5 mm EGTA, or with 20 μmZnSO4, or with 0.3 mm CaCl2/10 μm ZnSO4 and mixed with 20 μl of affinity beads equilibrated in the same buffers. After mixing at 4 °C for 15 min, the beads were spun down and the supernatant was removed. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffers. At the last wash, beads were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes and boiled in SDS-sample buffer. For binding assays using recombinant IQGAP1 or IQGAP1 domains, 20 μl of reaction lysates were diluted in 500 μl of TTBS and processed as described for cell extracts. 500-μl aliquots of pre-cleared supernatant were mixed with 40 μm GTPγS (Sigma) plus 5 mm MgCl2, if needed, and with either 5 mm EDTA/5 mm EGTA or 0.3 mm CaCl2/10 μm ZnSO4and mixed with the appropriate antibodies (5 μg) plus 20 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose equilibrated in the same buffers. After mixing at 4 °C for 50 min, the beads were centrifuged briefly (5 s, 13,000 rpm), and the supernatant was removed. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of appropriate incubation buffers. At the last wash, beads were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes and boiled in SDS-sample buffer containing 5 mm EGTA and 5 mm EDTA. cells grown on permanox slides from Nunc, Inc. were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and permeabilized for 5 min with TBS (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 plus 1 mm CaCl2. After washing with TBS/1 mm CaCl2, cells were incubated for 30 min in TBS/1 mm CaCl2 containing 10% normal goat serum and then incubated with primary antibodies for 90 min in the same buffer containing 5% normal goat serum. The cells were then washed with TBS/1 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with cyanin3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or with Alexa488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in the same buffer as described for the primary antibodies. After washing with TBS/1 mmCaCl2, cells were incubated in a solution of Hoechst 33258 (2 μg/ml) for 5 min and placed under coverslips. Preparations were analyzed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200M) or a Leica confocal microscope (TCS-SP2). In the transformed human astrocytoma U373 cell line, the expression of S100B is up-regulated in post-confluent cells (Fig.1). Up-regulation of S100B is specific, because it is not observed with β-tubulin, calmodulin (CaM), and IQGAP1. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of post-confluent U373 cells, double-stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-human S100B (red) and mouse monoclonal anti-S100A6 (green), reveals heterogeneity in S100B staining among cells (Fig.2 A). Although all cells are uniformly immunostained with S100A6 antibodies (Fig. 2 B), considerable variation in S100B immunostaining characterized post-confluent U373 cells. In post-confluent culture, the strongest S100B-positive cells had grown on top of the cell layer. These cells are characterized by intense cytoplasmic S100B immunoreactivity and have adopted a less flattened morphology with long processes. Confocal microscopy analysis of S100B immunostaining in confluent and post-confluent U373 cells confirmed a relationship between S100B overexpression and change in cell shape (Fig. 2, C andD). In these experiments, cells were double-labeled with S100B polyclonal antibodies (red) and IQGAP1 monoclonal antibody (green). U373 cells that enter confluence have a flattened morphology. In these cells, the weak S100B immunoreactivity is mostly nuclear and IQGAP1 accumulates at the cell periphery (Fig.2 C). In post-confluent culture, cells characterized by intense cytoplasmic S100B immunoreactivity have adopted a less flattened morphology with long processes (Fig. 2 D). Overlapping of the S100B and IQGAP stainings (white pixels) reveals that some of the S100B colocalizes with IQGAP1 at the cytoplasmic membrane and within processes. The correlation between cytoplasmic S100B overexpression with changes in cell shape is consistent with previous studies that showed that selective inhibition of S100B production by antisense strategies in rat glioma C6 cells resulted in a more flattened cellular morphology (6Selinfreund R.H. Barger S.W. Welsh M.J. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In rat C6 glioma cells, S100B is also up-regulated in post-confluent cells, and its up-regulation correlates with drastic cell morphological changes (data not shown). In an attempt to identify specific S100B target proteins that could mediate the effect of S100B on cell morphology, we compared proteins in astrocytoma U373 and glial C6 cell extracts that bind to S100B-Sepharose beads. A major S100B-binding protein that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa was identified in both cell lines (Fig.3 A). The 170-kDa protein binds to S100B-Sepharose beads in EGTA/EDTA- and Ca2+/Zn2+-containing buffer. The 170-kDa human protein from U373 MG cells was further characterized by mass spectrometry. Protein identification was achieved using both MALDI peptide mass fingerprints and MS/MS sequence information (see “Materials and Methods”). Results revealed that it corresponds to human IQGAP1. IQGAP1 is a widely expressed protein that acts as a scaffold in recruiting and maintaining the organization of cytoskeletal proteins at the plasma membrane (19Bashour A.M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J.

The other high molecular weight Ca2+/Zn2+-dependent S100B-binding protein present in glial C6 cells, but not in U373 cell extract, has been previously identified as AHNAK (28Gentil B. Delphin C.

The binding of IQGAP1 to S100B is specific, because it is not observed with S100A6 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 6), and S100A11 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 7), two other S100 species expressed in U373 cells (17Deloulme J.C.

S100A1, the closest S100B homologue that is not expressed in U373 cells (17Deloulme J.C. Assard N. Ouengue Mbele G. Mangin C. Kuwano R. Baudier J. J. Biol.

IQGAP1 in U373 cell extract also binds to calmodulin-Sepharose beads (Fig.3 C, lanes 4 and 8). A physical interaction between S100B with IQGAP1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of a S100B/IQGAP1 complex from confluent U373 cell extract (Fig. 4). In a first set of experiments, S100B was immunoprecipitated with S16 monoclonal S100B antibody that recognizes an epitope located within the N terminus of S100B (18Takahashi M. Chamczuk A. Hong Y. Jackowski G. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence of IQGAP1 in the S100B immunoprecipitate was revealed with anti-IQGAP1 polyclonal antibodies. A small but detectable amount of IQGAP1 is found in the S100B immunoprecipitates in EDTA/EGTA buffer (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). The amount of IQGAP1 immunoprecipitated with S100B monoclonal antibody increased substantially in buffer containing Ca2+/Zn2+(Fig. 4 A, lane 5). The co-immunoprecipitation of IQGAP1 with S100B is specific, because it is not observed with control anti-MyoD antibodies (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 3). The Ca2+/Zn2+ requirement for the interaction between soluble S100B and IQGAP1 contrasts with the apparent divalent ion-independent interaction observed with S100B cross-linked to Sepharose beads (see below). In a second set of experiments, IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-IQGAP1 AF4 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4 B). S100B is found associated with IQGAP1 immunoprecipitates when using Ca2+/Zn2+-containing buffer. Cdc42 and β-catenin, two other IQGAP1 target proteins (22Fukata M. Kuroda S. Nakagawa M. Kawajiri A.

Several laboratories have also shown intracellular interactions between CaM and IQGAP1 (19Bashour A.M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J.

In Fig. 4 C, we compared the association of calmodulin (CaM) and S100B with immunoprecipitate IQGAP1 out of exponentially growing and post-confluent U373 cells in EGTA/EDTA- and Ca2+/Zn2+-containing buffer. CaM and S100B that co-immunoprecipitated with IQGAP1 were sequentially revealed using the same nitrocellulose transfer membrane. CaM co-immunoprecipitates with IQGAP1 in all conditions tested, whereas S100B only co-immunoprecipitates with IQGAP1 from post-confluent cell extracts in buffer containing Ca2+/Zn2+(compare lanes 2 and 3). It is noteworthy that, although other laboratories reported that Ca2+ enhances the interaction between CaM and IQGAP1 (26Mateer S.C. McDaniel A.E. Nicolas V. Habermacher G.M. Lin M.J. Cromer D.A.

This unexpected observation cannot solely be explained by a competition with S100B, because it is also observed with sub-confluent culture characterized by low S100B expression. In a pull-down assay using S100B cross-linked onto Sepharose beads, the S100B/IQGAP1 interaction can be detected independently of the presence of EGTA/EDTA or Ca2+/Zn2+ in binding buffer (Fig. 3). In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation experiments with endogenous cellular proteins revealed that IQGAP1/S100B interaction is markedly strengthened when Ca2+ and Zn2+ are included in binding buffer (Fig. 4). One factor that might explain this apparent discrepancy is the high S100B protein concentration used in the pull-down assay (1.5–3 μm) compared with the soluble S100B in cell extracts. To evaluate the effect of S100B concentration on complex formation with IQGAP1, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis using MCF7 cells extracts (which do not express the S100B protein) supplemented with increasing concentrations of recombinant human S100B (Fig. 5 A). Results confirm that the S100B/IQGAP1 interaction is regulated by divalent ions and that high concentrations of S100B are not sufficient to promote ion-independent interactions. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that chemical modifications within the S100B molecule may have profound effects on the protein quaternary and tertiary structures (2Baudier J.

(2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 47901–47905). Currently, it is not clear what upstream and downstream signaling molecules of p38 MAPK mediate αv integrin-mediated uPA up-regulation. In the present study, we found that αv integrin ligation activated small GTPase Rac1 preferentially, and dominant negative Rac1 inhibited αv integrin-mediated p38 MAPK activation. Using constitutively active MAPK kinases, we found that both constitutively active MKK3 and MKK6 mutants were able to activate p38 MAPK and up-regulate uPA expression, but only dominant negative MKK3 blocked αv integrin-mediated p38 MAPK activation and uPA up-regulation. These results suggest that MKK3, rather than MKK6, mediates αv integrin-induced p38 MAPK activation. Among the potential downstream effectors of p38 MAPK, we found that only MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 affects αv integrin-mediated uPA up-regulation significantly. Finally, using β-globin reporter gene constructs containing uPA mRNA 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and adenosine/uridine-rich elements-deleted 3′-UTR, we demonstrated that p38 MAPK/MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 signaling pathway regulated uPA mRNA stability through a mechanism involving the adenosine/uridine-rich elements sequence in 3′-UTR of uPA mRNA.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 637-645Google Scholar). Recently, p38 MAPK signaling pathway has also been demonstrated to play an important role in regulating mRNA stability (32Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L.E. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar, 33Kontoyiannis D. Kotlyarov A. Carballo E. Alexopoulou L. Blackshear P.J. Gaestel M. Davis R.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1191-1200Google Scholar).The concentration of an mRNA is a function of its rates of synthesis and degradation (35Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 10: 193-198Google Scholar). The regulation of mRNA stability is therefore an important means of modulating gene expression. Generally, mRNA stability is controlled by cis-acting sequences within 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) or, in some cases, within the coding region (35Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 10: 193-198Google Scholar, 36Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar). The best characterized regulatory elements are the adenosine/uridine-rich elements (ARE) within 3′-UTR of cytokine, growth factor, and proto-oncogene mRNAs, and these elements often contain several copies of the motif AUUUA (36Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar). Attaching ARE within a uridine-rich context results in the instability of otherwise stable reporter mRNA such as β-globin mRNA (37Loflin P.T. Chen C.-Y.A. Xu N. Shyu A.-B. Methods. 1999; 17: 11-20Google Scholar,38Xu N. Loflin P. Chen C.-Y.A. Shuy A.-B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 558-565Google Scholar). Furthermore, mRNA stability is regulated bytrans-acting RNA binding factors that interact with AREs (36Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar), and these include AUF1 (39Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Google Scholar).Our previous studies showed that engaging αv integrins with vitronectin (Vn) activates p38 MAPK and up-regulates uPA expression in invasive MDA-MB-231 cells and that the expression/function of αv integrins is essential for constitutive p38 MAPK activity and uPA expression in invasive cancer cells (44Chen J. Baskerville C. Han Q. Pan Z. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47901-47905Google Scholar). We and others (45Huang S. New L. Pan Z. Han J. Nemerow G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12266-12272Google Scholar, 46Montero L. Nagamine Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5286-5293Google Scholar) have also shown that p38 MAPK regulates uPA expression by promoting uPA mRNA stability. However, the upstream and downstream signaling molecules of p38 MAPK involved in Vn/αv integrin ligation-mediated uPA up-regulation remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that Vn/αv integrin ligation activates Rac1 preferentially and that the Rac1 activity is important for Vn-induced p38 MAPK activation. We also show that although both constitutively active MKK3 and MKK6 enhance uPA expression, only dominant negative MKK3 blocks Vn/αv integrin ligation-induced p38 MAPK activation and uPA up-regulation. Among the potential p38 MAPK downstream kinases, only dominant negative MAPKAPK2 inhibits uPA expression and destabilizes uPA mRNA. In the parallel experiments, we find that constitutively active MAPKAPK2 restores uPA expression and prolongs uPA mRNA stability in p38 MAPK-inhibited MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings suggest that a signaling pathway involving Rac1-MKK3-p38-MAPKAPK2 mediates Vn/αv integrin-mediated uPA up-regulation. In addition, we provide evidence that the ARE-containing 3′-UTR of uPA mRNA is essential for p38 MAPK/MAPKAPK2-regulated uPA mRNA stability.DISCUSSIONOur previous studies have demonstrated that the elevated endogenous p38 MAPK is essential for uPA up-regulation in invasive breast cancer (58Chan S.Y. Empig C.J. Welte F.J. Speck R.F. Schmaljohn A. Kreisberg J.F. Goldsmith M.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 117-126Google Scholar). We have further shown that the elevated p38 MAPK activity requires αv integrin expression/function, and αv integrin ligation activates p38 MAPK and up-regulates uPA expression (44Chen J. Baskerville C. Han Q. Pan Z. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47901-47905Google Scholar). In this report, we identified the upstream and downstream signaling molecules of p38 MAPK that participate in p38 MAPK-regulated uPA mRNA stability. Small GTPase Rac1 and Cdc42 are capable of activating p38 MAPK (55Philips A. Roux P. Coulon V. Bellanger J.-M. Vié A. Vignais M.-L. Blanchard J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5911-5917Google Scholar, 56Molnár A. Theodoras A.M. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13229-13235Google Scholar) and are important for many integrin-mediated cellular responses (50Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Google Scholar, 51Mainiero F. Soriani A. Strippoli R. Jacobelli J. Gismondi A. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 7-16Google Scholar, 52Bourdoulous S. Orend G.

We thus investigated whether Rho GTPases including Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA were involved in αv integrin-mediated p38 MAPK activation. We found that Vn/αv integrin ligation activated Rac1 preferentially (Fig. 1A). Further studies also showed that dominant negative Rac1, rather than dominant negative Cdc42 and RhoA, inhibited αv integrin ligation-induced p38 MAPK activation significantly (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest strongly that αv integrin signals through Rac1 for p38 MAPK activation. Several recent studies reported that α2β1 integrin ligation can activate p38 MAPK in various cell types (59Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kähari V.-M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-415Google Scholar, 60Klekotka P.A. Santora S.A. Zutter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9503-9511Google Scholar, 61Xu J. Clark R.A. Parks W.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 437-447Google Scholar). Furthermore, α2β1-induced p38 MAPK activation requires Cdc42 in human osteosarcoma cells (59Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kähari V.-M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-415Google Scholar) and Rac1 in murine NmuMG cells (60Klekotka P.A. Santora S.A. Zutter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9503-9511Google Scholar). Therefore, we consider the possibility that Rac1 or Cdc42 as a common signaling molecule for mediating integrin-induced p38 MAPK activation.The specific upstream activator kinases for p38 MAPK are MKK3 and MKK6. MKK4, a known activator kinase for JNK, has also been implicated in p38 MAPK activation in vitro (27Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Google Scholar, 28Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar). Although MKK3 and MKK6 are 80% homologous to each other and, in many cases, mediate same signals for p38 MAPK activation, they have been reported to exhibit differential involvement in other cellular events. For example, MKK6, rather than MKK3, is required for FasL and c-Abl-induced cell death in Jurkat T and NIH3T3 cells, respectively (47Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Google Scholar, 62Cong F. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13819-13824Google Scholar). Also, MKK6 is important for IL-12-induced p38 MAPK activation and STAT4 activation in T and NK cells (63Visconti R. Gadina M. Chiariello M. Chen E.H. Stancato L.F. Gutkind J.S. O'Shea J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1844-1852Google Scholar). However, MKK3, rather than MKK6, mediates tumor necrosis factor α and lipopolysaccharide-induced p38 MAPK activation and cytokine expression in both fibroblast and macrophages (64Wysk M. Yang D.D. Lu H.-T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3763-3768Google Scholar, 65Lu H.-T. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Gatti E. Mellman I. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1845-1857Google Scholar). We showed that dominant negative MKK3, but not dominant negative MKK6, was capable of inhibiting αv integrin ligation-induced p38 MAPK activation and uPA up-regulation significantly (Fig. 3), suggesting that integrin-induced p38 MAPK activation may be mediated strictly by MKK3. Our study provides additional evidence for distinct involvement of MKK3 and MKK6 for p38 MAPK-mediated cellular responses.p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in a wide spectrum of cellular functions, and the diversified role of p38 MAPK may be explained by the existence of various p38 MAPK downstream signaling molecules. Multiple kinases and transcription factors have been identified as p38 MAPK substrates and are potentially downstream effectors of p38 MAPK (28Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar,29New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 1999; 8: 220-229Google Scholar). In fact, p38 MAPK/MSK-1 pathway is found to mediate vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced cAMP-response element-binding protein phosphorylation and activation in human endothelial cells (66Mayo L.D. Kessler K.M. Pincheira R. Warren R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25184-25189Google Scholar), p38 MAPK/MNK1 pathway is essential for stress-induced eukaryotic initiation factor-4E activation (67Knauf U. Tschopp C. Gram H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5500-5511Google Scholar, 68Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of 5-lipoxygenase appears to require p38 MAPK/MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAP3 pathways (69Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Rädmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Google Scholar). Our studies showed that dominant negative MAPKAPK2 inhibited αv integrin ligation-induced uPA up-regulation specifically (Fig. 4A), and constitutively active MAPKAPK2 rescued uPA expression in p38 MAPK-inhibited cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggest strongly that MAPKAPK2 is the main p38 MAPK downstream effector in regulating uPA expression in invasive breast cancer cells. These studies also further support the notion that the diversified role of p38 MAPK is determined by the variety of downstream signaling molecules.In the past several years, growing evidence has revealed clearly that the ARE in 3′-UTR of mRNA can affect mRNA stability significantly (70Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Google Scholar, 71Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene. 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar). The minimum consensus sequence for ARE is UUAUUUAUU or UUAUUU(A/U)(A/U) (36Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar), and this sequence is present in the 3′-UTR of uPA mRNA (57Nanbu R. Montero L. D'Orazio D. Nagamine Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 169-174Google Scholar). Early studies have shown that p38 MAPK pathway regulates uPA mRNA stability in an ARE-targeted mechanism (46Montero L. Nagamine Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5286-5293Google Scholar), and this finding was further confirmed by our studies (Fig. 6). We demonstrated that the stability of uPA mRNA 3′-UTR-containing β-globin transcript was decreased specifically by dominant negative MAPKAPK2 in MDA-MB-231 cells by (Fig. 7A), and prolonged by, constitutively active MAPKAPK2 in p38 MAPK-inhibited MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that MAPKAPK2 is the downstream effector of p38 MAPK for regulating uPA mRNA stability. Several recent studies have also demonstrated the importance of MAPKAPK2 in regulating mRNA stability. Blocking MAPKAPK2 activity was reported to inhibit cytokine/stress-induced IL-8 and IL-8 expression by destabilizing their mRNA (72Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Müller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Google Scholar). In MAPKAPK2-deficient cells, the half-life of IL-2 mRNA was reduced more than 10-fold, and re-expressing MAPKAPK2 in these cells restored IL-2 mRNA stability (73Neininger A. Kontoyiannis D. Kotlyarov A. Winzen R. Eckert R. Volk H.-D. Holtmann H. Kollian G. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3065-3068Google Scholar). Furthermore, tristetraprolin, a protein regulating mRNA stability, was found to be a direct substrate of MAPKAPK2 (32Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L.E. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar). Taken together, it is very likely that MAPKAPK2 may be a common p38 MAPK downstream signaling molecule for regulating ARE-mediated mRNA stability.In conclusion, we have defined the signaling pathway linking αv integrin ligation, p38 MAPK activation to uPA up-regulation in invasive breast MDA-MB-231 cells. Because uPA plays a significant role in tumor invasion and progression, the therapeutic approaches may be developed by intercepting the signaling pathway responsible for uPA overexpression.

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated clearly that the levels of uPA are associated closely with the degree of tumor cell invasion and that uPA plays a key role in tumor progression and metastasis (7Aguirre Ghiso J.A.

When uPA binds to its cell surface receptor, uPA rapidly converts plasminogen into plasmin, which then degrades a variety of extracellular matrix proteins and also initiates the activation of a metalloproteinase cascade (16Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Google Scholar, 17Collen C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 259-270Google Scholar).

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Google Scholar, 28Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity among the members of p38 MAPK family, differences in activation profile and substrate specificity have been observed (28Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar, 29New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 1999; 8: 220-229Google Scholar). The p38 MAPKs can be activated by a wide spectrum of stimuli, including cellular stress, proinflammatory cytokines, and growth factors (29New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc Med. 1999; 8: 220-229Google Scholar, 30Martin-Blanco E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 637-645Google Scholar). The activation of p38 MAPKs is regulated by upstream MAPKK (MKK3, MKK6, and probably MKK4) via phosphorylation of a TGY phosphorylation site (28Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar, 31Lee J.C. Kumar S. Griswold D.E. Underwood D.C. Votta B.J. Adams J.L. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 47: 185-201Google Scholar). The p38 MAPK effects are carried out by downstream substrates including protein kinases and transcription factors (28Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar, 30Martin-Blanco E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 637-645Google Scholar). Recently, p38 MAPK signaling pathway has also been demonstrated to play an important role in regulating mRNA stability (32Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L.E. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Google Scholar, 33Kontoyiannis D. Kotlyarov A. Carballo E. Alexopoulou L. Blackshear P.J. Gaestel M. Davis R.

The concentration of an mRNA is a function of its rates of synthesis and degradation (35Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 10:"
https://openalex.org/W2009925947,"We determined whether salicylate at pharmacological concentrations inhibits nitric-oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions in RAW 264.7 stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Cells were treated with sodium salicylate (10−7-10−4m) or vehicle for 30 min followed by LPS+IFN-γ for up to 24 h. Salicylate suppressed NOS-2 and COX-2 protein levels and promoter activities stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on NOS-2 expression stimulated by the combined agonists for 24 h. Results from promoter analysis indicate that the binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) to its cognate site at −150/−142 on the NOS-2 promoter region was essential for NOS-2 expression at 4 h but not at 24 h. Salicylate reduced C/EBPβ binding at 4 h and did not alter its binding at 24 h. NOS-2 and COX-2 protein levels and C/EBPβ binding stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h were inhibited by a similar battery of signaling inhibitors, suggesting a common pathway for NOS-2 and COX-2 expression. Kinetic analysis indicates that NOS-2, similar to COX-2 expression, at 4 h was largely due to the action of LPS, which induced C/EBPβ binding, whereas its expression at a longer time point was contributed by IFN-γ. Our findings implicate two distinct pathways for NOS-2 expression induced by LPS+IFN-γ. Salicylate at pharmacological concentrations is capable of suppressing the early phase of NOS-2 and COX-2 expression by blocking C/EBPβ binding. We determined whether salicylate at pharmacological concentrations inhibits nitric-oxide synthase-2 (NOS-2) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions in RAW 264.7 stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Cells were treated with sodium salicylate (10−7-10−4m) or vehicle for 30 min followed by LPS+IFN-γ for up to 24 h. Salicylate suppressed NOS-2 and COX-2 protein levels and promoter activities stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on NOS-2 expression stimulated by the combined agonists for 24 h. Results from promoter analysis indicate that the binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) to its cognate site at −150/−142 on the NOS-2 promoter region was essential for NOS-2 expression at 4 h but not at 24 h. Salicylate reduced C/EBPβ binding at 4 h and did not alter its binding at 24 h. NOS-2 and COX-2 protein levels and C/EBPβ binding stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h were inhibited by a similar battery of signaling inhibitors, suggesting a common pathway for NOS-2 and COX-2 expression. Kinetic analysis indicates that NOS-2, similar to COX-2 expression, at 4 h was largely due to the action of LPS, which induced C/EBPβ binding, whereas its expression at a longer time point was contributed by IFN-γ. Our findings implicate two distinct pathways for NOS-2 expression induced by LPS+IFN-γ. Salicylate at pharmacological concentrations is capable of suppressing the early phase of NOS-2 and COX-2 expression by blocking C/EBPβ binding.

Pharmacol. 1995; 33: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of NOS-2 by these stimuli has been extensively characterized in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. LPS combined with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was reported to activate NOS-2 promoter synergistically. Promoter analysis reveals that two clusters of enhancers located at −54 to −236 and −731 to −962 of NOS-2 promoter region are essential for the sustained expression of NOS-2 in response to LPS+IFN-γ stimulation (3Xie Q.-W.

COX-2 is also inducible in this murine macrophage by diverse pro-inflammatory mediators. Its induction by these stimuli is typical of an immediately early gene with a rapid and transient time course. Several regulatory elements on murine COX-2 promoter including a cyclic AMP response element, two C/EBP sites, and a single NFκB site have been shown to be involved in COX-2 promoter activation (9Xie W.

Results from our laboratory demonstrate that C/EBPβ binding to the C/EBP site in human COX-2 promoter is required for COX-2 transcriptional activation by pro-inflammatory mediators such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and interleukin-1β (13Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L.

Although several reports have shown that salicylate suppresses NOS-2 expression at suprapharmacological concentrations (>5 mm) by reducing NFκB binding (15Farivar R.S. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31585-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Amin A.R. Vyas P. Attur M. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Patel I.R. Weissmann G. Abramson S.B. Proc. Natl.

A. 1995; 92: 7926-7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, there is no report on NOS-2 expression influenced by pharmacological concentrations of salicylate. Because NOS-2 and COX-2 expressions are concurrently induced by LPS+IFN-γ in RAW 264.7 cells, we used this cell line as a model to test the hypothesis that salicylate at pharmacological concentrations (10−4 to 10−6m) inhibits NOS-2 and COX-2 expressions stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ by blocking a common C/EBPβ-dependent transcriptional pathway. The results show that salicylate suppressed NOS-2 and COX-2 protein levels and promoter activities by blocking the binding of C/EBPβ to its respective C/EBP elements on NOS-2 and COX-2 promoters. Our results further show that NOS-2 promoter activity stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h required C/EBPβ binding, and at this time period of stimulation, salicylate was effective in suppressing C/EBPβ binding, thereby reducing the extent of NOS-2 expression. Interestingly, C/EBPβ binding was no longer required for NOS-2 expression, and salicylate was incapable of inhibiting NOS-2 promoter activity stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 24 h. RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For all experiments, medium was removed, and cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h before stimulation with 2 μg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4, Sigma), 40 units/ml IFN-γ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or LPS+IFN-γ for indicated time periods. A wild-type murine 1.63-kilobase NOS-2 promoter/enhancer fragment (−1486/+145), its C/EBP site (−150/−142) mutant with the substitution of TGATGTAA for GTCGTGGC, and a 0.9-kilobase COX-2 promoter/enhancer fragment (−891/+9) were cloned into pGL3 basic luciferase expression vectors. RAW 264.7 cells at ∼60% confluence were transfected with the luciferase expression construct according to a procedure described previously (14Xu X.-M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.-M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5292-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A mixture of 15 μg of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and 4 μg of DNA was added to cells and incubated in serum-free medium for 6 h. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 18 h. Cells were washed with serum-free medium, growth-arrested for 24 h, and stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ for an indicated period of time. Cells were harvested using Promega lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured on a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer. On the same cell lysate, total protein assay was performed. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (13Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, harvested, and spun down at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellet was dissolved in solubilizing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.06 mg/ml aprotinin). Cell pellet was then spun down at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatant was collected, and its protein concentration was determined. For sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, each lane was loaded with 20 μg of protein. The gel was electrophoretically transferred, and proteins were identified by specific antibodies: anti-NOS-2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-COX-2 antibody (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI), anti-actin antibody (Oncogene, Boston, MA), and anti-C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The binding of nuclear extract proteins to the DNA sequence was performed by a newly developed method using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads to bind biotinylated DNA probe (17Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Yeh H. Deng W.G. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW 264.7 cells by a method described previously (17Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Yeh H. Deng W.G. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

The beads were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing multiple inhibitors, and resuspended in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Nuclear proteins bound to the beads were dissociated by incubation in water bath at 95 °C for 5 min and applied to Western blot analysis. PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1/2; LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K); SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK; AG490, an inhibitor of Janus activated kinase 2/3 (Jak2/3); GF109203X, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC); and rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, were obtained from Calbiochem. RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with these agents for 30 min prior to the addition of LPS, IFN-γ, or LPS+IFN-γ. It is well established that RAW 264.7 cells expressed both COX-2 and NOS-2 proteins in response to LPS+IFN-γ stimulation. To determine whether sodium salicylate at pharmacological concentrations suppresses COX-2 and NOS-2 expressions concurrently, we evaluated the effects of sodium salicylate on COX-2 and NOS-2 protein levels and promoter activities. Sodium salicylate suppressed COX-2 protein levels in serum-starved RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h in a concentration-dependent manner with a maximal inhibition of ∼50% at 10−5 to 10−4m (Fig.1 a). NOS-2 protein was detected after stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells with LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h and was suppressed by sodium salicylate (Fig. 1 b). Sodium salicylate at 10−5m suppressed COX-2 and NOS-2 promoter activities stimulated with LPS+INF-γ for 4 h to a similar extent (Fig. 2). We have observed in RAW 264.7 as well as in human fibroblasts that salicylate inhibited NOS-2 and COX-2 expressions only in serum-starved cells. When cells were cultured in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, salicylate did not inhibit NOS-2 or COX-2 protein levels stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h (data not shown).Figure 2Sodium salicylate (10−5m) suppressed NOS-2 and COX-2 promoter activities stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ to a similar extent.

In contrast, NOS-2 promoter activity increased progressively up to 24 h (Fig.3 b). To determine the role of C/EBP element in NOS-2 promoter activity, we transfected cells with luciferase expression vector containing a C/EBP-mutated NOS-2 promoter fragment. The mutation of the C/EBP element resulted in the collapse of NOS-2 promoter activity at 4 h but not at 24 h (Fig.4), suggesting different transactivational pathways for 4 h versus 24-h stimulation by LPS+IFN-γ. We next determined whether salicylate inhibited only the C/EBP-dependent NOS-2 expression. Sodium salicylate (10−5m) reduced NOS-2 promoter activity at 4 h by 50% but had no effect on NOS-2 promoter activity stimulated with LPS+IFN-γ for 24 h (Fig.5).Figure 4Mutation of the C/EBP sequence at the NOS-2 promoter region −1485 to +145 (M) abolished promoter activity stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h but not 24 h.

C/EBPβ binding to the NOS-2 promoter sequence was detected at basal state, which was enhanced by LPS+IFN-γ stimulation for 4 h (Fig. 6 b). Basal binding to COX-2 C/EBP sequence was not detected, but the binding was detectable at 4 h of stimulation (Fig. 6 c). Sodium salicylate at 10−5m did not alter C/EBPβ protein levels (Fig. 6 a) but suppressed C/EBPβ binding to NOS-2 and COX-2 promoter C/EBP sequences (Fig. 6, b andc). By contrast, C/EBPβ binding to NOS-2 sequence became undetectable after a 24-h treatment with LPS+IFN-γ, which is correlated with a marked reduction of C/EBPβ protein levels (Fig.7). Sodium salicylate had no effect on C/EBPβ binding or protein level at 24 h of stimulation (Fig.7).Figure 7Disappearance of C/EBP β proteins and C/EBP β binding to NOS-2 promoter sequence after stimulation with LPS+IFN-γ for 24 h.

We determined the kinetics of NOS-2 expression induced by LPS and IFN-γ individually. Under LPS stimulation, NOS-2 proteins were detected at 4 h and peaked at 12 h (Fig. 8). In contrast, NOS-2 proteins were undetectable at 4 h after IFN-γ stimulation became detectable at 8 h and peaked at 24 h (Fig. 8). LPS+IFN-γ treatment resulted in synergistic stimulation of NOS-2 expression. Robust expression was detected at 4 h, peaked at 12 h, and declined significantly at 24 h. We next determined whether sodium salicylate inhibited NOS-2 protein expression stimulated by LPS, IFN-γ, or LPS+IFN-γ for 4 and 24 h. Salicylate (10−5m) inhibited LPS and LPS+IFN-γ-induced NOS-2 protein levels at 4 h to a similar extent (Fig.9). It had no effect on IFN-γ-induced NOS-2 protein levels (Fig. 9). Taken together, these results suggest that salicylate inhibited LPS-induced C/EBPβ binding, thereby suppressing C/EBPβ-mediated COX-2 and NOS-2 expression.Figure 9Inhibition by salicylate (SA) of NOS-2 protein levels stimulated with LPS , IFN-γ, and LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h or IFN-γ for 24 h.The upper panel shows protein analysis by Western blots, and the lower panel shows the densitometry.

NOS-2 protein levels were significantly reduced by LY294002, SB203580, and AG490 (Fig.10 a), consistent with the involvement of PI3K, p38 MAPK, and Jak2/3 in NOS-2 expression. COX-2 protein levels at 4 h were also inhibited by LY2942002, SB203580, and AG490 with an almost identical profile (Fig. 10 b). LY2942002 and SB203580 abrogated LPS+IFN-γ-stimulated C/EBPβ binding to the NOS-2 promoter sequence without changing the C/EBPβ protein level (Fig. 11 a). Similarly, C/EBPβ binding to COX-2 promoter sequence was blocked by these two inhibitors (Fig. 11 b). These results suggest a common signaling pathway through which NOS-2 and COX-2 promoter activities are stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ at 4 h.Figure 11Inhibition of 38-kDa C/EBP β binding to NOS-2 sequence (A) and COX-2 sequence (B) by LY294002 (50 μm) and SB203580 (2.6 μm).

We pretreated cells with LY294002 or PD98059 for 30 min followed by LPS, IFN-γ, or LPS+IFN-γ for 4 h. Cells were harvested, and NOS-2 proteins were determined. NOS-2 protein expression induced by LPS alone or LPS+IFN-γ was similarly inhibited by LY294002 but not by PD98059 (Fig. 12). IFN-γ did not induce detectable NOS-2 at 4 h, and pretreatment with these inhibitors did not alter its effect on NOS-2 protein expression (Fig. 12). These results suggest that NOS-2 and COX-2 expressions after a 4 h stimulation by LPS+IFN-γ were contributed primarily by LPS via a signaling pathway involving several signaling molecules including PI3K. Our findings indicate that salicylate at pharmacological concentrations is capable of suppressing NOS-2 and COX-2 expressions in RAW 264.7 macrophages by blocking C/EBPβ binding to specific binding sites at the NOS-2 and COX-2 promoter regions. Our results further demonstrate that the concurrent NOS-2 and COX-2 expressions in response to LPS+IFN-γ stimulation for 4 h is attributable to the action of LPS, because IFN-γ did not induce NOS-2 or COX-2 expression at this early time point. C/EBPβ binding has been shown to be required for LPS-induced COX-2 transcriptional activation (18Caivano M. Gorgoni B. Cohen P. Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48693-48701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study, our results show that C/EBPβ binding is also essential for NOS-2 transcriptional activation by LPS at 4 h. Salicylate was capable of suppressing C/EBPβ binding to the promoters of both genes. These results suggest that salicylate suppresses NOS-2 and COX-2 transcription by a common C/EBPβ-dependent mechanism. We have previously demonstrated that COX-2 stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and interleukin-1β (13Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in human fibroblasts also requires C/EBPβ binding, and salicylate exerts a similar effect on blocking C/EBPβ binding, thereby suppressing COX-2 transactivation. In contrast, salicylate does not suppress COX-2 stimulation by tumor necrosis factor α whose stimulation does not require C/EBPβ binding. Taken together, these results indicate that C/EBPβ binding is a key target of salicylate action. It may be predicted that salicylate is capable of suppressing an array of C/EBPβ-dependent genes. This action of salicylate could explain the therapeutic effects of aspirin on diverse human diseases. The mechanism by which salicylate blocks C/EBPβ binding has not been characterized. As C/EBPβ binding depends on phosphorylation, it is probable that salicylate disrupts C/EBPβ phosphorylation by inhibiting the kinase activity. The exact kinase that phosphorylates C/EBPβ and enhances its binding and transactivation properties remains to be identified. Several kinases including p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, calmodulin-dependent kinase, MAPK, PKC, and PKA have been shown to phosphorylate C/EBPβ at distinct tyrosine or serine/threonine residues (19Buck M. Poli V. van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K.

Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether all of the phosphorylation sites are required for C/EBPβ binding, nor is it clear whether all the kinases are activated by each stimulus. It is possible that each type of agonists may activate several kinases that act in concert to promoter C/EBPβ binding. Salicylate may block one of the kinase activity, thereby weakening the C/EBPβ binding. Our results suggest that neither PKC nor p42/p44 MAPK is a target of salicylate, because the inhibition of PKC or MAPK did not alter C/EBPβ binding. Work is in progress to determine whether ribosomal S6 kinase, calmodulin-dependent kinase, or PKA is the target of salicylate inhibition. Our results demonstrate different kinetics of NOS-2 and COX-2 promoter activation by LPS+IFN-γ. COX-2 expression by the combined stimuli follows a time course that is characteristic of COX-2 induction by other agonists including LPS. Its promoter activity stimulated by LPS or LPS+IFN-γ peaked at 4 h and declined rapidly thereafter. The addition of IFN-γ does not potentiate the stimulatory effect of LPS nor does it prolong the time course of COX-2 stimulation. In contrast, NOS-2 expression by the combined stimuli has a prolonged time course, which is contributed primarily by IFN-γ. Our time course of NOS-2 expression by the combined stimuli is consistent with the reported data (23Lorsbach R.B. Murphy W.J. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1908-1913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Weiss A. Oguchi S. Cicatiello L. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8324-8333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the time course of NOS-2 expression under the stimulation of LPS or IFN-γ had not been extensively investigated. Our results show a different time course of NOS-2 expression stimulated by these two agonists. LPS induced an early and short-term NOS-2 expression resembling the time course of COX-2 expression, whereas IFN-γ stimulated NOS-2 expression with a late onset and a prolonged time course. This kinetic difference is attributable to distinct receptor-mediated signaling pathways used by these two agonists to induce the binding of different transactivators to their respective regulatory elements on the NOS-2 promoter. The synergistic action of LPS+IFN-γ could be explained by a complementary time course of stimulation, recruitment of multiple transactivators and coactivators to the promoter, and dynamic switch of transactivator binding over time caused by these two agonists. These processes are complex and possibly coordinately regulated. The results from this study provide direct evidence for a time-dependent change in C/EBPβ binding that correlates with the early short-term NOS-2 expression. C/EBPβ binding is absolutely required for NOS-2 expression at 4 h but not at 24 h. The binding of other transactivators, notably NFκB and interferon regulatory factor-1, is probably responsible for the late onset and sustained NOS-2 expression stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ. It is interesting to note that C/EBPβ proteins are degraded by prolonged LPS+IFN-γ stimulation, which results in the switch-off of the C/EBPβ binding. It will be important to determine the time course of binding of other functionally important transactivators in response to stimulation by LPS, IFN-γ, or LPS+IFN-γ and evaluate the effect of salicylate on the binding of these transactivators at different time points. NOS-2 transcriptional activation in response to stimulation by LPS+IFN-γ at 4 and 24 h may be mediated through distinct signaling pathways. Our results indicate that at 4 h of stimulation, promoter activation is mediated via a pathway involving PI3K, p38 MAPK, and Jak2/3. On the other hand, our data 2K. Cieslik, Y. Zhu, and K. K. Wu, unpublished data. also reveal that NOS-2 transcriptional activation by LPS+IFN-γ for 24 h was inhibited by GF109203X and rapamycin and augmented by LY294002, SB203580, AG490, and PD98059, suggesting that NOS-2 expression at 24 h is mediated via a signaling pathway involving PKC and mammalian target of rapamycin and negatively regulated by PI3K, p38 MAPK, Jak2/3, and MEK1/2. Only a small number of reports address signaling pathways for LPS+IFN-γ-induced NOS-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells. These reports provide information on signaling pathways for NOS-2 expression at 4–6 or 20–24 h but did not provide kinetic data. For example, Salhet al. (25Salh B. Wagey R. Marotta A. Tao J.S. Pelech S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6947-6954PubMed Google Scholar) report the inhibition of NOS-2 expression at 6 h by LY294002, whereas Diaz-Guerra et al. (26Dı́az-Guerra M.J.M. Bodelón O.G. Velasco M. Whelan R. Parker P.J. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32028-32033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Chen et al. (27Chen C.-C. Wang J.-K. Lin S.-B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6206-6214PubMed Google Scholar) report the involvement of PKC in NOS-2 expression at 24 h. Diaz-Guerra et al. (28Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Castrillo A. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6184-6190PubMed Google Scholar) report that NO production stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ for 24 h was augmented by LY294002. These results are consistent with our findings that PI3K mediates NOS-2 expression at 4–6 h and negatively regulates its expression at 24 h. Taken together, these results support the notion that NOS-2 expression stimulated by LPS+IFN-γ comprises two distinct phases that are signaled by different pathways: 1) an early phase of expression, which is signaled through PI3K, p38 MAPK, and Jak 2/3; and 2) a late phase of expression, which is signaled via PKC and mammalian target of rapamycin. In this study, we have characterized considerably the early phase of expression. The early phase NOS-2 expression resembles the expression of an immediate early gene such as COX-2. Its signaling pathway leads to C/EBPβ binding and C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional activation. We have demonstrated that salicylate is capable of suppressing the early phase NOS-2 expression by blocking C/EBPβ binding, and this inhibitory process also resembles its suppression of COX-2 transcriptional activation. In contrast, the late phase NOS-2 expression has not been characterized. Its signaling pathways appear to be complex, comprising positive and negative signaling pathways. The role of the negative signaling pathway in controlling the late phase NOS-2 expression is unclear. It is also unclear which transcriptional activators are activated through the positive signaling pathway and which transcription factors are controlled by the negative pathway. Our results have excluded the involvement of C/EBPβ in the late phase NOS-2 transcriptional activation. It is possible that NFκB and interferon regulatory factor-1 are the key transactivators for the late phase NOS-2 expression. Work is now in progress to characterize the signaling and transcriptional pathways for the late phase NOS-2 expression and the pharmacological control of its expression. We thank Dr. Bruce Kone (Division of Nephrology, University of Texas-Houston) for providing the NOS-2 promoter expression vector and Susan Mitterling for excellent editorial assistance."

The present studies demonstrate that PKCδ is required in part for induction of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK) in cells treated with 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) and other genotoxic agents. DNA damage-induced SAPK activation was attenuated by (i) treatment with rottlerin, (ii) expression of a kinase-inactive PKCδ(K-R) mutant, and (iii) down-regulation of PKCδ by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Coexpression studies demonstrate that PKCδ activates SAPK by an MKK7-dependent, SEK1-independent mechanism. Previous work has shown that the nuclear Lyn tyrosine kinase activates the MEKK1 → MKK7 → SAPK pathway but not through a direct interaction with MEKK1. The present results extend those observations by demonstrating that Lyn activates PKCδ, and in turn, MEKK1 is activated by a PKCδ-dependent mechanism. These findings indicate that PKCδ functions in the activation of SAPK through a Lyn → PKCδ → MEKK1 → MKK7 → SAPK signaling cascade in response to DNA damage.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4979-4989Google Scholar). By contrast, whereas Lyn activates the MEKK1 → MKK7 → SAPK pathway, the direct downstream effector of Lyn is not known (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar). The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases has been subdivided into the following: (i) the conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ), which are calcium-dependent and activated by diacylglycerol, (ii) the novel PKCs (δ, ε, θ, and μ), which are calcium-independent and activated by diacylglycerol, and (iii) the atypical PKCs (ζ and λ), which are calcium-independent and not activated by diacylglycerol (22Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed novel PKC, PKCδ, is tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated by c-Abl in the response to DNA damage (23Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Google Scholar). As found for c-Abl and Lyn (24Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A.

Other studies have demonstrated that the nuclear complex of c-Abl and Lyn includes the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHPTP1 (27Kharbanda S. Bharti A. Pei D. Wang J. Pandey P. Ren R. Weichselbaum R. Walsh C.T. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Google Scholar, 28Yoshida K. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Google Scholar). In cells that respond to genotoxic stress with the induction of apoptosis, PKCδ is cleaved by caspase-3 to a constitutively active catalytic fragment (PKCδCF) (30Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G.

Blood. 1996; 87: 1990-1996Google Scholar). The finding that PKCδCF induces nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation has indicated that cleavage of PKCδ contributes to the apoptotic response (32Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S.

The present studies have addressed the involvement of PKCδ in the activation of stress signals in response to arrest of DNA replication and to DNA damage. The results demonstrate that PKCδ is required in part for activation of SAPK. The results also demonstrate that PKCδ transduces Lyn-mediated signals to MEKK1 in a Lyn → PKCδ → MEKK1 → MKK7 → SAPK pathway. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. MCF-7 cells, HeLa cells, and 293T embryonal kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were treated with araC (Sigma-Aldrich), rottlerin (Calbiochem), or Gö6976 (Calbiochem). Irradiation was performed at room temperature with a Gammacell 1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada) and a137Cs source emitting at a fixed rate of 0.21 gray/min. The PKCδ(K-R) cDNA (29Yoshida K. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Google Scholar) was cloned into a pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector (Invitrogen) and introduced stably into U-937 cells by electroporation (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad) and selection in geneticin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). U-937/Lyn(K-R) cells were prepared as described previously (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar, 28Yoshida K. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34663-34668Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected with pGFP, pGFP-PKCδCF, pGFP-PKCδCF(K-R) (29Yoshida K. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Google Scholar), pFLAG, pFLAG-SEK1(K-R), pFLAG-MKK7(K-R), or pFLAG-MEKK1(K-M) (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar) by the calcium phosphate method. DNA concentrations were adjusted with empty vector. siRNA duplexes (siRNAs) were synthesized and purified by Japan Bio Service (Saitama, Japan). The siRNA sequences for targeting PKCδ were 5′-GAUGAAGGAGGCGCUCAGTT3′ for PKCδsiRNA1 and 5′-GGCUGAGUUCUGGCUGGACTT-3′ for PKCδsiRNA2. GFPsiRNA was used as a negative control (33Hirai I. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25722-25727Google Scholar). Transfection of siRNAs was performed as described (34Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared as described (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar, 28Yoshida K. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol.

(SCBT), anti-ERK2 (sc-154; SCBT), anti-p38 MAPK (sc-535; SCBT), anti-PKCδ (sc-937; SCBT), anti-Lyn (sc-15; SCBT), or anti-MEKK1 (21Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Yamauchi T. Kumar S. Kaneki M. Kumar V.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4979-4989Google Scholar) antibodies for 2–6 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h of incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (SCBT). The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. In vitro kinase assays for SAPK, ERK, and p38 MAPK were performed as described (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar, 29Yoshida K. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Google Scholar). Anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates were incubated with histone H1 as a substrate (29Yoshida K. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After blocking with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the filters were incubated with anti-JNK1/SAPK, anti-ERK2, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-PKCδ, anti-Lyn (Transduction Laboratories), anti-MEKK1, anti-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-GFP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-GST (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), or anti-phospho-Tyr (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies for 1–4 h at room temperature. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cosedimentation analysis of PKCδ and Lyn by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation was performed as described (35Yoshida K. Komatsu K. Wang H.-G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Google Scholar). Assays for direct binding of PKCδ and Lyn in vitro were performed as described previously (35Yoshida K. Komatsu K. Wang H.-G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Google Scholar). To investigate whether PKCδ functions as an upstream effector of the SAPK response to genotoxic agents, U-937 cells were pretreated with PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin, followed by exposure to araC. Anti-SAPK immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays by phosphorylating GST-c-Jun. The results demonstrate that pretreatment with rottlerin attenuates araC-induced activation of SAPK (Fig. 1A). By contrast, there was no detectable effect of pretreatment with the PKCα and PKCβ inhibitor, Gö6976 (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with U-937 cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether PKCδ is required for the induction of other MAPK family members, ERK and p38 MAPK, cells exposed to rottlerin and then araC or IR were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK2 and anti-p38 MAPK. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) or ATF-2 demonstrated that rottlerin has less of an inhibitory effect on araC- or IR-induced p38 MAPK activity and no apparent effect on ERK activation (Fig. 1, C and D and data not shown). These results suggest that activation of SAPK is at least in part dependent on PKCδ in the response to genotoxic agents. To further assess involvement of PKCδ in SAPK activation, a Myc-tagged kinase-inactive PKCδ(K-R) mutant was introduced stably in U-937 cells. In contrast to U-937 cells expressing the empty vector, two separate clones of transfected cells expressed Myc-PKCδ(K-R) (Fig. 2A). Anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates from control and araC-treated U-937/neo and U-937/PKCδ(K-R) cells were analyzed for phosphorylation of histone H1. The results demonstrate that activation of PKCδ by araC is abrogated in U-937 cells expressing PKCδ(K-R) (Fig. 2B). To confirm the involvement of PKCδ in DNA damage-induced activation of SAPK, U-937/neo and U-937/PKCδ(K-R) cells exposed to araC were analyzed for SAPK activity. The results demonstrate that activation of SAPK is attenuated, but not completely inhibited, in araC-treated cells expressing kinase-negative PKCδ(K-R) (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained in IR-treated cells (Fig. 2D). By contrast, DNA damage-induced ERK and p38 MAPK activation were unaffected in U-937/PKCδ(K-R) cells, as compared with that in U-937/neo cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that PKCδ is involved in SAPK activation in the cellular response to diverse genotoxic agents. To further assess the role of PKCδ in SAPK activation, 293T cells were treated with siRNA duplexes that target PKCδ. The results demonstrate that the PKCδsiRNA1 down-regulates PKCδ expression (Fig. 3A). Less pronounced results were obtained with PKCδsiRNA2 (Fig. 3A). As a control, treatment with a GFPsiRNA had little if any effect (Fig. 3A). Importantly, treatment with PKCδsiRNA, but not GFPsiRNA, attenuated araC-induced SAPK activation (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the kinase function of PKCδ is sufficient for SAPK activation, 293T cells were transfected with PKCδCF. Analysis of anti-SAPK immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun demonstrated that expression of PKCδCF induces SAPK activity (Fig. 3C). By contrast, expression of kinase-inactive PKCδCF(K-R) had little effect on SAPK activity (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells expressing PKCδCF or PKCδCF(K-R) (data not shown). To define the effectors downstream to PKCδ in the SAPK pathway, 293T cells were co-transfected with PKCδCF and kinase-inactive SEK1(K-R) or MKK7(K-R). Analysis of anti-SAPK immunoprecipitates demonstrated that expression of MKK7(K-R), but not SEK1(K-R), is associated with attenuation of SAPK activity by PKCδ (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that PKCδ induces SAPK activation by an MKK7-dependent, SEK1/MKK4-independent mechanism. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Lyn tyrosine kinase is activated in the response to genotoxic stress and that Lyn regulates SAPK activation by an MKK7-dependent pathway (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar). Whereas the present results indicate that the PKCδ-mediated SAPK signaling pathway is also MKK7-dependent, we asked whether Lyn is involved in PKCδ → SAPK signaling. To determine whether PKCδ binds to Lyn, we incubated glutathione beads containing GST or GST-PKCδ with purified Lyn. Analysis of the adsorbates demonstrated binding of Lyn with GST-PKCδ and not GST (Fig. 4A). To determine whether PKCδ phosphorylates Lyn in vitro, heat-inactivated purified Lyn was incubated with recombinant PKCδ. Analysis of the reaction products demonstrated no detectable phosphorylation of Lyn by PKCδ (Fig. 4B, lane 2). By contrast, incubation of heat-inactivated PKCδ with purified Lyn showed that Lyn phosphorylates PKCδ (Fig. 4B, lane 5). These findings provide support for a direct interaction between PKCδ and Lyn. To determine whether Lyn contributes to the regulation of PKCδin vivo, anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates from control and araC-treated cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ. The results demonstrate that Lyn associates constitutively with PKCδ and that araC treatment has little if any effect on the extent of the interaction (Fig. 5A). These results were confirmed when anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Lyn (Fig. 5A). A constitutive association between Lyn and PKCδ was also observed in MCF-7 and HeLa cells (data not shown). To confirm these findings with another approach, lysates from U-937 cells were separated by sedimentation in a glycerol gradient. Analysis of the gradient fractions by immunoblotting with anti-Lyn and anti-PKCδ demonstrated cosedimentation of Lyn and PKCδ (Fig. 5B). To extend the analysis, anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates from araC-treated U-937/neo and U-937/Lyn(K-R) cells were analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Tyr. The results demonstrate that expression of Lyn(K-R) blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in response to araC (Fig. 5C). In concert with these findings and the demonstration that PKCδ is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (23Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Google Scholar), Lyn(K-R) also attenuated the induction of PKCδ activity by araC (Fig. 5D, left). Conversely, to determine whether PKCδ regulates Lyn in the DNA damage response, anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates from U-937/neo and U-937/PKCδ(K-R) cells were analyzed for Lyn activity by assessing autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation of enolase. The finding that araC-induced activation of Lyn is comparable in U-937/neo and U-937/PKCδ(K-R) cells (Fig. 5D, right) suggests that Lyn may function as an upstream effector of PKCδ. Our previous studies showed that Lyn-induced SAPK activation is MEKK1-dependent (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that PKCδ interacts with MEKK1, anti-MEKK1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ. The results show that complexes of PKCδ and MEKK1 are detectable in control and araC-treated cells (Fig. 6A, left panel). araC-induced increases in the association of PKCδ and MEKK1 were detectable at 0.5 h and maximal at 2 h of treatment (Fig. 6A, right panel). To further assess the interaction between PKCδ and MEKK1, we first performed in vitro kinase assays by incubating recombinant PKCδ with GST or GST-MEKK1 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the products demonstrated that PKCδ phosphorylates MEKK1 in vitro (Fig. 6B). To further define whether PKCδ activates MEKK1, GST-MKK7(K-R) was co-incubated with or without recombinant PKCδ and kinase-active MEKK1 (yeast-derived) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The results demonstrate that MEKK1 phosphorylates GST-MKK7(K-R) and that the addition of recombinant PKCδ increases MEKK1-mediated MKK7(K-R) phosphorylation (Fig. 6C, lane 3). As a control, there was no detectable phosphorylation of MKK7(K-R) by PKCδ (Fig. 6C,lane 1). To extend these findings, anti-SAPK immunoprecipitates from 293T cells expressing PKCδCF and FLAG-tagged kinase-inactive MEKK1(K-M) were analyzed for phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun. The results demonstrate that expression of MEKK1(K-M) decreases PKCδ-induced SAPK activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). These results collectively indicate that MEKK1 is a downstream effector of PKCδ in the SAPK signaling pathway. Involvement of PKCδ in the genotoxic stress response has been supported by the finding that both arrest of DNA replication and induction of DNA lesions are associated with PKCδ activation (23Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Google Scholar,29Yoshida K. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that full-length PKCδ is activated as an early event within 1 h of exposure to genotoxic agents (23Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Google Scholar, 29Yoshida K. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PKCδ on tyrosine as a mechanism for PKCδ activation by DNA-damaging agents is mediated in part by the c-Abl kinase (23Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Google Scholar, 36Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Google Scholar). The results of the present study demonstrate that Lyn also phosphorylates PKCδ and that Lyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ contributes to PKCδ activation. PKCδ is also activated as a later event (3–6 h) in the DNA damage response by caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage (23Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Google Scholar, 30Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

Suzuki K. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 831-838Google Scholar). The resulting C-terminal 40-kDa fragment contains the catalytic domain, which, in the absence of the N-terminal regulatory domain, is constitutively active (30Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Google Scholar, 31Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Google Scholar). The finding that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ is required for activation of caspase-3 and thereby PKCδ cleavage has supported a link between both mechanisms of PKCδ activation (36Blass M. Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Blumberg P. Brodie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 182-195Google Scholar). Whereas expression of PKCδCF induces characteristics of apoptosis (32Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Google Scholar), the precise events responsible for this response are unknown but may involve an interaction between PKCδCF and DNA-PKcs (26Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Google Scholar). In contrast to the activation of PKCδ by tyrosine phosphorylation, cleavage of PKCδ to the constitutively active catalytic fragment is irreversible and thus may function in the prolonged stimulation of multiple pro-apoptotic pathways. SAPK is activated in diverse cell types by agents, such as araC, that block DNA replication and by others, such as IR, that induce DNA lesions (7Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Google Scholar, 8Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Feller S. Mayer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Google Scholar, 9Chen Y.R.

Lin X.H. Yhao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Google Scholar, 12Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnett E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F.-F. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Google Scholar). Like SAPK, PKCδ is also activated by both arrest of DNA replication and DNA damage (23Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Google Scholar, 29Yoshida K. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that treatment of cells with the PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin, attenuates activation of SAPK in response to genotoxic stress. In concert with these findings, expression of the kinase-inactive PKCδ(K-R) mutant attenuated activation of both PKCδ and SAPK in response to araC and IR. Moreover, down-regulation of PKCδ expression by siRNA was associated with attenuation of DNA damage-induced SAPK activation. These findings provided support for the involvement of PKCδ as an upstream effector in the regulation of SAPK activation. The results also demonstrate that inhibition of PKCδ signaling attenuates the early (<1 h) and later periods of SAPK activation. Thus, SAPK is activated by signals transduced by PKCδ and possibly, after activation of caspase-3, by PKCδCF. In this context, the results show that expression of PKCδCF is also associated with SAPK activation. Previous studies have shown that nuclear c-Abl is an upstream effector of the SAPK response to both arrest of DNA replication and DNA damage (7Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Google Scholar, 8Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Feller S. Mayer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Google Scholar). Other work has demonstrated that activated forms of Abl induce SAPK activity (5Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Google Scholar, 38Raitano A.B. Halpern J.R. Hambuch T.M. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11746-11750Google Scholar, 39Renshaw M.W. McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1286-1293Google Scholar). Lyn forms a nuclear complex with c-Abl and, like c-Abl, also contributes to SAPK activation in response to genotoxic stress (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar). Whereas c-Abl activates SAPK by a SEK1-dependent mechanism, Lyn → SAPK signaling is mediated by MKK7 (8Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Feller S. Mayer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Google Scholar, 20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar). The respective roles of the c-Abl → SEK1 → SAPK and the Lyn → MKK7 → SAPK pathways in DNA damage response may vary in different cell types or under different growth conditions. Nonetheless, the finding that inhibition of PKCδ attenuates SAPK activation in response to araC and IR indicates that PKCδ affects one or both of the pathways. c-Abl interacts directly with MEKK1 and activates MEKK1 in response to DNA damage (21Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Yamauchi T. Kumar S. Kaneki M. Kumar V. Bharti A. Yuan Z. Ghanem L. Rana A. Weichselbaum R. Johnson G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4979-4989Google Scholar). In turn, MEKK1 transduces c-Abl-mediated signals to SEK1 and SAPK (8Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Feller S. Mayer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Google Scholar, 21Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Yamauchi T. Kumar S. Kaneki M. Kumar V. Bharti A. Yuan Z. Ghanem L. Rana A. Weichselbaum R. Johnson G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4979-4989Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). The finding that kinase-inactive MEKK1(K-M) blocks Lyn-mediated activation of SAPK provided support for the involvement of MEKK1 in both the c-Abl and Lyn pathways (Fig. 7). However, unlike studies with c-Abl (21Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Yamauchi T. Kumar S. Kaneki M. Kumar V. Bharti A. Yuan Z. Ghanem L. Rana A. Weichselbaum R. Johnson G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4979-4989Google Scholar), the available evidence failed to support a direct interaction between Lyn and MEKK1 (20Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Google Scholar). The present findings demonstrate that Lyn associates with PKCδ and that tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PKCδ is mediated in part by a Lyn-dependent mechanism. The results further demonstrate that PKCδ associates with MEKK1 and that the interaction between PKCδ and MEKK1 is increased in response to DNA damage. Moreover, phosphorylation of MEKK1 by PKCδ stimulated MEKK1 activity. These findings thus collectively support a model in which PKCδ functions downstream to Lyn and as an upstream effector of the MEKK1 → MKK7 → SAPK pathway (Fig. 7). SAPK is activated in the response of cells to environmental stress (40Davis R. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). MKK7 is a specific activator of SAPK, whereas SEK1 (also known as MKK4) activates both SAPK and p38 MAPK. In turn and depending on the type of stress, upstream effectors of MKK7 and SEK1 include MEKK1–4 and the mixed-lineage protein kinases, ASK1–2, TAK1, and TPL2 (40Davis R. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). The available evidence indicates that MEKK1 is activated by the Rho family GTPases (41.Fanger, G., Schlesinger, T., and Johnson, G. (2000).Google Scholar), TRAF family members (42Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Google Scholar), the ECSIT adapter protein (43Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Carothers J. Xiao C. Douglas I. Janeway C.A. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2059-2071Google Scholar), protein kinase G (44Soh J.W. Mao Y. Liu L. Thompson W.J. Pamukcu R. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16406-16410Google Scholar), and c-Abl (21Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Yamauchi T. Kumar S. Kaneki M. Kumar V. Bharti A. Yuan Z. Ghanem L. Rana A. Weichselbaum R. Johnson G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4979-4989Google Scholar). The results of the present studies provide support for PKCδ as yet another effector of MEKK1 activation. PKCδ is activated in response to growth factor receptor stimulation (45Li W. Yu J.C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Google Scholar, 46Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Google Scholar), DNA-damage (23Yuan Z.-M. Utsugisawa T. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1643-1648Google Scholar), and oxidative stress (47Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11223-11237Google Scholar). PKCδ is also activated by caspase-3-mediated cleavage in the apoptotic response. Thus, although the present work has focused on involvement of PKCδ in DNA damage-induced signaling, the findings do not exclude the possibility that PKCδ or PKCδCF contributes to SAPK activation in response to other types of stress.

https://openalex.org/W2003003676,"Coronin 3 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the coronin protein family in mammals. In fibroblasts and HEK 293 cells, it is localized both in the cytosol and in the submembranous cytoskeleton, especially at lamellipodia and membrane ruffles. The carboxyl terminus of all coronins contains a coiled coil suggested to mediate dimerization. We show here that in contrast to other coronin homologues, the recombinant human coronin 3 carboxyl terminus forms oligomers rather than dimers, and that this part is sufficient to bind to and cross-link F-actin in vitro. The carboxyl terminus alone also conferred membrane association in vivo, and removal of the coiled coil abolished membrane localization but notin vitro F-actin binding. Coronin 3 is exclusively extracted as an oligomer from both the cytosol and the membrane fraction. Because oligomerization was not reported for other coronins, it might be a key feature governing coronin 3-specific functions. Cytosolic coronin 3 showed a high degree of phosphorylation, which is likely to regulate the subcellular localization of the protein.

Cytosolic coronin 3 showed a high degree of phosphorylation, which is likely to regulate the subcellular localization of the protein. Coronins are a family of F-actin-associated proteins expressed in a large variety of eukaryotes from yeast to man (1de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Google Scholar). The coronin prototype was isolated from actomyosin complexes of Dictyostelium discoideum (2de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 13: 4097-4104Google Scholar). Mutant analysis and use of GFP fusion proteins inDictyostelium showed that the protein is involved in phagocytosis, locomotion, and cytokinesis (3de Hostos E.L. Rehfuess C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Google Scholar, 4Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Google Scholar, 5Fukui Y. Engler S. Inoue S. de Hostos E.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 42: 204-217Google Scholar). Members of the family were found in lower (Saccharomyces, Entamoeba, and Trichomonas) and higher eukaryotes (Xenopus,Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, and mammals). Whereas lower eukaryotes contain unique coronins, metazoa express several homologues. Two genes were identified in the Drosophila andCaenorhabditis genomes, whereas in the human data base, five different coronin-like proteins were found (own data base search, GIs 7290756 and 7302313) (1de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Google Scholar, 6Rappleye C.A. Paredez A.R. Smith C.W. McDonald K.L. Aroian R.V. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2838-2851Google Scholar). According to a suggestion by Okumura (7Okumura M. Kung C. Wong S. Rodgers M. Thomas M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 779-787Google Scholar), extended by de Hostos (1de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Google Scholar), these can be classified as coronins 1–5. Coronins 1–3 have also been grouped as coronins 1A–1C and coronins 4 and 5 as 2A and 2B, based on their relative homology. All coronins share a central domain containing 5 WD40 repeats with NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions comprising about 70 and 150–200 amino acid residues, respectively. WD40 repeats are found in proteins of different functions and are thought to serve as protein-protein interaction modules (8Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Google Scholar). In coronins, the NH2-terminal sequence, the WD40 repeat elements, and an additional 70-amino acid region COOH-terminal to the repeats are highly conserved. Furthermore, each family member contains a unique, divergent region of about 100 amino acids in the COOH-terminal extension. The very COOH-terminal 30–40 amino acids are predicted to form a coiled coil structure in all homologues, which could mediate self-association of the protein. Recently, dimerization via the coiled coil has been demonstrated for a Xenopus coronin (9Asano S. Mishima M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 225-235Google Scholar), but the role of this module in mammalian homologues has not been investigated. Most coronins are expressed in a strictly tissue-specific manner indicative of tissue-specific functions. Coronin 1 (p57, TACO) is mainly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and is involved in the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex in neutrophils, it also localizes to phagosomes in macrophages (10Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Google Scholar, 11Grogan A. Reeves E. Keep N. Wientjes F. Totty N.F. Burlingame A.L. Hsuan J.J.

Coroninse, a variant of coronin 2 expressed in secretory cells of the gastric mucosa and the kidney, is found at secretory canaliculi (13Parente J.A. Cen X. Zhou C. Petropoulos A. Chew C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3017-3025Google Scholar), coronin 4 (“IR10”) is expressed in testis and, to a lesser extent, in brain (14Zaphiropoulos P.G. Toftgård R. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 1049-1056Google Scholar). Coronin 5 (“Clipin C”) is restricted to neuronal tissue (15Nakamura T. Takeuchi K. Muraoka S. Takezoe H. Takahashi N. Mori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13322-13327Google Scholar), where it accumulates at growth cones and colocalizes with focal adhesions. The most widely expressed mammalian isoform, coronin 3, has not been extensively characterized yet. Its mRNA is found in all tissues examined (7Okumura M. Kung C. Wong S. Rodgers M. Thomas M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 779-787Google Scholar,16Iizaka M. Han H.J. Akashi H. Furukawa Y. Nakajima Y. Sugano S. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 2000; 88: 221-224Google Scholar). F-actin colocalization was found for transfected hemagglutinin-tagged coronin 3 (16Iizaka M. Han H.J. Akashi H. Furukawa Y. Nakajima Y. Sugano S. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 2000; 88: 221-224Google Scholar). Because of its ubiquitous expression, the role of coronin 3 may be a general instead of a tissue-specific one. In this study, we have examined the properties of the unique COOH-terminal region of human coronin 3 (Hcoronin 3). Usingin vitro F-actin binding studies, subcellular fractionation, and stable expression of transfected EGFP 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; WD40 repeat, tryptophan and aspartate containing repeat; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; aa, amino acid(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; WD40 repeat, tryptophan and aspartate containing repeat; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; aa, amino acid(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.-tagged proteins in HEK 293 cells, we found a role for the COOH terminus in F-actin association and cross-linking as well as in localization of the protein to plasma membranes. Whereas the COOH-terminal coiled coil was not necessary for F-actin binding in vitro, it was essential for cortical localization as well as for the formation of homo-oligomers in vitro. Gel filtration of high salt-treated cell fractions suggests that coronin 3 is present in the form of stable oligomers in vivo as well, which contrasts with the suggested coronin dimerization and may be specific for coronin 3, because this function is exerted by the unique region not shared by other homologues.DISCUSSIONCoronin 3 expression is ubiquitous and overlaps with other coronin homologues (7Okumura M. Kung C. Wong S. Rodgers M. Thomas M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 779-787Google Scholar, 16Iizaka M. Han H.J. Akashi H. Furukawa Y. Nakajima Y. Sugano S. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 2000; 88: 221-224Google Scholar). This protein may thus be involved in non-tissue-specific processes or play an accessory role in tissue-specific events. We found endogenous coronin 3 at punctate and filamentous cytoplasmic structures and lamellipodia in different cell lines. Coronin 3 was shuttling between an intracellular pool and the cell cortex during remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton.Hcoronin 3 Localizes to the Plasma Membrane in an Actin-dependent MannerIn addition to its presence in the cytosol, Hcoronin 3 is also associated with membranes in a form that is not extracted by Triton X-100. Because the Hcoronin 3 sequence contains no putative transmembrane domains or prenylation motifs, a direct association with membranes seems unlikely. This view is also supported by the fact that localization of Hcoronin 3 both to the membrane and to punctate cytoplasmic structures in immunofluorescence experiments are abolished by treatment of cells with actin-depolymerizing drugs. In flotation experiments, Hcoronin 3, but not β-actin or E-cadherin, was also found at the bottom of the gradient. This might be because of dissociation of Hcoronin 3-containing protein complexes from the membranes during the assay. Together with the localization to membrane ruffles, this suggests a likely role of coronin 3 in organization of the submembranous cytoskeleton during spreading, adhesion, and cell migration. Stably expressed truncated versions of EGFP-Hcoronin 3 that lacked the COOH-terminal or NH2-terminal non-WD part were not found in the membrane fraction and showed no clear colocalization with cortical F-actin in fluorescence images, although EGFP-Hcoronin 3-(1–444) retained a weak enrichment at lamellipodia. The COOH terminus alone, which harbors both F-actin binding and oligomerization sites, was sufficient for Triton-resistant membrane association. EGFP fluorescence, but not membrane association, has also been studied for truncated versions of Xenopus coronin with similar results (25Mishima M. Nishida E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2833-2842Google Scholar).A further interesting outcome is that the truncated Hcoronin 3 only containing the core region and thus lacking all regions implied in F-actin colocalization, not only failed to localize to membranes, but also affected the shape of the cells (Fig. 7). These cells showed impaired spreading and adhesion to solid supports, whereas cell-cell adhesion was obviously unaffected. This led to a rounded or spindle-like cell shape. Because similarly truncated Xenopuscoronin led to impaired Rac-mediated spreading and lamellipodia formation, Mishima and Nishida (25Mishima M. Nishida E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2833-2842Google Scholar) suggested that the coronin core might directly interact with this small GTPase and might block signal transmission to downstream effectors.In Vitro F-actin Interaction of the Hcoronin 3 COOH TerminusThe COOH-terminal part of Hcoronin 3 is a region most likely harboring both homologue-specific and conserved functions. One function is in F-actin interaction. Although all coronins bind F-actinin vitro, no discrete F-actin binding domain has been defined for any member of the family. Truncation experiments suggest that both NH2- and COOH-terminal regions are required for correct subcellular localization of Xenopus laevis coronin (25Mishima M. Nishida E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2833-2842Google Scholar), which was also found for Hcoronin 3 in this study. It has been suggested that the NH2 terminus might be an F-actin binding domain, whereas the COOH terminus could contribute to F-actin colocalization by mediating dimer formation (9Asano S. Mishima M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 225-235Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that the Hcoronin 3 COOH terminus bound to F-actin in vitro, whereas the NH2 terminus did not (Fig. 10).Interaction of NH2- and COOH-terminal RegionsThe NH2 terminus of Hcoronin 3 bound to the COOH terminus bothin vitro and in vivo in coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 9). The regions of the COOH terminus required for the binding of the NH2 terminus and of F-actin are close to each other and may even overlap (Fig. 10). Thus, the NH2terminus might interfere with F-actin binding. In fact, addition of the NH2 terminus to the COOH-terminal fragment Hcoronin 3-(315–444) markedly reduced F-actin cosedimentation of the COOH-terminal fragment (Fig. 9D). However, no clear reduction of F-actin cosedimentation by the NH2 terminus was found for Hcoronin 3-(315–474) that formed oligomers by the coiled coil. Moreover, the region 315–474 appeared to bind to F-actin and the NH2 terminus simultaneously (Fig. 9C), whereas Hcoronin 3-(315–444) did not. This suggests that, although amino acids 315–444 were sufficient for F-actin binding in vitro, the coiled coil has an influence on this interaction. This might be exerted by synergistic binding of several actin binding sites of the oligomer, or by additional F-actin interacting residues in the coiled coil that are not affected by the NH2 terminus. It is difficult to draw conclusions for the in vivo role of the NH2terminus, but these data suggest that the influence of the NH2 terminus on F-actin binding in vivo is a minor one because F-actin colocalization of EGFP-Hcoronin 3 was drastically decreased when the coiled coil was deleted (Figs. 6 and 7). Nevertheless, it is possible that the failure of the NH2-terminal deleted construct to colocalize with F-actinin vivo is because of a regulatory role of the first 71 amino acids in spatial regulation of F-actin binding (Fig. 7). However, the NH2 terminus might as well exert different roles. For example, intramolecular interaction between NH2- and COOH-terminal parts might be required for the formation of the WD40-propeller structure. Alternatively, intermolecular interactions between the NH2 and COOH termini of different Hcoronin 3 molecules might be required for stable association with F-actin fibers in a way similar to ERM proteins (29Bretscher A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 109-116Google Scholar). On the other hand, these models do not explain why the NH2-terminal truncated protein EGFP-Hcoronin 3-(72–474) failed to localize to the cortex, whereas the even shorter construct EGFP-Hcoronin 3-(315–474) was found at the cortex. It is possible that the lack of the NH2 terminus led to misfolding of the whole protein and thus also abolished functions of the COOH terminus. Another possibility is that the WD repeat region actively causes cytosolic localization and is “antagonized” by the NH2 terminus in the full-length protein.Oligomerization of the COOH TerminusA further feature revealed by the COOH terminus was its ability to form oligomers. Although the coiled coil of coronins is generally regarded to be a dimerization domain (1de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Google Scholar), dimerization was only proven forXenopus coronin (9Asano S. Mishima M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 225-235Google Scholar). Our gel filtration data for the recombinant Hcoronin 3 COOH terminus show the formation of higher order oligomers, most likely trimers, instead of dimers. Computer prediction (multicoil program, Ref. 30Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Google Scholar) suggests a high probability of trimer formation for the Hcoronin 3 coiled coil (0.61 trimer versus0.15 dimer) in contrast to Xenopus coronin (0.19 trimerversus 0.5 dimer) and human coronin 1 (0.09 trimerversus 0.9 dimer). The latter two contain a leucine zipper motif that is absent in coronin 3. We therefore suggest that different coronins might form different homomers, which may be related to their specific functions, e.g. by extending the number of multiple protein-protein interactions. Oligomerization, F-actin binding, and cross-linking properties of the Hcoronin 3 COOH terminus are reminiscent of the Ena-VASP homology domain 2 of mammalian VASP protein (31Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of VASP contains a putative coiled coil as well, is similar in length, and contains one F-actin binding site per molecule. The coiled coil mediates VASP tetramerization, which is a prerequisite for F-actin bundling. The Ena-VASP homology 2 domain represents a novel type of F-actin-binding module and the coronin 3 COOH terminus shows a weak homology to Ena-VASP homology domain 2. Both sequences contain heptad repeats forming a “mixed charge cluster,” which is not found in other coronins. This might point to a common structure for both COOH termini, and the coronin 3 COOH terminus could represent a functionally related module for F-actin interaction. It is not known whether mammalian coronins exhibit F-actin bundling or cross-linking activity also in vivo, but we found that overexpression of EGFP-Hcoronin 3 in cell types other than HEK 293, like COS-7 and Jurkat cells, caused the formation of thick bundle-like structures containing F-actin and EGFP-Hcoronin 3 (not shown). The yeast coronin homologue Cnp1 leads to the formation of similar rod-like F-actin bundles upon overexpression and mediates F-actin cross-linkingin vitro (32Goode B.L. Wong J.J. Butty A.C. Peter M. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 83-98Google Scholar). We also detected the presence of oligomersin vivo. Hcoronin 3 was extracted by 0.6 m KCl both from the cytosolic and particulate fractions of HEK 293 cells nearly completely as an oligomer with an apparent mass of about 150–200 kDa, as shown by gel filtration. This treatment dissolves cytoskeletal complexes (27Berryman M. Gary R. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1231-1243Google Scholar), and it is likely that Hcoronin 3 exists exclusively in the form of oligomers that require hydrophobic interactions. Dimers formed by Xenopus coronin have been reported to be stable even in 2 m KCl and 2 murea (9Asano S. Mishima M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 225-235Google Scholar). Together with the fact that deletion of the coiled coil decreases cortical localization (Fig. 7), our results suggest that oligomerization seems to be a prerequisite, but not sufficient, for membrane association, and other factors may determine translocation of the protein between the cortex and the cytosol.One likely mechanism directing Hcoronin 3 localization is its phosphorylation, because this modification occurs with other coronins (11Grogan A. Reeves E. Keep N. Wientjes F. Totty N.F. Burlingame A.L. Hsuan J.J. Segal A.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3071-3081Google Scholar, 13Parente J.A. Cen X. Zhou C. Petropoulos A. Chew C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3017-3025Google Scholar, 28Reeves E. Dekker L.V. Forbes L.V. Wientjes F.B. Grogan A. Pappin D.J.C. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 859-866Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we found that the majority of Hcoronin 3 from cytosolic fractions had a pI different from the predicted one, whereas Hcoronin 3 from the particulate fraction was not modified. This suggests that association with and dissociation from the membrane-associated cytoskeleton requires phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Similarly, the dissociation of coronin 1 from phagosomes requires phosphorylation by protein kinase C (33Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Google Scholar). The Hcoronin 3 sequence contains, among potential target sites for other Ser/Thr kinases, eight possible target sites for PKC (34Kreegipuu A. Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Google Scholar), allowing for comparable processes in the dissociation of coronin 1 from phagosomes and in the dissociation of coronin 3 from the cortical cytoskeleton. Coronins are a family of F-actin-associated proteins expressed in a large variety of eukaryotes from yeast to man (1de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Google Scholar). The coronin prototype was isolated from actomyosin complexes of Dictyostelium discoideum (2de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 13: 4097-4104Google Scholar). Mutant analysis and use of GFP fusion proteins inDictyostelium showed that the protein is involved in phagocytosis, locomotion, and cytokinesis (3de Hostos E.L. Rehfuess C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Google Scholar, 4Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Google Scholar, 5Fukui Y. Engler S. Inoue S. de Hostos E.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 42: 204-217Google Scholar). Members of the family were found in lower (Saccharomyces, Entamoeba, and Trichomonas) and higher eukaryotes (Xenopus,Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, and mammals). Whereas lower eukaryotes contain unique coronins, metazoa express several homologues. Two genes were identified in the Drosophila andCaenorhabditis genomes, whereas in the human data base, five different coronin-like proteins were found (own data base search, GIs 7290756 and 7302313) (1de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Google Scholar, 6Rappleye C.A. Paredez A.R. Smith C.W. McDonald K.L. Aroian R.V. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2838-2851Google Scholar). According to a suggestion by Okumura (7Okumura M. Kung C. Wong S. Rodgers M. Thomas M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 779-787Google Scholar), extended by de Hostos (1de Hostos E.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Google Scholar), these can be classified as coronins 1–5. Coronins 1–3 have also been grouped as coronins 1A–1C and coronins 4 and 5 as 2A and 2B, based on their relative homology. All coronins share a central domain containing 5 WD40 repeats with NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions comprising about 70 and 150–200 amino acid residues, respectively. WD40 repeats are found in proteins of different functions and are thought to serve as protein-protein interaction modules (8Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Google Scholar). In coronins, the NH2-terminal sequence, the WD40 repeat elements, and an additional 70-amino acid region COOH-terminal to the repeats are highly conserved. Furthermore, each family member contains a unique, divergent region of about 100 amino acids in the COOH-terminal extension. The very COOH-terminal 30–40 amino acids are predicted to form a coiled coil structure in all homologues, which could mediate self-association of the protein. Recently, dimerization via the coiled coil has been demonstrated for a Xenopus coronin (9Asano S. Mishima M. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 225-235Google Scholar), but the role of this module in mammalian homologues has not been investigated. Most coronins are expressed in a strictly tissue-specific manner indicative of tissue-specific functions. Coronin 1 (p57, TACO) is mainly expressed in hematopoietic tissues and is involved in the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex in neutrophils, it also localizes to phagosomes in macrophages (10Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Google Scholar, 11Grogan A. Reeves E. Keep N. Wientjes F. Totty N.F. Burlingame A.L. Hsuan J.J.

Coroninse, a variant of coronin 2 expressed in secretory cells of the gastric mucosa and the kidney, is found at secretory canaliculi (13Parente J.A. Cen X. Zhou C. Petropoulos A. Chew C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3017-3025Google Scholar), coronin 4 (“IR10”) is expressed in testis and, to a lesser extent, in brain (14Zaphiropoulos P.G. Toftgård R. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 1049-1056Google Scholar). Coronin 5 (“Clipin C”) is restricted to neuronal tissue (15Nakamura T. Takeuchi K. Muraoka S. Takezoe H. Takahashi N. Mori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13322-13327Google Scholar), where it accumulates at growth cones and colocalizes with focal adhesions. The most widely expressed mammalian isoform, coronin 3, has not been extensively characterized yet. Its mRNA is found in all tissues examined (7Okumura M. Kung C. Wong S. Rodgers M. Thomas M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 779-787Google Scholar,16Iizaka M. Han H.J. Akashi H. Furukawa Y. Nakajima Y. Sugano S. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 2000; 88: 221-224Google Scholar). F-actin colocalization was found for transfected hemagglutinin-tagged coronin 3 (16Iizaka M. Han H.J. Akashi H. Furukawa Y. Nakajima Y. Sugano S. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 2000; 88: 221-224Google Scholar). Because of its ubiquitous expression, the role of coronin 3 may be a general instead of a tissue-specific one. In this study, we have examined the properties of the unique COOH-terminal region of human coronin 3 (Hcoronin 3). Usingin vitro F-actin binding studies, subcellular fractionation, and stable expression of transfected EGFP 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; WD40 repeat, tryptophan and aspartate containing repeat; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; aa, amino acid(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 1The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; WD40 repeat, tryptophan and aspartate containing repeat; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; aa, amino acid(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.-tagged proteins in HEK 293 cells, we found a role for the COOH terminus in F-actin association and cross-linking as well as in localization of the protein to plasma membranes. Whereas the COOH-terminal coiled coil was not necessary for F-actin binding in vitro, it was essential for cortical localization as well as for the formation of homo-oligomers in vitro. Gel filtration of high salt-treated cell fractions suggests that coronin 3 is present in the form of stable oligomers in vivo as well, which contrasts with the suggested coronin dimerization and may be specific for coronin 3, because this function is exerted by the unique region not shared by other homologues. DISCUSSIONCoronin 3 expression is ubiquitous and overlaps with other coronin homologues (7Okumura M. Kung C. Wong S. Rodgers M. Thomas M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 779-787Google Scholar, 16Iizaka M. Han H.J. Akashi H. Furukawa Y. Nakajima Y. Sugano S. Ogawa M. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 2000; 88: 221-224Google Scholar). This protein may thus be involved in non-tissue-specific processes or play an accessory role in tissue-specific events. We found endogenous coronin 3 at punctate and filamentous cytoplasmic structures and lamellipodia in different cell lines. Coronin 3 was shuttling between an intracellular pool and the cell cortex during remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton.Hcoronin 3 Localizes to the Plasma Membrane in an Actin-dependent MannerIn addition to its presence in the cytosol, Hcoronin 3 is also associated with membranes in a form that is not extracted by Triton X-100. Because the Hcoronin 3 sequence contains no putative transmembrane domains or prenylation motifs, a direct association with membranes seems unlikely. This view is also supported by the fact that localization of Hcoronin 3 both to the membrane and to punctate cytoplasmic structures in immunofluorescence experiments are abolished by treatment of cells with actin-depolymerizing drugs. In flotation experiments, Hcoronin 3, but not β-actin or E-cadherin, was also found at the bottom of the gradient. This might be because of dissociation of Hcoronin 3-containing protein complexes from the membranes during the assay. Together with the localization to membrane ruffles, this suggests a likely role of coronin 3 in organization of the submembranous cytoskeleton during spreading, adhesion, and cell migration.

Posttranslational addition of lipid to carboxyl-terminal CaaX box (where C represents cysteine, a is generally an aliphatic residue, and X can be any amino acid) is required to target Ras proteins to the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane. The pathway by which Ras translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane is currently not clear. We have performed genetic screen to identify components of the Ras plasma membrane localization pathway. Mutations in two genes, ERF2 and ERF4/SHR5, have been shown to affect the palmitoylation and subcellular localization of Ras proteins. In this report, we show that Erf4p is localized on the endoplasmic reticulum as peripheral membrane protein in complex with Erf2p, an integral membrane protein that was identified from the same genetic screen. Erf2p has been shown to be required for the plasma membrane localization of GFP-Ras2p via pathway distinct from the classical secretory pathway (X. Dong and R. J. Deschenes, manuscript in preparation). We show here that Erf4p, like Erf2p, is involved in the plasma membrane localization of Ras2p. Erf2p and Erf4p represent components of previously uncharacterized subcellular transport pathway involved in the plasma membrane targeting of Ras proteins."

Similarly, exon 12 encoding for the 3 amino acids located between the T1 and T2 functional fragments of cTnT (8Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also alternatively spliced by a developmentally independent mechanism (9Jin J.-P. Huang Q.-Q. Yeh H.-I Lin J.J.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of exon 12 region is unclear, the alternative splicing of exons 4 and 5 alters the modulatory NH2-terminal variable region of TnT (10Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Inclusion or exclusion of the 10 amino acids encoded by the embryonic exon 5 in cTnT results in embryonic and adult cTnT isoforms with significant changes in activation of the actomyosin ATPase (11Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In comparison, alternate splicing of exon 4 results in much smaller structural and functional differences (12Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2668-2672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these observations demonstrate that structural variations in the NH2-terminal region of cTnT can affect the function of cardiac muscle. In contrast to the fact that most adult avian and mammalian hearts express only a single cTnT isoform, we have found the expression of an additional cTnT splicing variant resulting from the exclusion of 12 amino acids encoded by the exon 8 in the heart of the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) turkey (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This abnormal splicing pathway resulted in a low molecular weight cTnT exhibiting altered molecular conformation and binding affinity for troponin I (TnI) and tropomyosin (Tm). These structure-function changes in turkey cTnT altered the calcium activation of reconstituted thin filaments (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol.

The pathological role of cTnT structure-function abnormalities in cardiomyopathy and heart failure has been demonstrated by multiple point mutations in cTnT as well as the altered expression of splicing variants (14Anderson P.A.W.

It is worth noting that all turkeys, including domestic, wild, and the DCM models, constitutively express the abnormal low molecular weight cTnT lacking the exon 8 segment (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of two classes of cTnT that are different in function will generate heterogeneity in the thin filament regulatory system. Because the myocardium normally contracts as a syncytium, the heterogeneity will desynchronize the myocardial contraction and may be a key factor responsible for the high incidence of DCM in turkeys. This example indicates that abnormalities in cTnT mRNA splicing may play a role in the pathogenesis of DCM. In the present study, we found that the aberrant splicing of cTnT also occurs in mammalian hearts that exhibit a high correlation to the spontaneous development of DCM. The canine cTnT demonstrates the skipping of the exon 7 segment, the mammalian equivalent to the avian exon 8 previously found to be excluded from the DCM turkey cTnT. An exclusion of the adjacent exon 6-encoded segment occurs in the guinea pig cTnT. We also found abnormal retention of the embryonic exon 5 in the adult cat, dog, and guinea pig cTnT. The aberrant splicing patterns of canine cTnT are different in developing cardiac and skeletal muscles, suggesting abnormalities of trans-regulatory factors. Transgenic (TG) expression of the aberrantly spliced cTnT variants resulted in functional changes in adult TG mouse cardiomyocytes. The findings support the hypothesis that thin filament heterogeneity due to the co-expression of alternatively spliced cTnT variants may desynchronize myocardial contraction and contribute to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. A mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) previously developed by immunization with purified bovine cTnT (CT3) (20Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1067-C1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used in the present study. The CT3 mAb cross-reacts with slow skeletal muscle TnT but not fast skeletal muscle TnT. The distinct mobility of cTnT and slow TnT in SDS-gel electrophoresis allows an easy identification of cTnT in Western blots. The CT3 epitope has been mapped in the COOH-terminal domain of TnT (20Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1067-C1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle tissues were collected from experimental animals immediately post mortem and stored at −80 °C. The frozen or fresh tissues were directly homogenized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer containing 1% SDS. Caution was applied to minimize the time of sample processing to avoid protein degradation. After being heated at 80 °C for 5 min, the samples were stored at −80 °C until use. The muscle protein extracts were resolved by 14% Laemmli gel with an acrylamide-to-bisacrylamide ratio of 180:1. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to reveal the resolved protein bands. Duplicated gels were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as previously described (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After blocking in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the anti-cTnT mAb CT3. The membranes were then washed with high stringency using Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% SDS, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse second antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.), washed again, and developed in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution as previously described (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Densitometric quantification of the Western blots was carried out using Image 1.61 software (National Institutes of Health). The ratios among the cTnT bands detected by the same mAb were used to evaluate the relative amounts of the cTnT splicing variants. As described previously (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) total RNA from domestic cat, Hartley guinea pig, and Doberman pincher dog ventricular muscle was isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two micrograms of the cardiac RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcription (RT) using an oligonucleotide primer (5′-T19V-3′) complementary to the beginning of the poly-A tail of mRNAs. Cardiac TnT cDNA was amplified from the total cardiac cDNA by PCR using a degenerative forward primer (5′- CACATATGTCKGACVYVGARGARGWGGTGG-3′) synthesized corresponding to the exon 2 sequence in mammalian cTnT covering the translation initiation codon and a degenerative reverse primer (5′-GAGAATTCTAYTTCCARCGYCCGGTGAC-3′) synthesized corresponding to the complementary sequence of exon 17 in mammalian cTnT covering the translation stop codon. Restriction endonucleaseNdeI and EcoRI cleavage sites were engineered in the primers (the underlined sequences) for later cloning into a prokaryotic expression vector. Resultant PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and ligated into the pCR4 vector using the TOPO system (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmid DNA was purified, and the cDNA insert was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. cDNAs encoding the cTnT splicing variants were isolated by NdeI andEcoRI digestion, subcloned into the pET17b expression vector, and used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli cells. Freshly transformed E. coli was cultured in rich liquid media containing ampicillin and chloramphenical and induced at mid-log phase with isopropyl-1-thiol-β-d-galactoside (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After three additional hours of culture the bacterial cells were harvested, lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot as described above. The total ventricular muscle protein extracts were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (21Jin J.-P. Lin J.J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first dimension was isoelectric focusing (IEF) in Bio-Rad mini tube gels containing pH 3.5–10 Ampholine (Amersham Biosciences). After electrophoresis at 350 V for 16 h and 700 V for 1 h, the IEF gel was equilibrated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min and loaded onto a 14% Laemmli slab mini gel with an acrylamide-to-bisacrylamide ratio of 180:1 for the second dimension SDS-PAGE. Five minutes after the bromphenol blue dye front ran off the bottom edge, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to reveal the resolved protein spots or transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting using the CT3 mAb as described above. Genomic DNA was prepared from a lymphonodus of a male Doberman pincher dog by proteinase K digestion and phenol/CHCl3 extraction as previously described (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for PCR amplification of the segment containing the exon 6 to exon 8 region of the canine cTnT gene. Sequence of the forward primer (5′-GGCTGCGACGGAGGAGACCAACGCG-3′) was chosen within the exon 6. Sequence of the reverse primer (5′-GGTTTGGACTCCTCCACCGGGCCAT-3′) was complementary to the exon 8 sequence. By PCR usingPfu DNA polymerase with proofreading activity (Stratagene), a DNA fragment of ∼1.2 kb was specifically amplified from the canine genomic DNA. This PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned into the pCR4-TOPO plasmid vector, and sequenced as described above. The cDNA and genomic DNA sequences as well as the deduced protein primary structures were analyzed using the DNAStar computer program. As described previously (22Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 231-242Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), transgenic mice were constructed on a C57BL/6 background using cloned mouse cardiac α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter (23, generously provided by Dr. Jeffrey Robbins, University of Cincinnati) to direct a heart-specific, post-natal expression of mouse cTnT cDNA encoding the high molecular weight embryonic isoform or the exon 7-deleted variant. For reliable functional characterization, segregation of the transgene allele was confirmed for both transgenic constructs during breeding of the founder lines. The expression of the exogenous cTnT in the transgenic mouse hearts was verified by Western blots using the CT3 mAb as above. The relative amounts of exogenous and endogenous cTnT in the transgenic mouse cardiac muscle were determined by densitometric quantification of the Western blots as described above. The incorporation of exogenous cTnT into the cardiac muscle thin filaments of the transgenic mice was verified by Western blots on Triton X-100-washed cardiac myofibrils as described previously (22Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 231-242Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An anti-TnI mAb TnI-1 and an anti-Tm mAb CH1 were used in Western blots to verify the normal expression of cardiac TnI and Tm in the transgenic mouse cardiac muscle (22Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 231-242Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mice of both sexes, 4–5 months old, were used for functional characterization. Wild type C57BL/6 mice of similar age (Charles River) were used as controls. Cardiomyocytes were enzymatically isolated from the transgenic and wild type mice by perfusion with Ca2+ free Joklik solution containing collagenase and returned to 1.25 mmCa2+ as described previously (24Yu Z. Jin J.-P. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: A83Google Scholar). Rod-shaped single cardiomyocytes with a sharp outline and clearly visible striations were selected for contractile analysis. The cardiomyocytes were loaded into a closed chamber mounted on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope through a heating adapter and continuously superfused with oxygenated physiological buffer containing 132 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 12 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm pyruvic acid, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2, at 37 °C. The cardiomyocytes were paced using a Myopacer field stimulator (IonOptix, Milton, MA) to produce contraction at 1, 2, 5, and 10 Hz in the absence or presence of 10 nm isoproterenol. An IonOptix video system (Milton, MA) was used to record the cell length by two-edge detection. Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 240 Hz and analyzed by the SoftEdge computer program from IonOptix. The data were exported to the program Excel, and statistic analysis was carried out using Student t test. It is well documented that a switch from the embryonic to adult cTnT isoform expression occurs during perinatal development (21Jin J.-P. Lin J.J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The adult mammalian heart normally expresses a single cTnT isoform or in a few species such as bovine and mouse, two very similar cTnT isoforms resulting from the inclusion or exclusion of the 4–5 amino acids encoded by exon 4 (Fig. 1). However, Western blots using anti-cTnT mAb detected one to five additional cTnT variants constituting a heterogeneity of cTnT in the adult heart of the cat, pig, monkey, guinea pig, and dog (Fig. 2). The high molecular weight cTnT variants found in the adult pig, monkey, cat, dog, and guinea pig hearts co-migrated with the embryonic cTnT in SDS-PAGE. The low molecular weight cTnT variants detected in the dog and guinea pig hearts were significantly smaller than the low molecular weight adult cTnT previously reported in mammalian cardiac muscle (TnT4) (11Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35341-35349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) but similar to that found in the DCM turkey heart resulting from the abnormal exclusion of exon 8 from the avian cTnT gene (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast to the two cTnT variants found in the adult turkey heart, adult dog and guinea pig hearts both express six cTnT variants, of which the two guinea pig low molecular weight cTnTs are the smallest (Fig. 2).Figure 2The nature of the abnormal high and low molecular weight cTnT variants. Western blot analysis of total ventricular muscle homogenate using the anti-cTnT mAb CT3 compared the multiple cTnT variants in the adult heart of the cat, pig, dog, and guinea pig with the neonatal mouse and DCM turkey cardiac muscle samples. The alignment shows that the cat, pig, dog, and guinea pig high molecular weight cTnT variants are of similar size to that of the mouse embryonic cTnT. The low molecular weight cTnT variants found in the dog are similar to that in the turkey heart. The guinea pig low molecular weight cTnT variants were the smallest size observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Utilizing RT-PCR we cloned cDNAs encoding the two cat, six guinea pig, and six canine cTnT variants detected by Western blots. Sequencing of the cDNAs revealed alternative RNA splicing of four NH2-terminal coding exons in the cTnT gene of the three species. The cDNA sequences of the splicing variants of cat, guinea pig, and dog cTnT have been submitted to the GenBankTM/EBI data bank with accession numbers AF519619,AF519620, AF519741, AF519742, AF519743, AF519744, AF519745,AF519746, AY120356, AY120357, AY005140, AY005141, AY005142, andAY005143. Protein primary structure maps of the mammalian cTnT variants were constructed from the deduced amino acid sequences and are shown in Fig. 3. Comparison of the cTnT variants demonstrates that the high molecular weight cTnT found in the adult cat heart is the result of the abnormal inclusion of embryonic exon 5 encoding 10 amino acids. The six cTnT variants found in the adult dog heart were due to alternative splicing of exons 4, 5, and 7. In addition to the normal adult isoforms, abnormal inclusion of the embryonic exon 5 was responsible for the two high molecular cTnT variants, whereas the skipping of exon 7 deleted 12 amino acids and produced the low molecular weight cTnT. The exon 7 of mammalian cTnT gene is equivalent to the exon 8 in avian cTnT gene. Therefore, the aberrant low molecular weight dog cTnTs are equivalent to the low molecular weight cTnT found in the DCM turkey heart (13Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As seen in the bovine and mouse cTnT, alternative splicing of exon 4 encoding 5 amino acids produced two variants each of the adult, embryonic and exon 7-deleted cTnT. Similar to the dog cTnT variants, the two high molecular weight cTnTs found in the adult guinea pig heart were the result of the abnormal inclusion of the embryonic exon 5. However, unlike the splicing of the dog and turkey low molecular weight cTnT variants, the two low molecular weight cTnTs found in the guinea pig heart resulted from abnormal exclusion of the exon 6-encoded segment (Fig. 3). Inclusion or exclusion of exon 4 encoding 4 amino acids is responsible for the two variants of adult and high and low molecular weight guinea pig cTnTs. Both exons 6 and 7 are normally constitutively expressed exons in all cTnTs previously characterized. Exon 6 in the mammalian cTnT genes encodes a large segment (9Jin J.-P. Huang Q.-Q. Yeh H.-I Lin J.J.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) corresponding to that encoded by two exons, exon 6 and 7, in the avian cTnT gene (3Cooper T.A. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11140-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exon 6 of guinea pig cTnT gene encodes for 25 amino acids, and its abnormal exclusion results in a rather large structural change (Fig. 3 and TableI).Table IPhysical properties of the guinea pig, cat, and dog cTnT variantscTnT Variant1-aWT, wild type; ΔE, exon deletion; aa, number of amino acids; MW, molecular weight; pI, isoelectric point.aaMWpITurkey embryonic WT1-aWT, wild type; ΔE, exon deletion; aa, number of amino acids; MW, molecular weight; pI, isoelectric point.1-bCalculated using the adult sequences plus the chicken embryonic exon 5 segment, assuming the turkey exon 5 segment is identical to the chicken counterpart.30336,1954.96Turkey adult WT29334,8905.25Turkey adult ΔE828133,6505.42Cat embryonic29435,2904.95Cat adult28433,9575.19Guinea pig embryonic #129835,6474.88Guinea pig embryonic #229435,2194.93Guinea pig adult #128934,4575.06Guinea pig adult #228534,0295.14Guinea pig ΔE6 #126431,9105.83Guinea pig ΔE6 #226031,4816.22Dog embryonic #129635,2815.07Dog embryonic #229134,7235.19Dog adult #128734,0695.24Dog adult #228233,5115.42Dog ΔE7 #127532,8685.50Dog ΔE7 #227032,3105.841-a WT, wild type; ΔE, exon deletion; aa, number of amino acids; MW, molecular weight; pI, isoelectric point.1-b Calculated using the adult sequences plus the chicken embryonic exon 5 segment, assuming the turkey exon 5 segment is identical to the chicken counterpart. Open table in a new tab Expression of the cloned cDNA encoding the four abnormal dog cTnT variants in E. coli yielded proteins recognized by the anti-cTnT mAb CT3 with sizes identical to those found in the dog cardiac muscle (Fig. 4). The results confirm the authenticity of the cDNA cloning. The physical properties of the alternatively spliced cat, dog, and guinea pig cTnT variants calculated from the deduced primary structures are summarized in Table I. The data demonstrate that the abnormal inclusion and/or exclusion of exons 5, 6, or 7 in the cat, guinea pig, and dog cTnTs resulted in substantial changes in the molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI). Western blot analysis by the mAb CT3 of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on left ventricular homogenates from the adult cat, dog, and guinea pig hearts further confirmed the changes in both molecular weight and pI of the cTnT splicing variants (Fig. 5) as calculated from the amino acid sequences (Table I). Fig. 6 Ademonstrates a good linear correlation between the size of the alternatively spliced cTnT variants and their overall charge, confirming that the NH2-terminal structure determines the charge features of TnT (25Wang J. Jin J.-P. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The alternative splicing of exon 4 encoding 5 amino acids in dog cTnT and 4 amino acids in guinea pig cTnT further added differences to the structural variations. Fig. 6 B compared the combined effects of exons 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the physical property of canine and guinea pig cTnT. The results demonstrate that the inclusion or exclusion of the 4 or 5 amino acids encoded by exon 4 only results in relatively small changes of pI when exon 7 in dog or exon 6 in guinea pig cTnT is included. However, it produces significantly larger effects when both exons 5 and 7 in dog cTnT or exons 5 and 6 in guinea pig cTnT are excluded. The progressively additive effects of the alternatively spliced NH2-terminal exons on the structure of cTnT suggest that the abnormal exclusion of exon 7 or 6 from adult cTnT results in a critical decrease in the buffering capacity of the protein structure, which significantly reduces the tolerance of the NH2terminus to structural variation such as the non-developmentally regulated alternative splicing of exon 4.Figure 5The aberrant cTnT variants expressed in the cat, guinea pig, and dog cardiac muscle exhibit altered isoelectric point. Western blot analysis using the anti-cTnT mAb CT3 on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-resolved total ventricular muscle homogenates demonstrated that the alternatively spliced cTnT variants are different in their overall charge, consistent with that predicted from sequence data (Table I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Correlation between the NH2-terminal alternative splicing and pI of the cTnT variants.

Its active form, {Pt(ammine)(cyclohexylamine)}2+, binds to DNA similarly to cisplatin, forming intra- and interstrand cross-links between adjacent purine bases. Since {Pt(ammine)(cyclohexylamine)}2+ contains two different ligands, it can form two isomeric 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-links. Here we report the 2.4-Å resolution x-ray crystal structure of the major adduct between {Pt(ammine)(cyclohexylamine)}2+ and a DNA dodecamer, using the same sequence as previously reported for crystal structures of cisplatin-DNA (Takahara, P. M., Rosenzweig, A. C., Frederick, C. A., and Lippard, S. J. (1995)Nature 377, 649–652) and oxaliplatin-DNA (Spingler, B., Whittington, D. A., and Lippard, S. J. (2001) Inorg. Chem. 40, 5596–5602). Both duplexes in the asymmetric unit contain 1,2-intrastrand cross-links in which the cyclohexylamine ligand is directed toward the 3′-end of the platinated strand. The chair conformation of the cyclohexyl group is clearly resolved. Platination distorts the duplex, resulting in a global bend angle of about 38o and a dihedral angle between platinated guanine bases of ∼31o. Both end-to-end and end-to-groove packing interactions occur in the crystal lattice, the latter positioned in the minor groove across from the site of the platinum cross-link. A high degree of homology observed between this structure and the previously reported platinum-DNA structures suggests that these platinum complexes distort the DNA duplex in a very similar manner. These results suggest that differences in activity between these drugs are unlikely to result from gross conformational distortions in DNA structure following platinum intrastrand cross-link formation. cis-trans-cis-Ammine(cyclohexylamine)diacetatodichloroplatinum(IV) is an oral analog of the platinum anti-cancer drug cisplatin that is currently in phase III clinical trials.

The diminished activity of cisplatin against several other cancers, the acquired immunity developed by many tumors, and unpleasant side effects caused by the drug have led to a search for improved platinum chemotherapeutics (2Chu G.

Soc. 1996; 118: 12309-12321Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar). An NMR solution structure shows appreciably more bending and a larger dihedral angle between the cross-linked guanine bases than observed in the crystal structure (8Gelasco A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9230-9239Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the complex formed between domain A of high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1a) and a cisplatin-DNA d(GpG) cross-link, a phenylalanine residue of the protein intercalates into the widened minor groove at the site of platination (9Ohndorf U.-M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The binding of HMG-domain proteins to cisplatin adducts potentiates the activity of the drug by shielding the DNA from nucleotide excision repair and possibly by diverting the protein from its native function (10Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 11Vichi P. Coin F. Renaud J.-P. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.H. Moras D.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16307-16315Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). cis-trans-cis-Ammine(cyclohexylamine)diacetatodichloroplatinum(IV) is a platinum(IV) compound related to cisplatin. It can be administered orally and has been in phase III clinical trials (13Ferrante K. Winograd B. Canetta R. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S61-S68Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Wong E. Giandomenico C.M. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2451-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of this compound is similar to that of other mononuclear platinum anti-cancer drugs following conversion tocis-ammine(cyclohexylamine)dichloroplatinum(II) by intracellular reducing agents, such as glutathione. The activated species, {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+(NH2Cy is cyclohexylamine), forms two 1,2-d(GpG) adducts with DNA, termed 3′ and 5′ orientational isomers (15Hartwig J.F. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5646-5654Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), according to the positioning of the substituted amine with respect to the direction of the platinated strand. These isomers occur in an ∼2:1 ratio, the more abundant isomer having the cyclohexylamine ligand directed toward the 3′-end of the platinated strand (15Hartwig J.F. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5646-5654Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The differences in activity among platinum drugs may involve variations in their DNA binding properties. Very few studies have been performed to explore this possibility. Recent work has demonstrated that both the nature of the ligands on the platinum atom and the bases immediately flanking the d(GpG) adduct can affect the binding of HMGB1 to platinated DNA (16Wei M. Cohen S.M. Silverman A.P. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38774-38780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that HMGB1a differentially recognizes the adducts of platinum complexes containing different carrier ligands and that HMGB1a binds to {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+ adducts in TG*G*A and AG*G*C sequences about half as well as cisplatin adducts. It has also been demonstrated that {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+ adducts are more effective than those of oxaliplatin and cisplatin in blocking translesion synthesis past the site of damage (17Vaisman A. Lim S.E. Patrick S.M. Copeland W.C. Hinkle D.C. Turchi J.J. Chaney S.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11026-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This property may be one reason for its success in early clinical trials. Structural studies have provided important information about the interactions between platinum compounds and DNA. The crystal structures of cisplatin (6Takahara P.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 7Takahara P.M. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12309-12321Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and oxaliplatin (18Spingler B. Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 40: 5596-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) bound to homologous DNA sequences reveal several interesting differences and provide some insight into the effects of carrier ligands on the structure of platinum-DNA adducts. The most significant feature of the oxaliplatin-DNA structure that differentiates it from that of the cisplatin-DNA adduct is the presence of a hydrogen bond between the O6 atom of G7 and an amino group of the coordinated 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (dach) ligand. In the present article we report the first x-ray crystal structure of an asymmetric platinum complex, {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+, bound to a DNA duplex. For comparison purposes we have employed the same DNA sequence as used for the previous two structures (Fig. 2). The major orientational isomer of this platinum complex was investigated. This work significantly extends the structural information available on platinum-DNA adducts and offers insights into the differences and common features between a variety of platinated DNA structures. The compoundcis-[Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)Cl2] was prepared by standard methods (19Abrams M.J. Giandomenico C.M. Vollano J.F. Schwartz D.A. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1987; 131: 3-4Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Barton S.J. Barnham K.J. Habtemariam A. Sue R.E. Sadler P.J. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1998; 273: 8-13Crossref Google Scholar). Crystallization reagents were obtained from Aldrich, Fluka, and Sigma. Phosphoramidites and reagents for DNA synthesis were purchased from Glen Research. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out on a Waters 600E system controller using a Waters 486 detector (λ, 260 nm) for preparative runs, and on a Waters 600S controller with a Waters 2487 detector (λ, 260 nm) for analytical runs. Top and bottom strands of the 12-bp deoxyoligonucleotide (top strand sequence 5′-d(CCTCTGGTCTCC)) were prepared (10-μmol scale, 2 syntheses for top strand) by using standard phosphoramidite methods on an Applied Biosystems 392 RNA/DNA synthesizer. After automated synthesis, the oligonucleotides were deprotected with ammonium hydroxide by incubating the crude reaction mixtures at 65 °C for 1 h. The bottom strand was purified by ion-exchange HPLC (Dionex NucleoPac PA-100, 9 mm × 250 mm, 10% acetonitrile, 25 mmammonium acetate, linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.4 m NaCl over 30 min). The product was desalted by dialysis against water using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Pierce). The resulting product was analytically pure as judged by both ion exchange and C18 reverse-phase HPLC. The top strand was platinated with {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+. Activated {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+ was prepared by mixing 2 equivalents of silver nitrate with 1 equivalent ofcis-[Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)Cl2] in 1.0 ml of water for 6 h. The mixture was protected from light and centrifuged to remove precipitated silver chloride. The top strand was platinated with 2.2 equivalents of the activated platinum complex in a solution containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) at 37 °C for 22 h. The product was purified by ion-exchange HPLC (Dionex NucleoPac PA-100, 9 mm × 250 mm, 10% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium acetate, linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.4m NaCl over 30 min). Two product peaks were observed and collected separately. The products were then dialyzed against water using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes. The major product was purified by reverse phase HPLC (C18Vydac Column, linear gradient from 7.5% acetonitrile, 0.0925m ammonium acetate to 17.5% acetonitrile, 0.0772m ammonium acetate over 30 min). The purified platinated deoxyoligonucleotide top strand was then annealed to the purified bottom strand by using 1 equivalent of each strand and 1× annealing buffer (100 mm MgCl2, 100 mm HEPES pH 7, and 500 mm LiCl) in 1 ml of solution. The mixture was heated to 85 °C for 1.0 min, and the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature over 2 h. The annealed product was purified by ion-exchange HPLC (Dionex NucleoPac PA-100, 9 mm × 250 mm, 10% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium acetate, linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.4m LiCl over 30 min). The purified double-stranded product was dialyzed against water as before. Finally, the duplex was re-annealed by heating to 80 °C for 1 min, followed by cooling to room temperature over 2 h. The hanging drop vapor diffusion method was used for crystallization (21Drenth J. Principles of Protein X-ray Crystallography. Springer, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). Initial conditions were obtained from a nucleic acid sparse matrix screen, Natrix (Hampton Research) (22Scott W.G. Finch J.T. Grenfell R. Fogg J. Smith T. Gait M.J. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Crystals suitable for diffraction were grown at 4 °C from 3-μl droplets containing 0.2 mm DNA and 0.5× well solution (1× well solution contained 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 12 mm spermine, 120 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 15% w/v polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000). The crystallization drops were equilibrated against a 1× well solution at 4 °C. Crystals of approximate dimensions of 0.5 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm appeared after 5–10 days. Crystals were transferred to a cryogenic freezing solution containing 50 mm Na cacodylate (pH 6.5), 12 mm spermine, 120 mmMg(OAc)2, 25% PEG 4000, and 15% glycerol at 4 °C, then mounted in a loop and frozen at 100 K under liquid nitrogen. Crystals were screened for diffraction on a Mar Research detector (mar345 345 mm 150 marpck plate) with CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54179 Å. Several crystals that diffracted to 2.8-Å resolution or better were stored on loops under liquid nitrogen. Data frames from these crystals were auto-indexed to determine unit cell parameters using the HKL program suite (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). From the cell constants and lack of systematic absences, the space group was determined to be P1. A high-resolution data set was collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. A data set with diffraction to 2.4-Å resolution was collected at 100 K on beam line SCD 19-ID (wavelength 0.970 Å). A total of 360 frames of data were taken, with φ varying by 1° per frame, using a 10-s exposure time per frame. The intensities were integrated by using DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

University of Gottingen:, Gottingen1997Google Scholar), using the resolution range 50–2.4 Å. Manual refinement and rebuilding of the structure were performed with XTALVIEW (25McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The unit cell dimensions revealed the crystal to be isomorphous with the previously reported cisplatin-DNA structure (6Takahara P.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar,7Takahara P.M. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27555) Google Scholar). Two platinated DNA duplexes comprise the asymmetric unit. The platinum atoms, ammine ligands, and water molecules were removed from this structure, and a rigid-body refinement was performed to generate an initial model. The DNA Dictionary for SHELX was used with appropriate restraints for the phosphodiester backbone, sugars, and nucleobases (27Clowney L. Jain S.C. Srinivasan A.R. Westbrook J. Olsen W.K. Berman H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 509-518Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28Gelbin A. Schneider B. Clowney L. Hseih S.-H. Olson W.K. Berman H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 519-529Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Large areas of electron density around G6-G7 (Fig. 2) on a sigma-d ∥Fo - Fc∥ map were identified as the {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+ moiety, starting coordinates for which were obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database (29Allen F.H. Kennard O. Chem. Des. Autom. News. 1993; 8: 31-37Google Scholar). The complex was manually fit into each of the duplexes using XTALVIEW. For subsequent refinement steps, 1,2- and 1,3-distances for the cyclohexylamine ligand were restrained. Forty-eight waters were added at locations having proper distances for hydrogen bonding interactions and electron densities greater than 2.0ς on a sigma-d ∥Fo - Fc∥ map. Refinement statistics are included in Table I. Geometry parameters were calculated by using the programs 3DNA (30Lu X.-J. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1563-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and Curves (31Lavery R. Sklenar H. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1988; 6: 63-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, ID number1LU5. The unit cell is isomorphous with that of the previously reported cisplatin-DNA structure (6Takahara P.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 7Takahara P.M. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12309-12321Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and similarly contains two DNA duplexes in the asymmetric unit. These duplexes are labeled molecule A (Fig.3) and molecule B. Two types of hydrophobic packing interactions occur between duplexes in the crystal lattice, end-to-end and end-to-minor groove. These packing interactions are mediated by hydrogen bonds between individual duplexes. The cisplatin-DNA and oxaliplatin-DNA structures exhibit similar packing interactions. In the hydrophobic end-to-minor groove packing, depicted in Fig.4, the end of one molecule packs against the minor groove opposite the platinum-binding site of another molecule. The C1-G24 base pair of molecule A interacts with the G6-C19 base pair of a molecule B helix. A similar interaction occurs between the C1-G24 base pair of molecule B and the G6-C19 base pair of molecule A. End-to-groove packing of this kind is often observed in A-DNA structures (32Frederick C.A. Quigley G.J. Teng M.-K. Coll M. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Rich A. Wang A.H.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the end-to-end packing arrangement, the 3′-end of one molecule stacks against the 3′-end of another such that a pseudo-continuous helix is formed. This type of packing is characteristic of B-DNA structures (33Wang A.H.-J. Teng M.-K. J. Cryst. Growth. 1988; 90: 295-310Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The crystal structure reveals the asymmetric attachment of thecis-{Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+fragment to the d(GpG) unit in both molecules A and B. Both maintain full Watson-Crick base pairing despite the distortion of the base steps. Their global bend angles and base step parameters differ slightly as a result of minor differences in local base pair and base step parameters (Tables II andIII). Both helices start with A-DNA conformations at the 5′ end of the platinated strand and gradually become more B-DNA-like, as determined by the slide and sugar puckering parameters (Table IV and Fig.5).Table IIBase pair parameters for molecules A and Bκ2-aBase pair parameters are defined as follows: κ, buckle; ς, opening; ω, propeller twist; Sx, shear;Sy, stretch; Sz, stagger.ςωSxSySzABABABABABABC1 - G2416.611.90.01−1.26−6.88−3.580.650.70−0.24−0.18−0.200.02C2 - G234.389.171.034.78−2.90−2.730.570.50−0.12−0.12−0.21−0.25T3 - A223.634.8614.42.89−12.5−7.52−0.04−0.320.06−0.22−0.17−0.20C4 - G21−1.37−3.102.862.58−1.04−5.050.390.070.060.35−0.240.14T5 - A202.834.28−1.50−0.96−5.20−5.20−0.09−0.14−0.29−0.190.260.17G6 - C1919.521.7−0.994.03−15.0−16.4−0.34−0.260.020.120.180.51G7 - C18−6.91−4.493.510.47−13.2−16.8−0.18−0.140.06−0.03−0.030.27T8 - A17−0.66−11.84.44−2.02−21.4−21.8−0.21−0.61−0.31−0.15−0.66−0.25C9 - G16−2.69−10.91.01−1.47−13.4−6.410.25−0.14−0.35−0.310.110.00T10 - A152.77−7.26−5.150.13−8.94−2.73−0.69−0.66−0.28−0.070.130.47C11 - G140.420.36−6.23−4.54−11.4−11.6−0.05−0.03−0.17−0.010.030.27C12 - G13−6.66−10.12.777.51−3.74−8.030.641.08−0.10−0.300.130.34A-DNA0.000.00−0.85−0.8511.411.40.000.00−0.11−0.110.150.15B-DNA0.000.00−0.38−0.38−1.29−1.290.000.000.010.01−0.02−0.022-a Base pair parameters are defined as follows: κ, buckle; ς, opening; ω, propeller twist; Sx, shear;Sy, stretch; Sz, stagger.

The minor groove is widened, and the major groove is narrowed significantly. The platinum-nitrogen distances are 2.0 ± 0.1 Å. The dihedral angle between the G6 and G7 nucleobases is 32oin molecule A and 29o in molecule B. These values are slightly greater than those from the previously reported platinated-DNA structures. In molecule A, the platinum atom is displaced 1.2 Å from the plane of the 5′ guanine and 0.61 Å from the plane of the 3′ guanine. The corresponding displacements in molecule B are 1.1 and 0.93 Å, respectively. The platinum atoms are 0.05 and 0.11 Å from the least-squares plane containing the four coordinated nitrogen atoms in molecules A and B, respectively. The cyclohexylamine ligand is well resolved at the 1ς level in an omit map, shown in Fig. 7, and is directed toward the 3′-end of the platinated strand. It adopts a chair conformation and points away from the major groove. The amino group of the NH2Cy ligand forms a hydrogen bond with the O6 atom on G6. The N···O distances is 2.6 Å for molecule A and 2.9 Å for molecule B. The ammine ligand forms a weak hydrogen bonding interaction with the O2P atom on G7, at a distance of 3.1 Å for molecule A and 3.4 Å for molecule B. The ammine ligand is about 4.7 Å from the O-6 atom of G7 in both duplexes, too far to form a hydrogen bond. The five platinated duplexes contained in the three platinum-DNA structures determined in our laboratory possess considerable homology. The root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) between comparable atoms in the various duplexes and platinum binding sites are listed in TableV.

Open table in a new tab The crystal packing in the platinum-DNA duplex structures has an effect on the observed symmetry as originally indicated by the homology between the cisplatin and oxaliplatin structures (7Takahara P.M. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12309-12321Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 18Spingler B. Whittington D.A. Lippard S.J. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 40: 5596-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The present results support this idea. The common end-to-minor groove packing significantly affects the geometry at the platination site. The solution structures of cisplatin-DNA and related adducts, solved by NMR spectroscopy, display higher global bend angles than any of the crystal structures (8Gelasco A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9230-9239Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This difference suggests that the solution form of platinated-DNA differs from that in the crystal lattice. The present structure supports our previous assignment of the major product of DNA platination by {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+ as the isomer with the cyclohexylamine oriented toward the 3′-end of the platinated strand (15Hartwig J.F. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 5646-5654Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonds observed between the platinum ligands and the DNA strand may contribute to this preference. One hydrogen bond is formed between the NH3 and the 5′ O2P atom, and another occurs between the NH2 group of the cyclohexylamine ligand and O6 of the 3′ guanine base. In the cisplatin-DNA structure, the distance between the 3′-directed ammine ligand and O6 of the 3′ guanine is 3.5 Å. This distance is too long for significant hydrogen bonding, suggesting that such a bond may not form in the minor orientational isomer of the {Pt(NH3)-(NH2Cy)d(GpG)}2+cross-link. Moreover, it is unlikely that the cyclohexylamine amino group would form a hydrogen bond with the 5′ guanine O6 atom in the minor isomer, since the NH3···O6 distance in the major isomer is 4.7 Å. Recent work by the Marzilli group (34Sullivan S.T. Ciccarese A. Fanizzi F.P. Marzilli L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9345-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Carlone M. Fanizzil F.P. Intini F.P. Margiotta N. Marzilli L.G. Natile G. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 39: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggested that hydrogen bonding between platinated guanine bases and their associated phosphate groups with the ammine or amine ligands in a {PtL2}2+ complex (L2 is two amines or a diamine) is extremely weak. In the present 3′ orientational isomer, the hydrogen bond with O-6 of the 3′ guanine is quite substantial and, in our previous {Pt(dach)}2+ complex, there was a similarly strong hydrogen bond on the 3′-end involving the amino group of dach and the 3′-phosphate. Crystal packing (see above) may contribute to these effects, or perhaps the conclusion about weak hydrogen bonds in these platinated duplexes is premature. The very small differences observed in the G6-G7 base pair step geometry for the cisplatin-, oxaliplatin-, and {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+-DNA structures may signal a common geometric feature that modulates their recognition by minor groove binding proteins. These results also support the hypothesis that the flanking sequence dependence of proteins binding to platinum-DNA adducts is most likely an inherent property of sequence-dependent protein-DNA contacts, not differential distortion around the platination site (16Wei M. Cohen S.M. Silverman A.P. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38774-38780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Sullivan S.T. Saad J.S. Fanizzi F.P. Marzilli L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1558-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Most proteins that bind platinum-DNA adducts, such as HMGB1 and TBP, interact with the minor groove. The crystallographic studies from our laboratory and computational studies by Marzilli and co-workers (34Sullivan S.T. Ciccarese A. Fanizzi F.P. Marzilli L.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9345-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,35Carlone M. Fanizzil F.P. Intini F.P. Margiotta N. Marzilli L.G. Natile G. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 39: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that platinum-DNA adducts are nearly structurally homologous, even in the minor groove where most protein-DNA interactions occur. Yet these proteins are able to recognize differentially adducts that contain differing amine ligands (16Wei M. Cohen S.M. Silverman A.P. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38774-38780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and platinum complexes with different spectator ligands inhibit transcription to varying degrees (37Sandman K.E. Marla S.S. Zlokarnik G. Lippard S.J. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This result suggests that hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and other major groove interactions between protein, DNA, and the ligands on the platinum may affect drug activity. The bulky dach ligand in oxaliplatin and the cyclohexylamine ligand in {Pt(NH3)(NH2Cy)}2+ adducts fill and increase the hydrophobicity of the major groove in the vicinity of the adduct. These major groove effects may fine tune platinum drug activity by interfering with transcription.

Recently, the Rev-erbα gene promoter has been characterized and shown to harbor a functional Rev-erbα-binding site known as Rev-DR2, responsible for negative feedback down-regulation of promoter activity by Rev-erbα itself. The present study aimed to investigate whether Rev-erbα gene expression is regulated by RORα. Gel shift analysis demonstrated thatin vitro translated hRORα1 protein binds to the Rev-DR2 site, both as monomer and dimer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that binding of RORα to this site also occurred in vivo in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The Rev-DR2 site was further shown to be functional as it conferred hRORα1 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter and to the natural human Rev-erbαgene promoter in these cells. Mutation of this site in the context of the natural Rev-erbα gene promoter abolished its activation by RORα, indicating that this site plays a key role in hRORα1 action. Finally, adenoviral overexpression of hRORα1 in HepG2 cells led to enhanced hRev-erbα mRNA accumulation, further confirming the physiological importance of RORα1 in the regulation of Rev-erbα expression.

The Rev-erb receptors form a subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors, consisting of two different genes, Rev-erbα(also termed ear1 or NR1D1) andRev-erbβ (also termed RVR, ear1β,BD73, HZF-2, or NR1D2) (1Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). TheRev-erbα gene is located on human chromosome 17q21 and is encoded on the opposite strand of the thyroid hormone α2 receptor (2Miyajima N. Horiuchi R. Shibuya Y. Fukushige S. Matsubara K.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Later, it was furthermore shown to bind also as a homodimer on response elements consisting of a tandem repeat of two RGGTCA motifs spaced by two nucleotides preceded by a 6-bp A/T-rich sequence (7Harding H.P.

The crystal structure of the Rev-erbα DNA-binding domain bound to its response element has been elucidated and revealed two major protein-DNA interfaces (9Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S. Miyoshi Y. Lazar M.A. Rastinejad F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although the Rev-erbα receptor was initially reported to activate transcription (5Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Transcriptional silencing by Rev-erbα requires the interaction with the corepressors N-CoR (or its variant RIP13a and RIP13Δ1) (10Renaud J.P. Harris J.M. Downes M. Burke L.J. Muscat G.E. Mol.

This interaction was shown to rely on two conserved interaction domains (ID-I and ID-II) of N-CoR (13Downes M. Burke L.J. Bailey P.J. Muscat G.E.

Because Rev-erbα and RORα display similar expression patterns and regulate shared target genes in an opposite manner, the present study aimed to investigate whether Rev-erbα gene expression is under the control of the orphan nuclear receptor RORα in HepG2 hepatoma cells. Our results show that RORα binds in vitroand in vivo to the Rev-DR2 site in the Rev-erbαgene promoter. The Rev-DR2 site conferred specific hRORα responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. A striking elevation ofRev-erbα promoter activity was observed in HepG2 cells upon hRORα1 expression vector co-transfection. Rev-erbαgene expression was increased when HepG2 cells were infected with an adenoviral construct allowing hRORα1 overexpression. Taken together, our results identify RORα as a positive regulator ofRev-erbα gene transcription and further delineate the complex cross-talks between the two receptors. RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as indicated by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was performed with MMLV-reverse transcriptase starting with 1 μg of total RNA following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 2.5 μl of cDNA were used for semiquantitative PCR (annealing temperature: 55 °C, 30 cycles) with the primers listed in TableI. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed (annealing temperature: 55 °C, 40 cycles) on a Light Cycler apparatus (Hoffmann-La Roche) with the Faststart DNA SYBRGreen Master Mix I (Hoffmann-La Roche) quantification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, using a 10-fold dilution of reverse transcription products, the specific primers indicated in Table I (200 nm), and 3 mm MgCl2 for hRev-erbα or 4 mm MgCl2 for β-actin. ConsideringC t as the cycle number in which the SYBRGreen fluorescence exceeds a constant threshold value and ΔC t as the value corresponding to the differenceC t (hRev-erbα) − C t(reference), where the β-actin mRNA is used as reference, the relative hRev-erbα/β-actin relative level L is determined by L = 2−ΔCt.

Medium was changed every 2 days. For infection experiments, HepG2 cells were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes at a density of 107 cells/dish and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h prior to viral infection. After seeding, viral particles were added at a multiplicity of infection of 100 and incubated for 3 h. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with PBS (0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and incubated in culture medium for the indicated times. At the end of the experiment, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, lysed, and scraped in 2 ml of ice-cold Trizol reagent.

At the end of the experiment, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and the luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-LuciferaseTM Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All transfection experiments were performed at least 3 times. Protein content of the extract was evaluated by the Bradford assay using the kit from Bio-Rad. hRORα1 and hRev-erbα were transcribed in vitro from the pCDNA3-hRORα1 and pSG5-hRev-erbα plasmids, respectively, using T7 polymerase and subsequently translated using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA-protein binding assays were conducted as described (60Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Laine B. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. Staels B. J. Biol.

We have used deletion mutagenesis of both the N and C termini to investigate the functional organization of the catalytic and regulatory regions of this enzyme. Western blot analysis of these mutants expressed in Escherichia coliindicated that residues 497–543 are involved in tetramer formation. Deletion of the 70 N-terminal residues resulted in a heme-free protein retaining 20% of wild type activity. Additional deletion of 151 C-terminal residues from this mutant resulted in an inactive enzyme. Expression of this double-deletion mutant as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein generated catalytically active protein (15% of wild type activity) that was unaffected by subsequent removal of the fusion partner. The function of the N-terminal region appears to be primarily steric in nature and involved in the correct folding of the enzyme. The C-terminal region of human cystathionine β-synthase contains two hydrophobic motifs designated “CBS domains.” Partial deletion of the most C-terminal of these domains decreased activity and caused enzyme aggregation and instability. Removal of both of these domains resulted in stable constitutively activated enzyme. Deletion of as few as 8 C-terminal residues increased enzyme activity and abolished any further activation byS-adenosylmethionine indicating that the autoinhibitory role of the C-terminal region is not exclusively a function of the CBS domains.

Levy H.L. Kraus J.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2007-2056Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of serine and Hcy to form cystathionine, which is then converted to cysteine by another PLP-dependent enzyme, cystathionine γ-lyase. CBS can also form cysteine directly from serine and hydrogen sulfide via the serine sulfhydrase reaction (2Braunstein A.E. Goryachenkova E.V. Tolosa E.A. Willhardt I.H. Yefremova L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 242: 247-260Google Scholar). In mammalian cells that possess the transsulfuration pathway, CBS occupies a key regulatory position between the remethylation of Hcy to methionine or its alternative use in the biosynthesis of cysteine. The relative flux between these two competing pathways is roughly equal and is controlled by intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) concentrations (3Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Google Scholar). AdoMet activates the mammalian CBS enzyme by as much as 5-fold with an apparent dissociation constant of 15 μm (4Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Martin J.J. Pick A.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 81-87Google Scholar, 5Roper M.D. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 514-521Google Scholar). Conversely, the same compound acts as an allosteric inhibitor of Hcy remethylation by inhibiting 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (6Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 139: 217-220Google Scholar, 7Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Google Scholar) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (8Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 14-19Google Scholar). Deficiency of CBS is the most common cause of inherited homocystinuria, a serious life-threatening disease that results in severely elevated Hcy levels in plasma, tissues, and urine. Symptoms include dislocated optic lenses, skeletal disorders, mental retardation, and premature arteriosclerosis and thrombosis (1Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Kraus J.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2007-2056Google Scholar). Human CBS is a member of a large family of PLP-dependent enzymes that operate almost exclusively in the metabolism of amino acids. Members of this family are of multiple evolutionary origins (9Salzmann D. Christen P. Mehta P.K. Sandmeier E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 576-580Google Scholar) but can be classified into four distinct families depending on their folds: the large α family, the β family, the d-alanine aminotransferase family, and the alanine racemase family (10Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Google Scholar). CBS belongs to the β family of PLP-dependent enzymes, members of which catalyze replacement and elimination reactions at Cβ. Human CBS displays significant levels of sequence and structural similarity with several other members of this family such as cysteine synthases, serine/threonine deaminases, and the β subunit of tryptophan synthase (11Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Google Scholar). The sequence and structural conservation between these enzymes is primarily confined to a region encompassed by residues 84–382 in human CBS (available at www.uchsc.edu/sm/cbs/cbsdata/cbsprotein.htm). This region includes the PLP binding domain and is similar to the previously described, catalytically activated, protease-resistant core of the enzyme spanning residues 40–413 (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar). Although the catalytic cores of cysteine synthases (CS) and CBS enzymes exhibit high levels of homology, the N- and the C-terminal non-catalytic regions of these proteins show virtually no similarity. Human CBS contains an N-terminal region of ∼70 amino acids (Fig. 1), which accommodates the heme prosthetic group (11Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Google Scholar). The function of this ligand is unknown, but a number of studies indicate it may play either a regulatory or structural role (13Taoka S. Ojha S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Google Scholar, 14Taoka S. Banerjee R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 87: 245-251Google Scholar, 15Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6516-6523Google Scholar) CBS lack heme indicates that it is not directly involved in catalysis (18Maclean K.N. Janosik M. Oliveriusova J. Kery V. Kraus J.P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 161-171Google Scholar, 19Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Google Scholar). The C-terminal regulatory domain of human CBS consists of ∼140 amino acid residues (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar). This region is required for tetramerization of the human enzyme and AdoMet activation (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar). The C-terminal regulatory region also encompasses the previously defined “CBS domain” (21Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Google Scholar). This hydrophobic sequence (CBS1), spanning amino acid residues 415–468, is conserved in a wide range of otherwise unrelated proteins. Its function remains unknown, although the sharp transition of thermally induced CBS activation and the observation that mutations in this domain can constitutively activate the enzyme indicate that it plays a role in the autoinhibitory function of the C-terminal region (22Janosik M. Kery V. Gaustadnes M. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10625-10633Google Scholar, 23Shan X. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Christopher S.A. Kruger W.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 635-643Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity with another CBS domain-containing protein, inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) from Streptomyces pyogenes (23Shan X. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Christopher S.A. Kruger W.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 635-643Google Scholar), a second, less conserved CBS domain (CBS2) has recently been identified between amino acid residues 486 and 543 in the C-terminal regulatory region of human CBS (see Fig. 1). Two well conserved CBS domains are also present in the C-terminal region of the yeast CBS, which is of approximately the same length as the human enzyme (see Fig. 1). The yeast enzyme functions as a tetramer but is not activated by AdoMet (17Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11541-11544Google Scholar). CBS from T. cruzi, which is also unresponsive to AdoMet, lacks the typical CBS C-terminal region and exists predominantly as a tetramer. This observation has lead to speculation that CBS tetramerization is not exclusively a function of the C-terminal region (20Nozaki T. Shigeta Y. Saito-Nakano Y. Imada M. Kruger W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6516-6523Google Scholar). All of the CS enzymes lack both the N-terminal heme binding domain and the C-terminal regulatory region (Fig. 1). These enzymes function as dimers, do not bind heme, and are not activated by AdoMet (24Byrne C.R. Monroe R.S. Ward K.A. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3150-3157Google Scholar, 25Rolland N. Droux M. Lebrun M. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 213-222Google Scholar). Structure/function analyses of products derived from limited trypsinolysis of human CBS provided some initial insight into the domain architecture of this protein (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar). It was determined that the N-terminal 39-amino acid region does not play a significant role in the native structure of fully-folded CBS, because removal of this region by partial tryptic cleavage does not affect binding of AdoMet, PLP or heme, or tetramer formation (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar). Further proteolysis leads to the removal of the entire C-terminal regulatory region, yielding a proteolytically resistant core, consisting of amino acid residues 40–413. The removal of the C-terminal domain causes the enzyme to dissociate from tetramers to dimers. This change in oligomeric status of the enzyme is accompanied by an increase in tryptophan fluorescence, possibly caused by exposing a tryptophan cluster at positions 408–410. The truncated protein showed no change in both its UV and visible absorption spectra indicating that it maintains the structural features of full-length CBS and is unaffected in its ability to bind both PLP and heme (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar). The active core is about 2- to 3-fold more active than the full-length tetramer but cannot be further activated by AdoMet (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar). Apart from AdoMet, several other modes of CBS activation have been reported. These include partial thermal denaturation (22Janosik M. Kery V. Gaustadnes M. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10625-10633Google Scholar), limited proteolysis (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar), and the presence of certain C-terminal mutations (22Janosik M. Kery V. Gaustadnes M. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10625-10633Google Scholar,23Shan X. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Christopher S.A. Kruger W.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 635-643Google Scholar). A possible common CBS activation mechanism has been proposed whereby the C-terminal region of CBS acts an autoinhibitory domain and that certain mutations, binding of AdoMet, limited trypsinolysis, or partial thermal denaturation all serve to displace this domain from its zone of inhibition (22Janosik M. Kery V. Gaustadnes M. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10625-10633Google Scholar, 23Shan X. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Christopher S.A. Kruger W.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 635-643Google Scholar). A recombinant human CBS enzyme similar to the above described “proteolytically resistant core” has recently been expressed inEscherichia coli and purified to homogeneity (26Janosik M. Meier M. Kery V. Oliveriusova J. Burkhard P. Kraus J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 289-291Google Scholar). This truncated enzyme, comprising amino acid residues 1–413, has been crystallized, and its x-ray structure has been determined (11Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Google Scholar). The crystals contained three dimers per asymmetric unit, and each dimer contained one heme and one PLP per subunit. It was observed that the heme binding region of the enzyme is almost completely disordered; the only exception is a short 310 helix formed by amino acid residues 60–62. Two N-terminal residues, Cys-52 and His-65 were identified as thiolate and histidine ligands to the heme. The heme resides in a small hydrophobic pocket at the outer end of each dimer, distant from the PLP cofactor, which is deeply buried in the active site and accessible only via a narrow channel (11Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Google Scholar). The finding that the heme is relatively distant from the PLP and the fact that the heme iron is ligated from both sides by the amino acid residues provide further evidence against its direct catalytic involvement (11Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Google Scholar). In this work, we have studied the role of both the N- and C-terminal regions of human CBS by generating 11 sequential truncation mutants spanning residues 1–70 and 401–551 (Fig. 2). We expressed all of these truncation mutants in E. coli and determined the effect of each deletion on activity, response to AdoMet, heme binding, oligomeric status, and stability. Characterization of these deletion mutants sheds new light upon the function and organization of the catalytic and regulatory regions of CBS. Unless otherwise stated, all materials were obtained from Sigma. l-[U-14C]Serine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for Western blotting were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. An Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was purchased from Millipore. With the exception of pKK Δ1–70 Δ401–551 and pGEX-6P-1 Δ1–70 Δ401–551, all of the C- and N- terminal deletion constructs used in this study were generated by a modification of the previously described pHCS3 CBS expression construct (27Kozich V. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 113-123Google Scholar), which contains the CBS full-length coding sequence cloned into pKK388.1. In this construct, CBS expression is governed by the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducibletac promoter. To generate all C-terminal deletion constructs, CBS cDNA fragments spanning the desired nucleotide residues (Table I) were amplified using primers incorporating SphI and KpnI sites to the 5′ and 3′ respective ends of the PCR product. All PCR products were then cut with SphI and KpnI and cloned by ligation into the pHCS3 vector digested with SphI andKpnI. Expression constructs pKK Δ1–39 and pKK Δ1–70 were generated by PCR amplification of the CBS cDNA regions encoding amino acids 40–336 and 71–336, respectively. For both of these N-terminal deletion mutants, the sense primer was used to introduce an NcoI site to the 5′ end of the amplified product (Table I). An SphI site naturally occurs in the CBS cDNA, just upstream of the antisense primer hybridization site (base pair position 1012, according to the CBS cDNA numbering (25Rolland N. Droux M. Lebrun M. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 213-222Google Scholar)). PCR products thus generated were then digested withNcoI and SphI and ligated into the pHCS3 plasmid cut with the same enzymes.Table IPCR primers used in the generation of N- and C-terminal truncated mutant expression constructsConstructPCR primers used for insert amplificationAmplified CBS cDNA regionSenseRestriction siteAntisenseRestriction sitebppKK CBS Δ551apHCS3.126SphI285KpnI1010–1650pKK CBS Δ544–551apHCS3.126SphI355KpnI1010–1029pKK CBS Δ534–551apHCS3.126SphI284KpnI1010–1599pKK CBS Δ524–551apHCS3.126SphI257KpnI1010–1569pKK CBS Δ497–551apHCS3.126SphI256KpnI1010–1488pKK CBS Δ488–551apHCS3.126SphI210KpnI1010–1464pKK CBS Δ442–551apHCS3.126SphI216KpnI1010–1323pKK CBS Δ414–551apHCS3.126SphI283KpnI1010–1239pKK CBS Δ1–39apHCS3.389NcoI127None120–1010pKK CBS Δ1–70apHCS3.384NcoI127None213–1010pKK CBS Δ1–70 Δ401–551bpKK 388.1.384NcoI378XhoI213–1200pGEX-6P-1 CBS Δ1–70 Δ401–551cpGEX-6P-1.377ApaI378XhoI213–1200PrimerPrimer sequencedPrimers are written from 5′ to 3′.Underlined bases indicate where the restriction site was introduced.126CGTAGAATTCACCTTTGCCCGCATGCTGAT127TACGATCGATGGCCCTCCTGCAGCTCCTGCGC210TACGGGTACCTCATTTGAACTGCTTGTAGATGAC216TACGGGTACCTCACTTCTCCCGGAGGAGCGCGAT256TACGGGTACCTCACAGCGTGTCCGTGAGGCGGATC257TACGGGTACCTCACTTCCCGGTGCTGTGGTACTGG283TACGGGTACCTCAACGGAGGTGCCACCACCAGGGC284TACGGGTACCTCACACCCCGAACACCATCTGCCGC285TACGGGTACCTCACTGGTCCCGCTCCTGGGCGGCC355TACGGGTACCTCACACGAAGTTCAGCAAGT377TCAGCTAGGGCCCGCAAAATCTCCAAAAATCTTGCCAGAT378ACCGCTCGAGTCACTCCTCCTTCAGAAAGCC384TACGCCATGGGGCCCGCAAAATCTCCAAAAATC389TACGCCATGGAGCCCCTGTGGATCCGGCCCa pHCS3.b pKK 388.1.c pGEX-6P-1.d Primers are written from 5′ to 3′.Underlined bases indicate where the restriction site was introduced. Open table in a new tab To make the pKK Δ1–70 Δ401–551 construct, the relevant portion of the CBS coding sequence was amplified by PCR using a sense primer carrying an NcoI site at the 5′ end of the primer and an appropriately designed antisense primer without any additional restriction sites. The PCR product encompassing the relevant nucleotides (Table I) was then cut with NcoI; the 3′ end of the PCR product remained blunt. This PCR fragment was then ligated into pKK388.1 digested with NcoI and SmaI. To generate the pGEX-6P-1 Δ1–70 Δ401–551 glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion expression construct, the pGEX-6P-1 vector internal ApaI site was abolished by site-directed mutagenesis of nucleotide 3893 from a C to a T. Subsequently, the CBS cDNA region encoding amino acid residues 71–400 was amplified using primers incorporating ApaI andXhoI sites to the 5′ and 3′ respective ends of the PCR product. Both the PCR product and the modified pGEX-6P-1 vector were cut with ApaI and XhoI and ligated together. All constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (Stratagene). The authenticity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing using a Thermo Sequenase Cy5.5 sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the Visible Genetics Long-Read Tower System-V3.1 DNA sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Growth of E. coli BL21 cells bearing the CBS mutant constructs, induction of expression, and the generation of crude cell lysates were performed as described previously (28Maclean K.N. Gaustadnes M. Oliveriusova J. Janosik M. Kraus E. Kozich V. Kery V. Skovby F. Rudiger N. Ingerslev J. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 641-655Google Scholar). The insoluble fraction was prepared as follows: after the centrifugation of the sonicated homogenate, pelleted cell debris was thoroughly washed with chilled 1× Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0. The pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (28Maclean K.N. Gaustadnes M. Oliveriusova J. Janosik M. Kraus E. Kozich V. Kery V. Skovby F. Rudiger N. Ingerslev J. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 641-655Google Scholar) followed by a brief sonication to homogenize the insoluble fraction. CBS activity was determined by a previously described radioisotope assay using [14C]serine as the labeled substrate (29Kraus J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 388-394Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry procedure (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of CBS that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of cystathionine in 1 h at 37 °C. Western blot analysis of crude cell lysates under both denaturing and native conditions was performed as described previously (22Janosik M. Kery V. Gaustadnes M. Maclean K.N. Kraus J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10625-10633Google Scholar) with some modifications. Soluble fractions of E. coli lysates containing the expressed mutant proteins were mixed with sample buffer and run on a 6% native PAGE without a stacking gel. The final composition of the sample buffer was: 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.9, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue. Detection of heme was performed using a previously described method that relies on heme peroxidase activity (31Vargas C. McEwan A.G. Downie J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Google Scholar). Quantitative densitometry analysis was performed using the Imagemaster 1D (version 2.0) software (Amersham Biosciences). To construct a calibration curve, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ng of purified wild type CBS protein were run on an SDS-PAGE together with crude cell lysates of the individual mutants. Following electrophoresis, Western blot immunoanalysis was conducted using rabbit anti-CBS serum. The signals corresponding to the experimentally observed CBS mutant subunits were all within the linear range of the calibration curve constructed with purified human CBS. The CBS deletion mutants were overexpressed using our previously described E. coli-based expression system (27Kozich V. Kraus J.P. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 113-123Google Scholar). In this system, CBS is expressed without any fusion partner under the control of the tac promoter. Both soluble and insoluble fractions of the bacterial lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using a CBS-specific antisera. Analysis of the soluble fractions revealed significant differences in the observed levels of the individual CBS mutant subunits in E. coli lysates (Fig. 3, top). The relative amounts of both N-terminal deletion mutants (Δ1–39 and Δ1–70) were decreased severalfold compared with that of the wild type control indicating that deletion of these regions has a negative impact upon the level of the resultant CBS present in the soluble fraction. The observed protein levels of the deletion mutants lacking either one or eight C-terminal amino acid residues were comparable to that of the wild type control, but only traces of the Δ534–551 mutant subunits were detected in the soluble fraction. More extensive deletions from the C terminus (mutants Δ524–551, Δ497–551, Δ489–551, Δ442–551, and Δ414–551) lead to a pronounced decrease in the amount of detectable CBS mutant subunits compared with the wild type control. Although diminished relative to the wild type control, it can be seen that the Δ414–551 construct, which lacks the entire C-terminal regulatory region, is present in a significantly higher concentration than the preceding deletion clones that lack between 18 and 109 C-terminal residues. Taken together, these findings indicate that partial deletions of the CBS C-terminal regulatory region that extend into and past the CBS2 domain are considerably more deleterious than removal of this entire region. The relative amount of the double-deletion mutant (Δ1–70 Δ401–551) was also severely diminished, indicating that removal of these relatively large areas of the CBS protein compromises the ability of the protein to assemble correctly. The reduced levels of some of the deletion mutant forms of CBS in theE. coli-soluble fractions poses a question regarding the possible influence of these truncations upon the solubility of the resultant mutant forms of CBS. In the past, we have repeatedly observed that, during the expression of wild type CBS in E. coli, a significant portion of the protein is produced as insoluble aggregates. 2J. Oliveriusová, V. Kery, K. N. Maclean, and J. P. Kraus, unpublished results. Full-length wild type CBS also exhibits a strong tendency toward aggregation during the course of purification as well as in the purified state, although this tendency is somewhat ameliorated by removal of the C-terminal regulatory region (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar, 26Janosik M. Meier M. Kery V. Oliveriusova J. Burkhard P. Kraus J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 289-291Google Scholar). To examine the possible effects of the various deletions upon CBS solubility, aliquots of the insoluble cell fractions obtained from the E. coli expression analysis described above were examined by Western blotting (Fig. 3,bottom). With two exceptions, the insoluble fractions were found to contain roughly the same amounts of the various CBS mutant proteins as the soluble fractions. Notably, both of the deletion mutants that lack the heme cofactor due to the absence of the Cys-52 and His-65 residues (Δ1–70 and Δ1–70 Δ401–551) and whose amounts were severely diminished in the soluble fraction were ∼5-fold more abundant in the insoluble fractions. It appears that the removal of the N-terminal region acts to decrease the solubility of these mutant forms of CBS and that this is responsible for the diminished amounts of these proteins in the soluble fractions. The Δ534–551-truncated protein was absent in both soluble and insoluble fractions, indicating that this deletion exerts a completely destructive effect upon CBS. Relative enzyme activities were determined for all of the various deletion mutants by assaying crude cell lysate-soluble fractions for CBS activity in the presence and absence of 1 mm AdoMet. The activities were normalized to the amounts of expressed CBS protein as determined by the densitometric scanning analysis of a Western blot of the cell lysate-soluble fractions. Specific activities of all deletion mutants were expressed as a percentage of the wild type activity determined in the absence of AdoMet, which was considered to be 100% (TableII). The calculated specific activity for the wild type enzyme derived from this analysis was 213 ± 19 units/mg, which is strikingly consistent with the value of 220 units/mg that we determined previously for the purified recombinant wild type enzyme (12Kery V. Poneleit L. Kraus J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 222-232Google Scholar).Table IIThe effect of N- and C-terminal deletions on CBS activity, response to AdoMet, oligomeric status, and heme bindingCBS mutantRelative activityAdoMet activationOligomeric statusHeme binding%x-foldWT, 1–551100 ± 04.42 ± 0.104-merYesΔ55199 ± 33.44 ± 0.124-merYesΔ544–551136 ± 13NAaNA, not activated.4-merYesΔ534–5510 ± 0NANDbND, not detected due to degradation or aggregation.NDΔ524–55130 ± 4NANDNDΔ497–551292 ± 45NA2-merYesΔ489–551334 ± 61NA2-merYesΔ442–551264 ± 48NA2-merYesΔ414–551505 ± 62NA2-merYesΔ1–3952 ± 23.99 ± 0.124-merYesΔ1–7019 ± 2NA4-merNoΔ1–70 Δ401–5512 ± 3NA2-merNoa NA, not activated.b ND, not detected due to degradation or aggregation.

The mechanism by which presenilin proteins regulate apoptotic cell death is not well understood. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we previously isolated a novel protein, presenilin-associated protein (PSAP) that specifically interacts with the C terminus of presenilin 1 (PS1), but not presenilin 2 (PS2). Here we report that PSAP is a mitochondrial resident protein sharing homology with mitochondrial carrier protein. PSAP was detected in a mitochondria-enriched fraction, and PSAP immunofluorescence was present in a punctate pattern that colocalized with a mitochondrial marker. More interestingly, overexpression of PSAP caused apoptotic death. PSAP-induced apoptosis was documented using multiple independent approaches, including membrane blebbing, chromosome condensation and fragmentation, DNA laddering, cleavage of the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and flow cytometry. PSAP-induced cell death was accompanied by cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase-3 activation. Moreover, the general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, which blocked cell death, did not block the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria caused by overexpression of PSAP, indicating that PSAP-induced cytochrome c release was independent of caspase activity. The mitochondrial localization and proapoptotic activity of PSAP suggest that it is an important regulator of apoptosis.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Google Scholar). A subset of AD cases is familial AD (FAD), which occurs as an inherited autosomal dominant disease caused by defects in any of three genes: presenilin 1 (PS1) on chromosome 14, presenilin 2 (PS2) on chromosome 1, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21 (for review, see Ref. 2Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Kim T.W. Moir R.D. Guenette S.Y. Wasco W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1996; 3: 159-168Google Scholar). The majority of FAD cases have been associated with mutations in PS1 and PS2 (2Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Kim T.W. Moir R.D. Guenette S.Y. Wasco W. Neurobiol. Dis. 1996; 3: 159-168Google Scholar). It has been shown that FAD-associated mutations in PS1 and PS2 affect the processing of APP, leading to an increased production of the more amyloidogenic Aβ peptide, both in vivo and in vitro (3Borchelt D.R.

In addition to their roles in APP processing, roles for PS1 and PS2 in programmed cell death or apoptosis have also been reported in several studies. It has been shown that overexpression of a C-terminal fragment of PS2 protects neural cells against apoptosis (7Vito P. Ghayur T. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28315-28320Google Scholar). It was also reported that overexpression of a C-terminal fragment of PS1 delays anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (8Vezina J. Tschopp C. Andersen E. Muller K. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 263: 65-68Google Scholar). A role for PS1 and PS2 in apoptosis is also supported by studies demonstrating that overexpression of PS1 or PS2 bearing FAD mutations results in increased sensitivity to apoptotic insults (9Keller J.N.

Science. 1996; 274: 1710-1713Google Scholar). These studies suggest that mutant PS1 and PS2 may be directly involved in neuronal cell death found in the AD brain by regulating the apoptotic cascades. Apoptosis has been implicated as a mechanism of cell death in AD, and the involvement in apoptotic cell death has been reported for all of the three known Alzheimer genes, PS1, PS2, and APP (for review, see Ref.14Czech C. Tremp G. Pradier L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 363-384Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms by which these molecules are involved in apoptosis are not well understood. Very recently, by using a yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a novel protein, designated presenilin-associated protein (PSAP), which interacts with the C terminus of PS1 (15Xu X. Shi Y. Wu X. Gambetti P. Sui D. Cui M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32543-32546Google Scholar). We now report that PSAP is a proapoptotic molecule that causes apoptotic cell death when it is overexpressed. Our results also indicate that PSAP-induced apoptosis involves caspase activation. Inhibition of caspase activity blocked apoptosis but had no effect on PSAP-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria, indicating that cytochrome c release is an earlier event in PSAP-induced apoptosis. To explore the biological function of this newly identified molecule, its subcellular localization was also investigated. Our results demonstrate that PSAP is localized in mitochondria. These results indicate that PSAP is a novel mitochondrial protein that may be an important mediator of PS1-regulated apoptotic cell death cascades. Growth medium, fetal bovine serum, and other supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. The general caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), was purchased from R&D Systems. Unless stated otherwise, the routine chemicals, proteinase inhibitors, propidium iodide, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. For wild type PSAP, PSAP cDNA was amplified with primer pair BHK-PSAP+ (5′-GGATCCAAGCTTGCCACCATGGCGGG AGCCGGAGCTGGAGCCGG-3′) andXbaI-PSAP− (5′-TCTAGACTCCAGGGCAAA GCATGATCCTG-3′). DNA fragments generated by using these primer pairs contained a Kozak sequence, GCCACC (16Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar), followed by an ATG codon and aXbaI site at the 3′ end, which allowed insertion of the DNA fragments into the pcDNA3.1/myc-His expression vector (Invitrogen) in frame. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was first cloned into TOPOTM TA cloning vector, pCR®2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and the fidelity of the DNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The inserted DNA was then digested withHindIII/XbaI restriction enzymes and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His expression vector in frame. Thus, the PSAP was expressed as a myc-tagged polypeptide with the myc-His tag at the C terminus. The plasmid pcDNA3.1/LacZ-myc-His, which expresses LacZ protein with a myc tag, was provided in the pcDNA3.1/myc-His vector package by the vendor (Invitrogen). To generate the construct expressing PSAP-green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion protein, PSAP cDNA was amplified with primer pair BHK-PSAP+ (5′-GGATCCAAGCTTGCCACCATGGCGGGAGCCGGAGCTGGAGCCGG-3′)/BamHI-PSAP− (5′-GGATCCCCTCCAGGGCAAAGCATGAT-3′). The resulting DNA fragment encodes the full-length PSAP in which the stop codon TAA was destroyed and replaced with a BamHI restriction site. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector, and the fidelity of the DNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The inserted DNA was then digested with HindIII/BamHI restriction enzymes and subcloned into HindIII/BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech) in frame with the GFP coding sequence. Thus, PSAP was expressed as a fusion protein fused to the N terminus of GFP. For construction of the plasmid expressing wild type PS1 (PS1wt), PS1 cDNA was amplified by a pair of primers, BHKFPS1+, which encoded the Flag epitope and the N-terminal eight amino acids of PS1 preceded by a HindIII site (GGATCCAAGCTTGCCACCATGGACTATAAGGACGACGACGACAAGACAGAGTTACCTGCACCGTTGTC) and BEPS1−, which is complementary to 3′-end of PS1 cDNA and contains a BamHI site (GGATCCGAATTCCTAGATATAAAATTGATGG). The PCR product was first cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector, confirmed for its fidelity by sequencing, and subcloned intoHindIII/BamHI sites of the pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Thus, PS1 will be expressed with an N-terminal FLAG tag. To generate the D385A mutant PS1(D385A), the flag-tagged PS1wt cDNA in pCR2.1-TOPO vector was amplified with complementary oligonucleotide primers D385A-S (5′-AACTTGGATTGGGAGCTTTCATTTTCTACAGTGT-3′) and D385A-AS (5′-ACACTGTAGAAAATGAAAGCTCCCAATCCAAGTT-3′), which contain the substitution of a single nucleotide indicated by a bold letter, using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For mutant PS1(D257A), the flag-tagged PS1wt cDNA in pCR2.1-TOPO vector was amplified with oligonucleotide pairs D257A-S (5′-GTGATTTCAGTATATGCTTTAGTGGCTGTTTTGT-3′) and D257A-AS (5′-ACAAAACAGCCACTAAAGCATATACTGAAATCAC-3′) using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. The fidelity of the sequence has been confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant PS1(D385A) and PS1(D257A) cDNAs, in which an aspartate residue was replaced by alanine at position 385 and 257, respectively, were then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector as described above. The double mutant, PS1(D257A/D385A), was constructed by taking advantage of the unique restriction site DraII between codon 257 and codon 385 of the PS1 gene. Both PS1(D257A) and PS1(D385A) in the pcDNA3.1 vector were digested with DraII. The 3′ endDraII fragment, which contained the D385A mutation from PS1(D385A), was used to replace the 3′ end DraII fragment of PS1(D257A). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected with the PSAP expression vector. Twenty-four h after transfection, both floating cells and adherent cells, which were detached by trypsinization, were collected, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 90% methanol on ice for 15 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 2 min, washed twice with cold PBS, suspended in 200 μl of PBS, and incubated with RNase A (Sigma, 20 μg/ml final concentration) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were chilled on ice for 10 min, stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (Calbiochem) for 1 h, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using an Elite ESP flow cytometer, as described previously (17Sramkoski R.M. Wormsley S.W. Bolton W.E. Crumpler D.C. Jacobberger J.W. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 274-283Google Scholar). Morphological changes such as cell rounding and membrane blebbing were examined by microscopic inspection of cells under differential interference contrast. Nuclear changes such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were analyzed by staining with acridine orange or DAPI. All of the observations, including those of the GFP fluorescence images, were acquired using an Olympus BX-51 fluorescence microscope equipped with the necessary filters and a digital camera. Nuclear morphological changes of cells transfected with PSAP or LacZ without GFP were examined by acridine orange staining as described previously (18Agrawal S. Agarwal M.L. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Stark G.R. Chisolm G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1981-1992Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and harvested by centrifugation at 1000 rpm, washed once with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and stained with an acridine orange and ethidium bromide dye mixture (final concentration, 10 μg/ml for each) immediately before quantification. A minimum of 200 cells/coverslip was scored under a fluorescence microscope for apoptotic morphology. Nuclear morphological changes of cells transfected with PSAP-GFP were examined by DAPI staining according to the protocol provided by the vender (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. On the next day, cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA (pPSAP-GFP or pEGFP-N2 as a control) using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Medium was removed 24 h after transfection, and cells were washed once with DAPI-methanol (1 μg/ml) and incubated with DAPI-methanol for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing once with methanol, coverslips were placed on microslides and the cells were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). HEK293 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Two days later, the medium was replaced with pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 nm MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) and incubated for 15 min to label the mitochondria. For labeling the endogenous PSAP, cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 4 min. The fixed cells were washed four times with PBS and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. The coverslips were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PSAP antibody (1:200), which was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 270–283 of PSAP, for 3 h and rinsed with PBS four times. After incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, the coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Images were acquired using a confocal laser microscope (Leica TCS SP2). For cells transfected with PSAP-GFP or GFP alone, the mitochondria were labeled with MitoTracker as described above. The green fluorescence produced by PSAP-GFP or GFP alone was directly observed by confocal laser microscopy. For examination of cytochrome c release, the cytosolic extracts and mitochondria-containing fractions were prepared by permeabilization of cells with streptolysin O using the method described previously by Mosser et al. (19Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Meriin A.B. Sherman M.Y. Morimoto R.I. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7146-7159Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, cells (106) were washed with PBS, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 10 μl of streptolysin O buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) containing 60 units of streptolysin O (Sigma). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the permeabilization of cells was monitored by trypan blue staining. At the time when 95% cells were stained, permeabilized cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10–14%) followed by Western blotting using anti-cytochrome c antibody (PharMingen). For purification of mitochondria, cells were washed once in 10 volumes of Swell Buffer A (10.0 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10.0 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and pelleted at 200 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 10 volumes of Swell Buffer A and ruptured with two or three strokes in a Dounce homogenizer using a tight-fitting pestle (pestle B). Sucrose (from a 60% stock solution) was added to a final concentration of 250 mm and centrifuged at 960 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells, nuclei, and connective tissue fibers. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 8,600 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the crude mitochondrial fraction. Mitochondria were further purified on sucrose gradient. The pellet containing the crude mitochondria was resuspended in 4 ml of buffer B (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) and layered on top of the sucrose gradients of 35, 40, 43, 46, 50, and 60% of sucrose in 5 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA). After centrifugation at 60,000 × g using a Beckman SW 28.1 rotor for 45 min at 4 °C, the gradients were fractionated with a 20-gauge/1.5 needle and washed once with three volumes of distilled water at 9600 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to dilute the sucrose. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer C (250 mmsucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and subjected to Western blot analysis. For analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, caspase-3 processing, and the ectopic expression of PS1 and PSAP, combined floating and attached cells were lysed by sonication for 20 s on ice in Western blot lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and protease inhibitors). After addition of 4× SDS sample buffer and incubation at 65 °C for 15 min, samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% for PARP and PSAP or 10–14% for caspase-3, cytochrome c, and PS1) electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membranes were then probed with monoclonal antibodies against epitope myc (Invitrogen), flag (Sigma), PARP (7D3–6, BD PharMingen), caspase-3 (PharMingen), cytochromec (PharMingen), anti-PSAP or anti-PS1L and visualized by ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (15Xu X. Shi Y. Wu X. Gambetti P. Sui D. Cui M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32543-32546Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cells or purified mitochondria were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice for 30 min. The total cell lysates or lysed mitochondria, obtained as an 18,000 × g supernatant, were incubated with anti-myc (Invitrogen), anti-PSAP, or anti-PS1L and protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA), the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with the appropriate antibodies. In an attempt to establish a cell line stably expressing PSAP, we found that, after transfection with PSAP cDNA, massive cell death occurred in the absence of the selection drugs. This suggested that PSAP could cause cell death and prompted us to examine the nature of cell death caused by overexpression of PSAP. Cells can die by either of two major mechanisms: necrosis or apoptosis. Several well established methods can be employed to reveal the observable morphological and biochemical differences between necrosis and apoptosis. We first examined the profile of DNA content using flow cytometry. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression construct, pcDNA3.1/myc-His/PSAP, which expresses a PSAP-myc fusion protein or control plasmid, pcDNA3.1/myc-His/LacZ, which encodes LacZ with a C-terminal myc tag. Twenty-four h after transfection, the expression of these transgenes was confirmed by Western blot analysis with the anti-myc antibody (Fig. 1A) and the DNA hypodiploid assays were performed by flow cytometry after DNA staining with propidium iodide. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1B, a significant portion of cells transfected with PSAP displayed reduced DNA content, as demonstrated by the appearance of the hypodiploid DNA peak, sub-G1 peak (indicated as peak B), at the left of the G1 peak. Cells with lighter DNA staining than that of G1 cells have been considered apoptotic (20McCarthy N.J. Evan G.I. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1998; 36: 259-278Google Scholar). The percentage of cells associated with the sub-G1 peak was 18% in PSAP-transfected cells and less than 2% in LacZ-transfected cells or in cells transfected with vector only. Early observations of apoptosis revealed that cells entering apoptosis from non-mitotic parts of the cell cycle showed marked and characteristic changes in nuclear shape and organization. We next examined the effect of transient expression of PSAP on the nuclear morphological change in HEK293 cells. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1B, fluorescent microscopic analysis by acridine orange staining revealed that a certain number of cells exhibited nuclear condensation and fragmentation, the typical indicator of cells undergoing apoptosis (21Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Google Scholar). This nuclear morphology change was at the background level among cells transfected with LacZ cDNA with a myc tag. The percentage of cells with apoptotic morphology was ∼20% in cells transfected with PSAP and less than 2% in control cells transfected with LacZ cDNA (Fig. 1C). This observation is consistent with the result of the flow cytometric analysis. A similar result was observed when cell viability was determined by CellTiter 96 AQueous Assay (Promega, data not shown). The cytotoxicity of PSAP was not caused by the myc tag that was expressed as a part of the fusion protein, nor was it the result of a toxic effect of our overexpression system, because overexpression of myc-tagged LacZ protein did not induce apoptotic DNA loss or nuclear morphological change. The percentage of apoptotic cells observed (∼20%) may reflect the limitation of the efficiency of the transient transfection method used in our experiments. The transfection efficiency was determined to be 20–30% by transfecting cells with pCMV-βGal followed by a colorimetric assay (data not shown). Controlled fragmentation of genomic DNA is another hallmark of apoptosis. We further examined PSAP-induced apoptosis using a DNA laddering assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, analysis of DNA from PSAP-transfected cells demonstrated the generation of the typical nucleosomal-sized ladders of DNA fragments (lane 3). There was no detectable DNA laddering after electrophoresis of DNA from cells transfected with a negative control plasmid expressing myc-tagged LacZ protein (lane 2). To further confirm that the apoptotic cell death is caused by overexpression of PSAP, cells were transfected with a plasmid that expresses PSAP-GFP fusion protein. The expression of PSAP-GFP and the morphological change on individual cells were monitored as described under “Materials and Methods.” The expression of PSAP-GFP and GFP alone in transfected cells was also determined by Western blot analysis using a GFP-specific antibody from Clontech (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, only the cells expressing PSAP-GFP, but not the cells transfected with GFP alone, displayed blebbed membranes, condensed chromatin, and fragmented nuclei as indicated by arrowheads in panels A, B, and C of Fig. 2. This one-to-one correlation holds for all of the microscopic fields observed in all of three replicated experiments. These results strongly argue that only, and all of, the cells transfected with PSAP undergo apoptosis. Because cleavage of the death substrate, PARP, by activated caspase is another prominent indicator of apoptosis (22Dubrez L. Savoy I. Hamman A. Solary E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5504-5512Google Scholar), we also performed a time-course experiment to analyze the cleavage of PARP upon overexpression of PSAP. HEK293 cells were transfected with PSAP. At various time points, equal numbers of cells were harvested and the cleavage of PARP and the expression of PSAP were analyzed by Western blot. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, 8 h after transfection with PSAP, the 85-kDa fragment of PARP, which is a characteristic of apoptosis, became detectable. Similar results were also observed in HeLa cells and the human neuroblastoma cell line M17 (data not shown). The maximum cleavage of PARP was observed within 24 h after transfection. The time course of PARP cleavage is in good agreement with the time course of PSAP expression (middle panel of Fig. 3). A similar time course was also observed by flow cytometric analysis; the proportion of cells displaying sub-G1 DNA content reached a peak at 24 h after transfection (data not shown). The key effectors of apoptotic cell death are caspases, a family of cysteine proteases activated by proteolytic processing upon induction of apoptosis (23Utz P.J. Anderson P. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 589-602Google Scholar). To determine whether PSAP-induced apoptosis involves caspase activation, HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing PSAP or LacZ and incubated in medium with or without the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (100 μm, “Material and Methods”). z-VAD-fmk is a specific tetrapeptide pseudosubstrate for several caspases, including caspase-3, which could irreversibly block the caspase proteolytic cascade (24Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after transfection, expression of myc-targeted PSAP and LacZ was detected by anti-myc antibody (panel A of Fig. 4). PSAP-induced apoptosis was evaluated by analyzing the cleavage of PARP. As shown in panel B of Fig. 4, the typical apoptotic 85-kDa fragment of PARP was detected in PSAP-transfected cells maintained in the absence of z-VAD-fmk (lane 2). The apoptotic morphological change of the PSAP-transfected cells was also observed by microscopy (data not shown). In contrast, no PARP cleavage was detected in PSAP-transfected cells maintained in the presence of z-VAD-fmk (lane 3), indicating PSAP-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent and can be blocked by a general caspase inhibitor. As expected, cleavage of PARP was not detected in the control cells transfected with LacZ (lane 1) or untransfected cells (lane 4). To test whether PSAP-induced cell death involves activation of effector caspases, such as caspase-3, lysates from cells transfected with PSAP or LacZ were analyzed by Western blot using an antibody that recognizes both pro- and activated caspase-3. As shown in panel C of Fig. 4, the active forms of caspase-3, as indicated byarrowheads, were indeed detected in PSAP-transfected cells maintained in the absence of z-VAD-fmk (lane 2), but not in the LacZ-transfected cells (lane 1). It is notable that the active forms of caspase-3 were not detectable in PSAP-transfected cells maintained in the presence of z-VAD-fmk (lane 3). Taken together, these data suggest that PSAP-induced cell death was mediated by caspase activation. As caspase-3 is one of the main effector caspases and is activated in response to both intracellular and extracellular death signals, its activation also provided additional evidence that"
https://openalex.org/W1584547617,"We have recently reported the crystal structure of the accessory subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase, pol γB, and identified a region of the protein involved in DNA binding. The DNA employed in previous studies was presumed to be single-stranded, because it was generated by single-sided PCR. Further characterization of this DNA indicated that, due to a strand transfer event during synthesis by single-sided PCR, the DNA adopts a double-stranded hairpin conformation under native conditions. We used a series of double- and single-stranded oligonucleotides of different lengths to confirm that human pol γB prefers to bind double-stranded DNA longer than 40 bp with little apparent sequence specificity. Site-specific deletion mutagenesis identified clusters of basic residues in two surface loops required for DNA binding located on opposite sides of the symmetrical pol γB dimer. A heterodimer of pol γB that contains one mutant and one wild-type DNA binding region was shown to be unable to bind double-stranded DNA, suggesting that a single DNA molecule must contact both DNA binding sites in the pol γB dimer. The ability to bind double-stranded DNA is not essential for pol γB stimulation of pol γA activity in vitro, but may play a role in DNA replication or repair.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). pol γB is related both in primary sequence and structure to class IIa prokaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) (1Carrodeguas J.A.

Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Apart from its role in the stimulation of pol γ, pol γB has DNA binding activity that may reflect properties of aaRSs. All aaRSs bind specific RNAs, although one, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, has been shown to bind specifically to double-stranded DNA using an atypical helix-turn-helix domain (4Lechler A. Kreutzer R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The so-called b5 domain that mediates this DNA binding is not found in most aaRSs. In preliminary experiments, we found that pol γB was able to bind to a DNA substrate generated by single-sided PCR that was presumed to have a mostly single-stranded conformation (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) similar to the H-strand region that serves as origin for lagging strand mtDNA replication (OL) (5Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). These observations provided support for models suggesting that the DNA binding ability of pol γB might play a role in initiation of mtDNA replication (6Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This sort of model has been suggested for Drosophila pol γ as well (7Fan L. Sanschagrin P.C. Kaguni L.S. Kuhn L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9527-9532Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although this enzyme appears to have a simple heterodimer structure with extensive contacts between the A and B subunits (8Fan L. Kaguni L.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this report we present the results of further experiments to characterize the nucleic acid binding properties of mammalian pol γB, by studying binding to a variety of single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs and by exploring the effects of amino acid changes on nucleic acid binding. The results show that wild-type pol γB binds only to one of two major DNA species generated by single-sided PCR extending through OL. pol γB prefers to bind to an aberrant PCR product that is substantially double-stranded due to a strand transfer event at the hairpin structure at OL. Binding titrations with a variety of single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs of different lengths confirmed that pol γB prefers to bind double-stranded DNA. We further show that clustered point mutations that convert basic residues to alanine residues in two nucleic acid binding loops alter the DNA binding properties of the protein. The pol γB dimer contains two DNA binding sites on opposite sides of the protein. We constructed a pol γB heterodimer containing one mutant and one wild-type DNA binding site and found that this heterodimer was unable to bind double-stranded DNA. Thus, we conclude that both sites are required for high affinity DNA binding, suggesting that an individual DNA molecule must wrap around pol γB to interact simultaneously with both sites. The DNA template used for the synthesis of 129-mer and other single-stranded DNAs was first cloned by PCR from HeLa mitochondrial DNA using primers containingXbaI (HOL1) and XhoI (HOL2) restriction sites. This clone, containing human mitochondrial DNA sequences from position 5495 to 5920, spanning OL, was named pJAC64. Sequencing revealed a point mutation, G to A, at position 5773. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon. The sequences of oligonucleotides used to generate fragments of mtDNA for binding assays are as follows: HOL1, 5′-TCTAGATATACTAATAATCTTAT-3′ (used with HOL2 to make clone pJAC64); HOL2, 5′-TCTGAGCAACGGTCGGCGAACAT-3′; HOL3, 5′-CCGAGGTGATTTTCATATTG-3′ (used to make 129-mer and 117-mer); HOL5, 5′-GAATTGCAAATTCGAAGAAG-3′ (used to make 98-mer and 83-mer); HOL6, 5′-CCCTAATCAACTGGCTTC-3′ (used with HOL2 to make a double-stranded 221-bp DNA by PCR that was used as template for synthesis of the 98-mer (the 5′-end of HOL6 matches the 3′-end of 98-mer)); and HOL8, 5′-TTCAATCTACTTCTCCCG-3′ (used with HOL2 to make a double-stranded 206-bp DNA by PCR that was used as template to prepare the 83-mer (the 5′-end of HOL8 matches the 3′-end of 83-mer)). The following forward oligonucleotides (F) were used as single-stranded DNA in EMSA. Each forward oligonucleotide was annealed with its corresponding complement (R) to prepare double-stranded oligonucleotides: 32F, 5′-GCCGAGATGGAGCAGCAAATGTGGTTCCTTGT-3; 32R, 5′-ACAAGGAACCACATTTGCTGCTCCATCTCGGC-3′; 40F, 5′-AGAGAACTCCTTTACAGCAGCAGCAAATCTTCATAGAAAG-3′; 40R, 5′-CTTTCTATGAAGATTTGCTGCTGCTGTAAAGGAGTTCTCT-3′; 47F, 5′-TATATCCAAATTAAAAGCATTTTTGATTGCATATATATCATCAGCTA-3′; and 47R, 5′-TAGCTGATGATATATATGCAA- TCAAAAATGCTTTTAATTTGGATATA-3′. The 32F and 32R oligonucleotides were also used for site-specific mutagenesis to create mutant P1; the 40F and 40R oligonucleotides were used to create mutant P2. Oligonucleotides used to produce theNotI/XhoI cassette encoding the calmodulin binding protein tag were: CBPF, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAAAGCGACGATGGAAAAAG and CBPR, 5′-ACCGCTCGAGTCATGCCCCGGAGGATGAGAT. Oligonucleotides used for PCR and EMSA were gel-purified before labeling and again after labeling as described above. Concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotides were calculated based on UV absorption. Labeling was carried out with polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) and [γ-32P]ATP, under standard conditions. Fractions of known amounts of labeled oligonucleotides were spotted onto DE-81 paper (Whatman), washed with 250 mm potassium phosphate, and counted in a scintillation counter to determine specific activities. To generate double-stranded oligonucleotides, equal amounts of complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were mixed in a buffer containing 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, heated at 90 °C, and then cooled slowly to room temperature. The general approach used for synthesis of single-stranded DNA by PCR has been described previously (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To generate the 129-mer, the 228-bp double-stranded DNA used as a template was excised by restriction digestion with enzymesXhoI and HincII from clone pJAC64. Primer HOL3 was used in a standard PCR reaction using either Taq DNA polymerase (Fisher) or Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with buffers supplied by the manufacturer. To prepare other single-stranded DNA species, the template was obtained by PCR using pJAC64 DNA as template and the primers described above. 25 or 30 cycles were carried out at 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. To incorporate internal label, reactions were carried out using 100 ng of template DNA, 20 pmol of unlabeled primer, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]dATP. For 5′-end-labeled products, 5 pmol of kinased HOL3 were used in a PCR reaction under the same conditions as above. The PCR products were precipitated with ethanol and collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in formamide loading buffer, boiled, and run in 8–13% polyacrylamide-8 m urea sequencing gels. Bands were identified by autoradiography, excised from the gel, and crush-eluted by rotating end over end overnight in a buffer containing 0.3m sodium acetate, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA. After brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was filtered through 0.22-μm Ultrafree-MC filters (Millipore). DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA. The concentration of internally labeled PCR products was calculated by measuring the incorporated radioactivity and the specific radioactivity of the precursors in the PCR mix, taking into account the sequence of the DNA. For 5′-end-labeled PCR products, the final concentration was estimated using the known specific radioactivity of the labeled primer. Human pol γB mutants HGB P1 (pJAC81) and HGB P2 (pJAC82) were generated using the QuikChange method (Stratagene), using pJAC44 DNA (6Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as template and primers 32F and 32R (P1) and 40F and 40R (P2). Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described (6Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with the following changes: expression was carried out at room temperature, with addition of extra ampicillin (50 μg/ml) every hour after induction, for a total of 3 h. Frequent addition of fresh ampicillin helped prevent loss of the plasmid by the BL21(DE3) cells and substantially increased the yield of recombinant protein. C-terminal His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA (Qiagen) affinity chromatography (6Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) except that the wash buffer was adjusted to contain 1 m NaCl instead of 300 mmNaCl to reduce contamination by bacterial proteins. To generate pol γB heterodimers with differential affinity tags on the two monomers, a derivative of pET22b(+) was generated with a C-terminal calmodulin binding protein tag in place of the His tag. Oligonucleotide CBPF containing a NotI recognition site and oligonucleotide CBPR containing an XhoI recognition site were used for PCR on plasmid pSH6 (9Honey S. Schneider B. Schieltz D. Yates J. Futcher B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e24Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to produce a 105-bp product encoding the calmodulin binding peptide tag sequence AAAKRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFKKISSSG. Following cleavage of the PCR product withNotI and XhoI, the resulting fragment was cloned into pET22b(+) vector cut with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting ampicillin-resistant vector was named pET22b(+)/CBP. This vector was digested with NdeI and NotI to permit it to accept NdeI/NotI DNA fragments encoding wild-type human pol γB or the P2 mutant. To permit selection for heterodimeric pol γB, NdeI/NotI cassettes encoding wild-type and P1 mutant human pol γB were inserted into the kanamycin-resistant vector pET29a(+), which supports synthesis of his-tagged proteins. Co-transfection of Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) with HGB P1 in pET29a(+) and HGB P2 in pET22b(+)/CBP and selection for both ampicillin and kanamycin resistance generated a strain capable of expressing both proteins. As a control, the two wild-type HGB clones in both pET22b(+)/CBP and pET29a(+) were also co-expressed. In each case, co-expression was expected to produce three forms of dimeric protein, the His-tagged and CBP-tagged homodimers and the heterodimer bearing both His and CBP tags. Purification of the His-/CBP-tagged heterodimers was carried out first on a calmodulin column (Stratagene) and then on Ni-NTA (Qiagen). Bacterial cells were sonicated in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μmpepstatin, 1 mm imidazole, 1 mmMgCl2, and 4 mm CaCl2. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with calmodulin affinity resin on a rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, and bound protein was step-eluted with the same buffer lacking CaCl2and MgCl2 but containing 2 mm EGTA. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Centricon 30 and adjusted to 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Additional purification by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was performed as described (6Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Quantitation of recombinant proteins was carried out by UV absorbance or by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels using commercial glutamate dehydrogenase as a standard. Reactions were carried out in 10-μl volumes containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 70 mm NaCl. Each reaction contained a total of 2 μl of either protein or dialysis buffer (6Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which supplied the glycerol and 60 mm salt to the reaction. 1 μl of DNA was used, containing 100 mmNaCl, which was responsible for 10 mm salt in the reaction. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and run in native polyacrylamide gels. Gels contained 6% acrylamide, 0.1% bis-acrylamide, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA. Running buffer was 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 0.1 mmEDTA. Gels were pre-run at room temperature for 1 h at 80 V, using the miniprotean II system (Bio-Rad), and run under the same conditions. Gels were dried on DEAE paper (Whatman) and imaged using either Kodak XAR5 film or a phosphorimaging screen (AmershamBiosciences). 30 fmol (10,000 cpm) of end-labeled DNA was mixed with 10 μg of tRNA carrier in a total volume of 20 μl. 4 μl of 4% pyridinium formate, pH 2, was added, and the mix was incubated at 48 °C for 15 min. Following ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of water, 80 μl of 10% piperidine was added, and the mixture was incubated at 90 °C for 10 min. After ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended in formamide loading buffer, boiled, and run in 8% polyacrylamide-8 m urea sequencing gels. Gels were fixed in a solution containing 10% acetic acid, 12% methanol and dried on Whatman 3MM paper, and an autoradiogram was obtained. We have previously suggested that the relationship of pol γB with some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases could indicate a role in binding tRNA-like structures present at the mitochondrial origins of replication. To test this model we attempted to synthesize a single-stranded DNA spanning the light strand origin of replication (OL). This heavy-strand DNA fragment was expected to contain the stem-loop structure known to be required for the initiation of light strand synthesis. We chose single-sided PCR as a quick method to generate single-stranded DNA. This method involves the use of PCR to extend an oligonucleotide primer using double-stranded DNA as template, generating a run-off product. The product, labeled by incorporation of radioactive dAMP, was then separated from the template DNA using denaturing electrophoresis in polyacrylamide-urea gels. Two closely migrating species were observed near the position expected for the single-stranded DNA (Fig.1) in addition to other shorter extension products that appeared to terminate at secondary structures in the template. We assumed that the largest species was the expected run-off product of 129 nucleotides and the shorter one was produced by the polymerase stalling before reaching the end of the template. We refer to the slower migrating species as 129(+) and to the faster migrating one as 129(−). 129(+) was used as the presumed single-stranded DNA in previous binding studies (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In our attempts to delimit the region in the 129-mer necessary for pol γB binding, we generated shorter products using the same single-sided PCR technique, changing the primer and/or DNA template used for synthesis. In this way, we synthesized a 117-mer, a 98-mer, and an 83-mer (Fig. 2 A). In each case we obtained two major DNA species around the expected size (data not shown), resembling products we obtained for the 129-mer. Experiments employing the 83-mer are not included in this report. EMSA experiments revealed that pol γB bound the (+) species in every case, but not the (−) species (Fig. 2 B). Unexpectedly, in the native gels used for mobility shift assays, the (+) and (−) species interchanged their mobilities with respect to denaturing gels, with 129(+), 117(+), and 98(+) now migrating faster than 129(−), 117(−), and 98(−), respectively. This unusual electrophoretic mobility prompted further investigation of the nature of the pairs of PCR products. We synthesized 5′-end-labeled 129(+) and 129(−) species using 5′-end-labeled primers to permit chemical sequencing to determine whether they represented different conformations of the same DNA fragment or differed somehow in sequence. Following purification of the DNAs in denaturing gels, we carried out partial DNA sequencing by generating purine ladders for each of the DNA species. The ladders obtained with the 129(−) species matched the sequence expected for the 129-mer. The ladder obtained with the 129(+) species showed the identical sequence up to a point corresponding to the “descending” side of the OL stem, in the direction of synthesis. From that point on, the sequence was divergent (Fig.3). Equivalent results were obtained with end-labeled 98(+) and 98(−) PCR products, with the 98(−) ladder matching the expected sequence for the 98-mer and the 98(+) one diverging at the same point seen with 129(+) (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, when the 129-mer was synthesized, a significant fraction of PCR products appeared to be aborted at a size around 89 nucleotides (upper asterisk). This is the point at which 129(+) and 129(−) sequences diverge, coinciding with the descending half of the stem at OL, in the direction of synthesis. We reasoned that the 3′-region of those aborted molecules should be able to fold in a stem-loop structure, resembling the OL. The 3′-end of this stem could then prime synthesis by the polymerase, extending the size of the double-stranded stem back to the 5′-end of the primer (Fig. 4 B). This would generate a large stem structure with a loop corresponding to the OL loop, i.e. a 70-bp stem with a 12-nt loop. In denaturing gels, this DNA species would behave as a single-stranded DNA of 152 nt, which agrees well with the mobility of the 129(+) species seen in Fig. 3. The relative mobility of the hairpin PCR products varied somewhat with the gel temperature and the quantity loaded on gels containing 8 m urea. It is well known that urea is a rather weak denaturing agent that is not able to completely disrupt secondary structures (10Maniatis T. Jeffrey A. vandeSande H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3787-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Analysis of the purine ladder generated from the 129(+) species beyond the point of sequence divergence in Fig. 3showed that it matched the expected sequences for the 152-mer DNA predicted by the mechanism shown in Fig. 4. The 129(+) and 98(+) DNAs would be expected to behave as double-stranded DNAs of approximately half the size under native conditions. This agrees with the faster mobility of the (+) species in the native gels used for EMSA (see Fig.2 B). We also probed the structure of these PCR products by digestion with the restriction enzyme AluI. This enzyme should produce a labeled 42-nucleotide fragment from 5′-end-labeled 129(+), when analyzed in denaturing gels (Fig. 4 B). AluI should not cut the single-stranded 129(−) species. This is exactly what we observed (data not shown). We also confirmed that when internally labeled 129(−) is annealed to a complementary single strand, it can be cut by AluI, generating the expected products shown in Fig. 4 A (data not shown). The reason why the polymerase stalls in the region corresponding to the descending half of the OL stem loop is not obvious. The polymerase might be expected to stall preferentially when entering the stem structure (assuming such a structure exists during synthesis), but the products seen during synthesis due to stalling at this site are only minor species. Instead, the polymerase appears to stall and to engage in hairpin replication at the base of the loop at OL. Interestingly, the hairpin product was only observed when the light strand was the template, not when the polymerase was moving in the opposite direction using the heavy strand as template. There may be some unusual structure resulting from the G-rich tract at the base of the OL loop that facilitates hairpin replication by the polymerase. We have obtained different ratios of 129(+) and 129(−) species using different polymerases (Taq, Pfu) and different concentrations of nucleotides, suggesting that different conditions could produce different amounts of the hairpin species. We tested whether pol γ is similarly prone to hairpin formation at this site but did not find evidence of hairpin products. 2K. G. Pinz, unpublished observation. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the reported binding by pol γB to a single-stranded 129-mer (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) represented binding to a mostly double-stranded DNA of 70 bp, with a 12-nt loop at one end. The data presented in Fig. 2 Bindicate that pol γB binds more tightly to double-stranded (H117(+), H98(+)) than to single-stranded DNA (H117(−), H98(−), L117). To confirm the double-strand DNA binding preference of pol γB, we used a series of complementary oligonucleotides of different lengths. Oligonucleotides of 32, 40, 47, and 65 nt of unrelated sequences were annealed to their complementary oligonucleotides to generate double-stranded DNA or were used alone as single strands. Binding assays proved that pol γB prefers to bind double-stranded instead of single-stranded DNA (Fig. 5). More avid binding is observed with DNAs of 47 bp or larger, which indicates an approximate minimum DNA size requirement for pol γB binding. Also, the fact that pol γB was able to bind a variety of DNA sequences indicates that there is little or no sequence specificity for this reaction, although this aspect has not been studied in detail. To calculate an approximate K d for double-stranded DNA binding by pol γB we measured the disappearance of free DNA as the protein concentration was increased, because more than one complex can be seen. A binding titration with 1 nm ds47 DNA as shown in Fig. 6 was analyzed as a simple binding 1:1 interaction between the pol γB dimer and DNA, provided an apparent K d of 8.6 ± 1.5 nm.Figure 6Titration of the binding of pol γB to duplex oligonucleotide ds47. Binding reactions were conducted under standard conditions with 1 nm ds47 DNA and 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 nm dimeric pol γB. The fraction of DNA bound to protein was estimated by the removal of free DNA from the unbound position. Thesmooth curve drawn through the data points was fit to the data using the Langmuir isotherm, DNAbound/DNAtotal = [protein]/(K D + [protein]), and SigmaPlot software, resulting in the K D of 8.6 ± 1.5 nm. The inset shows the phosphorimaging results of the gel analysis. Note that ds47 contains a minor portion of ss47 that failed to anneal to its complement and did not bind pol γB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously used deletion mutagenesis to identify two protein loops in pol γB required for DNA binding (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We refer to these surface loops as loop I6, between β strands 10 and 11, and I7, between β strands 13 and 14. These two loops are closely apposed in the dimeric protein structure (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and contain clusters of basic residues. The corresponding regions in threonyl-tRNA synthetase contribute to the RNA binding site for anticodon recognition (11Sankaranarayanan R. Dock-Bregeon A.C. Romby P. Caillet J. Springer M. Rees B. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Moras D. Cell. 1999; 97: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To identify residues in these loops necessary for DNA binding by pol γB, we generated alanine replacement mutants. In mutant P1, two basic residues in the I6 loop 302RK303, were replaced with alanines; in mutant P2, three residues in the I7 loop,337RKK339, were replaced with alanines (see Fig. 7 A). We studied the abilities of the new mutants, HGB P1 and P2, as well as other mutants of pol γB, to bind the double-stranded 47-mer, ds47. Fig. 7 B shows the EMSA results obtained with wild-type pol γB, deletion mutants I4, I5, I6, and I7 (described previously (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) and point mutants, P1 and P2. These results indicate that the basic residues in loops I6 and I7 are required for pol γB binding to double-stranded DNA. The P1 and P2 mutants are able to stimulate pol γA activity in vitro (not shown), as has been shown for the I6 and I7 deletions (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), indicating that pol γB binding to double-stranded DNA is not necessary for stimulation of pol γA activity. The results presented above suggest a working model to describe the DNA binding of pol γB whereby an I6 loop from one monomer and an I7 loop from the other create a binding site for double-stranded DNA. Because pol γB is a dimer, the complex would be expected to contain two potential I6/I7 binding sites on either side of the protein. When either the I6 or I7 loop is mutated, binding sites on both sides in the pol γB dimer are affected. Thus, the foregoing results do not permit us to determine whether one I6/I7 binding site is sufficient for binding to double-stranded DNA. To test this model directly, we generated a pol γB heterodimer containing a mutated I6 loop (P1) in one monomer and a mutated I7 loop (P2) in the other as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The strategy to accomplish this was to co-express two forms of pol γB with different C-terminal affinity tags in the same E. colicells, as shown in Fig. 8 A. We reasoned that successive chromatography on two different affinity matrices would permit purification of heterodimers containing one monomer with each type of affinity tag. We employed a C-terminal calmodulin binding protein (CBP) tag for this experiment. This is a convenient affinity tag, because the protein can be adsorbed to a calmodulin affinity column in the presence of calcium and desorbed by the replacement of calcium with the chelator EGTA (9Honey S. Schneider B. Schieltz D. Yates J. Futcher B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e24Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To provide a positive control, wild-type pol γB was cloned in the same two vectors and expressed under the same conditions. In each case, three types of dimers are expected to form: His-tagged homodimers, CBP-tagged homodimers, and heterodimers containing one His-tagged subunit and one CBP-tagged subunit. Only the heterodimers are retained on both types of affinity matrices; this was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). For the case of the P1/P2 heterodimer, the pol γB should have mutated DNA binding loops I6 and I7 on one side of the protein dimer and wild-type ones on the opposite side. Dimeric wild-type and P1/P2 mutant pol γB proteins were purified by chromatography on calmodulin affinity resin followed by Ni-NTA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 8 B, the P1-His/P2-CBP heterodimer was unable to bind double-stranded DNA, although the wild-type heterodimer control was fully active in DNA binding. These results suggest that two wild-type I6 and I7 loops are necessary for DNA binding by pol γB and that DNA must loop around the protein in some fashion to permit this interaction. The accessory subunit of DNA pol γ, pol γB, stimulates the activity of the catalytic subunit under physiological buffer conditions (1Carrodeguas J.A. Kobayashi R. Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4039-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that vertebrate pol γB is related to prokaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) suggested that the nucleic acid binding properties of a tRNA synthetase might contribute to the function of the accessory factor. Because the sequences surrounding both origins of mtDNA replication have a high potential for forming complex secondary structures, we speculated that pol γB could be involved in the recognition of such structures, directing the polymerase to the origins of replication (6Carrodeguas J.A. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1237-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As a first approach to test this hypothesis we studied pol γB binding to a DNA fragment derived from a region of the mitochondrial genome that contains the light strand origin of replication (OL). We initially documented binding of pol γB to a DNA substrate synthesized by single-sided PCR (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the PCR product that bound tightly to pol γB in these experiments was, in fact, a largely duplex hairpin generated by fold-back priming during PCR. To confirm the double-stranded DNA binding preference of pol γB, we used a series of oligonucleotides, either in single-stranded or double-stranded form. The data in Figs. 5 and 6 show that pol γB has a poor ability to bind short duplex oligonucleotides but is able to bind with high affinity (K d of ∼8.6 nm) to a 47-mer oligonucleotide. Our measurement of the absolute affinity of this interaction is subject to technical limitations of the EMSA assay, and we are working to develop independent measurements of this affinity using other methods. Limet al. (12Lim S.E. Longley M.J. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38197-38203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) have previously observed binding of pol γB to a 34:38-mer primer-template, but the lowest protein concentration used in their experiments, 2 pmol in a 20-μl binding reaction, did not permit determination of the K D for this interaction. Our results suggest that the presence of a 5′ overhang in the primer-template used by Lim et al. (1999) probably did not influence the binding. pol γB has shown a similar ability to bind other duplex fragments longer than ds47 (data not shown), suggesting that DNAs must exceed a minimal size between 38 and 47 bp to bind. pol γB binds very poorly to single-stranded DNA, such that only a few percent of input DNA is bound by 150 nm protein (Fig. 5). To date, we have identified no specific sequences that preferentially bind to pol γB. However, the finding that a single DNA molecule appears to interact with binding sites on both sides of the pol γB dimer suggests that DNA sequences with an intrinsic bend may be bound more avidly. The binding of pol γB to double-stranded DNA provides a contrast to the binding of folded single-stranded RNA by tRNA synthetases. The affinity of pol γB for double- stranded DNA is much higher than that previously observed for the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase fromThermus thermophilus, which has been estimated to have a binding constant of 400 nm. This interaction also requires a longer minimal DNA size of ∼80 bp and does not employ the same regions of the protein required for tRNA binding (4Lechler A. Kreutzer R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Dou X. Limmer S. Kreuzer R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that there are significant differences between the DNA binding reported for phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase and that reported here for pol γB. DNA binding by mammalian pol γB depends on the dimeric structure of the protein and on two superficial loops initially identified by deletion analysis, I6 and I7 (3Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K.

The corresponding regions of threonyl-tRNA synthetase are involved in binding to the anticodon of tRNA, as depicted in Fig. 7. Both loops in pol γB contain basic lysine and arginine residues that appeared to be good candidates to play a role in DNA binding. Site-directed mutagenesis to convert these residues to alanines confirmed this model (Fig. 7). We conclude that the basic residues in the I6/I7 region are essential for the double-stranded DNA binding activity of pol γB. Because we observed that DNA binding requires a rather long segment of DNA, ∼38–47 bp (Fig. 5), we sought to test the model that a single DNA duplex must interact simultaneously with the I6/I7 loops on both faces of the pol γB dimer protein. We produced a heterodimer containing one pol γB polypeptide with point mutations in I6 and a second with point mutations in I7. The results shown in Fig. 8 revealed that this heterodimer was not able to bind DNA. The use of a dual-tagged control wild-type protein ruled out the trivial possibility that this deficiency was due to the nature of the tags employed in purification. Thus, we conclude that a single DNA molecule must contact basic residues on both sides of pol γB for stable binding. The structural basis for the action of pol γB on the catalytic subunit is poorly understood. This reflects the fact that the structure of the catalytic subunit has not been determined, and the interactions between the large and small subunits have not been defined precisely. Both the mammalian pol γB, which has a dimeric structure, and itsDrosophila homolog, which binds as a monomer to its cognate pol γA, resemble tRNA synthetases. Recently, Drosophilapol γB has been shown to make extensive contacts with the catalytic subunit (8Fan L. Kaguni L.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These extensive contacts may be critically important for the activity of the small subunit as a processivity factor (14Breyer W.A. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Among processivity factors, the ability of pol γB to bind duplex DNA is unusual, but not unprecedented. The toroidal “sliding clamp” processivity factors like proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and E. coli DNA pol III β subunit do not possess intrinsic DNA binding activity and must be loaded onto DNA by additional factors. However, the herpes virus UL42 protein does bind DNA non-specifically with high affinity (15Weisshart K. Chow C.S. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 55-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the nonspecific DNA binding activity of UL42 appears to contribute to the ability of the herpes virus DNA polymerase holoenzyme to conduct a one-dimensional scan along DNA to identify primer-template binding sites (16Randell J.C. Coen D.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in UL42 that abrogate nonspecific DNA binding also impair the ability of the protein to function as a processivity factor. This provides an interesting contrast to pol γB, where mutants deficient in DNA binding, point mutants PI and P2 and the related deletion mutants I6 and I7, are not impaired in their ability to stimulate in vitro DNA synthesis by the catalytic subunit on a poly(dA):oligo(dT) template:primer ((3) and data not shown). Thus, the role, if any, that is played in mtDNA maintenance by this double-stranded DNA binding of pol γB remains to be established.

https://openalex.org/W1984823571,"The RAD52 epistasis group of proteins, including Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54, plays an important role in the homologous recombination repair of double strand breaks. A well characterized feature associated with the ability of these proteins to repair double strand breaks is inducible nuclear foci formation at the sites of damage. How the process is functionally regulated in response to DNA damage, however, remains elusive. We show here that c-Abl tyrosine kinase associates with and phosphorylates Rad52 on tyrosine 104. Importantly, the very same site of Rad52 is phosphorylated on exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR). The functional significance of c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of Rad52 is underscored by our findings that cells that express the phosphorylation-resistant Rad52 mutant, in which tyrosine 104 is replaced by phenylalanine, exhibit compromised nuclear foci formation in response to IR. Furthermore, IR-induced Rad52 nuclear foci formation is markedly suppressed by the expression of dominant-negative c-Abl. Together our data support a mode of post-translational regulation of Rad52 mediated by the c-Abl tyrosine kinase.

DSBs 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFP, green fluorescence protein; HR, homologous recombination; IR, ionizing radiation; KA, kinase-active; KD, kinase-dead; WT, wild type. arise on chromosomes when replication forks collapse during DNA replication as well as on exposure to DNA-damaging agents such as IR. To repair DSBs, one of which is sufficient to cause cell death if left unrepaired, eukaryotes have developed multiple DSB repair pathways that include nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination (HR). In yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the genes involved in HR form theRAD52 epistasis group of genes (RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, MRE11, and XRS2) (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Google Scholar). Mutation of these genes is often associated with hypersensitivity to IR and mitotic and meiotic recombination defects (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Google Scholar). Among theRAD52 group, the rad51, rad52, andrad54 mutants exhibit more severe defects in HR repair, which suggests that these genes encode the central components of the recombinational repair machinery (1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Google Scholar). Structural homologues of the RAD52 group of genes have been cloned from vertebrates (2Morrison C. Takeda S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 817-831Google Scholar). Because these proteins share similar biochemical properties with their yeast homologues (3Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Google Scholar), and because vertebrate cells deficient in the Rad54 (4Bezzubova O. Silbergleit A. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M.

However, mutant phenotypes of RAD52 epistasis group genes in vertebrates are not always identical to those in yeast. The most prominent examples areRad51 and Rad52. Rad51 gene knockout mice are embryonic lethal (8Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Google Scholar, 9Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-6240Google Scholar), and depletion of Rad51 proteins from cells is accompanied by an accumulation of cytologically detectable chromosome aberrations and subsequent cell death, indicating the essential role of Rad51 in the maintenance of chromosomal DNA during normal cell cycle (10Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Google Scholar). On the contrary, Rad52 gene knock-out mice are normal and fertile, and Rad52-deficient cells only show a slight decrease in gene targeting frequency and do not exhibit an IR-sensitive phenotype (11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Baarends W.M. Van Sloun P.P. Lohman P.H. Pastink A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6423-6429Google Scholar). However, it was recently shown that simultaneous depletion of Rad52 and Xrcc3 proteins renders chicken DT40 cells nonviable and provokes extensive chromosomal breaks (13Fujimori A. Tachiiri S. Sonoda E. Thompson L.H. Dhar P.K. Hiraoka M. Takeda S. Zhang Y. Reth M. Takata M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5513-5520Google Scholar). This finding demonstrates that Rad52 plays an essential role in the maintenance of chromosomal DNA in cooperation with Xrcc3, one of fiveRAD51 paralogs. HR is important to the maintenance of chromosome integrity. Cells from ataxia telangiectasia patients, who have mutations in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene, show chromosomal instability, radiosensitivity, and defective cell cycle checkpoint (14Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Google Scholar). ATM-deficient cells exhibit altered kinetics of radiation-induced Rad51 and Rad54 focus formation (15Morrison C. Sonoda E. Takao N. Shinohara A. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 463-471Google Scholar, 16Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6087-6096Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic analyses have shown that the defect in ATM function is associated with an impaired HR-mediated DSB repair process (15Morrison C. Sonoda E. Takao N. Shinohara A. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 463-471Google Scholar). ATM, c-Abl, and Rad51 associate and form protein complex in vivo (17Yuan Z.M. Huang Y. Ishiko T. Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Kharbanda S. Wang R.

Park M.S. Sung P. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12748-12752Google Scholar), but the biological significance of this tyrosine phosphorylation is not clear. Here we show that c-Abl phosphorylates Rad52 on Tyr-104 in vivo. Inhibition of this tyrosine phosphorylation, either by dominant-negative c-Abl expression or substitution of Rad52 Tyr-104 by Phe suppresses IR-induced GFP-Rad52 nuclear foci formation. 293T (American Type Culture Collection) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Dr. Hatsumi Nagasawa, Colorado State University) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate methods for 293T, and by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for CHO cells. To establish GFP-Rad52(WT) and GFP-Rad52(Y104F) expressing CHO cells, 10 μg of plasmids were linearized by digestion with ApaLI (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37 °C, phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and transfected to semiconfluent CHO cells in 100-mm-diameter dishes. Transfected cells were selected in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. The resistant colonies were isolated and expanded for further analysis. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. CHO cells were irradiated at 5.45–5.70 centrigrays/s by a cobalt-60 γ irradiator (model GR-12, US nuclear). Vectors that express kinase-active or inactive c-Abl have been reported previously (21Kawai H. Nie L. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6079-6088Google Scholar). cDNAs of humanRad51, DFF45, and wild type and mutantRad52 were subcloned into pcDNA3-FLAG and/or pEGFP-C1 vectors. The series of tyrosine-to-phenylalanine point mutants of humanRad52 were generated by two-step PCR using a set of 30-nucleotide primers that carried the mutated nucleotide. Cells were transfected in 60-mm-diameter plates with 5 μg of plasmid DNA and harvested at 24 h post-transfection. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin) by incubating on ice for 30 min, and the extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). After the addition of loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 1% glycerol), the samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated with the indicated antibodies for 4 h followed by incubation with protein A-protein G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional 4 h. For detection of tyrosine phosphorylation of FLAG-Rad52, whose molecular size is close to mouse Ig, dithiothreitol was replaced by 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Calbiochem) in lysis buffer, and β-mercaptoethanol was eliminated from loading buffer (22Funabiki H. Yamano H. Kumada K. Nagao K. Hunt T. Yanagida M. Nature. 1996; 381: 438-441Google Scholar). Immune complexes and whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with anti-FLAG (M5, Sigma), anti-GFP (Clontech), anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology), anti-c-Abl (Ab-2, Oncogene Research Products), and goat polyclonal anti-Rad52 (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase or anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant c-Abl was prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (23Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Google Scholar). Immunopurified FLAG-tagged proteins were incubated with the recombinant c-Abl in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction products were washed three times with 500 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot. Cells were grown on chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and transfected with the indicated vector. To detect transfected proteins, at the indicated hours after γ-irradiation cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, cells were permeabilized with ice-cold 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, and then incubated with the anti-FLAG antibody (1:300 dilution) for 1 h. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, the slides were incubated with secondary antibody (Texas Red × goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes) and 4′6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (10 μg/ml) for 1 h. After being washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) that contained 2.5 mg/ml n-propyl gallate (Sigma) and viewed with a Nikon ECLIPSE E600 fluorescence microscope using a ×60 objective. For kinetics analyses, at least 200 cells with green fluorescent signal were counted at each time point and a minimum of five foci per nucleus was scored as a positive cell. Given the finding that Rad52 binds to Rad51 (18Chen G. Yuan S.S. Liu W. Xu Y. Trujillo K. Song B. Cong F. Goff S.P. Wu Y. Arlinghaus R. Baltimore D. Gasser P.J. Park M.S. Sung P. Lee E.Y. J. Biol.

Nakada S. Utsugisawa T. Kharbanda S. Wang R. Sung P. Shinohara A. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3799-3802Google Scholar, 18Chen G. Yuan S.S. Liu W. Xu Y. Trujillo K. Song B. Cong F. Goff S.P. Wu Y. Arlinghaus R. Baltimore D. Gasser P.J. Park M.S. Sung P. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12748-12752Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether any interaction occurs between c-Abl and Rad52 using immunoprecipitation/Western analysis. A plasmid encoding FLAG-c-Abl was coexpressed with a GFP-Rad52-expressing vector in 293T cells to test this possibility. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection for immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody. Anti-GFP immunoblotting analysis of the immunocomplexes revealed an apparent association of Rad52 with the c-Abl protein (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Because of its C-terminal nuclear export sequence, the c-Abl protein actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and consequently distributes to both compartments (25Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. McElroy A.K. Wang J.Y. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Google Scholar). The Rad52 protein is, however, almost exclusively nuclear-localized (26Liu Y. Li M. Lee E.Y. Maizels N. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 975-978Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to examine where these two proteins co-localize in the cell. The c-Abl C-terminal deletion mutant that lacks the nuclear export sequence and is mainly nuclear-localized (21Kawai H. Nie L. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6079-6088Google Scholar) was tested for its ability to bind to Rad52. The result indicated that this c-Abl that lacked the nuclear export sequence exhibited a markedly increased association with the Rad52 protein when compared with that of wild type c-Abl (Fig. 1A, lane 4), suggesting that the interaction between the two proteins is mediated primarily by nuclear c-Abl. To analyze the interaction between c-Abl and Rad52 further, we performed a reciprocal immunoprecipitation/Western analysis of lysates isolated from cells that coexpressed FLAG-Rad52 and GFP-c-Abl. Rad51 or an unrelated protein DFF45 was included as a positive or negative control, respectively. The readily detectable c-Abl signal in the Rad52 as well as Rad51, but not DFF-45 (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5 versus lane 6), immunocomplexes confirmed specific in vivo binding of c-Abl to Rad52. The in vivo association of c-Abl with Rad52 prompted us to ask whether the Rad52 protein was phosphorylated as a result of binding to the c-Abl tyrosine kinase. To accomplish this, we coexpressed kinase-active (KA) or kinase-dead (KD) c-Abl (21Kawai H. Nie L. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6079-6088Google Scholar) with FLAG-tagged Rad52 in 293T cells. FLAG-Rad51 and FLAG-DFF45 were again included as positive and negative controls, respectively. Tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting analysis of anti-FLAG immunocomplexes. As reported previously (18Chen G. Yuan S.S. Liu W. Xu Y. Trujillo K. Song B. Cong F. Goff S.P. Wu Y. Arlinghaus R. Baltimore D. Gasser P.J. Park M.S. Sung P. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12748-12752Google Scholar), coexpression of Rad51 with c-Abl(KA), but not by c-Abl (KD), was associated with Rad51 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and4), whereas c-Abl(KA) did not phosphorylate DFF45 (Fig. 2A, lane 5), indicating that this c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is substrate-specific. Under the same experimental conditions, coexpression of c-Abl(KA), but not c-Abl(KD), resulted in Rad52 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2A,lanes 1 and 2). To distinguish whether the observed Rad52 tyrosine phosphorylation in the c-Abl(KA)-expressing cells was mediated directly by c-Abl or by an intermediate tyrosine kinase, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. Recombinant c-Abl protein was purified from insect cells infected with baculovirus that contained c-Abl-expressing vector and subsequently incubated with purified FLAG-tagged substrate proteins. Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot analysis of the reaction products demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of full-length Rad52 (data not shown) and Rad52-(1–280) (Fig. 2B, lane 4), but not Rad52-(151–418) (Fig. 2B, lane 5), indicating that c-Abl directly phosphorylates Rad52 at its N terminus. Rad51 was again included as a positive control (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Inspection of the amino acid sequence of Rad52 revealed 8 tyrosine residues within the region spanning amino acids 1–150. We then substituted each of the eight tyrosine residues with phenylalanine to identify the c-Abl phosphorylation site. When coexpressed with the kinase-active c-Abl, only FLAG-Rad52(Y104F) exhibited nearly completely diminished reactivity toward anti-Tyr(P), whereas the other mutants remained phosphorylated to the extent comparable to that of wild type Rad52 (Fig. 2C, lane 6 versus lanes 1,2, 3, 4, 5, and7). This result clearly demonstrates that when overexpressed, c-Abl phosphorylates Rad52 in vivo at the Tyr-104 residue. Consequently, it was important to determine whether this phosphorylation reflects the biological function of endogenous c-Abl. To address this issue and to examine whether IR that activates c-Abl kinase could induce Rad52 tyrosine phosphorylation, we used CHO cell lines in which GFP-tagged wild type or the Y104F mutant of Rad52 was stably expressed at relatively low levels. At the indicated time after exposure of the cells to ionizing radiation, cell lysates were prepared for anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitation to enrich tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, which were then subjected to anti-Rad52 immunoblot. Remarkably, IR indeed induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad52, as demonstrated by a distinct Rad52 band detected in the IR-treated cells (Fig. 2D, top panel, lane 6). Significantly, this IR-induced Rad52 phosphorylation was completely absent in the Rad52(Y104F) mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 2D, bottom panel,lane 6), which supports our hypothesis that Rad52 phosphorylation induced by IR is a c-Abl-mediated event. Given the fact that the SH2 domain displays a high affinity to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue, we were interested in knowing whether Rad52 tyrosine phosphorylation affected its association with c-Abl, which contains an SH2 domain at its N terminus. The binding of Rad52 to c-Abl was analyzed by immunoprecipitation/Western analysis from lysates that were prepared from cells coexpressing GFP-Rad52 with either FLAG-c-Abl(KA) or FLAG-c-Abl(KD). Interestingly, whereas anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation brought down a comparable amount of the c-Abl(KA) and c-Abl(KD) proteins (Fig. 3, top panel), anti-GFP immunoblotting detected a markedly stronger Rad52 band in the c-Abl (KA)-expressing cells than in the c-Abl(KD)-expressing cells (Fig. 3, bottom panel, lane 5 versus lane 6), supporting the notion of phosphorylation-enhanced interaction between the two proteins. To further substantiate this observation, the c-Abl phosphorylation-resistant mutant of Rad52, Rad52(Y104F), was tested for its association with c-Abl. In contrast to wild type Rad52, Rad52(Y104F) did not exhibit significant preferential binding toward the kinase-active c-Abl (Fig. 3, bottom panel, lane 7 versus lane 8). This finding indicates the importance of c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation to the interaction between Rad52 and kinase-active c-Abl. A well characterized feature of cellular homologous recombinational repair of DSBs is the formation of nuclear foci that contain DSB repair proteins (26Liu Y. Li M. Lee E.Y. Maizels N. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 975-978Google Scholar, 27Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Google Scholar, 28Tan T.L. Essers J. Citterio E. Swagemakers S.M. de Wit J. Benson F.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 325-328Google Scholar). It has been shown that stably expressed GFP-Rad52 can mimic endogenous Rad52 protein in forming nuclear foci in response to IR (26Liu Y. Li M. Lee E.Y. Maizels N. Curr.

Having demonstrated that IR-induced Rad52 phosphorylation was mediated by c-Abl, we were interested in determining whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Rad52 could affect IR-induced nuclear foci formation. To address this issue, we once again used stable Rad52-expressing CHO cell lines that we had previously established. Consistent with the published results, exposure of these cells to IR was associated with the induction of Rad52 nuclear foci formation. Although evenly distributed in the nucleus of untreated cells, the green Rad52 proteins became accumulated as distinct nuclear dots in IR-treated cells (Fig. 4A, top row,third panel). The number of cells that contained the Rad52 nuclear foci and the number of Rad52 foci in each cell increased with time and peaked at 6 h post-IR (Fig. 4B, open bars). To assess possible involvement of c-Abl in Rad52 foci formation, the GFP-Rad52(Y104F)-expressing cells were analyzed for IR-induced foci formation. Significantly, this Rad52 mutant, which is resistant to the c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation, exhibited an impaired ability to form nuclear foci in response to IR treatment (Fig. 4A, second row, third panel), as demonstrated by a marked decrease in the number of Rad52(Y104F)-expressing cells that displayed the nuclear foci compared with wild type Rad52-expressing cells at every time point examined (Fig. 4B, filled bars). To substantiate this observation further, plasmid expressing the kinase-dead c-Abl, which functions as a dominant-negative mutant, was transfected into the GFP-Rad52-expressing cells (Fig. 4A, third row). Analysis of IR-induced Rad52 nuclear foci revealed a significantly reduced number of the c-Abl(KD)-expressing cells that contained the nuclear foci in comparison with control cells (Fig. 4B,hatched bars), supporting the importance of the kinase activity of c-Abl in the formation of Rad52 nuclear foci induced by IR. Taken together, these results demonstrate that c-Abl functionally regulates Rad52 in response to IR. DNA damage triggers a series of cellular responses that include cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. These events are regulated by coordinated actions of a number of proteins that sense and transmit the damage signal to the transcription, replication, DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis machineries. The c-Abl tyrosine kinase is activated in response to DNA damage and has been shown to participate in DNA damage signaling (30Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3309-3318Google Scholar). Our findings here reveal a novel activity of c-Abl in the functional regulation of Rad52. The Rad52 protein, which is evenly distributed in the nucleus in unstressed cells, accumulates into foci on exposure of cells to IR (26Liu Y. Li M. Lee E.Y. Maizels N. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 975-978Google Scholar, 29Essers J. Houtsmuller A.B. van Veelen L. Paulusma C. Nigg A.L. Pastink A. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2030-2037Google Scholar, 31Liu Y. Maizels N. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 85-90Google Scholar). We present here compelling evidence to demonstrate that this IR-induced Rad52 foci formation is regulated by c-Abl via post-translational modification of the Rad52 protein. The Rad52 protein, specifically Tyr-104 residue, is phosphorylated by c-Abl in vitro and in IR-treated cells. The functional importance of this Rad52 tyrosine phosphorylation was highlighted by the demonstration that inhibition of c-Abl kinase activity by expression of dominant-negative c-Abl was associated with an impediment of Rad52 foci formation induced by IR. An additional support for c-Abl kinase-dependent regulation comes from an independent observation that the c-Abl phosphorylation-resistant Rad52 mutant exhibited an impaired ability to form nuclear foci in response to IR. How phosphorylation augments IR-induced nuclear Rad52 foci formation is currently unclear. The Rad52 proteins form a homoheptameric ring structure in vitro (32Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Van Dyck E. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Google Scholar). Even though tyrosine 104 is located within the homo-oligomerization domain of Rad52 (33Shen Z. Peterson S.R. Comeaux J.C. Zastrow D. Moyzis R.K. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 81-89Google Scholar), no apparent effect of phosphorylation on Rad52 homocomplex formation was detected (not shown). Rad52 tyrosine phosphorylation, however, markedly augments its association with the c-Abl protein, which has been shown to interact with ATM. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether this c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation can influence the interaction between Rad52 and other proteins that contribute to the IR-induced nuclear foci formation. It has been shown that Rad52-mediated HR repair is tightly associated with the S phase during which an identical chromosome, which is needed as a template for the repair, becomes available (34Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA damage-induced c-Abl activation also occurs during the S phase (35Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Google Scholar), which suggests a temporal correlation between these two events. Additionally, ATM, which is partially responsible for IR-induced c-Abl activation (19Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T. Hobson K. Gatei M. Zhang N. Watters D. Egerton M. Shiloh Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Lavin M.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Google Scholar, 20Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Google Scholar), contributes to the regulation of HR repair (15Morrison C. Sonoda E. Takao N. Shinohara A. Yamamoto K. Takeda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 463-471Google Scholar). It will be of interest to examine whether the ATM-dependent regulation of HR is mediated through c-Abl. Recently, constitutive association between c-Abl and Brca1 was reported (36Foray N. Marot D. Randrianarison V. Venezia N.D. Picard D. Perricaudet M. Favaudon V. Jeggo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4020-4032Google Scholar). This association was disrupted after exposure to IR in an ATM-dependent manner. c-Abl kinase activity seems to be repressed by this association, because BRCA1-mutated cells exhibit constitutive high c-Abl kinase activity that cannot be further increased on exposure to IR (36Foray N. Marot D. Randrianarison V. Venezia N.D. Picard D. Perricaudet M. Favaudon V. Jeggo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4020-4032Google Scholar). Brca1 has also been shown to promote HR-mediated DNA repair (37Moynahan M.E. Chiu J.W. Koller B.H. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 511-518Google Scholar). The defect in HR repair inBRCA1-mutated cells may be partially attributed to the deregulated c-Abl kinase and tyrosine hyperphosphorylation of Rad52. Further study will be required to address this possibility. In summary, our data provide compelling evidence to support a functional role for c-Abl in the post-translational regulation of IR-induced Rad52 nuclear foci formation."

Its cytoplasmic domain contains a central region unlike that of any other vertebrate or invertebrate syndecan core protein with a cationic motif that binds inositol phospholipids. In turn, lipid binding stabilizes the syndecan in oligomeric form, with subsequent binding and activation of protein kinase C. The specificity of phospholipid binding and its potential regulation are investigated here. Highest affinity of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain was seen with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5P)2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and both promoted syndecan-4 oligomerization. Affinity was much reduced for 3-phosphorylated inositides while no binding of diacylglycerol was detected. Syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain had negligible affinity for any lipid examined. Inositol hexakisphosphate, but not inositol tetrakisphosphate, also had high affinity for the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain and could compete effectively with PtdIns(4,5)P2. Since inositol hexaphosphate binding to syndecan-4 does not promote oligomer formation, it is a potential down-regulator of syndecan-4 signaling. Similarly, phosphorylation of serine 183 in syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain reduced PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding affinity by over 100-fold, although interaction could still be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Only protein kinase Cα was up-regulated in activity by the combination of syndecan-4 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, with all other isoforms tested showing minimal response.

InsP3 can also be the target of kinases that sequentially convert it through InsP4 and InsP5 to InsP6 (inositol hexaphosphate) that has been proposed to have various regulatory functions in phosphatase inhibition, trafficking, calcium influx, and cell growth (7Larsson O.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 can also be converted to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by PI 3-kinases that have also been implicated in regulation of protein trafficking, cell growth and survival, and cytoskeletal organization (10Leevers S.J.

In addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 may have roles itself, such as binding and regulation of the actin-associated proteins vinculin, α-actinin, and gelsolin (2Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to specific sites on these proteins influences their interactive properties with, for example, actin (12Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol.

One cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-4, also binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 through a motif in the central portion of its cytoplasmic domain, known as the V (variable) region. The V region of syndecan-4 is unlike that of any other family member and has the sequence LGKKPIYKKA (18Oh E.-S. Woods A. Lim S.-T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

The two pairs of lysine residues appear to be critical for this activity, and the motif KKXXXKK is known to bind inositol polyphosphate based on previous studies, for example of synaptotagmin II (20Mehrotra B.

The functional consequences of inositol phospholipid binding at this site appears to be the stabilization of a dimer of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain in an unusual twisted clamp motif, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (21Lee D.

Our current hypothesis is that syndecan-4, when clustered, signals through the kinase at nascent focal adhesions and contributes to focal adhesion assembly, with possible involvement of the G protein RhoA (19Couchman J.R.

One unresolved issue is the regulation of the syndecan-4, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PKCα signaling complex. There are several possibilities. First, all syndecans can interact with PDZ domain proteins through a C-terminal FYA sequence (19Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 113-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Zimmerman P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such interactions could lead to complex disassembly or internalization or to stabilization. This has not been examined. Second, Horowitz et al. (24Horowitz A. Murakami M. Gao Y. Simons M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15871-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation of the single serine residue at the boundary of the membrane proximal C1 region and V region of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (Ser183) can lead to decreased signaling through PKCα. In part this may be due to decreased affinity of PtdIns(4,5)P2 for the phosphorylated syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (24Horowitz A. Murakami M. Gao Y. Simons M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15871-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A third, alternate, hypothesis is that PtdIns(4,5)P2 may be displaced by another compound, yielding a form of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain unable to bind or activate PKCα. One possibility is InsP6. The KKXXXKK motif within syndecan-4 V region provides a potential site for InsP6 binding (31Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although we showed previously that this inositol phosphate neither promotes syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain oligomerization nor activates PKCα (18Oh E.-S. Woods A. Lim S.-T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we have examined these hypotheses by analyzing the specificity of phospholipid and inositol phosphate binding to syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain peptides, whether InsP6 can compete with PtdIns(4,5)P2 for binding to the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 core protein and the role of Ser183phosphorylation. Both InsP6 and phosphorylation may down-regulate syndecan-4-mediated signaling, since both strongly affect PtdIns(4,5)P2 interactions. In addition, InsP6diminished microfilament bundle formation in fibroblasts, under experimental conditions where syndecan-4 and PKCα are involved. Syndecan-2 and −4 peptides corresponding to the entire cytoplasmic domains of human syndecan-4 (4L) and syndecan-2 (2L) were synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA), and their sequences confirmed by mass spectroscopy. These sequences were (C)RMKKKDEGSYDLGKKPIYKKAPTNEFYA and RMRKKDEGSYDLGERKPSSAAYQKAPTKEFYA, respectively. Two modified 4L peptides were also synthesized, one lacking the three C-terminal amino acids (FYA; denoted 4ΔE) and a second incorporating a phosphoserine at position 183 in place of serine (p-4L). Also used were peptides corresponding to the central, variable (V) region of syndecan-4 and −2 with the sequences (C)LGKKPIYKK and (C)LGERKPSSAAYQ, respectively. At least two different batches of each peptide were used. All inositol phospholipids and diacylglycerols were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). PtdIns(4,5)P2 was also purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), as were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine. InsP6, InsP4, InsP3, and inositol hexasulfate (InsS6), HEPES, CHAPS, and one batch of PtdIns(4,5)P2 were from Sigma-Aldrich. Lipids were dissolved in a chloroform/methanol solution at 2 mg/ml as described previously (29Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25548-25551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Solubilized lipids were dried under N2 and sonicated for 2 min in ice-cold H2O at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Peptides were incubated on ice for 30 min with the indicated concentrations of lipid in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in a reaction volume of 100 μl. The samples were spun in filter units (Ultrafree-MC, 30,000 NMWL, Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 2000 ×g for 70 s following the method described by Haareret al. (32Haarer B.K. Petzold A.A. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 10: 7864-7873Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The filtrates (40 μl of each in 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1.5% dithiothreitol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (BioRad). The stained peptides were scanned on a BioRad GS670 imaging densitometer and quantitated. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Bound and free phospholipid were then calculated and averaged from replicates. The data were used to generate Scatchard plots, from which affinities were estimated. In addition, two forms of displacement experiments were performed. Peptides were first incubated with differing concentrations of inositol phosphate or sulfate for 30 min, then with 50 μm inositol phospholipid for an additional 30 min, or PtdIns(4,5)P2 was incubated first with the peptide, then the inositol phosphate or sulfate was added. The preparation and use of [3H]benzoyldihydrocinnamide (BZDC)-InsP4 and -InsP6 probes has been described previously (33Theibert A.B. Prestwich G.D. Jackson T.R. Hammonds-Odie L.P. Shears S. Signaling by Inositides: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1997: 117-150Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in 96-well plates. To 21 μl of buffer, consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm dibasic potassium phosphate, was added 1 μg of peptide in 5 μl of buffer and 3 μl of water, with or without unlabeled InsP4 or InsP6, as appropriate, to a final concentration of 20 μm. After a 10-min incubation on ice, 1 μl of photoactivable probe (0.5 μCi, 20–70 nm) was added. The plate was incubated for 60 min on ice before exposure to UV irradiation. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved by 20% SDS-PAGE at ∼30 mA, with prestained low molecular mass standards (Invitrogen) in one or two lanes. The gels were impregnated with Entensify (DuPont), dried and fluorographs exposed for 1 week. In other experiments, increasing concentrations of unlabeled InsP6were included in the assays, in order to ascertain theK i as an approximate measure of affinity of the inositol phosphate for the V region of syndecan-4. Gel filtration procedures were as previously (22Shin J. Lee W. Lee D. Koo B.-K. Han I. Lim Y. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Oh E.-S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8471-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides or a mixture of synthetic peptide and phosphoinositide were loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column (0.7 × 50 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 0.1% CHAPS, and 150 mmNaCl. Peptides were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 3 ml/h at room temperature, and 1-ml fractions were assayed on a UV monitor at 280 nm. The column was calibrated with molecular standards containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.3 kDa). Primary rat embryo fibroblasts were seeded onto fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates as previously (34Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min. At this time InsP4, InsP6, or InsS6 were added to the serum-free medium at various concentrations for up to an additional 2.5 h. In some cases, after 1.5 h, adherent cells were returned to normal growth medium, as a control to ascertain that adhesion inhibition was reversible. For interference reflection microscopy analysis of focal adhesion formation (35Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), cultures were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and washed and mounted in serum-free medium. Other cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining of microfilaments was performed as before (35Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells with focal adhesions or microfilament bundles was counted in three separate replicates, with at least 100 cells per coverslip counted in each case. In further studies, cells were seeded on the integrin-binding 110-kDa fragment of plasma fibronectin (19Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 113-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T.

Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to promote focal adhesion formation (19Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev.

Cells were fixed and stained for microfilament bundles with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin as before. Recombinant isoforms of PKC were incubated with, or without, the addition of PtdIns(4,5)P2and syndecan-4L cytoplasmic domain peptide, using identical methods as previously (18Oh E.-S. Woods A.

Quantitation was by laser scanning densitometry as before (18Oh E.-S. Woods A. Lim S.-T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide titration experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer in quadrature detection mode, equipped with a triple resonance probe head with triple-axis gradient coils. A series of one-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded for 4L, p-4L, and 2L peptides with different concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2. All data were collected at 25 °C, and the strong solvent resonance was suppressed by water-gated pulse sequence combined with pulsed-field gradient (PFG) pulses. All NMR data were processed using Bruker XWIN-NMR (Bruker Instruments) software on an SGI Indigo 2W. Lee and J. R. Couchman, unpublished data. work station. The proton chemical shifts were referenced to internal sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane 1-sulfonate (DSS). Fig.1 shows the sequences of syndecans-2 and −4 with their constant (C1 and C2) and variable (V) regions denoted. Lipid micelles were allowed to bind to peptides corresponding either to the full-length cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 or syndecan-2, and the unbound peptide recovered and quantified after centrifugation through a molecular mass cut-off filter. Affinities of the lipids for the peptides are shown in Table I. There was a significant preference of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(4)P over inositol phospholipids containing phosphate at the 3-position on the inositol ring. Phosphatidylserine had weak affinity for syndecan-4, while no binding to phosphatidylethanolamine or two forms of diacylglycerol was noted. Since diacylglycerol is a cleavage product of PtdIns(4,5)P2generated by phospholipase C, the data suggest that interactions of the inositol phosphate moiety of PtdIns(4,5)P2 with syndecan-4 are key. Very little binding of any lipid to syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain was seen, confirming that only the central V region of syndecan-4 contains the lipid binding site(s), since the C1 and C2 regions of these two core proteins are highly homologous. This was confirmed with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the V region of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domains, which had similar affinity to 4L for PtdIns(4,5)P2 (not shown).Table ILipid affinities for syndecan-4Lipid4Lp-4L4ΔE2LPtdIns4,5P255704.56100PtdIns4P4ND1065PtdIns3,4P2480NDNDPtdIns3,4,5P3NDNDNDDAG1-aDAG, 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol.NDNDDAG1-bDAG, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycerol.NDNDPtd ethanolamineNDNDPtd serine3653700Lipid affinities (μm) for cytoplasmic domains of wild-type syndecan-4 (4L), phosphorylated syndecan-4 (p-4L), syndecan-4 with a truncation of the C-terminal last three amino acids (4ΔE), or wild-type syndecan-2 (2L).

ND-not detectable. The almost identical affinities of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(4)P for the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 (4L) raised the question of whether both could stabilize the peptide in dimeric conformation. Fig. 2 shows that both phospholipids markedly promoted 4L dimer formation, which is only limited in their absence. Syndecan-2 cytoplasmic domain (2L) showed no tendency to form dimers (Fig. 2), even in the presence of PtdIns (4Cockcroft S. De Matteis M.A. J. Membrane Biol. 2001; 180: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 (not shown). Phosphorylation of the single Ser183 residue in syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain has been reported to decrease phospholipid binding and subsequent PKCα activity (24Horowitz A. Murakami M. Gao Y. Simons M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15871-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the entire cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4, but incorporating phosphorylated Ser183 had markedly lower affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 than the unphosphorylated peptide (570 μm compared with 5 μm; Table I). Moreover, this decrease was not accompanied by any change in preference for phospholipid interactions. There was still no detectable binding to D3 inositol phospholipids, and the affinity of the 4L peptides for PtdIns (4Cockcroft S. De Matteis M.A. J. Membrane Biol. 2001; 180: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)P was also reduced to undetectable levels (Table I). One-dimensional NMR spectroscopy was used as a further sensitive indicator of syndecan cytoplasmic domain interactions with PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3). The spectra demonstrated that each of the three peptides, 4L, p-4L and 2L, have different characteristics with respect to PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding. Most resonances for 4L and p-4L were changed and broadened upon inositide titration, indicative of oligomerization in the presence of the phospholipid. Therefore, even though the membrane filter assay showed a much decreased affinity of p-4L for PtdIns(4,5)P2, an interaction was still clearly detectable by NMR spectroscopy. However, the spectra of 4L and p-4L were distinct, which indicate differences in oligomer organization. Consistent with results of gel chromatography and lipid binding assays, the spectra of 2L peptide were unchanged with increasing inositide, indicative of no detectable interaction (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Syndecan cytoplasmic domain interactions with PtdIns(4,5)P2. Proton one-dimensional NMR spectra of 4L peptide (A), p-4L peptide (B), and 2L peptide (C) with titration of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Molar ratios of peptide to inositide are shown in the upper leftof each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Published data suggest that the C2 region of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain is flexible and may not participate in interactions with inositides (22Shin J. Lee W. Lee D. Koo B.-K. Han I. Lim Y. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Oh E.-S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8471-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This region, and particularly its terminal FYA motif, does interact with PDZ domain proteins (28Zimmerman P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These may stabilize the C2 structure in situ. Deletion of the FYA sequence did not alter in vitro binding affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Table I). Peptides corresponding to the V region and entire cytoplasmic domains of syndecan-2 and −4 were exposed to [3H]BZDC-InsP4 or [3H]BZDC-InsP6. Fig.4 shows the structure of these compounds. Covalent cross-linking was achieved by UV irradiation, with subsequent SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and quantitation. Control experiments contained an ∼400-fold excess of unlabeled InsP4 or InsP6. The results in Fig.5 A show that both the full-length cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 and its central V region specifically bound the [3H]BZDC-InsP6 probe. Quantification of the InsP6 probe bound to 4V and 4L peptides, by scanning densitometry, showed reductions of 92–94% in the presence of excess unlabeled InsP6. In contrast, there was limited binding of the [3H]BZDC-InsP4, and this was reduced by 58–61% by excess unlabeled compound. Consiste"

The control of transcription initiation involves the binding of gene regulatory proteins to regulatory and competing genomic DNA sequences.

In addition, changes in hydration accompany macromolecular interactions (reviewed in Refs. 8Robinson C.R. Sligar S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 395-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

For those interactions in which the hydration change is large, the free energies of interaction depend sensitively on the activity of water (aH2O). The intimate association of protein and DNA surfaces is accompanied by the displacement of water molecules associated with those surfaces. In addition, allosteric changes that extend beyond the contact surfaces can alter the solvent-accessible surface areas of protein and DNA and, thus, the numbers of associated water molecules. Any water molecules bound or released in these transactions are reactants or products, respectively, in the binding reaction. Changes in the number of thermodynamically associated water molecules can be detected and quantitated by the osmotic stress technique (12Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 13Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Fuller N.L. Rao D.C.

Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), using small, neutral solutes (osmolytes) that are typically excluded from the volumes immediately adjacent to macromolecular surfaces (11Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 15Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). With three caveats, the dependence of the affinity of protein for DNA (K obs) on water activity is a measure of the net change in the number of water molecules that are associated with the participating macromolecules. These are as follows: (i) thatK obs should not be significantly perturbed by the differential interaction of osmolytes with reactants and products; (ii) that volume exclusion by osmolytes should not significantly alterK obs; and (iii) that changes in solvent properties that indirectly affect binding affinity (for example, the dielectric coefficient) should not account for changes inK obs. Here we report the use of osmotic stress to measure the water stoichiometries of lac repressor binding to its primarylac promoter regulatory site (O1) and to nonspecific DNA. In the absence of low molecular weight inducers (e.g.allolactose), lac repressor binds its regulatory sites (operators O1, O2, and O3 (16Muller-Hill B. The Lac Operon. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1996Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) and promoter-bound RNA polymerase (17Straney S.B. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 699-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and inhibits one or more initial step(s) of the transcription process (17Straney S.B. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 699-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Lee J. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1991; 66: 793-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Schlax P.J. Capp M.W. Record M.T., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the cell, nonspecific DNA competes with target sequences for lac repressor binding. The distribution of repressor between regulatory and nonspecific sequences determines the occupancy of operator O1, and hence the transcriptional activity of thelac promoter (20von Hippel P.H. Revzin A. Gross C.A. Wang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4808-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21von Hippel P.H. Revzin A. Gross C.A. Wang A.C. Sund H. Blauer G.

Biol. 1994; 168: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown below, under standardin vitro conditions, this distribution depends on the water activity. In principle, the value of the water stoichiometry may contain information about structural changes that accompany binding. If the water stoichiometry of a reaction reflects the net association or dissociation of water molecules from the macromolecular surface, its value should be proportional to the sum of changes in solvent-accessible surface areas of reaction participants. For proteins, it has been estimated that an inner hydration layer water molecule occupies 9 ± 1 Å2 of surface (14Colombo M.F. Rao D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We use this value, with caveats, to obtain an estimate of the change in solvent-accessible surface area accompanying lacrepressor-DNA interaction. This estimated change is similar to one calculated for an isosteric model of the interaction, using the protein and DNA structures present in the co-crystal solved by Bell and Lewis (23Bell C.E. Lewis M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This similarity is surprising, because both repressor and operator DNA have been shown to undergo allosteric transitions during sequence-specific binding (cf. Refs. 23Bell C.E. Lewis M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Zwieb C. Kim J. Adhya S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C.

In binding competition assays, repressor-operator complexes were titrated with unlabeled E. coli genomic DNA, establishing the equilibrium shown in Equation 3,R·O+D⇆R·D+OEquation 3 in which R, O, and D represent repressor, operator, and competing DNA sites, respectively. At the ith step of the titration, the specificity ratio is given by Equation 4,KSKN=[R·O][D][O][R·D]Equation 4 Here [R·O] and [O] are measured quantities. The concentrations [R·D] and [D] were calculated using [R·D] = [R·O]o − [R·O]i and [D] = [D]o −m[R·D], in which [R·O]o and [D]oare equal to the initial concentrations of R·O and D; [R·O]i is equal to the measured concentration of R·O at the ith titration step, and m is equal to the number of base pairs occupied by the protein (33Fried M.G.

Sample osmolalities were measured with a vapor pressure osmometer (41Vossen K.M. Stickle D.F. Fried M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In aqueous solutions, osmolality (Os) and water activity are related by lnaH2O = −OsV̄, in which V̄ is the molal volume of water, and osmolality is given in units of osmol kg−1. Solution densities were measured as a function of osmolyte concentration using a Mettler densitometer, operating at 21 °C. Apparent partial specific volumes, v̄ app, were calculated using the relationship (37Durschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-128Google Scholar) shown in Equation5, v̄app=1ρo1−ρ−ρocEquation 5 in which ρ is the solution density; ρo is the solvent density; and c is the osmolyte concentration (all in grams per milliliter). The value of v̄ appextrapolated to infinite dilution was taken as the partial specific volume, v̄ (37Durschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-128Google Scholar). Molar volumes were calculated according to V mol =v̄·M r. 95% confidence intervals for fitted parameters were estimated by the method of Broderson et al.(38Broderson R. Nielsen F. Christiansen J. Andersen K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The binding of repressor (R) to operator (O) in an aqueous solution containing a neutral solute (S) can be represented by Equation 6, R+O⇆R·O+νH2OH2O+νSSEquation 6 in which νH2O and νS are the stoichiometric coefficients of water and solute, respectively. Following standard approaches (14Colombo M.F. Rao D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 40Wyman J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 223-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), it can be shown that ln K obs depends on lnaH2O as shown in Equation 7(57Vossen K.M. Wolz R. Daugherty M.A. Fried M.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11640-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).dlnKobsdlnaH2O=νH2O+νSdlnaSdlnaH2OEquation 7 Timasheff and co-workers (11Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

J. 1985; 47: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) have shown that many low molecular weight osmolytes are excluded from the volumes immediately adjacent to proteins (i.e. that these volumes are occupied preferentially by water molecules). Thus, for a process involving a large change in solvent-accessible surface area, in a solution containing such a “non-interacting” solute, one might expect νH2O to contribute more importantly to ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2Othan does νS. As described below, this expectation can be tested by comparing values of ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2Oobtained with different structurally and chemically distinct osmolytes. The electrophoresis mobility shift assay (33Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 34Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) was used to detect the binding of wild-type lac repressor to its primarylac operator site, O1 (Fig. 1 A). Under conditions of low binding saturation, the predominant complex formed contained one repressor tetramer, occupying site O1 (33Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 35Hudson J.M. Fried M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Vossen K.M.

Isotherms for the binding of lac repressor in a buffer containing 250 mm KCl and 0 or 5% v/v ethylene glycol are shown in Fig. 1 B. In the absence of osmolyte, the value ofK obs (1.1 ± 0.1 × 1010m−1) is in good agreement with values obtained at similar [salt] (29Stickle D.F. Liu G. Fried M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 42Whitson P.A. Olson J.S. Matthews K.S.

The value obtained in the presence of 5% ethylene glycol (K obs = 3.4 ± 0.5 × 1011m−1) is similar to ones obtained at similar [salt], in the presence of 5% glycerol (29Stickle D.F. Liu G. Fried M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 44Mossing M.C. Record M.T., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or 5% Me2SO (45Winter R. von Hippel P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6948-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The inclusion of acetamide, betaine, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or triethylene glycol in the reaction mixture increases the value ofK obs. For these solutes, lnK obs is linearly correlated with lnaH2O, with the consensus value of ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2O= −260 ± 32 (Fig. 2). In principle, several factors can contribute to the observed increase inK obs, including changes in water activity, changes in solvent polarity, and direct solute-macromolecule interactions. An important criterion for discrimination between direct solute interactions with macromolecules and osmotic effects is the sensitivity of the value of ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2Oto changes in the identity of the solute (12Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 57Vossen K.M. Wolz R. Daugherty M.A. Fried M.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11640-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The number of solute molecules associated with each macromolecule and the change in that number with protein-DNA interaction (νS) should depend on the identity of the solute. On the other hand, a purely osmotic effect should be independent of solute identity (12Parsegian V.A. Rand R.P. Rau D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 43-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 14Colombo M.F. Rao D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Closely similar values of ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2Owere obtained for the five low molecular weight solutes examined (TableI). This could occur only if the product νS·(∂lna S/∂lnaH2O) was the same, within error, for all solutes tested or if all values of νS·(∂lna S/∂ln aH2O) were much less than that of νH2O (Equation 7). Since chemically distinct solutes associate to different degrees with proteins (11Timasheff S.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 67-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 15Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and are likely to do so with nucleic acids as well, it seems improbable that νS·(∂lna S/∂ln aH2O) is the same for all the osmolytes tested. We conclude that preferential macromolecule-osmolyte interactions contribute much less to ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2Othan do changes in hydration.Table IStoichiometry of water release and change in solvent-accessible surface area for the binding of lac repressor to lac operator O1SoluteM rV mol(∂lnK obs)/(∂lna H2O)ΔA W1-aEstimated with the assumption that a water molecule occupies 9 ± 1 Å2 of macromolecular surface; experimental uncertainties in ∂lnK obs/∂lna H2O are propagated into the error range for ΔA W.ml/molÅ 2Acetamide5955.11-bFrom Ref.68.−259 ± 48−2380 ± 690Betaine11875.21-bFrom Ref.68.−260 ± 60−2400 ± 800Ethylene glycol6254.11-bFrom Ref.68.−279 ± 71−2580 ± 920Propylene glycol7671.21-bFrom Ref.68.−283 ± 38−2590 ± 625Triethylene glycol150129.51-bFrom Ref.68.−275 ± 42−2520 ± 650Uniformly weighted global fit to all data for the solutes listed above−260 ± 32−2370 ± 550Polyethylene glycol400343.61-cDetermined from apparent partial specific volumes as described in Equation 5.−564 ± 160Polyethylene glycol14501225.31-cDetermined from apparent partial specific volumes as described in Equation 5.−1322 ± 372Polyethylene glycol80006760.01-cDetermined from apparent partial specific volumes as described in Equation 5.−1677 ± 390In addition to the indicated solute, reactions contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml.1-a Estimated with the assumption that a water molecule occupies 9 ± 1 Å2 of macromolecular surface; experimental uncertainties in ∂lnK obs/∂lna H2O are propagated into the error range for ΔA W.1-b From Ref.68Hoiland H.

A second possibility is that the increase inK obs is a consequence of decrease in the solution dielectric coefficient with osmolyte concentration. If this were the case, ln K obs would be expected to scale identically with dielectric coefficient for all osmolytes tested. Shown in Fig. 3 are values of lnK obs as a function of dielectric coefficient for the osmolytes acetamide, betaine, and ethylene glycol. Since the slopes differ markedly for these osmolytes, changes in solvent polarity cannot account for the common effects of different osmolytes onK obs. A third possibility is that the observed changes inK obs are due to volume exclusion by the osmolytes. A hallmark of such effects is that they increase strongly with solute molar volume (10Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 4 is the dependence of ∂lnK obs/∂ln aH2Oon ln V mol, the natural log of solute molar volume, measured in our assay buffer, for solutes ranging fromM r = 59 (acetamide) to M r∼8000 (polyethylene glycol 8000). Values of ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2Odepend strongly on ln V mol for the large solutes, but become essentially independent of lnV mol for the small ones. Shown in Fig. 4,inset, a linear extrapolation of ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2Oas a function of V mol toV mol = 0 gives a limiting value, −272 ± 17, that is indistinguishable from the consensus value obtained with small osmolytes (−260 ± 32). This suggests that volume exclusion has a significant influence on the value of ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2Oonly when the osmolytes are large (for this system,V mol ≥ 130 ml/mol). Taken together, the results presented above support the interpretation that ∂lnK obs/∂lnaH2O= −260 ± 32, obtained with small osmolytes, is a measure of the net change in macromolecular hydration (νH2O) that accompanies interaction of the lac repressor with the lacoperator site O1. This result is in reasonable agreement with a previous estimate (νH2O = −210 ± 30) obtained from analysis of the [salt] dependence of operator binding (46Ha J.-H. Capp M.W. Hohenwalter M.D. Baskerville M. Record M.T., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Such large values indicate that water is by far the dominant stoichiometric component of the binding reaction. If we assume that all water molecules contributing to νH2O occupy the inner hydration layer when associated with a macromolecule, and if a water molecule in the inner hydration layer occupies 9 ± 1 Å2 of macromolecular surface as proposed for protein hydration (14Colombo M.F. Rao D.C. Parsegian V.A. Science. 1992; 256: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), then the value of νH2O specifies the change in solute-excluding, solvent-accessible macromolecular surface area (ΔA W) that accompanies complex formation. Summarized in Table I, the effects of low molecular weight solutes onK obs are consistent with the estimate ΔA W = −2370 ± 550 Å2. As shown below, this value is only slightly smaller than the area occluded in the repressor-DNA interface on formation of the complex with operator O1. The crystal structures oflac repressor dimer complexes with the “ideal” Osym and wild-type O1 operators (23Bell C.E. Lewis M. J. Mol.

Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar) as implemented in the program GRASP version 1.25 (49Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). A probe radius of 1.4 Å (equal to that of the oxygen atom in a water molecule) was used. Models of the solvent-inaccessible surfaces of DNA present in the repressor dimer-operator O1 and repressor dimer-Osym complexes are shown in Fig. 5. The change in solvent-accessible surface area on formation of each complex (ΔA S) was calculated using Equation 8, ΔAS=ARO−(AR+AO)Equation 8 Here A RO is the solvent-accessible surface area of the complex, and A R andA O are the corresponding areas calculated for models of free repressor and DNA molecules in which their conformations are identical to those found in the complex. It follows that these calculations do not take into account changes in the solvent-accessible surface areas of the protein and the DNA that results from conformational changes that occur during binding. In addition, they use structural data for the dimeric form of lac repressor, so they cannot take into account conformational differences that may distinguish dimeric and tetrameric forms of the protein or changes that take place at the dimer-dimer interface. With these caveats in mind, the values of ΔA S for the repressor (dimer)-Osym and repressor (dimer)-O1 complexes are −3340 and −2600 Å2, respecti"

Dimerization of two F1Fo monomeric complexes involves the physical association of two membrane-embedded Fo sectors and in a manner, which is dependent on the Fo subunit, Su e. Sequence analysis of Su e protein family members indicated the presence of a conserved coiled-coil motif. As this motif is often the basis for protein homodimerization events, it was hypothesized that Su e forms homodimers in the inner membrane and that formation of Su e dimers between two neighboring Focomplexes would facilitate dimerization of the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex (Arnold, I., Pfeiffer, K., Neupert, W., Stuart, R. A., and Schägger, H. (1998) EMBO J. 17, 7170–7178). Using a histidine-tagged derivative of yeast Su e, Su e-His12, combined with cross-linking and affinity purification approaches, we have directly demonstrated the ability of the yeast Su e protein to form homodimers. Functionality of the Su e-His12 derivative was confirmed by its ability to assemble into the ATP synthase complex and to support its dimerization in the Δsu e null mutant yeast cells. The close association of two neighboring Su e proteins was also demonstrated using cross-linking with Cu2+, which binds and cross-links a unique Cys residue in neighboring Su e proteins.

Mitochondria, eukaryotic organelles, produce energy in the form of ATP (adenosine 5′-triphosphate) by a process termed oxidative phosphorylation. The F1Fo-ATP synthase complex catalyzes the formation of this ATP from ADP (adenosine 5′-diphosphate) and in a manner that is coupled to the transport of protons across the inner membrane from the intermembrane space to the matrix (1Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Google Scholar, 2Velours J. Arselin G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 383-390Google Scholar, 3Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 428-442Google Scholar). In general, F1Fo-ATP synthase complexes may be resolved into two oligomeric parts, the catalytic F1sector, which performs the ATP synthesis and hydrolysis reactions, and the membrane-embedded Fo sector, which mediates the proton transport steps. Both the Fo and the F1 sectors are multisubunit protein complexes. The F1 sector is composed entirely of nuclear-encoded subunits, whereas the membrane-bound Fo sector is assembled from both nuclear and mitochondrially encoded proteins (1Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Google Scholar, 2Velours J. Arselin G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 383-390Google Scholar, 3Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 428-442Google Scholar). The mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase complexes do not exist as physically independent entities, but rather the complexes appear to be associated together as a larger oligomeric network of complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar, 5Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Google Scholar). Consistent with an earlier hypothesis proposed by Allen (6Allen R.D. Protoplasma. 1995; 189: 1-8Google Scholar), formation of this oligomeric F1Fo-ATP synthase network has been shown to play a critical role in the modulation of the cristae morphology (5Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Google Scholar). Formation of the ATP synthase oligomeric network appears to be dependent on the initial dimerization of two F1Fo-ATP synthase complexes (5Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Google Scholar). Evidence for the formation of the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase dimers, was first demonstrated in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar, 7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar, 8Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Arselin G. Graves P.V. Grandier-Vazeille X. Velours J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1414: 260-264Google Scholar). The dimeric ATP synthase was initially identified following mild detergent solubilization of mitochondrial membranes and subsequent analysis by either size-exclusion chromatography or blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) 1The abbreviations used are: BN, blue native; WT, wild type; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar, 7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar). A comparison of the subunit composition of the dimeric and monomeric forms of the ATP synthase following the BN-PAGE led to the identification of a number of novel, dimer-specific subunits, termed e, g, and k (Su e, Su g, and Su k, respectively) (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). Deletion of the genes encoding Su e, Su g, or Su k, showed them to be all non-essential subunits of the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex, as the resulting null mutants (Δsu e, Δsu g, and Δsu k, respectively) were viable on non-fermentable carbon sources indicating that their mitochondria were respiratory-competent (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). The Su e and Su g proteins, however, were shown to play an important role in the formation of the dimeric ATP synthase complex. As demonstrated by BN-PAGE analysis, formation of the dimeric ATP synthase was adversely affected in mitochondria isolated from the Δsu e or Δsu g null mutants (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). Formation of the Su e-mediated F1Fo dimers appears to be a prerequisite for the assembly of the F1Focomplexes into the larger oligomeric network (5Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Google Scholar). Failure to form this complex network in the Δsu e null mutant resulted in morphological changes of the mitochondrial inner membrane, with a notable absence of the characteristic inner membrane cristae tubular network (5Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Google Scholar). The presence of F1Fo-ATP synthase dimers has subsequently been characterized in a number of eukaryotic mitochondria, including bovine and human (9Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Google Scholar). Consistently, the Su e and Su g proteins are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution, found both in fungal and mammalian mitochondria. Su e and Su g are integral inner membrane proteins, indicating them to be components of the membrane-embedded Fo sector (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar, 7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar). Consequently, dimerization of the yeast F1Fo-ATP synthase had been proposed to involve the physical association of two membrane-embedded Fo sectors, and in a manner that involves the Su e and Su g proteins (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). Previous work has supported a central role of Su e in this F1Fo-ATP synthase dimerization event (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). Su e spans the inner membrane once via a single transmembrane segment, located at the extreme N-terminal region (approximately residues 1–25). The C-terminal region of Su e, the bulk of the protein (approximately 70 residues), thus protrudes into the intermembrane space (7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of known Su e-family members has indicated the presence of a conserved putative coiled-coil motif in the Su e protein, which is located directly C-terminal to the transmembrane segment (7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar). As coiled-coil motifs can often be the basis for homodimerization events, we previously proposed that Su e protein forms homodimers in the inner membrane (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). Furthermore, formation of Su e-Su e homodimers, between two neighboring Fo complexes was hypothesized to play an important role in facilitating dimerization of the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). In support of this model, it was previously shown that bovine Su e could be chemically cross-linked to a protein of a similar size to Su e, thus providing preliminary support for Su e-Su e dimers (10Belogrudov G.I. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20340-20345Google Scholar). Direct demonstration of homodimers of Sue, however, has been lacking to date. In this present study we directly analyzed the ability of the yeast Su e protein to form homodimers in the mitochondrial inner membrane. We have expressed a histidine-tagged derivative of yeast Su e, Su e-His12 in either wild type or Δsu e null mutant yeast cells. We demonstrate the functionality of the tagged Su e derivative by its ability to assemble into the ATP synthase complex and support dimerization of the complex. Using a chemical cross-linking and affinity purification approach, we directly demonstrate the formation of Su e-Su e dimers in the mitochondrial membrane. The close association of two neighboring Su e proteins is also demonstrated using cross-linking with Cu2+, which binds and cross-links a single Cys residue in neighboring Su e proteins. Finally, taking this information together, we propose a model for the molecular basis of the homodimerization of the F1Fo-ATP synthase Su e proteins. Yeast strains used in this study were wild type (WT) W303–1A (Mat a,leu2, trp1, ura3, his3,ade2) and the su e null mutant, Δsu e (W303–1A, leu2, trp1, ura3,ade2, TIM11::HIS3) (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar, 11Rothstein R.J. Sherman F. Genetics. 1980; 94: 871-889Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from the resulting yeast strains, which had been grown in YP (yeast extract, peptone)-Gal medium (2% galactose) supplemented with 0.5% lactate (12Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Strains bearing the 2μ Yep51-Su e-His12 plasmid (see below) were grown in the absence of added leucine on selective medium (SD(−lactate), supplemented with 0.1% galactose). The open reading frame encoding Su e (ATP21/TIM11 gene) was amplified by PCR as aBamHI-XbaI fragment, whereby the translational stop codon of the Su e open reading frame was omitted. The PCR fragment, following restriction digest, was cloned into a yeast multicopy 2μ expression plasmid, Yep51-GAL10 (LEU2), which contained the galactose-inducible GAL10 promoter, BamHI andXbaI cloning sites, and a sequence encoding 12 histidine residues and a STOP codon. The resulting plasmid, Yep51-Su e-His12 was transformed either into the haploid wild type (W303–1A) or into the su e null mutant, Δsu e, using the protocol described by (13Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Google Scholar) and leucine positive transformants were selected. Expression of Su e-His12 in the wild type (WT+ Su e-His12) and the su e null mutant background (Δsu e+ Su e-His12) were verified by Western blotting. Isolated mitochondria (100 μg of protein) were resuspended in SH buffer (0.6m Sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Cross-linking was performed on ice for 30 min in the presence of the sulfhydryl-specific homo-bifunctional reagent 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, 0.2 mmor 0.4 mm, as indicated.) Following quenching with cysteine, mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation, lysed in the presence of SDS-containing sample buffer (without β-mercaptoethanol), and cooked at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 16% acrylamide, 0.6% bisacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting. A batch method was used for the affinity purification of the histidine-tagged Su e protein using Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen). Mitochondria (600 μg of protein) were carefully solubilized in 600 μl of digitonin-lysis buffer (1% (w/v) digitonin, 150 mm potassium acetate, 30 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF) for 30 min on ice. Following lysis, 600 μl of lysis buffer without digitonin was added, and the samples were subjected to a clarifying spin by centrifugation for 30 min, at 226,000 × g(TLA45 rotor, Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge). The supernatant was then added to 90 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose bead suspension, which had been washed previously in the digitonin-containing lysis buffer. Binding was performed for 60 min at 4 °C under constant gentle rotation. The Ni-NTA beads were recovered by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the non-bound proteins were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. The Ni-NTA beads were washed three times with the digitonin lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted following the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer containing 400 mm imidazole. Samples were shaken for 10 min at 4 °C and then cooked at 95 °C for 3 min. Following centrifugation the supernatant was removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunedecoration of the resulting blot with Su e and F1α-subunit-specific antisera was performed. Following cross-linking with DTNB (0.2 mm, see above), mitochondria (1.5 mg) were solubilized in 150 μl of SDS-lysis buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm PMSF) for 10 min at 4 °C and then were heated to 95 °C for 3 min. The SDS-lysed mitochondria were diluted 20-fold with a Triton X-100-containing buffer (0.5% Triton-X-100, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF). Following centrifugation for 15 min at 30,000 × g (4 °C, Sigma, Rotor 12154), the supernatants were added to 90 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose bead suspension. The binding and elution of the Su e-His12 and cross-linked adducts was then performed, essentially as described above. Mitochondria (200 μg of protein) were lysed in 40 μl of digitonin buffer (1% (w/v) digitonin, 50 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol 1 mm PMSF) for 30 min on ice and subjected to a clarifying spin (30 min, 226,000 × g, TLA45 rotor, Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge). The supernatants were supplemented with 4 μl of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Serva Blue G in 500 mmaminocaproic acid) prior to electrophoresis. Samples were then analyzed by BN-PAGE using 5–10% polyacrylamide gradient gels, essentially as described previously (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar, 14Schägger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, Western blotting to nitrocellulose was performed, and protein complexes were detected by immunedecoration. The calibration standards used in the BN-PAGE are as follows: bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa), horse spleen apoferritin (443 kDa), and bovine serum albumin monomer (66 kDa). The dimeric and monomeric forms of the ATP synthase were detected by immunedecoration with F1 α-subunit-specific antisera. Isolated mitochondria (100 μg of protein) were resuspended in SH buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5) at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and cupric sulfate (CuSO4) cross-linking was performed essentially as previously described (15McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Google Scholar). CuSO4 was added at concentrations ranging from 0–10 μm, as indicated, and samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. Free sulfhydryl residues were then blocked by the addition of the cysteine-modifying reagentN-ethylmaleimide (10 mm), and excess Cu2+ was quenched following the addition of EDTA (10 mm). Samples were further incubated on ice for 15 min, and mitochondria then were re-isolated by centrifugation. Mitochondria were lysed with SDS-containing sample buffer containingN-ethylmaleimide and EDTA (both 10 mm) in the absence of the reductant β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were cooked at 95 °C for 3 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE using an SDS-urea acrylamide gel followed by Western blotting. Protein determinations and SDS-PAGE were performed according to published methods (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar, 17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The Western blot analysis and immunedecoration were performed using available Su e antisera raised against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of the Su e protein (7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar). The assembly state of the F1Fo-ATP synthase was analyzed in mitochondria isolated from both the su e and su gnull mutant yeast strains, together with those isolated from the isogenic wild type strain (Fig. 1A). Following solubilization with digitonin, mitochondrial protein complexes were resolved by BN-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Immunedecoration with an antibody specific for the F1 α-subunit demonstrated the presence of both dimeric and monomeric forms of the ATP synthase in wild type mitochondria as previously reported (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). In the su e null mutant mitochondria, the F1Fo-ATP synthase was resolved as a monomeric complex, with a notable absence of the dimeric form (Fig. 1A). In addition, free F1 complex was observed in the Δsu e mitochondria, reflecting the apparent instability of the monomeric F1Fo-ATP synthase in the absence of the Su e as previously reported (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). Analysis of the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex in the Δsu g null mutant mitochondria indicated that as in the Δsu e mutant, the majority of the complex was present in its monomeric and free F1 form. In contrast to the Δsu enull mutant, however, a small fraction of the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex was present as its dimeric form in mitochondria isolated from the Δsu g null mutant (Fig. 1A). We conclude therefore that the F1Fo-ATP synthase can form dimers in the absence of Su g, albeit with limited capacity. Western blots analysis of the mitochondria isolated from the su g null mutant demonstrated that the Su e protein was detectable in the Δsu g null mutant mitochondria, although strongly reduced relative to the wild type control mitochondria (Fig. 1B). Thus reduced ability of the ATP synthase to form dimers in the Δsu gmitochondria is most likely directly related to the reduced levels of Su e in these mitochondria (Fig. 1B). In addition the levels of Su k were strongly reduced, yet still detectable, in both the Δsu e and Δsu g mitochondria (Fig. 1B). Thus, although not essential for Su k, the presence of Su g and Su e appear to enhance the steady state levels of Su k. Thus taken together, we conclude that the Su e protein plays the central role in forming the F1Fo-ATP synthase dimer and that Su g protein plays an accessory role, which may involve a stabilization affect on the Su e protein. To facilitate the further characterization of Su e, we constructed a derivative of Su e, which contained an additional 12 histidine residues at the C terminus of the protein. Expression of the resulting histidine-tagged Su e, Su e-His12, was achieved by cloning the extended Su e open reading frame encoding Su e-His12 into a 2μ vector, Yep51, which contained a galactose-inducible GAL10 promoter. The Su e-His12 protein was expressed both in the wild type (WT + Su e-His12) andsu e null mutant, Δsu e, (Δsu e+Su e-His12), genetic backgrounds. Western blot analysis of mitochondria isolated from the WT + Su e-His12 and Δsu e+Su e-His12 strains confirmed the expression of the Su e-His12 derivative (Fig. 2A). Following the successful expression of Su e-His12, our initial experiments were aimed at demonstrating that the addition of the histidine tag to Su e did not functionally compromise the Su e protein. To do so, mitochondria were isolated from the Δsu e null mutant, the Δsu e+ Su e-His12strain, and the isogenic wild type background, and the steady state levels of the ATP synthase subunits Su g and Su k were analyzed. As previously described, the levels of Su g and Su k are significantly decreased in the absence of Su e, i.e. in the Δsu e mitochondria (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). The functionality of the expressed Su e-His12 was indicated from its ability to restore the levels of Su g and Su k in the Δsu e mitochondria (Fig. 2B). Functionality of the histidine-tagged Su e derivative was further tested by its ability to support the formation of the dimeric ATP synthase in the su e null mutant mitochondria (Fig. 2C). BN-PAGE analysis indicated the presence of the dimeric form of the F1Fo-ATP synthase in the Δsu e+Su e-His12 mitochondria. Furthermore, expression of the Su e-His12 protein appeared to support the stabilization of the F1Fo-ATP synthase by the noticeable lack of the free F1 sector in the Δsu e+Su e-His12 mitochondria, in contrast to the su e null mutant mitochondria and lacking the Su e-His12 protein (Fig. 2C). The functionality of the Su e-His12 derivative was further directly demonstrated by testing its ability to assemble together with other F1Fo-ATP synthase complex subunits. Su e-His12 was expressed in wild type yeast cells, and the mitochondria were isolated from these cells (WT + Su e-His12). Mitochondrial membrane proteins were solubilized with digitonin, a mild detergent known to maintain the assembled dimeric state of the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex. Following solubilization in this manner, Su e-His12 was affinity-purified via its histidine tag on a nickel-containing agarose matrix (Ni-NTA beads). Western blot analysis of the material bound to the Ni-NTA beads indicated that in addition to the Su e-His12 protein both wild type Su e and the α subunit of the F1 sector (F1 α) had been co-purified. The co-purification of F1 α and Su e on the Ni-NTA beads was dependent on the presence of the Su e-His12 protein as they were not observed bound to the Ni-NTA beads, following their solubilization from wild type mitochondria, which did not harbor the Su e-His12 protein (Fig. 3). In conclusion, these data confirm the ability of the Su e-His12 to assemble into the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex. Most importantly, the co-purification of the wild type Su e protein with the histidine-tagged derivative indicates that the F1Fo complex containing the Su e-His12 protein must contain at least one additional Su e subunit. Indeed, preliminary stoichiometric analysis of the subunit composition of the dimeric F1Fo-ATP synthase had suggested two Su e protein subunits/dimeric synthase (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). As previously mentioned the Su e proteins contain a conserved predicted coiled-coil motif, often the basis for homodimerization events. This, together with the observation that the Su e-His12-purified F1Fo-ATP synthase complex contains more than one subunit of the Su e protein, led us to test the ability of Su e to form homodimers. We initially tested the ability of Su e (11 kDa) to be cross-linked to another protein of the same size. To do so, mitochondria were subjected to chemical cross-linking using DTNB, Ellman's reagent, a sulfhydryl-specific, reductant cleavable cross-linking reagent. Yeast Su e contains a single Cys residue (Cys-28), which according to hydropathy plots, is located proximal to the C-terminal end of the single transmembrane region of Su e,i.e. at the intermembrane space-side of the inner membrane. Following cross-linking, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the absence of a reducing agent and then by Western blotting. Using the Su e-specific antibody, Su e and resulting cross-linked adducts were identified (Fig. 4A). When cross-linking was performed in wild type mitochondria, a Su e cross-linked adduct of approximately 22 kDa, the predicted size for a Su e-Su e homodimer was observed. Cross-linking in Δsu e+Su e-His12 mitochondria, resulted in the production of a 26-kDa adduct, a size in agreement for a Su e-His12-Su e-His12 homodimer. Finally, cross-linking of Su e in the wild type mitochondria harboring also the Su e-His12protein (WT+ Su e-His12) resulted in a mixed population of Su e-specific adducts of 22, 24 and 26 kDa in molecular mass (Fig. 4A). From their predicted sizes, we postulate these three adducts to correspond to Su e-Su e, Su e-Su e-His12, and Su e-His12-Su e-His12 homodimers, respectively. To confirm directly that Su e does indeed form homodimers, wild type mitochondria harboring the Su e-His12 protein were subjected to cross-linking with DTNB. Following cross-linking, the mitochondrial membranes were solubilized with the denaturing detergent SDS to disrupt any non-cross-linked complexes, and the Su e-His12 protein and cross-linked partners were affinity-purified on Ni-NTA-agarose beads. Affinity-purified Su e and the cross-linked proteins were then incubated with the reductant β-mercaptoethanol to cleave the chemical cross-linker and were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunedecoration with Su e-specific antisera indicated that authentic Su e, in addition to the Su e-His12 derivative, was bound to the Ni-NTA beads. Su e was not recovered on the Ni-NTA beads if the cross-linking with DTNB was performed in wild type mitochondria, which did not contain the Su e-His12 derivative (Fig. 4B). Thus co-purification of the authentic Su e with the Ni-NTA beads under these denaturing conditions was dependent on the presence of the Su e-His12 derivative. Furthermore, recovery of Su e on the Ni-NTA beads following SDS solubilization of the WT+ Su e-His12 mitochondria was not observed when the prior cross-linking step was omitted (results not shown). We conclude therefore that Su e can dimerize with the Su e-His12derivative, thus directly demonstrating the formation of Su e-homodimers in the mitochondrial membrane. In addition we have used a second independent cross-linking approach, using Cu2+ ions (15McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Google Scholar), to gain further evidence that the Cys residue from one Su e protein is in close physical proximity to the Cys residue of the neighboring Su e protein. In the presence of added Cu2+ ions, cross-linking of Su e to an adduct of 22 kDa was observed (Fig. 5). A low level of this Su e-specific 22-kDa adduct was also observed in the absence of added Cu2+. Presumably the endogenous divalent cation level (no EDTA was present) may have supported the formation of this adduct. The mobility of the Su e-Cu2+ cross-linked adduct was similar to that of the Su e-Su e homodimer, which had been cross-linked with DTNB. Taken together with the DTNB cross-linking data, we conclude therefore that the Su e forms homodimers, which are arranged in such a manner that the single Cys residue present in Su e is in close proximity to the Cys residue of the interacting Su e molecule. The F1Fo-ATP synthase forms dimeric complexes in the mitochondrial membrane (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar, 7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar). Evidence that these F1Fo-ATP synthase dimers further assemble together to form a larger network of F1Focomplexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane was recently presented (5Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Google Scholar). Our current data indicates that the initial ATP synthase dimerization event is supported through a physical interaction of neighboring Fo sectors. We have recently demonstrated that dimerization of the F1Fo-ATP synthase in intact mitochondria does not involve the natural inhibitor protein, Inh1, which was recently shown to bind to and promote dimerization of purified F1 sectors in solution (18Dienhart M. Pfeiffer K. Schägger H. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39289-39295Google Scholar, 19Çabezon E. Butler P.J. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25460-25464Google Scholar, 20Çabezon E. Arechaga I. Jonathan P. Butler G. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28353-28355Google Scholar). Rather, our data indicate that subunits e and g, Su e and Su g, are required for efficient ATP synthase dimer formation. In the absence of Su e, no dimer was observed and the F1Fo-ATP synthase was present exclusively in its monomeric form. In contrast, in the Δsu g mutant mitochondria, although strongly reduced in levels, a small percentage of F1Fo complexes were present as dimers. The levels of Su e are strongly reduced (yet still detectable) in the Δsu g mitochondria, thus indicating that Su g is involved in the stability of the Su e protein. We propose that Su e plays a central role in the formation of the dimeric F1Fo-ATP synthase and that Su g plays a supporting role and one that involves stabilization of the Su e protein. Su e family members contain a conserved coiled-coil motif in their hydrophilic region, just C-terminal to their transmembrane-spanning segments (7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar). As coiled-coil motifs are often the basis for protein-protein interactions, in particular homodimerization events, we proposed that the Su e mediated dimerization of the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex involved the formation of Su e-Su e homodimers (4Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence for the presence of the Su e-Su e homodimers was reported earlier as the bovine Su e protein could be cross-linked to another protein of a molecular mass similar to that of Su e itself (10Belogrudov G.I. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20340-20345Google Scholar). Here, we have extended that initial observation and, using a chemical cross-linking approach combined with affinity purification, we have directly demonstrated the formation of Su e-Su e homodimers in the yeast mitochondrial membrane. We have expressed a histidine-tagged Su e derivative, Su e-His12, in both wild type and Δsu emitochondria. The functionality of this Su e-His12derivative was shown 3-fold: (i) by its ability to restore steady-state levels of Su g and Su k when expressed in the Δsu e yeast strain; (ii) by its ability to assemble and co-purify with the F1Fo-ATP synthase complex; and finally, (iii) by its ability to support the dimerization of the ATP synthase in the Δsu e mitochondria. When expressed in wild type cells, Su e-His12 directly assembles and homodimerizes with the authentic Su e protein. Dimerization of Su e-His12 with Su e was directly demonstrated by chemical cross-linking followed by their co-purification on Ni-NTA agarose. What is the molecular basis for the Su e-Su e homodimerization? The dimerization of the F1Fo-ATP synthase is a conserved feature between the mitochondrial F1Fo-ATP synthase complexes, and hence it is most likely to be supported by a conserved feature of the Su e protein family. For this reason, we consider it unlikely the Su e-Su e interaction is mediated by the extreme C-terminal region of Su e (the last approximately 30 amino acid residues). This C-terminal region (residues 70–96) of the protein is unique to the yeast Su e homolog (7Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cross-linking of Su e proteins with Cu2+ ions or with DTNB indicates that the unique Cys residue in Su e is in close proximity to the Cys of the associated Su e protein. As the Cys residue is located immediately after the transmembrane-spanning segment and at the interface with the coiled-coil region, it implies that these regions of the Su e polypeptide must be physically close in the Su e dimer. As mentioned previously, the predicted coiled-coil motif is a conserved feature between Su e protein family members. It is therefore highly possible that this region plays an important role in Su e function. Taking this together with the known involvement of coiled-coil regions in protein homodimerization events, it is possible that the Su e homodimerization involves coiled-coil interactions between neighboring Su e proteins. Alternatively, it is possible that the Su e homodimerization process involves helix-helix interactions between the transmembrane helices of interacting Su e subunits. Indeed a conserved GXXXG (G for glycine and X for any amino acid residue) motif has been described to be a frequently occurring sequence of residues that favor helix-helix interactions of transmembrane segments of dimerizing membrane proteins (21Kleiger G. Grothe R. Mallick P. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5990-5997Google Scholar, 22Senes A. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9056-9061Google Scholar, 23Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Google Scholar). Interestingly, a GXXXG motif is found in the transmembrane segment of the yeast Su e protein. The possible importance of this GXXXG motif in Su e-Su e homodimerization events is further suggested by the fact that the GXXXG motif is conserved between the transmembrane regions of the other Su e family members also. Thus taken together, it is plausible that the coiled-coil motif and/or the GXXXG motif in the transmembrane-spanning segment, rather than the extreme C-terminal region of Su e, play a direct role in the homodimerization of Su e. Experiments designed to test these possibilities are currently ongoing in our laboratory.

Sci. 1995; 348: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In mutant proteins, or when the temperature is raised above the physiological optimum, some domains in labile proteins may loose their structure and seek alternatively stable structures, whereas other more compact domains may still retain their original native-like conformation (1Fink A.L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In general, stable aggregates lack enzymatic activity, expose more hydrophobic residues, have a higher β-sheet content, and adopt high oligomeric, less soluble quaternary structures (1Fink A.L.

Some aggregates display an amorphous organization, whereas others, such as amyloid plaques, form compact fibrils reaching highly ordered semi-crystalline structures (5Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Protein aggregates that accumulate under heat-stress in vitro, in bacteria, or in yeast can be actively resolubilized by a specific network of ATP-hydrolyzing chaperones and co-chaperones: Hsp100 (ClpB) and Hsp70/Hsp40/Bag1 (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE)(Escherichia coli chaperones in parentheses) (9Glover J.R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The disaggregation mechanism involves a sequential action, first of ClpB modifying the surface of large compact aggregates thus increasing DnaK affinity, and second, of DnaK binding and unfolding entangled polypeptides, which accelerates cis-trans isomerizations in secondary amide bonds of refolding polypeptides (12Ben-Zvi A.P.

The efficiency of chaperone-mediated disaggregation strongly depends on the nature of the protein, on the aggregate size, and its solubility (4Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol.

Disaggregating chaperones were used here as a tool to address the nature of homo- or heterogeneous protein aggregates, using three model proteins: glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 1The abbreviations used are: G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; KJE, DnaK+DnaJ+GrpE; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Confirmed by sedimentation, chaperones revealed that non-pathogenic proteins can produce different forms of heat-induced aggregates. Aggregates from one protein can associate with and accelerate the aggregation of another protein, a proteinaceous infectious behavior, which can be prevented and cured by molecular chaperones. Protein purification was according to published procedures: DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, (14Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Malate dehydrogenase from pig heart mitochondria was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay with BSA as a standard. Protein concentrations were expressed in protomers. Aggregates were formed by heat inactivation of the native proteins for 15 min, unless specified otherwise, and at the indicated temperature (52–75 °C) in folding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mmKCl, 20 mm MgAc, 10 mm dithiothreitol). Unless indicated otherwise, aggregation was preformed with 1 μm protein. Stable aggregates of MDH, G6PDH, and BSA were combined before, during, or after the heat treatment, as indicated. Fractionation of insoluble/soluble aggregates was preformed either by a 20-min centrifugation at 15,800 × g in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge (5417R), or by a 10-min centrifugation at various velocities (up to 365,000 × g) in a Beckman ultracentrifuge using a TLA-100.2 fixed angle rotor. Precipitated MDH, G6PDH, or BSA was solubilized in 5 m urea and SDS-sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol and 10% SDS. Following 3 min of incubation at 80 °C, samples were loaded and resolved by electrophoresis on a linear 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The amount of precipitated and soluble protein was measured from the intensity of Coomassie Blue-stained bands using the NIH gel-plotting program. Amounts were normalized to maximal precipitation values obtained at 75 °C (15 min) or to the amount of native protein. Chaperone-mediated reactivation was carried out in folding buffer at 25 °C in the presence of an ATP regeneration system (4 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 20 ng/ml pyruvate kinase). Unless specified otherwise, chaperone concentrations were 2 μm DnaK, 0.4 μm DnaJ, 0.2 μm GrpE (KJE), and 2 μm ClpB for the MDH reactivation assays and 0.5 μm ClpB for the G6PDH reactivation assays. Reactivation was initiated by addition of 2 mm ATP and followed using spectroscopic enzymatic assays for MDH and G6PDH (10Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Ben-Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 17Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9688-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Maximal rates of protein refolding were derived from the linear phase of the time curves. The various forms of aggregated G6PDH were incubated in folding buffer with 25 μm of bis-ANS (Molecular Probes). Bis-ANS fluorescence of G6PDH was measured with an excitation at 397 nm and emission at 496 nm in a PerkinElmer spectrometer LS50B. A central question about protein aggregation is whether single polypeptide chains form one or several types of protein aggregates during and following stress-induced denaturation. To address this question, different aggregates from a single enzyme, G6PDH, were generated by a 15-min exposure to various high temperatures (52−75 °C). When denatured at 62 °C, G6PDH was rapidly inactivated at a rate of 0.045 s−1 (Fig. 1 A). After 15 min, large insoluble aggregates were formed (Fig.1 B), half of which (EC50) required 3,000 ×g to be precipitated (Fig. 1 C). When denatured at 52 °C, G6PDH was inactivated 10 times more slowly, and it formed inactive more soluble aggregates, half of which required as much as 175,000 × g to be precipitated (Fig.1 C). Using disaggregating chaperones, we then compared the refoldability at 25 °C of each type of aggregate. In the presence of a limiting amount of chaperones and ATP, the more soluble aggregates generated at 52 °C were reactivated four times faster than the less soluble aggregates generated at 62 °C (Fig. 1 D). The later were, however, fully reactivated following longer incubations or in the presence of excess chaperones (see below), demonstrating the lack of irreversible lesions in the 62 °C-treated protein. Differences between various types of G6PDH aggregates were also observed using a hydrophobic fluorescent probe, Bis-ANS. The higher the temperature at which aggregates were pre-formed (and the lower was their solubility), the higher was their resistance to disaggregating chaperones after the stress (Fig. 1, E and F). Noticeably, chaperone-resistance increased with the apparent hydrophobic exposure of the aggregates (Fig. 1 E,inset). Because DnaK binding primarily depends on exposed hydrophobic segments in misfolded proteins (18Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), this suggests that disaggregation activity of ClpB in particular depends on other properties of the aggregates. The presence of misfolded proteins has been suggested to initiate and sustain aggregation of other stress-induced unfolding intermediates (19Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). We therefore next addressed protein aggregation in a more physiological context, where several proteins co-exist and may co-aggregate. MDH is more thermolabile than G6PDH. Within 6 min at 52 °C, over 90% became insoluble at 15,800 × g (Fig.2 A) compared with 15% insoluble G6PDH (Fig. 1 A). The effect of a rapidly aggregating MDH species on the aggregation kinetics of an otherwise slow-aggregating soluble G6PDH species (Fig. 2 A) was addressed at 52 °C. The presence of equimolar amounts of MDH did not affect the rate of G6PDH inactivation but, remarkably, strongly decreased the solubility of G6PDH aggregates (Fig. 2 B). The presence of five times less MDH molecules than G6PDH reduced the G6PDH precipitation values (EC50) from 171,000 ×g to 15,000 × g (Fig. 2 C). This effect was not observed when MDH was pre-aggregated and added to G6PDH after the stress (Fig. 3 A). At various centrifugation velocities, the distribution of G6PDH aggregates co-aggregated with MDH revealed a sharp decrease of solubility, by half for the largest aggregates and up to 80% for the smallest aggregates (Fig. 2 C). Thus, all sizes of G6PDH aggregates were affected by the presence of MDH.Figure 3Seeding and propagation of aggregation in different proteins. A, dose-dependent effect of MDH on the precipitation and chaperone recoverability of G6PDH aggregates. G6PDH (1 μm) and MDH were treated at 52 °C together (triangles) or separately and mixed after heat treatment (circles).

Whereas only 100 ×g sufficed to precipitate half the MDH aggregates alone, 4,000 × g were necessary to precipitate the same amount of co-aggregated MDH in the presence of a 5-fold excess of more soluble G6PDH aggregates (Fig. 2 C). This apparent solubilization effect independently demonstrates that stable MDH-G6PDH hetero-oligomers did form during co-aggregation. Remarkably, alongside with acceleration of aggregation kinetics, chaperone-mediated disaggregation was also impaired in hetero-aggregates. Hence, when MDH and G6PDH in equimolar amounts were co-aggregated, the rates of chaperone-mediated reactivation was eight times slower for MDH-G6PDH hetero-aggregates than for G6PDH homo-aggregates formed at the same temperature (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, when in a control experiment, preformed MDH and G6PDH homo-aggregates were mixed after heat treatment, the original solubility and chaperone-recoverability of either protein remained unaffected (Fig. 3 A). Hence, compared with homologous aggregation, heterologous aggregation affects both solubility and chaperone recoverability. To determine the nature of the interactions between two proteins, leading to decreased solubility and chaperone recoverability, a dose-response of G6PDH precipitation and chaperone recoverability was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of MDH. Unexpected from one-to-one hetero-aggregates, sub-stoichiometric amounts of MDH fully sufficed to carry both effects. As little as one 30-kDa MDH molecule sufficed to accelerate the precipitation and inhibit chaperone recovery of 4–5 60-kDa G6PDH molecules (Figs. 2 C and 3 A). In a reciprocal experiment, the presence of sub-stoichiometric amounts of G6PDH seeds (pre-aggregated at 52 °C) affected the MDH solubility and chaperone recoverability during and following a mild denaturation at 43 °C (Fig. 3 B). Induced MDH precipitation was confirmed using pre-aggregated seeds from a totally different protein, BSA, which is widely used as a stabilizing agent for labile proteins in vitro. Whereas at 56 °C, native BSA expectedly reduced the rate of MDH inactivation and aggregation (not shown), the presence of BSA in the aggregation rendered MDH aggregates significantly more resistant to disaggregating chaperones after the stress (Fig. 3 C). It is concluded that the ability of aggregates from one protein to influence, and even propagate, aggregation of another protein is a general property shared by many proteins, unrelated to amyloidogenic and prion proteins. Most chaperones can bind partially unfolded intermediates or small aggregates and thus prevent the formation of larger aggregates during stress. Hence, the role of binding chaperones on seed-induced MDH aggregation was addressed. The presence of DnaK (in binding-only mode without ATP) or the small heat shock protein IbpB efficiently inhibited seed-induced precipitation of MDH during mild denaturation at 43 °C (Fig.4 A). As previously shown in Fig. 3 B, the MDH solubility with a 0.5 μmG6PDH seed, but without chaperones, was ∼30% (∼70% precipitation). Yet, the non-catalytic binding effect of equimolar DnaK, or of IbpB chaperones on MDH solubility in the presence a G6PDH seed, was increased to 60 and 47%, respectively (Fig. 4 A). A mild increase was also observed in the solubility of the G6PDH seed (not shown). It can be concluded that potential cascade interprecipitation events among different proteins may be prevented by binding chaperones capable of sequestering seeds and aggregation substrates. During a prolonged stress, the binding capacity of the chaperone network may be overwhelmed (20Lorimer G.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The effect of active disaggregation by ClpB and KJE was therefore tested on the outcome of seed-induced aggregation. G6PDH treated at 52 °C in the presence of MDH seeds (as in Fig. 3 A), was refolded after the stress by limiting amounts of chaperones at a slower rate than G6PDH treated alone at the same temperature but at a faster rate than G6PDH treated alone at a higher temperature, 62 °C (Fig. 4 B). As expected from the higher oligomeric state of seeded aggregates (Fig.2 C), a ClpB dose-response on refolding rates revealed that ClpB has a lower apparent affinity (EC50 0.15) for seeded G6PDH, than for G6PDH alone (EC50 0.09) (at 52 °C). The recovery of G6PDH prepared at 62 °C depended even more on ClpB (EC50 0.22), indicating that cross-seeding can mimic the damaging effects of higher temperatures and generally increase the requirement by aggregating proteins for molecular chaperones. Depending on cellular and environmental conditions, active flexible proteins may populate a number of very similar native structures (21Luque I. Leavitt S.A. Freire E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Aggregated proteins are often more rigid, less soluble, and tend to assemble into a wide continuum of dissimilar high oligomeric structures. Hence, non-pathogenic proteins that normally form amorphous aggregates can be induced to form highly structured amyloid-like fibrils (reviewed in Ref. 22Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar), suggesting that unfolding conditions dictate individual polypeptides to adopt distinct, highly variable aggregated structures (3Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Minert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Here, molecular chaperones and differential centrifugation were used to address the degree of structural variation in different populations of homo-aggregates from non-pathogenic proteins. Depending on the denaturing conditions, proteins reproducibly formed very different aggregates, from small soluble chaperone-sensitive amorphous aggregates to more compact insoluble, chaperone-resistant aggregates. This is reminiscent of the PrPC protein, which in mammals forms different strains of PrPSC, with distinct sensitivities to proteolytic enzymes, specific rates of infectivity, and different locations in the brain (23Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that prions are not an exception. Some cohesive aggregates have been suggested to derive from specific domain-swapping interactions (24Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), implying that aggregation can take place only among identical or very similar polypeptides. Dissimilar co-aggregating polypeptides should therefore not interact with each other or inhibit, rather than accelerate, each other's aggregations (26Uversky V.N. Li J. Souillac P. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Jakes R. Goedert M. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11970-11978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Indeed, P22 tail spikes and coat proteins do not form hetero-aggregates (27Betts S. King J. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R131-R139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, here we show that cross-interactions between dissimilar co-aggregating proteins do take place and that they interfere with each other's kinetics of aggregation and chaperone-recoverability. This is confirmed in vivo, whereby heterologous aggregation between huntingtin and p53 has been observed in mammalian cells (28Steffan J.S. Kazantsev A. Spasic-Boskovic O. Greenwald M. Zhu Y.Z. Gohler H. Wanker E.E. Bates G.P. Housman D.E. Thompson L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, expression of a spontaneously aggregating protein containing 82 poly-glutamine repeats (Q82), increased cytotoxicity, and sequestrated otherwise soluble proteins with shorter poly-glutamine repeats (Q19 and HRP1) (29Satyal S.H. Schmidt E. Kitagawa K. Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Similarly, the spontaneous aggregation of the yeast prion [PIN(+)] induces the conversion of a number of soluble yeast proteins into different types of prions, suggesting a general mechanism of induced heterologous prion aggregation (30Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). One major implication of hetero-aggregation is that high cohesiveness in aggregates may not necessarily result from specific domain-swapping events but also from cooperative interactions between low-specificity sites, such as small hydrophobic patches and polar zippers on the surface of newly formed β-sheets (1Fink A.L. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R9-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 31Perutz M.F. Johnson T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5355-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Moreover, the intra-molecular rearrangement observed in the secondary structures of prionogenic, amyloidogenic, and common heat-induced aggregates are inconsistent with the high degree of structural preservation required for precise domain swapping (1Fink A.L. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R9-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Sub-stoichiometric amounts of one fast co-aggregating protein can significantly increase aggregation kinetics, oligomeric states, and chaperone-resistance properties of an otherwise soluble, slow-aggregating protein. This suggests that a conformational change, initially induced by heterologous MDH-G6PDH interactions, is further propagated to other G6PDH aggregates, without necessarily involving direct contacts with the initial MDH seed. This proteinaceous infectious behavior is similar to that of yeast prions, whereby a minority of one type of prion affects the onset and propagation kinetics of other yeast prions (30Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We show here that non-pathogenic proteins may also generate under stress proteinaceous infectious aggregates. Structurally fluid small aggregates formed by acid precipitation of non-pathogenic proteins are more toxic to mammalian cells than larger more stable amyloids (32Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). Likewise, prion seeding is more efficient when initiated with structurally fluid small oligomeric sup35 complexes, than with large “mature” particles (33Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that small soluble G6PDH aggregates formed at 52 °C were more efficient seeds than insoluble large aggregates formed at 62 °C (not shown). Hence, proteinaceous infectious behavior in non-pathogenic proteins may reach an optimum during the early phases of stress-denaturation in a mechanism that does not fundamentally differ from the “nucleation polymerization” model suggested for prion propagation (33Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 34Borchsenius A.S. Wegrzyn R.D. Newnam G.P. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Chernoff Y.O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6683-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In stressed cells, many sensitive proteins may alternate between native and partially unfolded states, which, depending on the conditions and the presence of seeds, may choose to aggregate or revert to the native state. We showed here that the stability of one protein may depend on the stability and aggregation-propensity of other unrelated proteins in the same cellular compartment, implying a new, unsuspected network of protein-protein interactions in the cell. Yet molecular chaperones can control such interactions by sequestering active seeds and aggregation-prone intermediates. Neutralization of catalytic-seeds is likely to be more powerful than direct prevention-of-aggregation of intermediates, the later depending on limited non-catalytic one-to-one interactions with the chaperones. During prolonged stresses, once unfolding intermediates exceed the binding capacity of cellular chaperones, aggregation may prevail and disaggregating chaperones become essential to remove toxic seeds and intermediates. The involvement of molecular chaperones in aggregate detoxification has been demonstrated in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Over-expression of Hsp100 and/or Hsp70 dissolves stress-induced aggregates in E. coli (11Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rudiger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 35Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 36Sakahira H. Breuer P. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) as well as polyglutamine-rich aggregates in yeast and animals (reviewed in Ref, 36). Moreover, cascade aggregations are observed when the expression of Hsp networks is low, such as during apoptosis (37Garrido C. Gurbuxani S. Ravagnan L. Kroemer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) or aging (38Soti C. Csermely P. Biogerontology. 2000; 1: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our in vitro results demonstrate that as expected from seed-induced increase in aggregate size, the dependence on ClpB for efficient disaggregation increases. It is therefore important, especially for mammalian cells devoid of ClpB-like chaperones, to maintain aggregates small enough for effective scavenging by the Hsp70 chaperone system alone (12Ben-Zvi A.P.

Our results suggest that a network of molecular chaperones can play the role of an intracellular defense mechanism against protein pathogens. It can specifically recognize infectious particles, such as proteinaceous infectious seeds, and prevent their propagation among other proteins in the cell by passive sequestration or active disruption of the infectious agent. Moreover, we show that properties initially assigned to prions, such as multiple strains, infectivity, compactness, and resistance to chaperones, are also shared by regular proteins lacking polyglutamine motives, or associated pathologies. Yet mutant, amyloidogenic, and prion proteins may distinguish themselves from the other proteins in the cell by their ability to undergo conformational rearrangements at or around physiological conditions (40Leclerc E.

It is moreover possible that mutant, poly-glutamine rich, amyloidogenic, and prionigenic proteins form more compact aggregates that naturally resist the chaperone and protease networks and consequently evolve detectable pathological aggregates during the lifetime of a given organism. Our results imply that environmental stresses may strongly influence the ability of cells to counteract the early onset pathologic protein aggregations."

RGSZ1, one of the RGS proteins specifically localized to the brain, has been cloned previously and described as a selective GTPase accelerating protein for Gαz subunit. Here, we employed several methods to provide new evidence that RGSZ1 interacts not only with Gαz, but also with Gαi, as supported byin vitro binding assays and functional studies. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pull-down assays, glutathione S-transferase-RGSZ1 protein was shown to bind35S-labeled Gαi1 protein in anAlF AlF4− dependent manner. The interaction between RGSZ1 and Gαi was confirmed further by co-immunoprecipitation studies and yeast two-hybrid experiments using a quantitative luciferase reporter gene. Extending these observations to functional studies, RGSZ1 accelerated endogenous GTPase activity of Gαi1 in single-turnover GTPase assays. Human RGSZ1 functionally regulated GPA1 (a yeast Gαi-like protein)-mediated yeast pheromone response when expressed in a SST2 (yeast RGS protein) knockout strain. In PC12 cells, transfected RGSZ1 blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase activity induced by UK14304, an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Furthermore, RGSZ1 attenuated D2 dopamine receptor agonist-induced serum response element reporter gene activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In summary, these data suggest that RGSZ1 serves as a GTPase accelerating protein for Gαi and regulates Gαi-mediated signaling, thus expanding the potential role of RGSZ1 in G protein-mediated cellular activities.

The functional activity of G protein α subunit is critically governed by the rates of GDP/GTP exchange stimulated by the receptor activation, and the intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyzes the GTP to GDP. However, the in vitro measured intrinsic GTPase activity of G protein α subunits is too slow to account for the rapid signal termination that occurs in vivo. A new family of proteins, regulators of G protein signaling (RGS), have been identified to accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα subunits and mechanistically impact the kinetics of G protein physiological function (6Koelle M.R.

The RGS domain-containing proteins dramatically enhance the endogenous GTPase activity of Gα subunits by binding to and stabilizing the flexible switch regions of Gα to resemble that of the transition state, thereby lowering the activation energy barrier of the hydrolysis reaction (13Berman D.M.

Similarly, GAIP displays GAP activity toward both Gαi and Gαq (25Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Google Scholar, 26Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl.

Both isoforms of RGS3 possess GAP activity for Gαi and Gαq, and regulate signaling through both Gαi- and Gαq-linked signaling pathways (28Scheschonka A. Dessauer C.W. Sinnarahjah S. Chidiac P. Shi C.-S. Kehrl J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 719-728Google Scholar). An increasing number of RGS proteins have been shown to exhibit relative selectivity toward specific Gα subunits. RGS6 and RGS7 are selective for Gαo relative to other Gαi family members (29Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Google Scholar), whereas p115RhoGEF is a specific GAP for the Gα12 and Gα13 family (30Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Google Scholar, 31Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Google Scholar). RGS2 shows more potent inhibition of Gαq-coupled signaling than Gαi signaling in vivo andin vitro (32Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L. Linder M.E. Hepler J.R. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34253-34259Google Scholar). RGSZ1 was independently identified by two groups as a specific GAP protein of Gαz. Wang et al. (33Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Google Scholar, 46Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Google Scholar) directly purified the RGSZ1 protein from bovine brain tissue lysate by its GAP activity toward Gαz, whereas Glick et al. (34Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Google Scholar) identified the RGSZ1 using Gαz Q205L mutant as “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain library. The sequence of the hRGSZ1 protein is 83% identical to a bovine RET-RGS1 and 56% identical to hGAIP. RGSZ1 is exclusively expressed in brain, with the highest concentrations in the caudate nucleus and the temporal lobe, implying that RGSZ1 may play a role in regulating signals in these brain regions. RGSZ1 was reported to show high selectivity for Gαz in an in vitro GTPase assay, exhibiting at least 20–100-fold selectivity for Gαz over other Gαi family members and no GAP activities for Gαq and Gαs (33Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Google Scholar). To date, however, RGSZ1 functional studies have largely relied on in vitro GTPase assays. The precise physiological function of RGSZ1, especially with regard to its role in cell signaling, is still not clear. To further understand the function of RGSZ1, we employed several methods to investigate the physical and functional interactions of RGSZ1 with other Gαi family members. We found that RGSZ1 protein bound to Gαi1 protein, as well as Gαz protein, in an AlF4−-dependent manner. Also, RGSZ1 accelerated the endogenous GTPase activity of Gαi1 in single-turnover GTPase assays. The interaction between RGSZ1 and Gαi was further confirmed by yeast two-hybrid experiments. Studies using intact cells showed that hRGSZ1 functionally regulated the yeast G protein (GPA1, Gαi-like)-mediated pheromone response. Furthermore, RGSZ1 attenuated D2 dopamine receptor agonist-induced serum response element (SRE) reporter gene activity in CHO cells and also blocked MAP kinase activity induced by a α2-adrenergic receptor agonist in PC12 cells. In summary, these data suggest that RGSZ1 may GAP Gαi and regulate Gαi-mediated cell signaling. cDNAs for hRGSZ1, hRGS4, and hGAIP were amplified from a human brain cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR using oligonucleotides based on published sequences (21Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Google Scholar, 33Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Google Scholar, 34Glick J.L.

The PCR products were cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), pQE-60 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and pcDNA3(+) vectors (Invitrogen). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The GST-RGSZ1 and GST-RGS4 fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli using a B-PERTMGST fusion protein purification kit (Pierce). The RGSZ1-His6 protein was purified from E. coli via a nickel-nitrilotriacetic resin-based chromatography. The RGS4 core domain peptide (166 amino acids) and Gαi1-His6 protein were purified as described previously (36Moy F.J. Chanda P.K. Cockett M.I. Edris W. Jones P.G. Mason K. Semus S. Powers R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7063-7073Google Scholar). A RGS7 core domain (residues 330–448) was a gift from Dr. Philip Jones (Wyeth, Princeton, NJ). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against hRGSZ1 was generated using the N-terminal 16 amino acids as immunogen. Mouse monoclonal antibody against Gαi1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The GTPase activity of Gαi1protein was measured by monitoring free γ-Pi release from bound GTP as described previously (25Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μmGαi1 protein was incubated with 1 μm[γ-32P]GTP in a buffer containing 10 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 2 μm GTP, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Lubrol, at 30 °C for 30 min. The [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Gαi1 was separated from unbound [γ-32P]GTP by passing through a gel filtration column (Princeton Separations), and diluted to 200 nm with ice-cold assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μm GTP, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Lubrol, pH 7.5). The Gαi1 GTPase was initiated by adding 10 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm GTP, with or without RGS protein. The reaction was stopped by adding 5% Norit activated charcoal in 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 3.0). Following a centrifugation, the supernatant containing free32Pi was counted. All assays were performed at 0 or 15 °C. All recombinant RGS and Gαi1 proteins used here were expressed and purified from E. coli (>90% purity). Approximately 65% of the Gαi1 protein bound to GTPγS in a standard binding assay. The observed rate constants (Kobs) for each were calculated using GraphPad Prism2 program based on a one-phase exponential association equationY = Ymax[1 − exp(−KX)]. The GST-RGSZ1 fusion protein was prepared using the pGEX-4T-1 vector and E. coli strain JM109. [35S]Gαi1 and [35S]Gαz were generated by an in vitro TnT T7-coupled transcription/translation system as description by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). 5 μg of GST-RGSZ1 was attached to glutathionine-agarose beads (50 μl of 50% beads) and incubated with 2 μl of 35S-labeled Gα subunits in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm GDP, 1 mmDTT, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.05% Lubrol, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin) for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffer and then re-suspended in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Labeled proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. CHO-K1 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded in 100-mm diameter dishes (3 × 106 cells/well) the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with RGSZ1 and Gαi1 plasmids or with empty pcDNA3 (+) vector using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM(Invitrogen). All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were harvested 40–48 h thereafter in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 2% Triton X-100, and then incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking. The unsolubilized fractions were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was diluted with the lysis buffer without detergent to reach a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100. The supernatant was pre-cleared with nonimmune rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Then a polyclonal antibody against RGSZ1 (1 μg/ml, final) and 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a monoclonal antibody against Gαi1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) using standard Western blotting procedure with ECL chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). Human RGSZ1 was subcloned into theNcoI/BamHI sites of pACT2 vector (Clontech) to generate a Gal4 DNA activation domain (AD) fusion protein. Human Gαi1, Gαi1Q204L mutant, Gαi2, and Gαi3 were subcloned individually into EcoRI and PstI sites of pGBKT7 vector (Clontech) to generate GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD)fusion proteins. A Gal-luciferase reporter (Kp126) was generated by cloning the firefly luciferase gene into theBamHI and SalI sites of pEK1 vector (66Ozenberger B.A. Young K.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9 (32): 1321-1329Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Yeast strains were generated by co-transformation of plasmids into CY770 (66Ozenberger B.A. Young K.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9 (32): 1321-1329Google Scholar) using the lithium acetate method and growth on selective medium. For each strain, 30 colonies were mixed in liquid medium (−Trp−Leu−Ura) and grown overnight at 30 °C with continuous shaking. Yeast cells were diluted to an A600 of 0.15 and then grown for 3 h at 30 °C. The luciferase reporter gene activity was determined using a LucLiteTM kit (Packard, Meriden, CT) and a luminescence counter (Packard) in a single photon counting mode. The cDNAs of hRGSZ1, hRGS2, and SST2 were cloned into theBamHI/ClaI sites of p426TEF vector (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The yeast SST2 knock-out strain (KY113) was transformed with the plasmid encoding RGS2, RGSZ1, or SST2, and grown in selective media. Transformants were selected, cultured using standard conditions, diluted to 0.5 of A600 in 5 ml to produce a lawn of cells. Plates were dried for 2 h at 30 °C, and then α factor was spotted on the surface of the agar plate in a series of dilutions (1, 10, 100, and 1000 μm), and incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. PC12 cell lines stably expressing eGFP or eGFP-RGSZ1 were selected and cultured in DMEM containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml G418. The p44/42 MAPK activity was measured using a MAP kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Briefly, cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and then treated with UK14304 (Sigma) for 5 min. Thereafter cells were immediately transferred on ice and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested using a cell lysis buffer from the kit plus 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. MAPK activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instruction. CHO-K1 cells stably expressing D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) were maintained in six-well plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml mycophenolic acid, 0.25 mg/ml xanthine, and HT supplement. Cells were transfected with cis-reporter plasmid pSRE-luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contains a SRE-dependent luciferase gene, lacZgene, and RGSZ1 plasmids. Cells were then starved in serum-free medium overnight and treated for 5 h with 10 μm quinpirole, an agonist of D2R. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using the dual reporter gene assay kit from Tropix (Bedford, MA). Measurements were performed with a luminometer, and luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities. RGS proteins bind to a specific conformational state of Gα subunits. RGS4 binds only to the transition state ( O2.¯-bound) of Gαi1 subunits (13Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Google Scholar), whereas RGS2 binds to both transition state and active (GTPγS-bound) form of Gαq (37Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Google Scholar). Both RGS4 and RGS2, however, do not bind to the GDP-bound form of Gα subunits. To determine the physical interaction between RGSZ1 and Gαi, a GST-RGSZ1 fusion protein was attached to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated individually with anin vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled Gαi1 wild type, GαiQ204L, GαiR178C or Gαz wild type, GαzQ205L, GαzR179C, with and without GTPγS or AlF4−. As shown in Fig. 1, RGSZ1 bound to Gαi1(lane 10) and Gαz (lane 4) only in the presence of AlF4−, but not in the presence of GTPγS (lanes 3 and 9). RGSZ1 did not bind to the constitutively active QL (lanes 5 and11) and RC mutants (lanes 6 and12) of Gαz or Gαi1. This observation indicates that RGSZ1 directly binds to both Gαi1 and Gαz in their transition states. To further investigate the physical interaction between RGSZ1 and Gαi1 in cells, co-immunoprecipitation of RGSZ1 and Gαi1 in CHO-K1 cells was also determined (Fig. 2). Cells were co-transfected with Gαi1 and RGSZ1, and cell extracts were prepared 2 days after transfection. RGSZ1 in the cell lysates was immunoprecipitated using a specific RGSZ1 polyclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. The Gαi1 protein associated with RGSZ1 was probed with a monoclonal antibody against Gαi1 in a Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2, Gαi1 was only detected after immunoprecipitation with RGSZ1 antibody in the presence of AlF4− (lane 3). The amount of Gαi1 detected was increased when 1 μg of purified recombinant RGSZ1 protein was added in the cell lysate to increase the availability of RGSZ1 protein (lane 6). These data further indicated that the transition form of Gαi1 specifically interacts with RGSZ1. The interaction between RGSZ1 and Gαi1 was further examined in intact cells, using a yeast two-hybrid system functionally linked to a luciferase reporter gene. RGSZ1 was fused to the Gal4-AD, and Gαi1, Gαi1QL, Gαi2, and Gαi3 were fused with Gal4-BD. The RGSZ1-AD fusion protein was co-expressed with either Gαi1-BD, Gαi1Q204L-BD, Gαi2-BD, or Gαi3-BD fusion proteins and the luciferase reporter gene activity was determined. As shown in Fig. 3, transformants containing empty vectors alone (lane 1), RGSZ1-AD alone (lane 2), or Gαi-BD alone (lanes 3–6) had very low luciferase activity (∼5000 counts), indicating a low basal activity of the luciferase reporter. By comparison, the yeast strain containing both RGSZ1-AD and Gαi1-BD showed ∼70-fold increase (∼350,000 counts) over the luciferase activity of controls (lane 7), suggesting a strong interaction between RGSZ1 and Gαi1 in yeast. RGSZ1 also interacted well with the Gαi1Q204L mutant (lane 8) and Gαi3 (lane 10) in this system, but interacted poorly with Gαi2 (lane 9). To examine whether RGSZ1 functionally GAPs Gαi1, single-turnover GTPase assays were conducted using full-length recombinant RGSZ1-His6 and Gαi1-His6 proteins. In the GTPase assay, RGSZ1 dramatically accelerated the GTPase activity of Gαi1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). 100 nm RGSZ1 maximally activated the GTP hydrolysis of 500 nmGαi1 in less than 1 min (Fig. 4B). TheKobs value was increased from 0.335 m−1 in the absence of RGSZ1 to 3.885 m−1 in the presence of RGSZ1 at 0 °C. By comparison, at 15 °C theKobs value was increased from 0.652 m−1 without RGSZ1 to 3.985 m−1 with RGSZ1 (Fig. 4B). The -fold stimulation by RGSZ1 on the Gαi1 GAP activity was minimized with longer reaction time because of the higher basal intrinsic GTPase activity. This was especially noted at 15 °C. To compare the relative GAP activities of RGSZ1 with other well known Gαi GAP proteins, the GAP activities of full-length GAIP and RGS4 core domain (residues 77–199) were also tested. The RGS4 core domain has been demonstrated to retain full GAP activity and binding affinity with the full-length protein in the in vitro assay (38Popov S. Yu K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, RGSZ1, GAIP, and RGS4 (core domain) in 20 nm each stimulated Gαi1 GTPase (200 nm) with similar rates. The observed rate constants (Kobs) for RGSZ1, GAIP, and RGS4 (core) indicated in Fig. 4C are 0.063, 0.069, and 0.056 s−1, respectively. A RGS7 core domain (residues 330–448) preferentially interacting with Gαo(29Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Google Scholar), showed relatively weaker activity toward Gαi1(Kobs = 0.024 s−1) (Fig. 4C). These data clearly indicate that RGSZ1 accelerates the GTPase of Gαi1 with almost identical activity to that observed for RGS4 and GAIP. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) G protein α subunit (GPA1) is a Gαi-like protein (39Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Cell. 1987; 50: 1001-1010Google Scholar, 40Miyajima I. Nakafuku M. Nakayama N. Brenner C. Miyajima A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1011-1019Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that some mammalian RGS proteins, such as RGS4, RGS1, RGS3T, and RGS16, which interact well with mammalian Gαi proteins, can also modulate Gpa1 and attenuate the pheromone response in yeast (21Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Google Scholar, 41Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8679-8685Google Scholar). A functional complementation study was conducted to ascertain whether RGSZ1 could interact with Gpa1 and regulate the pheromone response pathway, as measured in a halo assay in the SST2 (a yeast RGS protein) knockout strain (Fig. 5). Treatment with α factor caused dose-dependent cell cycle arrest, as observed by the increase of the halo size in the empty vector control strain (Fig. 5A). By comparison, the α factor (100 μm)-induced halo in the RGSZ1-transformed strain was ∼70% smaller than that of the vector strain (Fig. 5B), suggesting that RGSZ1 partially blocked the pheromone response via modulation of Gpa1. SST2 (a positive control) showed stronger effects than RGSZ1 in the halo assay. However, RGS2, which has lower GAP activity for Gαi (32Heximer S.P. Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Bernard J.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8679-8685Google Scholar), did not show a significant effect in modulating the yeast pheromone response. The α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) preferentially couples to Gαiproteins to transduce cellular signals (42Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Google Scholar). Activation of α2-AR results in MAPK activation in various cell types by coupling to Gαi. This activation is mediated by βγ subunits and occurs as a direct result of Ras activation (43Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Google Scholar, 44Anderson N.G. Milligan G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1529-1535Google Scholar). RGS4 attenuates MAPK activation by interleukin 8 receptor and D2 dopamine receptor, both of which couple to Gαi proteins (21Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Google Scholar, 45Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Google Scholar). The role of RGSZ1 in the regulation of the MAPK activity induced by activation of endogenous α2-AR in PC12 cells was examined. We generated PC12 stable cell lines expressing either the eGFP-RGSZ1 fusion protein or eGFP protein alone, with relatively identical expression levels (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, treatment of the eGFP cell line with UK14304, an agonist of α2-AR, caused a dose-dependent activation of p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2). The activation of MAPK induced by 10 μm UK14304 reached the maximal level in 5 min. By comparison, the activation of ERK1/2 by UK14304 was substantially blocked in the eGFP-RGSZ1 cell line. The activation of MAPK by UK14304 was also blocked by treatment with PTX (50 ng/ml) (data not shown), suggesting that UK14304-induced MAPK activation was mediated by PTX-sensitive Gαi protein, not by other endogenous PTX-insensitive Gα subunits, such as Gαz, Gαq, and Gαs, which may also weakly interact with the α2A receptor in PC12 cells (42Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Google Scholar). To further demonstrate the effect of RGSZ1 in attenuating another Gαi-coupled signal transduction pathway in mammalian cells, we transfected the RGSZ1 gene into CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the D2R, which is predominantly coupled to Gαisubunits. We have found previously that activation of D2R by quinpirole, a D2R agon"

Fractions were characterized using electron microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, and enzymatic markers, and it was demonstrated that the heaviest (pellet) fraction contains electron-dense vacuoles rich in phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium, as found before for acidocalcisomes. Staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) indicated that poly- phosphate (polyP) was preferentially localized in this fraction together with pyrophosphate (PPi). Using an enzyme-based method, millimolar levels (in terms of Pi residues) of polyP chains of less than 50 residues long and micromolar levels in polyP chains of about 700–800 residues long were found to be preferentially localized in this fraction. The fraction also contained the pyrophosphatase and polyphosphatase activities characteristic of acidocalcisomes. Western blot analysis using antibodies against proteins from micronemes, dense granules, rhoptries, and plasma membrane showed that the acidocalcisomal fraction was not contaminated by these other organelles. T. gondii polyP levels rapidly decreased upon exposure of the parasites to a calcium ionophore (ionomycin), to an inhibitor of the V-H+-ATPase (bafilomycin A1), or to the alkalinizing agent NH4Cl. These changes were in parallel to an increase in intracellular Ca2+concentration, suggesting a close association between polyP hydrolysis and Ca2+ release from the acidocalcisome. These results provide a useful method for the isolation and characterization of acidocalcisomes, showing that they are distinct from other previously recognized organelles present in T. gondii, and provide evidence for the role of polyP metabolism in response to cellular stress.

Not all these pumps and exchangers are necessarily present in all acidocalcisomes. However, the H+-PPase has been found in all cases in the purified organelle (11Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Google Scholar, 12Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8146-8153Google Scholar), which makes this pump the marker of choice for acidocalcisomes. The functions of the acidocalcisome in cell growth and survival are poorly understood. Based on its chemical composition, rich in PPi and polyP (a linear polymer of hundreds of orthophosphate residues linked by high energy phosphoanhydride bonds), one possible function could be as an energy and phosphate reservoir. PolyP has been shown to have a function in the cellular response to nutrient limitation during the stationary phase of growth and in the chelation of metals (17Kulaev I.S. Kulakovskaya T.C. Andreeva N.A. Lichko L.P. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 23: 27-43Google Scholar, 18Kuroda A. Tanaka S. Ikeda T. Kato J. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14264-14269Google Scholar, 19Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Google Scholar). A critical role for the acidocalcisomal polyP in the adaptation processes of Trypanosoma cruzi to environmental changes has been demonstrated (20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Google Scholar). In several protozoan parasites it has been shown that the acidocalcisome is the main calcium storage compartment (1Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Google Scholar, 2Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Google Scholar). Because Ca2+ signaling is involved in many processes, such as invasion of host cells by different parasites (2Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Google Scholar, 21Vieira M. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 157-162Google Scholar), it is possible, although it has not yet been demonstrated, that this compartment could also have a role as a source of releasable Ca2+. Many aspects of acidocalcisomes, such as their transport and enzymatic activities, need further study to understand the physiological importance of these organelles in protozoan parasites. A crucial requirement for these studies is the isolation of the organelles free from interference of other organelles or enzymatic activities. In the present work, we report a modification of the cell fractionation method used for T. cruzi epimastigotes (22Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Google Scholar) for the purification of acidocalcisomes from Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. We also report for the first time the determination of short and long chain polyP in these parasites. Our results indicate that the concentration of polyP changes drastically under alkaline stress or when the cells are incubated with calcium ionophores. Ca2+ release from acidocalcisomes is associated with the hydrolysis of polyP. Tachyzoites of T. gondii RH strain were cultivated and purified by the method of Moreno and Zhong (5Moreno S.N.J. Zhong L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 655-659Google Scholar) in bovine turbinate cells (ATCC CRL 1390). Host cells were cultivated in tissue culture flasks using Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. Cells were infected with tachyzoites at a final host-to-parasite ratio of 1:5. Parasites were harvested 2–3 days after infection and purified as described previously (23Chamberland S. Kirst H.A. Current W.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 903-909Google Scholar). Horse serum, DNase, RNase, Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (D5523), Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline (PBS), Hanks' solution, nocodazole, sodium orthovanadate, sodium pyrophosphate, silicon carbide (400 mesh), protease inhibitors mixture, and goat anti-mouse antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma. Bafilomycin A1 was from Kamiya Biomedicals, Thousand Oaks, CA. Iodixanol (Optiprep, Nycomed) was from Invitrogen. 2-Amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (these two components were from the EnzChek phosphate assay kit) and the tetraacetoxymethyl esters of fura 2 (1-[2-(5-carboxyoxazol-2-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran-5-oxyl]-2-(2′-amino-5′-methylphenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) and BCECF (2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein), fura 2-AM and BCECF-AM, respectively, were from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR.

The antibodies used for the characterization of the subcellular fractions were: anti-SAG1 monoclonal antibody, a gift from Dr. John Boothroyd, Stanford University School of Medicine; anti-ROP monoclonal antibody, a gift from Dr. Jean Francois Dubremetz, Institut de Biologie, CNRS; and anti-micronemes and anti-dense granules, gifts from Dr. David Sibley, Washington University. Escherichia coli strain CA38 pTrcPPX1 was kindly provided by Prof. Arthur Kornberg, Stanford University School of Medicine (Stanford, CA). All other reagents were analytical grade. Tachyzoites (∼2.4 × 1010 cells) were centrifuged at 500 × gfor 10 min, and the cell pellet was washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS and once in lysis buffer (125 mm sucrose, 50 mmKCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm K-Hepes, 5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors mixture (0.2% v/v), 12 μg/ml DNase, 12 μg/ml RNase, and 8 μg/ml nocodazole, pH 7.2). The cell pellet was mixed with 1.8× wet weight silicon carbide and lysed by grinding with a pestle and mortar for not more than 60 s (lysis was checked by microscopy every 15 s). The mixture of silicon carbide and lysed cells was resuspended in ∼100 ml of lysis buffer, and the suspension was left for 3 min on ice to allow most of the silicon carbide to settle. The liquid phase was carefully transferred to another tube and centrifuged at 36 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and left on ice, whereas the pellet was resuspended in ∼50 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged again under the same conditions. Combined supernatants were centrifuged at 144 × g for 10 min to remove debris and unbroken cells. The supernatant obtained from this last centrifugation was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 2.7 ml of lysis buffer, homogenized with the aid of a 22-gauge needle about 8–10 times until no clumps were observed, and mixed with 1.3 ml of 60% iodixanol. This mixture (20% iodixanol) was included as the middle layer of a discontinuous gradient, with the other (4-ml) steps containing 10, 15, 25, and 30% iodixanol (diluted in lysis buffer). The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 × g using a Beckman SW 28 rotor for 60 min. Thirteen fractions were collected corresponding to bands and interfaces (Fig. 1). The acidocalcisomal fraction (F13) pelleted on the bottom of the tube and was resuspended in lysis buffer. All these procedures were done at 4 °C. ATPases, pyrophosphatase, and exopolyphosphatase activities were assayed by measuring phosphate release using the EnzCheck phosphate assay kit as described before (11Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A.

Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Google Scholar). Acid phosphatase (lysosome marker, Ref. 24Barrett A.J. Heath M.F. Dingle J.T. Lysosomes: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1977: 36-40Google Scholar) was assayed in microtiter plates by measuring phosphate release from p-nitrophenylphosphate. Fractions (5 μl) were added to a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate and incubated for 30 min at 28 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 150 mm sodium hydroxide (100 μl), and released p-nitrophenol was detected at 405 nm. Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad Coomassie Blue method. All assays were recorded in a PowerWave 340i plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Polyphosphatase activity was determined measuring Pi release in the presence and absence of polyP. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with 60 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6.0 mm MgCl2, and 520 μm purified polyP500–700 in a final volume of 75 μl. One unit corresponded to the release of 1 pmol of Pi per min. Release of Pi was monitored by the method of Lanzetta et al. (25Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Google Scholar). PolyP500–700was isolated from agarose gels with Maddrell salt solution as described Clark and Wood (26Clark J.E. Wood H.G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 280-290Google Scholar). The construction of normalized density distribution histograms was carried out as described before (15Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M.

Cells (∼5 × 107) obtained as described above were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer, and 45 μl of this suspension was incubated at room temperature with 10 μg of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)/ml. After 10 min, the samples were mounted on a slide and observed with an Olympus Fluoview FV300 laser-scanning confocal microscope using optical sections of 0.1 μm and an argon laser for detection of polyP (20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Google Scholar). Acidocalcisomal fractions (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with DAPI as described above, and samples were observed with an epifluorescence microscope using an Olympus WIG filter (excitation 380–385 nm; emission >580 nm) for polyP detection. Recombinant exopolyphosphatase (rPPX1) was obtained and purified as described before (20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol.

This strain of bacteria is insertionally inactivated for endogenous polyphosphate kinase and exopolyphosphatase (27Crooke E. Akiyama M. Rao N.N. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6290-6295Google Scholar) and contains a plasmid with the His-taggedrPPX1 gene from S. cerevisiae (28Wurst H. Shiba T. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 898-906Google Scholar). Proteins from each fraction of the gradient were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose (NitroPure, MSI, Westborough, MA) with a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus by standard techniques. Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk in Dulbecco's PBS, washed 3 times (10 min each) in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-PBS), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies against micronemes (6D10 for MIC-2) (29Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Google Scholar), rhoptries (T3–4A71C8 for ROP 2, 3, 4) (30Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem.

Polyclonal antisera raised against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptides corresponding to the hydrophilic loop IV (antibody 324) of the plant V-H+-PPase was used (33Serafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1775-1779Google Scholar). Membranes were then washed 3 times with T-PBS (15 min each) and incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:10,000 (or 1:2,000 anti-rabbit IgG when the anti V-H+-PPase antibody was used). After another round of washes (4 times with T-PBS/15 min each), the membranes were processed for chemiluminescence detection as per the manufacturer's (Amersham Biosciences) instructions. Before reprobing with other antibodies, blots were stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and washed 3 times with T-PBS before the incubations. For observation of acidocalcisomal fraction 13, the sample was washed twice in 250 mm sucrose and diluted before being applied to Formvar-coated copper or nickel grids. The fraction was allowed to adsorb for 5–10 min at room temperature, blotted dry, and observed directly by electron microscopy (11Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell.

Scott D.A. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 759-766Google Scholar). X-ray microanalysis was performed at the Electron Microscopy Center, Southern Illinois University, as described before (11Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Google Scholar, 12Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Google Scholar, 13Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 759-766Google Scholar). Long chain polyP extraction was performed as described by Ault-Riché et al. (34Ault-Riché D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.-M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Google Scholar). For short chain polyP, extractions were done as described by Ruiz et al.(20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Google Scholar). PolyP levels were determined by the amount of Pireleased upon treatment with an excess of purified recombinant exopolyphosphatase (rPPX1) from S. cerevisiae as previously described (20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Google Scholar). PPi levels were determined by the amount of Pi released upon treatment with inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma, final activity, 10 units/ml) as previously described (35Urbina J.A. Moreno B. Vierkotter S. Oldfield E. Payares G. Sanoja C. Bailey B.N. Yan W. Scott D.A. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33609-33615Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of polyP was calculated taking into account the cell volume of tachyzoites measured by the [14C]inulin exclusion method as previously described by Damper and Patton (36Damper D. Patton C.L. J. Protozool. 1976; 23: 349-356Google Scholar), with some modifications. Cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) glucose and 0.05% (w/v) albumin (HBSSA) and then resuspended in HBSSA containing 0.2 mg/ml [14C]inulin at final concentrations of 1 × 109 and 2 × 109 cells/ml. Three 50-μl aliquots were taken from each suspension and transferred to scintillation vials. The suspensions were then centrifuged in Eppendorf tubes at 14,000 × g for 2 min, and three 50-μl aliquots of the supernatant were transferred to scintillation vials. 5 ml of scintillation mixture was added to each vial, and the vials were counted. All cell manipulations were performed on ice and/or with chilled solutions. Cell volume was determined by inulin exclusion. The difference in radioactivity/ml between the cell suspension and the supernatant was used to calculate the cell volume (difference divided by radioactivity of supernatant = fraction of volume occupied by cells). Results were expressed as an average of the values obtained in two different suspensions from three independent experiments. Spectrofluorometric determinations of tachyzoites loaded with fura 2-AM or BCECF-AM were performed as described previously (5Moreno S.N.J. Zhong L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 655-659Google Scholar). For the alkaline or ionophore treatments, tachyzoites (2.5 × 108) were washed once with Dulbecco's PBS and resuspended in 0.55 ml of 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mmHepes pH 7.4 (buffer A). At the times indicated, 40 mmNH4Cl, 1 μm ionomycin, or 1 μmbafilomycin were added. Aliquots of 50 μl were withdrawn at the times indicated and mixed with 500 μl of guanidine isothiocyanate lysis buffer (20Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Google Scholar) for long chain polyP determination or with 300 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m HClO4 for short chain polyP determination as described above. The method used to isolate acidocalcisomes from various protozoa has been improved in stages (11Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Google Scholar, 12Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Google Scholar, 13Rodrigues C.O.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Google Scholar) but has not proved useful for isolation of these organelles from apicomplexan parasites. A new procedure for the isolation of acidocalcisomes fromT. gondii is depicted in Fig. 1. This method used generally lower concentrations of iodixanol in the gradient steps than those previously used for the purification of acidocalcisomes from T. cruziepimastigotes (22Scott D.A. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Google Scholar) but with the T. gondii sample added in the middle of the gradient in a 20% iodixanol layer rather than applied to the top of the gradient without added iodixanol. This strategy allowed a better separation of the acidocalcisomes from the ghosts present in the intermediate fractions and a better recovery of the pellet fraction at the base of the gradient (fraction 13). When directly applied to Formvar-coated grids and observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 2B), fraction 13 was seen to contain electron-dense structures, as expected for acidocalcisomes (1Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Google Scholar, 2Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Google Scholar). The same electron-dense organelles were observed in whole cells when they were applied to EM grids in the same manner (Fig. 2A). X-ray microanalysis of the granules present in fraction 13 (Fig. 3) showed that they have the same chemical composition as acidocalcisomes found in other protozoa (1Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 443-448Google Scholar, 2Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 33: 151-159Google Scholar) and electron-dense vacuoles in whole T. gondii (9Luo S. Vieira M. Graves J. Zhong L. Moreno S.N.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-66Google Scholar), indicating that they are acidocalcisomes.Figure 3X-ray microanalysis spectra of acidocalcisomes isolated from T. gondii(A) and background (B).Peaks from Cu and Si arise from the grids and the silicon carbide used for cell disruption, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The distribution of different enzymatic activities and organelle markers was compared along with that of the established marker for acidocalcisomes, H+-PPase (Figs.4 and 5). The aminomethylenediphosphonate-sensitive pyrophosphatase activity peaks in three different regions along the gradient (Fig. 4). Observation of these fractions by electron microscopy showed that the only fraction containing the electron-dense vacuoles, as seen in Fig. 2B, was fraction 13. Fractions 1 and 5 contained many cell ghosts produced in the lysis procedure (data not shown). A V-H+-ATPase sensitive to bafilomycin has been described to be present in acidocalcisomes of T. gondii (5Moreno S.N.J. Zhong L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 655-659Google Scholar, 6Moreno S.N.J. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Biochem. J. 1997; 330: 853-860Google Scholar). However, the V-H+-ATPase activity seems to have a broader distribution if compared with the H+-PPase (Fig. 4). Acid phosphatase activity, a marker for another acidic organelle, the lysosome, did not peak in fraction 13 (Fig. 4). The acidocalcisomal fraction also lacks markers for other organelles present in T. gondii, such as rhoptries (30Leriche M.A. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 45: 249-259Google Scholar), micronemes (29Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Google Scholar), and dense granules (31Labruyere E. Lingnau M. Mercier C. Sibley L.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 311-324Google Scholar), as depicted in the Western blots shown in Fig. 5. Likewise, antibodies against the surface antigen of T. gondii tachyzoites (SAG1) (32Bülow R. Boothroyd J.C. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3496-3500Google Scholar) show that the plasma membrane is distributed mainly in the middle of the gradient (Fig. 5). Antibodies against the H+-PPase (Fig. 5) confirm the distribution of this protein, obtained by enzymatic measurements (shown in Fig. 4). The strong reaction of this antibody in fractions 4–12 is because of the presence of plasma membrane fragments (as marked by SAG1) and the high amount of protein in these fractions (Fig 4). The H+-PPase has been previously shown to be located on the cell surface of T. gondii as well as in acidocalcisomes (7Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Bailey B.N. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno B. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 737-745Google Scholar). Importantly though, fraction 13, which contains low amounts of protein, showed a clear reaction with antibodies against the H+-PPase and no reaction with antibodies against all other markers, thus indicating that this fraction contained only acidocalcisomes. T. gondii tachyzoites contain high levels of long and short chain polyP, as determined by measuring degradation of polyP with recombinant yeast exopolyphosphatase (rPPX1). Cellular concentrations of short chain polyP (less than 50 phosphate residues) were in the mm range (in terms of Pi residues, 24.0 ± 0.5 mm), whereas values for long chain polyP (700–800 phosphate residues) were in the micromolar range (43.0 ± 0.5 μm), taking into account a calculated cell volume of 16.5 ± 3 μl/109 tachyzoites. Tachyzoites also contained very high levels of PPi (7.95 ± 0.16 mm). Controls of uninfected"

Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells expressing an exogenous α3 chain were found to secrete LN6 with the full-length α3 chain and a smaller amount of its processed form lacking the carboxyl-terminal G4-5 domain, besides mature LN5 without G4-5 (mat-LN5). We prepared the unprocessed LN6 and mat-LN5, as well as LN6 mutants without G4-5 (LN6ΔG4-5) or G5 (LN6ΔG5). These laminins supported attachment of HT1080 cells and human keratinocytes (HaCaT) through integrins α3β1 and/or α6β1. LN6ΔG4-5, LN6ΔG5, and mat-LN5 promoted rapid cell spreading, whereas LN6 did hardly. A purified G4-5 fragment of the laminin α3 chain supported cell attachment through interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and promoted cell spreading in combination with mat-LN5 or LN6ΔG4-5. These results imply that the G4-5 domain within the LN6 molecule suppresses cell adhesion, while the released G4-5 promotes it. The presence of G5 rather than the heparin-binding domain G4 was responsible for the impaired cell spreading activity of LN6. However, the unprocessed LN6 promoted cell spreading in the presence of mat-LN5. Unlike mat-LN5, both LN6ΔG4-5 and LN6 did weakly or did not stimulate cell motility. These findings demonstrate that LN6 and LN5 have distinct biological activities, but they may cooperatively support cell adhesion. The proteolytic processing of the α3 chain seems to regulate the physiological functions of LN6.

These findings demonstrate that LN6 and LN5 have distinct biological activities, but they may cooperatively support cell adhesion. The proteolytic processing of the α3 chain seems to regulate the physiological functions of LN6. The components of basement membranes not only support tissue architectures but also regulate various cellular functions, such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. The regulatory functions of basement membranes can be largely attributed to the interaction of laminins with their receptors. Genetically distinct five α, three β, and three γ subunits of laminin form specialized heterotrimers (laminins-1 to -15) that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner during embryonic development as well as in the adult (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). All laminin α subunits share a large globular domain at their carboxyl-terminal region (G domain), which consists of five homologous globular subdomains (or modules) of about 200 amino acids each (G1–G5 or LG1–LG5). This region contains binding sites for extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. perlecan and fibulin-1), as well as cellular receptors including integrins, syndecans, and α-dystroglycan (1Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 (LN5), 1The abbreviations used are: LNx, laminin-x; HSPG, heparansulfate proteoglycan; mat-LN5, mature LN5 without G4-5 domain of laminin α3 chain; LN6ΔGx, LN6 lacking Gx domain of laminin α3 chain; α3G4-5, a G4-5 fragment of laminin α3 chain which consists of α3, β3, and γ2 chains, was originally found as an anchoring filament component of keratinocytes (kalinin/epiligrin/nicein) (2Rousselle P.

Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). LN5 is unique in its biological activity and structure. It potently stimulates both cell adhesion and cell motility in culture (5Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). LN5 is currently the only laminin molecule with truncations in the amino-terminal regions (or the short arms) of all three subunits. The laminin β3 and γ2 subunits are found only in LN5, whereas the α3 chain is found in laminin-6 (LN6, α3β1γ1), laminin-7 (LN7, α3β2γ1), and laminin-13 (LN13, α3β2γ3). LN5 is secreted by various types of epithelial cells in tissues and in culture, and assembled into the basement membrane structures in vivo. The interaction of LN5 with integrin α6β4 in the hemidesmosome structures is essential for stable attachment of basal cells to their substrate, polarization of the epithelial sheet, and stabilization of cellular architecture through the intermediate filament (2Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 3Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). LN5 is synthesized and secreted in a precursor form containing a 190-kDa α3, a 140-kDa β3, and a 150-kDa γ2 chains, but the α3 and γ2 chains undergo proteolytic processing to smaller species of 160 kDa and 105 kDa, respectively (8Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that post-translational processing of LN5 molecules modulates their function. Proteolytic cleavage of the γ2 chain by MMP-2 (gelatinase A) or MT1-MMP increases the cell motility activity of LN5 (9Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 10Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) but decreases the cell adhesion activity (11Gagnoux-Palacios L. Allegra M. Spirito F. Pommeret O. Romero C. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been reported that the processing of the 190-kDa α3 chain to the 160-kDa one by plasmin converts the precursor LN5 from a migration ligand to an anchorage ligand in hemidesmosomes (12Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the mature LN5 with the processed α3 chain has been shown to strongly promote cell motility or cell scattering via integrin α3β1 (5Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It was recently found that the cleavage of the α3 chain occurs between the G3 and G4 domains, releasing the G4-5 fragment (13Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and that the G3 domain is essential for the potent activity of LN5 to promote cell adhesion and migration (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has also been found that the G2 domain contains an integrin α3β1 binding sequence (15Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these past studies indicate that the G1-3 domain of the α3 chain is the primary site to bind cell surface receptors, but the short arms of the γ2 and possibly β3 chains are likely to affect the biological activity of LN5. To clarify the structure and function relationship of LN5, it seems important to characterize LN6, because these two laminins share the common α3 subunit and are often produced by the same cell types. LN6 was first identified as k-laminin in culture media of human keratinocytes and a squamous cell carcinoma line (8Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17900-17906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In human amnion, about half-amount of LN5 exists in complexes with LN6 or LN7 (17Champliaud M.F. Lunstrum G.P. Rousselle P. Nishiyama T. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The rotary-shadowed image analysis of the complexes suggests that LN5 binds with LN6 or LN7 through the interaction of their short arms. It is assumed that the complex formation allows stable association of LN5 with the basement membrane in the amnion (17Champliaud M.F. Lunstrum G.P. Rousselle P. Nishiyama T. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, no previous studies have shown the biological activity of LN6 or LN7 presumably because of the difficulty in isolating these laminins in LN5-free forms. In the present study, we isolated LN6 as an unprocessed single protein and as truncated forms lacking the G4-5, G3-5, or G5 domain of the α3 chain. This report describes the biological activities of the four forms of LN6, as well as their differences from LN5. Human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 was obtained from Japanese Cancer Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Four transfectants of HT1080 cells, HT1080/WT, HT1080/ΔG5, HT1080/ΔG4-5, and HT1080/ΔG3-5 were established in our recent study (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HT1080/WT has been stably transfected with a full-length cDNA of human laminin α3 subunit, and HT1080/ΔG5, HT1080/ΔG4-5, and HT1080/ΔG3-5 with mutant cDNAs for the laminin α3 chains lacking the G5, G4-5, and G3-5 domains, respectively. Buffalo rat liver-derived epithelial cell line BRL has been described in our previous studies (5Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HaCaT cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human laminin α3 chain (LSα3c4) and γ2 chain (D4B5) were previously established and characterized (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J.

Res. 1998; 50: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the G4 domain of laminin α3 chain was produced in our laboratory (13Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K.

Other antibodies used and their sources are: a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for human laminin β3 chain from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); a rat monoclonal antibody against laminin β1 chain (VNR147) and mouse monoclonal antibodies against human laminin γ1 chain (2E8) and against human integrin α5 (P1D6) and β1 (6S6) subunits from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA); mouse monoclonal antibodies against integrin α2 (P1E6) and α3 (P1B5) subunits from Invitrogen; and a rat monoclonal antibody against human integrin α6 (G0H3) from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Mouse EHS-laminin (laminin-1, LN1), human laminin-10/11 (LN10/11), and human plasma fibronectin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Invitrogen, and Asahi Technoglass (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Various recombinant LN5 forms have been isolated from the conditioned media of HT1080 transfectants (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study, LN5 and three forms of LN6 were purified by basically the same method as before. Briefly, the serum-free conditioned medium of HT1080/WT cells was fractionated by molecular-sieve chromatography on a Sepharose-4B column (AmershamBiosciences) and then by a heparin-Sepharose column. Proteins bound to the heparin column were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl and then with 1.0 m NaCl. Each fraction was passed through a gelatin-Sepharose column to remove fibronectin, and then subjected to two kinds of immunoaffinity chromatographies. LN5 was purified from the 0.5 m NaCl eluate using a LSα3c4-Sepharose (anti-α3 chain antibody) column and a D4B5-Sepharose (anti-γ2 chain antibody) column as reported previously (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To isolate LN6, the 1.0m NaCl eluate from the heparin column was diluted 10-fold to decrease the NaCl concentration, and then applied to a Q-Sepharose HPLC column (Amersham Biosciences). The materials eluted between 0.3 and 0.4 m NaCl were passed through the D4B5-Sepharose column to remove LN5. Finally, the unbound materials were applied to the LSα3c4-Sepharose immunoaffinity column. Bound LN6 was eluted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and immediately neutralized. LN6 mutants without the G5 domain of laminin α3 chain (LN6ΔG5), without the G4-5 domain (LN6ΔG4-5), and without the G3-5 domain (LN6ΔG3-5) were purified from the conditioned media of HT1080/ΔG5, HT1080/ΔG4-5, and HT1080/ΔG3-5 cells, respectively, by essentially the same procedure as above. The G4-5 fragment of laminin α3 chain (α3G4-5) was isolated according to the recently published procedure with some modifications (13Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the concentrated conditioned medium of HT1080/WT cells was fractionated on a Sepharose 4B column and then on a heparin-Sepharose column. Proteins bound to the heparin column at 0.1 m NaCl were eluted sequentially with 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 m NaCl. The α3G4-5 fragment was mostly eluted at 0.8 m NaCl, and this fraction was finally applied to a cation-exchange Mono S HPLC column at 0.1 m NaCl. The α3G4-5 fragment was eluted from the column at 0.5∼0.6 m NaCl. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis was performed according to the method reported before (20Koshikawa N. Moriyama K. Takamura H. Mizushima H. Nagashima Y. Yanoma S. Miyazaki K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5596-5601PubMed Google Scholar). The first dimensional SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 4% polyacrylamide disc gel (2 mm in diameter and 70 mm in length) under non-reducing conditions. After the electrophoresis, the gel was incubated in a SDS sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 15 min, placed on a 6% polyacrylamide slab gel (85-mm wide, 1-mm thick, and 70-mm long), and run for the second dimensional SDS-PAGE. Proteins separated on the slab gel were subsequently subjected to the immunoblotting procedure. The cell attachment assay was performed as described previously (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar, Acton, MA) were coated with various substrates in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight, and then blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Cells were suspended in serum-free medium at a density of 2∼4 × 105 cells/ml, and 100-μl aliquots were inoculated onto the plates. After incubation at 37 °C, adherent cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.0005% Hoechst 33342, 0.001% Triton X-100 for 1.5 h. The fluorescent intensity of each well of the plates was measured using a CytoFluor 2350 fluorometer (Millipore, Bedford, MA). A blank value corresponding to an empty well was automatically subtracted. Cell scattering activity of various forms of laminins toward BRL cells was assayed as reported previously (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 7,000 cells/well onto 24-well plates (Sumibe Medical, Tokyo, Japan) containing 0.5 ml/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 plus 1% fetal bovine serum. In the standard assay, test samples were directly added into the culture and incubated at 37 °C. After 2 days, cell scattering was judged by microscopic observation. Alternatively, test samples were coated on 24-well plates as described above, and the plates were used for assays of cell scattering and cell migration. Cell migration on these substrates was monitored at 37 °C with a time-lapse video. The length of cell migration was measured with a video micrometer (VM-30; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). It was previously found that when a cDNA for human laminin α3 chain is transfected into human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, the exogenous α3 chain is assembled with the endogenous β3 and γ2 chains to produce the LN5 hetrotrimer of α3β3γ2 (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In that study, the conditioned medium of the HT1080 transfectant (HT1080/WT) contained both the 190-kDa and 160-kDa α3 chains, but only the LN5 with the 160-kDa α3 chain, which had been proteolytically cleaved between the G3 and G4 domains, was purified from the conditioned medium. Antibodies to the laminin β3 chain and to the γ2 chain precipitated the 160-kDa α3 chain but not the 190-kDa one from the conditioned medium, suggesting the presence of α3-containing laminin(s) other than LN5. In the present study, the conditioned medium of HT1080/WT cells was analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and the following immunoblotting with the antibodies to the laminin α3, γ2, β1, and γ1 chains. On the first dimensional non-reducing SDS-PAGE, the α3 chain was separated into at least four different molecular sizes, over 1,000 kDa (the top of gel), 600, 450, and 400 kDa (Fig.1 A). The 450- and 400-kDa α3 chains were associated with the γ2 chain, showing that they were the LN5 forms with the 150- and 105-kDa γ2 chains, respectively (Fig.1 B). This demonstrated that the 190-kDa α3 chain had completely been converted to the 160-kDa mature form in LN5 molecule. On the other hand, the α3 chain in the 600-kDa complex was not associated with the γ2 chain (Fig. 1 B). On the second dimensional reducing SDS-PAGE, the α3 chain at this position was separated into a 190-kDa major spot and a 160-kDa minor one. Laminin β1 and γ1 chains were separated as broad bands, showing that they existed as different complexes including the β1-γ1 heterodimer (Fig. 1, C and D). The β1 and γ1 chains were found at the position of the 600-kDa α3 complexes. These results suggested that the 190-kDa α3 chain might exist as LN6 (α3β1γ1). The results also imply that the proteolytic processing of the laminin α3 chain occurs preferentially in LN5 in the HT1080/WT cells. The high-molecular weight aggregate of the α3 chain on the top of gel was not further investigated in this study. To characterize the 600-kDa complexes containing the laminin α3 chain, we attempted to isolate the laminin isoforms from the HT1080/WT conditioned medium. The conditioned medium was fractionated by the molecular-sieve chromatography, followed by the heparin affinity chromatography. Both the 190- and the 160-kDa α3 chains bound to the heparin column, but the former was eluted at 1.0 m NaCl, whereas the latter was mainly eluted at 0.5 m NaCl (data not shown). The difference in the affinity to heparin was consistent with our previous observation that the G4-5 fragment of the α3 chain tightly binds to a heparin column (13Tsubota Y. Mizushima H. Hirosaki T. Higashi S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The eluted 190-kDa α3 chain was further purified by an anion-exchange HPLC and then passed through the anti-laminin γ2 antibody column to remove LN5. Finally, the material was bound to an immunoaffinity column conjugated with the anti-laminin α3 antibody and eluted therefrom. The purified material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with five kinds of antibodies. The isolated protein migrated as a single band of about 600 kDa slightly beneath mouse LN1 under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2 A). Reducing SDS-PAGE resolved the 600-kDa laminin into three bands with molecular masses of 220, 210, and 190 kDa (Fig. 2 B), and these bands were identified as the laminin β1, γ1, and α3 chains, respectively (Fig. 2 C). Neither anti-β3 nor anti-γ2 antibody reacted with any of the three chains (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that the purified 600-kDa laminin is LN6. The LN5 purified by the immunoaffinity chromatography with the anti-laminin γ2 antibody contained only the 160-kDa form of the α3 chain, in addition to the 135-kDa β3 chain and the 150-/105-kDa γ2 chain (hereafter referred as mature LN5; mat-LN5) (Fig. 2, B andC). We also purified a small amount of LN6 with the 160-kDa α3 chain from the 0.5 m NaCl eluate from the heparin column. The 160-kDa α3 chain in this preparation was not reactive with the antibody against the G4 domain (data not shown). This indicated that the 160-kDa α3 chain had been cleaved between the G3 and G4 domains just like the 160-kDa α3 chain in mat-LN5. Therefore, we decided to purify this laminin at a higher yield from the conditioned medium of HT1080/ΔG4-5 cells, which had been transfected with the cDNA for the laminin α3 chain lacking both G4 and G5 domains (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By the same purification procedure as above, a LN6 mutant, which lacked the G4 and G5 domains, was purified. This preparation, named LN6ΔG4-5, contained a 220-kDa β1 chain, a 210-kDa γ1 chain, and a 160-kDa α3 chain as analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 2, Band C). Furthermore, we prepared a LN6 mutant, which lacked the G3, G4, and G5 domains, named LN6ΔG3-5, from the HT1080/ΔG3-5 cells (14Hirosaki T. Mizushima H. Tsubota Y. Moriyama K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22495-22502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To characterize LN6, we compared some biological activities of the three forms of LN6 (LN6, LN6ΔG4-5, and LN6ΔG3-5), mat-LN5 and some other matrix proteins using three different cell lines: human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, and the rat liver cell line BRL. First, attachment of HaCaT cells was examined by inoculating these cells onto plastic plates precoated with different concentrations of the protein substrates (Fig.3 A). mat-LN5, LN6, and LN6ΔG4-5 efficiently supported the cell attachment, but LN6ΔG3-5 did hardly. Compared on a molar basis assuming a similar coating efficiency, the cell attachment activities of mat-LN5, LN6, and LN6ΔG4-5 were comparable, but higher than those of LN1, LN10/11, and fibronectin. The marked difference of the cell attachment activity between LN6ΔG4-5 and LN6ΔG3-5 suggests that the G3 domain is essential for the high affinity binding of LN6 to integrins. Essentially the same dose-response curves were obtained with HT1080 cells (data not shown). In the case of the BRL cells, LN6ΔG3-5 showed a cell attachment activity similar to those of LN1 and LN10/11 (Fig.3 B). Morphology of HaCaT cells on the different substrates was examined (Fig. 4, a–d). Despite the apparently similar cell attachment activity of mat-LN5, LN6, and LN6ΔG4-5, there was a marked morphological difference between the two LN6 forms. Rapid and extensive spreading of HaCaT cells was induced on mat-LN5 or LN6ΔG4-5, whereas on the LN-6 substrate they barely spread but exhibited some small spikes (or projections). HaCaT cells displayed more flattened morphology on LN10/11 than on mat-LN5 or LN6ΔG4-5. Poor cell spreading on LN6 was reproduced in HT1080 cells (Fig. 4,e–h) and BRL cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the proteolytic processing of laminin α3 chain converts LN6 from the inactive form to the active form regarding its cell spreading activity. To compare integrin requirement of mat-LN5 and two forms of LN6 (LN6 and LN6ΔG4-5), effects of function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies on the attachment of HaCaT cells were examined. The cell attachment activity of LN6 was completely blocked by the anti-integrin α3 or the anti-integrin β1 antibody (Fig.5 A). Almost the same results were obtained for LN6ΔG4-5 and mat-LN5 (data not shown). HaCaT cells are known to express both integrins α3β1and α6β4 (21Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results imply that in HaCaT cells integrin α3β1 is the primary receptor for these laminins, and integrin α6β4 is not functional at least as the initial receptor. On the other hand, attachment of HT1080 cells to LN6 was partially blocked by the anti-integrin α3 antibody but completely by the anti-integrin β1 antibody or the anti-integrin α3 plus anti-integrin α6antibodies (Fig. 5 B). Essentially identical results were obtained for LN6ΔG4-5 and mat-LN5 (data not shown). Since HT1080 cells express integrins α3β1 and α6β1 but not integrin α6β4 (3Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), LN6, and LN6ΔG4-5, as well as mat-LN5, are thought to recognize both integrins α3β1 and α6β1. Integrin α6β1 may work as a secondary (or supplementary) receptor for these laminins. It is also noted that the presence or absence of the G4-5 domain in the α3 chain has practically no effect on the integrin binding specificity of LN6. LN5 is known to require a heat-sensitive helical conformation for the expression of the biological activity (5Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2041477898,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) is a tetrameric assembly of conserved subunits that each contains six transmembrane regions (TMRs) localized near the carboxyl terminus. Receptor subunit assembly into a tetramer appears to be a multideterminant process involving an additive contribution of membrane spanning helices and the short cytosolic carboxyl terminus (residues 2590–2749). Previous studies have shown that of the six membrane-spanning regions in each subunit, the 5th and 6th transmembrane regions, and the carboxyl terminus are strong determinants for assembly. The fifth and sixth TMRs contain numerous β-branched amino acids that may participate in coiled/coil formation via putative leucine zipper motifs. InsP3R truncation mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells and analyzed by sucrose density gradient sedimentation and gel filtration for their ability to assemble. Chemical cross-linking with the homobifunctional reagents sDST or DMS of mammalian and bacterially expressed carboxyl-terminal containing receptor fragments reveals that sequences within the carboxyl terminus confer the formation of subunit dimers. A series of InsP3 receptor carboxyl-terminal fragments and glutathioneS-transferase (GST)/InsP3R chimeras were expressed in Escherichia coli and used in an in vitro assay to elucidate the minimal sequence responsible for association of the carboxyl termini into dimers. The results presented here indicate that this minimal sequence is ∼30 residues in length and is localized between residues 2629 and 2654. These residues are highly conserved between the three InsP3R isoforms (∼80% identity) as well as the ryanodine receptor (∼40% identity) and suggest that a conserved assembly motif may exist between the two intracellular receptor families. We propose that assembly of the InsP3 receptor to a tetramer involves intersubunit interactions mediated through both the membrane-spanning regions and residues 2629–2654 of the carboxyl terminus possibly through the formation of a dimer of dimers.

InsP3 is generated through phosphoinositide turnover via the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C in response to G protein or tyrosine kinase-coupled plasma membrane receptor stimulation. InsP3 rapidly diffuses to the endoplasmic reticulum and binds to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) inducing calcium release transients from intracellular stores. InsP3-mediated calcium signaling is implicated in numerous, diverse cellular processes including cell proliferation/differentiation, transcription, hepatic glycogen metabolism as well as learning and memory (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar, 2Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Williams R.J. Irvine R.F. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3077-3081Google Scholar). The InsP3 receptor family is composed of at least three isoforms that share a high degree of sequence identity. The InsP3R protein is a tetrameric structure resulting from homo- or hetero-oligomerization of the receptor subunits. Each receptor subunit consists of an amino-terminal ligand binding domain of ∼600 amino acids containing many positively charged basic amino acids thought to participate in the ligand binding pocket (3Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Google Scholar, 4Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Google Scholar, 5Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Google Scholar). This region is highly conserved among the three isoforms yet the apparent affinity for InsP3 of each receptor subtype varies considerably (6Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28613-28619Google Scholar). The central ∼1600 amino acids of the receptor is the least conserved region between the isoforms and has been coined the coupling or modulatory domain. This region has been proposed to couple or transduce ligand occupancy to channel opening through a conformational shift and contain numerous sequence motifs for potential modulation of the receptors function. These include modulatory phosphorylation sites as well as ATP, calcium, and calmodulin binding sites. The carboxyl-terminal ∼500 amino acids encode the calcium channel domain and include the six transmembrane-spanning segments. The ion permeation pathway is localized within the sequences encompassing the fifth and sixth transmembrane-spanning segments (7Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Google Scholar). The permeation properties of the three InsP3R isoforms intrinsic calcium channel are very similar. All channels exhibit similar calcium conductances and ionic selectivity. Despite these similarities, InsP3 and calcium differentially regulate the individual receptor isoforms (8Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 834-839Google Scholar, 9Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Google Scholar, 10Mak D.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 435-446Google Scholar). These properties likely account for the heterogeneity in calcium signaling observed in cells expressing more than one isoform of the receptor. In addition to forming the calcium channel, the membrane-spanning sequences are key elements that contribute to receptor subunit assembly into tetramers (3Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Google Scholar, 11Joseph S.K. Boehning D. Pierson S. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Google Scholar, 12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar). In particular, the fifth and sixth transmembrane regions are critical determinants for oligomerization (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding an InsP3R construction in which the first four membrane-spanning sequences were deleted assembled into tetramers and when characterized electrophysiologically, the recombinant protein formed nearly constitutively open calcium channels (7Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Google Scholar). These had very similar permeation properties to those of the wild type receptor. The fifth and sixth membrane-spanning regions ability to form stable oligomers has been proposed to be a consequence of interactions mediated by β-branched amino acid residues, which resemble a leucine zipper motif (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar). Another sequence region identified as critical for oligomerization of the receptor subunits is the cytosolic 160 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. These residues significantly enhance receptor assembly into high apparent molecular weight oligomers (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar). This enhanced assembly was observed with protein contexts containing as few as two transmembrane-spanning regions through constructions containing all six (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar). In addition to receptor subunit assembly, the carboxyl-terminal region has been implicated in interactions with the amino-terminal ligand binding domain and possibly contributes to channel activity (13Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Google Scholar, 14Nakade S. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 125-131Google Scholar, 15Miyazaki S.I. Yuzaki M. Nakade S. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Google Scholar). A notable feature of this region of the InsP3R protein family is the high degree of homology with the ryanodine receptor. In this study we investigated the role of the cytosolic carboxyl-terminal amino acids in the assembly and oligomerization of the InsP3R into functional tetramers. Receptor mammalian expression construct series containing exclusively the 5th, 6th as well as sequences encompassed by both membrane-spanning sequences with progressively truncated carboxyl termini were characterized for their ability to oligomerize using sucrose density gradient sedimentation and size exclusion chromatography. In addition, a series of bacterial expression products derived from the cytosolic carboxyl terminus were used in GST pull-downs and chemical cross-linking experiments to localize potential interactions. These studies reveal that a sequence region of ∼30 amino acids, spanning residues 2629–2654, in the carboxyl terminus confers the formation of subunit dimers and are essential for receptor assembly. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was obtained from Mediatech. Fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Goat serum was purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes, DNA modifying enzymes, and DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and U.S. Biochemical Corp. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and used without further purification. A series of plasmid intermediates containing the type-1 InsP3R transmembrane regions (TMR) 5 and 6 and sequences encompassing 5–6 were prepared in pGEM3Z. pGem3Z was modified by inserting annealed GM123-AATTCTTCGAAGCGGGAAGATCTG/GM124-GATCCAGATCTTCCCGC TTCGAAG into theEcoRI/BamHI-digested vector, introducing uniqueBstBI and BglII sites. Fragments corresponding to fifth, sixth, and fifth through sixth TMRs were generated by PCR. The PCR primers used to generate the TMR sequences were as follows: TMR5, GM018-GCGCCATGGTTCGAAGTGTCACCCGCAATGGACGGCCC (nt 7622–7645) and GM016-ACTAGTCGACGAGATCTTGGTCTTGTTCAAGATAAAGTCATCCTT (nt 7716–7732); TMR6, GM143-GCGCCATGGTTCGAAGGGTGATCTATGAC (nt 8021–8035) and GM002-GTCAAGCTTGTCCCT(T/C)TCCAAGCC(G/A)CAGATGAAGCA (nt 8157–8192); TMRs5–6, GM018 (nt 7622–7645) and GM002 (nt 8157–8192). These products were digested with BstBI/BglII and inserted into similarly digested pGEM3Z to create pGEMTMR5, pGEMTMR6, and pGEMTMR5–6 and verified via DNA sequencing. To these intermediate plasmids, various fragments of the type 1 InsP3R carboxyl terminus were added. To create the plasmids containing the full-length carboxyl-terminal segment the full-length type-1 InsP3R expression plasmid (pCMVI-9, Ref. 16Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Google Scholar) was digested with BglII/XbaI, and the fragment (nt 8140–9471) was then inserted into the similarly digested intermediate pGEMTMR encoding plasmids to generate pGEMTMR5+C, pGEMTMR6+C, and pGEMTMR5–6+C. The creation of the carboxyl-terminal deletion series (-40, -60, -80, -100, -120, and -144 amino acids) was achieved by insertingBglII/XbaI-digested PCR amplification products into similarly digested pGEMTMR intermediates. The 5′ oligonucleotide primer GM021-GGATCCCCATGGACACCTTTGCTGACCTG was constant and corresponded to nt 8097–8114. The 3′ antisense primers contained the termination codon and were as follows: -40C, GM144-CGGAATTCTAGAGTTAGGTGACCAGCTTC, nt 8444–8456; -60C, GM145-CGGAATTCTAGAGTTACCCTTCAGAGTCAC, nt 8383–8396; -80C, GM146-CGGAATTCTAGAGTTATCTTTCCCTGATC, nt 8324–8336; -100C, GM147-CGGAATTCTAGAGTTACACTTTCACCAG, nt 8265–8276; -120C, GM148-CGGAATTCTAGAGTTACTCTTCAAAGGTG, nt 8204–8216); and -144C, GM149-CGGAATTCTAGAGTTAGATCTCTTCCTTC, nt 8132–8144. This process resulted in a pGEM-3Z-based vector series encoding TMR 5, 6, or 5–6 with a sequentially greater truncation of the carboxyl terminus (pGEMTMRX-40, -60, -80, -100, -120, and -144). Final assembly of the TMR/carboxyl-terminal deletion construct series into mammalian expression plasmids was achieved by exchanging theBstBI/XbaI fragment of the full-length type-1 mammalian expression plasmid from pCMVI-9 (see pInsP3R-T1) with the BstBI/XbaI fragment from the intermediate plasmids described above (16Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Google Scholar, 17Ramos-Franco J. Caenepeel S. Fill M. Mignery G.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2783-2793Google Scholar). This resulted in the final series of pTMR5-XC, pTMR6-XC, and pTMR5–6-XC expression constructs (Fig. 2). The amino-terminally truncated series of mammalian expression vectors were prepared using a similar strategy, except that plasmid pCMVI-11 was used as a host vector. This plasmid is missing the 418 amino-terminal amino acid residues, tetramerizes, and does not bind InsP3 (16Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Google Scholar). Each of the BstBI/XbaI fragments of pGEMTMR5–6-XC series were exchanged for the wild type sequences of pCMVI-11 producing the amino-terminally truncated pΔNH2TMR5–6-XC series of clones (see Fig. 2). The chimeric glutathione S-transferase (GST)/InsP3R carboxyl termini constructs were built by digesting pGEX-2T with BamHI/EcoRI and inserting similarly digested PCR-amplified fragments. The constructs, pGEXI2590–2749 and pGEXI2590–2669 were built with the identical 5′ primer, GM201-CGGGATCCGACACCTTTGCTGACCTG (nt 8096–8114). The 3′ antisense primer for pGEXI2590–2749 was GM022-GGAATTCTTAGGCTGGCTGCTGTGGG (nt 8561–8579) and for pGEXI2590–2669 was GM146-CGGAATTCTAGAGTTATCTTTCCCTGATC (nt 8324–8336). pGEXI2625–2645 was assembled with the primer pair of GM222-CGGGATCCGTCACCTTTGAAGAG (nt 8200–8216) and GM223-CGGAATTCTACACGATGAAGCACAG (nt 8250–8264). pGEXI2646–2665 used the pair of GM224-CGGGATCCCTGGTGAAAGTGAAGG (nt 8265–8280) and GM225-CGGAATTCTACATCTCTGCCACGTAG (nt 8309–8324). pGEXI2635–2654 was generated using the primer pair of GM226-CGGGATCCCACAACATGTGGC (nt 8232–8244) and GM227-CGGAATTCTACTCGGTGGAGTCC (nt 8279–8293). The non-chimeric bacterially expressed carboxyl-terminal fragments were generated by PCR amplification followed by digestion and insertion intoBamHI/NcoI digested pET-8C (18Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). For the carboxyl-terminal deletion series the same 5′ primer was used, GM021-GGATCCCCATGGACACCTTTGCTGACCTG (nt 8097–8114). The 3′ antisense primers were as follows: pETI2590–2749, GM202-CGGGATCCTTAGGCTGGCTGCTGTGGG (nt 8561–8580); pETI2590–2709, GM203-CGGGATCCTTAGGTGACCAGCTTCATGGTG (nt 8438–8456); pETI2590–2689, GM204-CGGGATCCTTACCCTTCAGAGTCAC (nt 8383–8396); pETI2590–2669, GM205-CGGGATCCTTATCTTTCCCTGATC (nt 8324–8336); pETI2590–2649, GM206-CGGGATCCTTACACTTTCACCAG (nt 8265–8276) and pETI2590–2629, GM207-CGGGATCCTTACTCTTCAAAGGTG (nt 8204–8216). Truncations from the amino-terminal end of the carboxyl-terminal region used the same 3′ antisense primer, GM202-CGGGATCCTTAGGCTGGCTGCTGTGGG (nt 8561–8580). The 5′ primers were as follows: pETI2602–2749, GM209-GGATCCCCATGGGGAAGGAAGAGATC (nt 8132–8144); pETI2625–2749, GM210-GGATCCCCATGGTCACCTTTGAAGAG (nt 8202–8216); pETI2645–2749, GM211-GGATCCCCATGGTGCTGGTGAAAGTG (nt 8262–8276) and pETI2666–2749, GM212-GGATCCCCATGGGGATCAGGGAAAGAAACC (nt 8324–8340). The two bacterial expression clones expressing carboxyl-terminal fragments, pETI2602–2669 and pETI2625–2669, were assembled using the same 3′ antisense primer, GM205-CGGGATCCTTATCTTTCCCTGATC (nt 8324–8336). The 5′ primers were GM209-GGATCCCCATGGGGAAGGAAGAGATC (nt 8132–8144) and GM210-GGATCCCCATGGTCACCTTTGAAGAG (nt 8202–8216) for pETI2602–2669 and pETI2625–2669, respectively. Frozen rabbit heart ventricle (1 gram) was ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen and solubilized with GTC (4m guanidinium thiocyanate, 20 mm sodium acetate, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.5% sarkosyl). The sample was clarified by 15 min, 3220 ×g, 20 °C centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was layered on top of a 5.7 m cesium chloride cushion and centrifuged for 16 h at 26,700 rpm, 20 °C in a SW41 rotor. The total RNA pellet was allowed to air dry and dissolved in nuclease-free water, precipitated, and quantitated. 5 μg of the total RNA was used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis. Each 50-μl reaction contained 500 μm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 1 μg of pd(N)6 random hexamer (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol plus 200–400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and heat-inactivated for 5 min at 95 °C. The RyR carboxyl-terminal clone was built in modified pET-8C. Oligonucleotides GM230-GATCCTGCAGAGCTTCGAACACATCCGCGAGGGCAAGTTCGACGAGTAG and GM231-GATCCTACTCGTCGAACTTGCCCTCGCGGATGTGTTCGAAGCTCTGCAG were annealed and inserted into BamHI-digested pET-8C to introduce aBstBI site followed by the coding sequence for the final 11 residues of the 116-kDa subunit of the proton pump. Next the reverse-transcribed RNA from rabbit heart ventricle was used as a template for PCR with the primer pair GM232-CATGCCATGGGATCCGATGCTTTTGGAGAACTCAGAGACC (nt 14918–14942) and GM233-GGAATTCGAAATTTAGCTGGTCTTCATACTGTTTCCGG (nt 15190–15218) to amplify the DNA encoding the final 100 residues of the RyR-2 carboxyl terminus. Modified vector and PCR products were digested withBstBI/NcoI and ligated together to generate pETR4870–4969. The identity of the pETR4870–4969 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with InsP3R plasmid DNA using the DEAE-dextran method (19Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA cloning. II. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48–72 h prior to harvesting for analysis. Transfected COS-1 cells were harvested 48–72 h post-transfection. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by 20 passages through a 27.5-gauge needle. Microsomal fractions were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at (106,120 × g). Microsomes were resuspended in buffer and solubilized by adjusting the buffer to 1% CHAPS and mixing on ice for 1–2 h. Prior to oligomerization analysis, the solubilized samples had the insoluble fraction removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at (106,120 × g) two times followed by passage through a 0.22-μm cellulose-acetate Spin-X centrifuge filter (Corning; Corning, NY). Sucrose gradients were run as previously described (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar). Essentially, 2 ml of 5–20% continuous sucrose gradients were centrifuged for 4 h and 55 min, 4 °C, at 166,320 × g in a Beckman TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor. Gradients were subsequently fractionated into 25 × 80-μl aliquots, and InsP3R protein was detected by immunoblotting. FPLC analyses were performed with anAmersham Biosciences AB Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. The mobile phase was 1% CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and run at 0.4 ml/min. The column eluates were fractionated into 0.25-ml aliquots. BL21-CodonPlus Competent Cells (Stratagene) harboring the InsP3R plasmids were cultured overnight in Luria Broth + 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol + 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was diluted and then incubated at 37 °C until reaching an optical density (λ, 600 nm) of 0.7. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were incubated for an additional 3–4 h. Cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 20 min at (48,000 × g). Cell pellets were scraped into liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further use. Frozen bacterial cell pellets were weighed out, and lysis buffer was added STET (8% sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-CL, pH 8.0, 50 mmEDTA, 0.25% lysozyme, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with shaking at ambient temperature for 20 min. Samples were sonicated 2 × 30 s and the DNase and RNase A added to 4 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Samples were incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min after the addition with shaking. Samples centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at (15,000 × g), and supernatants were decanted. Pellets were washed three times in Wash Buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and a final wash in 0.1 mTris-CL (pH 8.5), 1 m urea, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold water and frozen at −80 °C. Bacterial expression products were solubilized in 8 m urea, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 3 mm dithiothreitol. Following solubilization, the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at (106,120 ×g). Pellets were discarded, and the solubilized protein was subjected to dialysis against 4 × 1000 volumes of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Recovered dialysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at (106,120 × g) to remove the insoluble fraction and ∼25% of each sample removed for SDS/PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining to identify the initial starting material. The remainder of the sample was interacted with glutathione-Sepharose MicroSpin GST Purification Module mini-columns (Amersham Biosciences). Columns were washed 3 × 0.5 ml with the above dialysis buffer. Bound material was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Eluted material was run on SDS/PAGE and Coomassie-stained to reveal eluted proteins. COS cell expression products were resolved on 5% SDS/PAGE with the exception of the chemically cross-linked material, which was resolved on 4% SDS/PAGE. Bacterially expressed proteins were run on 14% SDS/PAGE and Tris/Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (20Schagger H. Von-Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). The Tris/Tricine resolving gels were 16.5%T/3%C with and without 10%T/3%C spacer gels and a 4%T/3%C stacking gel. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted using chemiluminescent reagents (AmershamBiosciences). The InsP3R-specific amino-terminal (T1NH) and carboxyl-terminal (T1C) polyclonal antibodies were generated against residues 308–326 of the type-1 SIb alternatively spliced isoform and the 19 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, respectively (17Ramos-Franco J. Caenepeel S. Fill M. Mignery G.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2783-2793Google Scholar). The luminal loop antipeptide antibody (V753) is directed against residues 2463–2476 of the type-1 receptor. The proton pump tag antibody is directed against the 11 carboxyl-terminal residues of the 116-kDa subunit of the proton pump (3Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Google Scholar, 12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar). An additional peptide antibody, B188, was used in Western blotting and is directed against residues 2607–2623 of the type-1 InsP3R. All InsP3R peptide antibodies were affinity-purified using immunogenic peptide. The GST antibody was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. The secondary antibody used was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Solubilized protein was chemically cross-linked with either sulfo-disuccinimidyl tartrate (sDST) or dimethyl suberimidate (DMS). Final reactions had various millimolar amounts of freshly prepared cross-linking reagent added to 0.25 mg/ml solubilized protein, 200 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were incubated at ambient temperature for 45 min and then quenched with the addition of 4× SDS/PAGE sample buffer. Samples were immediately boiled and run on SDS/PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. It is well established that the multiple membrane-spanning sequences of the InsP3R subunits are essential determinants for the targeting, assembly, and formation of the intrinsic calcium release channel (3Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Google Scholar, 7Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Google Scholar, 12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J.

The 5th and 6th membrane-spanning sequences, which together with the interceding luminal loop constitute the channel pore, are efficiently assembled into tetramers in the presence of the cytoplasmic carboxyl termini. Previously, Galvanet al. (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar) demonstrated that the inclusion of the carboxyl terminus with membrane-spanning region deletions augmented receptor subunit assembly into oligomers. The apparently additive affect of the carboxyl terminus was observed with recombinant protein containing as few as two through those containing all six membrane-spanning regions (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar). In addition, yeast two-hybrid experiments using the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal fragment indicated a potential interaction between the termini. In support of these observations, Magnino et al. (22Magnino F. Schmidt K. Mery L. Dufour J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5981-5988Google Scholar) reported similar observations using the type-2 InsP3R. In a previous study (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar) we noted that the inclusion of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus enhanced InsP3R membrane-spanning region truncation expression product assembly. This enhancement was observed in all contexts of membrane-spanning regions containing as few as two and as many as all six and resulted in a substantial shift of expression products to more dense regions of the sucrose gradients. The effect of the receptor carboxyl terminus upon the assembly of the InsP3R containing the full complement of membrane-spanning sequences is illustrated in Fig. 1. In this series of immunoblots the full-length (pInsP3R-T1, TMR1–6+C) and a carboxyl-terminally truncated receptor (TMR1–6-C) were sedimented through 5–20% sucrose gradients either independently or as mixed samples. The expression products of the protein lacking the carboxyl termini sedimented with a distinct high density component yet, as previously observed (12Galvan D. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Google Scholar), there was a substantial amount of material that did not sediment to density gradient positions consistent with a high"
https://openalex.org/W1973937709,"During clathrin-mediated endocytosis Hsc70, supported by the J-domain protein auxilin, uncoats clathrin-coated vesicles. Auxilin contains both a clathrin-binding domain and a J-domain that binds Hsc70, and it has been suggested that these two domains are both necessary and sufficient for auxilin activity. To test this hypothesis, we created a chimeric protein consisting of the J-domain of auxilin linked to the clathrin-binding domain of the assembly protein AP180. This chimera supported uncoating, but unlike auxilin it acted stoichiometrically rather than catalytically because, like Hsc70, it remained associated with the uncoated clathrin. This observation supports our proposal that Hsc70 chaperones uncoated clathrin by inducing formation of a stable Hsc70-clathrin-AP complex. It also shows that Hsc70 acts by dissociating individual clathrin triskelions rather than cooperatively destabilizing clathrin-coated vesicles. Because the chimera lacks the C-terminal subdomain of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain, it seemed possible that this subdomain is required for auxilin to act catalytically, and indeed its deletion caused auxilin to act stoichiometrically. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal subdomain weakened auxilin-clathrin binding and prevented auxilin from polymerizing clathrin. Therefore the C-terminal subdomain of the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin is required for auxilin to act catalytically, whereas the N-terminal subdomain strengthens auxilin-clathrin binding. During clathrin-mediated endocytosis Hsc70, supported by the J-domain protein auxilin, uncoats clathrin-coated vesicles.

Many of the functions carried out by the Hsc70 (the constitutive isoform of Hsp70) class of molecular chaperones both in vivo and in vitro require the presence of J-domain proteins (1Silver P.A.

Furthermore, knockout of auxilin in yeast or knockdown of auxilin in Caenorhabditis elegans prevents endocytosis from taking place (5Pishvaee B. Costaguta G. Yeung B.G. Ryazantsev S. Greener T.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), showing that aside from Hsc70, auxilin is also required for uncoating to take place in these organisms. J-domain proteins are thought to function by inducing substrates to bind to Hsc70, and this has been directly demonstrated for auxilin by showing that auxilin is required for ATP-dependent binding of Hsc70 at pH 6, where there is no uncoating (8Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of action of J-domain proteins is not completely understood, it is generally thought that they first bind substrate and then transfer the substrate to Hsc70-ATP and, finally, induce one round of rapid ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 (9King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12452-12459Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress. Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). This stabilizes the binding of substrate because most substrates detach rapidly from Hsc70-ATP but very slowly from Hsc70-ADP (11Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E.

To carry out their function J-domain proteins must contain both a J-domain that interacts with Hsc70 and a substrate-binding domain that interacts with substrate. In fact, mammalian auxilin, a multi-domain protein, consists of at least three domains, an N-terminal Pten-like domain (15Haynie D.T. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2643-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of unknown function, a clathrin-binding domain, and a C-terminal J-domain (4Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition to these domains there is a kinase domain in the ubiquitously expressed form of auxilin called GAK (16Greener T. Zhao X. Nojima H. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1365-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar,17Umeda A. Meyerholz A. Ungewickell E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, yeast auxilin, which contains only the clathrin-binding domain and J-domain, supports uncoating (5Pishvaee B. Costaguta G. Yeung B.G. Ryazantsev S. Greener T. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. McCaffery J.M. Payne G.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Lemmon S.K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R49-R52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro, a recombinant fragment of mammalian auxilin consisting of just the clathrin-binding domain and the J-domain supports uncoating and clathrin polymerization just like intact auxilin (16Greener T. Zhao X. Nojima H. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1365-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and therefore in this paper we will simply refer to this recombinant fragment as auxilin. Recently, Ungewickell and co-workers (20Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) found that the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin can be further divided into two subdomains. The C-terminal subdomain, which is conserved in both GAK and C. elegans auxilin (7Greener T. Grant B. Zhang Y. Wu X. Greene L.E. Hirsh D. Eisenberg E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Greener T. Zhao X. Nojima H. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1365-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Umeda A. Meyerholz A. Ungewickell E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), binds only to the distal domain of clathrin whereas the N-terminal subdomain binds to both the distal and terminal domains of clathrin (20Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This has important implications in understanding how auxilin might interact with clathrin because we had previously shown that the terminal domain of clathrin is not necessary for the uncoating of clathrin baskets by Hsc70 (4Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Ungewickell and co-workers (19Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) also found that auxilin activity is partially restored when its clathrin-binding domain and J-domain of auxilin are linked head to head via glutathioneS-transferase dimerization. On this basis they suggested that the simple combination of a clathrin-binding domain and a J-domain, with the two domains bringing clathrin baskets and Hsc70 in proximity to each other, may be sufficient for auxilin to support uncoating by Hsc70. If this is indeed the case it seemed possible that the source of the clathrin-binding domain would not affect the activity of auxilin. To test this hypothesis, we produced a chimeric protein derived from the 58-kDa C-terminal clathrin-binding domain of neuronal-specific, monomeric assembly protein AP180 (21Ahle S. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3143-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10933-10939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the J-domain of auxilin (4Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We then determined whether this chimera supports uncoating by Hsc70 in vitro. Our results showed that the chimera supports uncoating by Hsc70, but surprisingly it acts stoichiometrically rather than catalytically. Rather than dissociating from uncoated clathrin and recycling to support further uncoating, like both Hsc70 and APs, it is stably incorporated into the uncoated Hsc70-clathrin complex. This observation supports our earlier proposal that a stable Hsc70-clathrin-AP complex forms following uncoating (23Jiang R. Gao B. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8439-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results also show that, despite the intertwined nature of clathrin baskets, Hsc70 acts by dissociating individual clathrin triskelions rather than destabilizing the entire clathrin baskets. Because the chimera lacks the C-terminal subdomain of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain that specifically binds to the distal domain of clathrin, it seemed possible that it was this domain needed for auxilin to act catalytically. To test this point we linked the auxilin J-domain directly to the N-terminal subdomain of auxilin and found that this deletion mutant protein also acts stoichiometrically rather than catalytically. On the other hand, we found that the 20-kDa C-terminal portion of auxilin consisting only of the C-terminal portion of the clathrin-binding domain and the J-domain acts catalytically but does not support polymerization of clathrin into baskets and binds to clathrin baskets much more weakly than intact auxilin. Therefore, it appears that the C-terminal portion of the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin is required for auxilin to act catalytically, whereas the N-terminal portion of the clathrin-binding domain is required for auxilin to induce clathrin polymerization and strengthens the binding of auxilin to clathrin baskets. ATP, creatine phosphokinase, and phosphocreatine were from Sigma. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were from Invitrogen. PQE30 vector, host cell M15, and His6 affinity resin were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). PCR kits were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [14C]Formaldehyde and [32P]ATP were from New England Nuclear (Norwich, CT). The constructs derived from auxilin and AP180 1The abbreviations used are: AP, assembly proteins; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type are shown in Fig.1. To make the 58-kDa C-terminal domain of AP180 and the chimera composed of the 58-kDa C-terminal domain of AP180 and the J-domain of auxilin, which will be referred to as C58 and C58J, respectively, we used mouse AP180 cDNA (accession number M83985) as a template for a PCR. In making C58J, the primers were 5′-ACTATCGACGGATCCCCGCCAGTTG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-ATTGAAGCTTAAATTGTTTACAAGAAATCCTT-3′ (antisense primer). A BamHI site was introduced into the sense primer, and a HindIII site was introduced into antisense primer. The PCR product that encodes 577 amino acids was subcloned into PQE30 at the BamHI and HindIII sites. To amplify the C-terminal 58-kDa putative clathrin assembly domain of AP180, we performed PCR using mouse AP180 cDNA as a template. A sense primer (5′-ACTATCGACGGATCCCCGCCAGTTG-3′) that contains a BamHI site and an antisense primer (5′-CTTAAATTGTTTAGGCGCCATCCTTGATGTT-3′) that contains a NarI site were used for PCR. To amplify the J-domain of auxilin, we performed PCR using bovine full-length auxilin cDNA (accession number U09237) as a template. A sense primer (5′-ATGGCTAAGGAGATGGGCGCCGAGAAG-3′) that contains aNarI site and an antisense primer (5′-CGGGTCTGCAGCAGAAATGGAAAAGCTTA-3′) that contains aHindIII site were used for PCR. After ligation of these two PCR products by NarI site, C58J chimera fragment that encodes 577 amino acids from AP180 and 96 amino acids from auxilin J-domain was subcloned into PQE 30 at the BamHI andHindIII sites. The 54-kDa C-terminal of auxilin formed by PCR from the brain auxilin cDNA inserted into the PGEX4T1 vector using 5′-GTCTTAGGAAGATCTGCTCCAATAGATATCCCTCC-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-AGAAATGGAAAAGTCGACAAGTTAATACAAGGG-3′ as the antisense primer. This was subcloned into pQE30 at the BamHI and PstI sites. This construct was cut using SphI and PstI and subcloned into pQE32 to make the 20-kDa C-terminal fragment of auxilin (auxilin-C20). The 16-kDa fragment (auxilin-C16) was derived from the 54-kDa fragment by using 5′-GCAGCTGACTTTGAAAGATCTCTCTCTGGTCAAGG-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-AGCAGAAATGGAAAAGCTCTGCAGTTAATACAAGGG-3′ as the antisense primer. The PCR product was subcloned into pQE30 at the BglII andPstI sites. The internal truncated form of auxilin (Δ-auxilin) was made from two PCR products derived from the 54-kDa C-terminal domain of clathrin that were ligated together at theEcoRI site. The clathrin domain was derived using the same sense primer as in the 54-kDa C-terminal construct and 5′-GAAGCTCACGTCGACGTTGAATTCGTTCTGGGGAGAGGAGTG-3′ for the antisense primer. The J- domain was derived using 5′-TCCACAATGCACACTGAATTCTGGGCTGGG-3′ for the sense primer and the same antisense primer as for the 54-kDa C-terminal domain. The PCR product was subcloned into PQE30. C58 or C58J plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli M15 for protein expression. Auxilin constructs were transformed into E. coli TG100 for protein expression (16Greener T. Zhao X. Nojima H. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1365-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown for 2 h before expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for another 4 h at 25 °C. His6 fusion proteins were purified on nickel-agarose resin according to Qiagen procedures. Hsc70 was prepared from bovine brains as described previously by Greene and Eisenberg (24Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clathrin was extracted from clathrin-coated vesicles using 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.0, and the high speed supernatant containing clathrin and assembly proteins was concentrated and loaded onto a preparative Superose 6 filtration column (2.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated in 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. Fractions the of clathrin peak and the assembly protein peak were pooled and stored in 0.5 m Tris at 4 °C. To obtain clathrin free of auxilin, the clathrin was double-purified on a Superose 6 column (23Jiang R. Gao B. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8439-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). WT and K71E Hsp70 were produced as recombinant proteins as described previously (25Rajapandi T. Wu C. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7244-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine the concentration of auxilin, C58, and C58J, these recombinant proteins were repurified by assembling them with clathrin, depolymerizing the baskets, and affinity chromatography on a nickel-agarose column. The concentrations of these proteins were determined from their molar extinction coefficients and absorbances at 280 nm. Known concentrations of these proteins were then run on Coomassie Blue gels, and their intensity was standardized against a known concentration of Hsc70. The concentration of recombinant proteins were then routinely determined by comparison of their Coomassie Blue staining with the Hsc70 standard on SDS gels. Purified APs were trace-methylated according to the procedure of Jentoft and Dearborn (26Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4359-4365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 5 mm sodium cyanoborohydride and 10 FCi of [14C]formaldehyde. AP baskets were made by overnight dialysis against 0.1 m MES, 1 mm DTT (pH 6.5), and pure clathrin baskets were made by dialysis against 0.1m MES, 1 mm DTT (pH 6.0). After centrifugation for 1 h at 150,000 × g, the pellet was suspended in buffer A, 20 mm MES (pH 6.0) or 20 mmimidazole (pH 7.0), 2 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mm DTT. The concentration of clathrin in prepared baskets was determined after solubilizing the baskets with 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0. Pure clathrin baskets used in the uncoating experiments at pH 7.0 were made by polymerizing double-purified clathrin by overnight dialysis against 10 mm MES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5. Polymerized AP-clathrin baskets were prepared as described previously (23Jiang R. Gao B. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8439-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both the AP-clathrin baskets and the pure clathrin baskets were stable for at least 2 days. Uncoating and binding assays were done at 25 °C in buffer A at pH 7.0 and 6.0, respectively. Uncoating of clathrin by Hsc70 and binding of Hsc70 to baskets were routinely performed by incubating Hsc70 with baskets at 25 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 30 units/ml of creatine phosphokinase and 15 mm phosphocreatine. The amount of clathrin released from baskets or Hsc70 not bound to baskets was determined by ultracentrifugation of 0.15-ml aliquots of reaction mixture in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge at 400,000 × g for 6 min. The clathrin released or the unbound Hsc70 in the supernatant was quantified by SDS-PAGE followed by gel scanning on a LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer. The constructs used are shown in Fig.1. We first compared the ability of C58 and the chimera C58J, composed of the 58-kDa C-terminal clathrin-binding domain of AP180 and the J-domain of auxilin, to bind to clathrin and induce its polymerization. Both recombinant proteins induced the polymerization of clathrin to clathrin baskets (Fig.2 A) and bound polymerized clathrin (Fig. 2 B) at a 1:1 molar ratio of recombinant protein to clathrin triskelions. Furthermore, when equal amounts of both recombinants were added in excess to the clathrin baskets, they bound in equal amounts, and together bound at a 1 to1 molar ratio to the clathrin baskets. This shows that the two recombinant proteins bind with equal affinity to the same binding site on clathrin (Fig.2 B, open circles and diamonds). Therefore, the addition of the auxilin J-domain to C58 had no effect on its ability to polymerize clathrin or to bind to the resulting clathrin baskets. Interestingly, although auxilin, like C58 and C58J, induced clathrin polymerization at a 1:1 molar ratio to clathrin (Fig.2 A, solid triangles), it bound to clathrin baskets at a 3 to 1 molar ratio to clathrin (Fig. 2 B,solid triangles). Therefore, there are clear differences in the interactions of auxilin and C58J with clathrin baskets, making it particularly interesting to determine whether C58J, like auxilin, supports uncoating of clathrin baskets by Hsc70 When catalytic amounts of auxilin were added to clathrin baskets prepared with the assembly protein C-58, there was stoichiometric uncoating by Hsc70 (Fig.3, circles). In contrast, when catalytic amounts of C58J were added to these same clathrin baskets, we obtained almost no uncoating of the clathrin baskets (Fig. 3,squares). At first glance, this suggests that C58J does not support uncoating by Hsc70. However, when we prepared the clathrin baskets by using C58J rather than C58 as an assembly protein, the C58J-clathrin baskets were uncoated by Hsc70 with the same biphasic time course as occurs when auxilin supports uncoating (Fig. 3,diamonds). Furthermore, three Hsc70s were required to uncoat each clathrin triskelion during the rapid initial burst of uncoating, showing that Hsc70 uncoated the C58J-clathrin baskets stoichiometrically, just as occurs with auxilin (24Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because C58J was used as an AP in this experiment, it was present at a 1:1 molar ratio to clathrin. Therefore, these data suggest that C58J indeed supports uncoating but does so stoichiometrically rather than catalytically. The inability of C58J to support catalytic uncoating does not occur because it is unable to move rapidly from site to site on the clathrin. Like auxilin (Fig. 4 A,section 1), clathrin baskets with bound C58J also rapidly exchanged with free C58 and C58J (Fig. 4 A, sections 2–4). Furthermore, the close agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical values given in sections 2–4confirm that, as shown in Fig. 2, C58 and C58J bind with equal affinity to the same single binding site on clathrin. It also appears that one of the three sites where auxilin binds to clathrin baskets probably overlaps the site where C58 and C58J bind because the addition of a large excess of free auxilin displaced about two-thirds of the bound C58J (data not shown). If auxilin and C58J bind to the same site on clathrin baskets and exchange rapidly with free recombinant protein, why does auxilin act catalytically whereas C58J does not? To investigate this question, we first confirmed that C58J acts stoichiometrically by measuring the uncoating of clathrin baskets polymerized with varying ratios of C58J and C58. Fig. 5 A shows that the amount of uncoating was proportional to the amount of C58J present in the clathrin baskets. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that only clathrin molecules complexed with C58J are uncoated, and once this uncoating occurs, unlike auxilin, C58J is not able to dissociate from the uncoated clathrin and return to the baskets to support further uncoating. This conclusion is supported by the data in Fig.4 B where we show that when baskets polymerized with equal concentrations of C58 and C58J were uncoated by Hsc70, only C58J but not C58 was released from the baskets as the clathrin was uncoated. Therefore, the simplest explanation of our data is that, in contrast to auxilin but like Hsc70 (23Jiang R. Gao B. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8439-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the released C58J forms a stable complex with the uncoated clathrin preventing C58J from supporting further uncoating. These results suggest that, following uncoating, C58J is acting as a typical AP because we previously showed that the uncoated clathrin-Hsc70 complex is stable only if it also has an AP associated with it (23Jiang R. Gao B. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8439-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the presence of trace amounts of auxilin, Hsc70 acted catalytically rather than stoichiometrically in uncoating pure clathrin baskets that lacked APs presumably because in the absence of APs the Hsc70 could not form a stable complex with the released clathrin (23Jiang R. Gao B. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8439-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, if C58J were acting as an AP, both Hsc70 and C58J should act stoichiometrically rather than catalytically during the uncoating of pure clathrin baskets because both Hsc70 and C58J should form a stable complex with the released clathrin, and thus the amount of uncoating should be equal to the amount of added C58J. Fig.5 B shows that this was the case. Even with pure clathrin baskets the amount of uncoating was limited by the amount of C58J added to the baskets (circles), unlike the results obtained with trace amounts of auxilin (squares). The N-terminal portion of the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin shows some similarity with the clathrin-binding domain of AP180 and has been found to bind to both the terminal and distal domains of clathrin (20Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C-terminal portion of the clathrin-binding domain binds only to the distal portion of clathrin (20Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and shows no homology with the clathrin-binding domain of AP-180. Because one of the major differences between C58J and auxilin is that C58J lacks this C-terminal portion of the clathrin-binding domain, it is possible that this portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain is required for auxilin to act catalytically. To test this point we first investigated the properties using the truncated auxilin, auxilin-C20. Auxilin-C20 was unable to induce polymerization of clathrin under our standard conditions for polymerization, although at high concentrations it did induce a small amount of clathrin to sediment. Examination of this sedimentable material by electron microscopy showed that it did not consist of clathrin baskets (data not shown). In contrast, Ungewickell and co-workers (20Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) carried out polymerization with a similar recombinant fragment in the presence of 2 mmCa2+ and found that it did promote polymerization. In agreement with the results of Ungewickell and co-workers (20Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we found that auxilin-C20 did support clathrin uncoating by Hsc70, and furthermore, we found that it acted catalytically rather than stoichiometrically (Fig. 6 A). Although approximately three times more auxilin-C20 than auxilin was necessary to support uncoating by Hsc70 (Fig. 6 A, open circles versus open squares), we also found that at pH 7 auxilin-C20 bound to clathrin baskets polymerized by C58 more weakly than either C58J or auxilin, both of which bound stoichiometrically to clathrin baskets (data not shown). When this weak binding is taken into consideration, our data suggest that the bound auxilin-C20 is as effective as auxilin in supporting catalytic uncoating of clathrin baskets. We next investigated whether the 10-kDa clathrin-binding region adjacent to the J-domain is required for auxilin to support catalytic uncoating of AP-clathrin baskets. First, we found that a auxilin-C16 was almost completely inactive in supporting uncoating by Hsc70 (Fig.6 A, solid squares). Therefore, the minimum portion of auxilin capable of supporting uncoating by Hsc70 is the J-domain in combination with the full 10-kDa clathrin-binding region. Next, we deleted this 10-kDa region clathrin-binding region from auxilin and examined the ability of this mutated auxilin to bind to clathrin, to polymerize it, and to catalytically support uncoating. Table I shows that Δ-auxilin induced polymerization of clathrin just like auxilin, and furthermore, like auxilin it bound to the resulting clathrin baskets at a 3:1 molar ratio. However, Δ-auxilin supported uncoating poorly. It did not support catalytic uncoating of clathrin baskets prepared with C58 as an assembly protein (Fig. 6 A, solid circles). Rather, as shown in Fig. 6 B (squares), Hsc70 only uncoated clathrin baskets polymerized with Δ-auxilin, and even in this case, the time course of uncoating was considerably slower than with intact auxilin. Furthermore, when clathrin was polymerized with two Δ-auxilins with mutated J-domains and unmodified Δ-auxilin per clathrin (Fig. 6 B, circles), the resulting clathrin baskets still could not be uncoated by Hsc70, showing that only clathrin baskets containing three Δ-auxilins/clathrin can be uncoated. Altogether these data show that the C58J was more effective in supporting uncoating than the Δ-auxilin. Therefore, the 10-kDa domain adjacent to the J-domain appears to be necessary for auxilin to catalytically support uncoating by Hsc70.Table IPolymerization of clathrin by Δ-auxilinΔ-Auxilin addedClathrin polymerizedμmμm0.30.20.50.41.00.51.50.52.00.51-aThe resuspended pellet had three Δ-auxilins bound per clathrin triskelion as determined from the densitometry of the Coomassie Blue bands on SDS gels.The experiment was performed as described for Fig. 1 A using 0.5 μm in clathrin.1-a The resuspended pellet had three Δ-auxilins bound per clathrin triskelion as determined from the densitometry of the Coomassie Blue bands on SDS gels. Open table in a new tab The experiment was performed as described for Fig. 1 A using 0.5 μm in clathrin. We previously showed that at pH 6 where uncoating does not occur, intact auxilin catalytically induces the binding of Hsc70-ATP to both pure clathrin baskets (8Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and AP180-clathrin baskets (4Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), a reaction that is reversed when the ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP. Fig.7 confirms this effect and also shows that somewhat more auxilin is required to induce Hsc70 binding to C58-clathrin baskets than to pure clathrin baskets, although in both cases the auxilin acts catalytically (open versus solid circles). We obtained a similar result with C58J (Fig. 7, open versus solid triangles). Therefore, although C58J acts stoichiometrically at pH 7, because it forms an irreversible complex with the uncoated clathrin, at pH 6, where uncoating does not occur, it acts catalytically to induce Hsc70 binding just like auxilin. In contrast, Δ-auxilin did not induce binding of Hsc70 even when added to pure clathrin baskets (Fig. 7, diamonds). It induced Hsc70 binding only when it was used to polymerize the clathrin baskets (data not shown), just as was required for it to induce uncoating by Hsc70. Therefore, the absence of the 10-kDa domain of auxilin adjacent to the J-domain seems to interfere more with the activity of auxilin itself than with the activity of the C58J chimera. We previously showed that the K71E Hsp70 mutant, which does not hydrolyze ATP, cannot uncoat clathrin-coated vesicles at pH 7 and is not induced to bind to mixed AP clathrin baskets at pH 6 by catalytic amounts of auxilin (25Rajapandi T. Wu C. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7244-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We now find that auxilin can induce binding of K71E Hsp70 with bound ATP to clathrin baskets at pH 6, but it does so stoichiometrically rather than catalytically (Fig.8 A). When one K71E Hsp70 was added per clathrin triskelion in the baskets, one auxilin was required for each of the Hsp70s induced to bind to the baskets (Fig.8 A), but as with the binding of WT Hsp70 to clathrin baskets, the binding of K71E Hsp70 was reversed in ADP (data not shown). As expected, in contrast to what we observed with WT Hsc70 (8Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), this binding was not accompanied by activation of the ATPase activity of K71E Hsp70 by auxilin baskets (data not shown), presumably because K71E Hsp70 does not have any ATPase activity. The auxilin-induced binding was not due simply to K71E Hsp70 binding directly to the auxilin on the baskets. When three K71E Hsp70s were added per clathrin triskelion in the baskets, each auxilin induced three K71E Hsp70s to bind to each clathrin triskelion in the baskets (Fig. 8 B). This binding could not have been due to the direct interaction of K71E Hsp70 with auxilin because WT Hsc70 binds to isolated auxilin at a 1:1 molar ratio (27Jiang R.F. Greener T. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6141-6145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although WT Hsp70 binds to His6-auxilin immobilized on a nickel-agarose column, K71E Hsc70 does not even bind to immobilized His6-auxilin (data not shown). ATP hydrolysis is therefore not necessary to induce binding to clathrin by auxilin at pH 6. However, the catalytic induction of Hsc70 binding to clathrin by auxilin requires ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70, perhaps to release the auxilin from the uncoated Hsc70-clathrin complex so that it can induce multiple binding cycles of Hsc70 to the baskets, in addition to the 10-kDa clathrin-binding domain adjacent to the J-domain of Hsc70. During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the molecular chaperone Hsc70 carries out key functions for which the J-domain protein auxilin is required. It has been postulated (10Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress. Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 28Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that, in general, J-domain proteins act by inducing substrates to bind to Hsc70, and in agreement with this view, we previously showed that auxilin acts by inducing Hsc70 to bind to clathrin baskets (8Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to its C-terminal J-domain, auxilin has a central clathrin-binding domain and an N-terminal Pten-like domain. However, only the clathrin-binding domain and the J-domain are required for auxilin to support uncoating by Hsc70in vitro, and for this reason it has been suggested that auxilin acts simply by juxtaposing clathrin baskets with Hsc70 so that Hsc70 can bind to the clathrin baskets and carry out uncoating (19Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If this were the case, it seemed possible that linking any clathrin-binding domain to the auxilin J-domain would result in a chimera that would function like auxilin. We found that C58J does support uncoating by Hsc70 in vitro, but unlike auxilin, which supports uncoating catalytically, C58J supports uncoating stoichiometrically. We showed that, when clathrin baskets were polymerized by a mixture of C58 and C58J, both recombinant proteins bound to the same site on the clathrin triskelions at a 1:1 molar ratio. However, only the clathrin triskelions with bound C58J were uncoated by Hsc70. This result leads to several important conclusions. First, it demonstrates unequivocally that, despite the intertwined nature of the clathrin triskelia in the clathrin basket, Hsc70 is able to uncoat individual clathrin triskelions from the basket, leaving the remainder of the basket intact. Even when pure clathrin baskets, which are relatively unstable at pH 7, were uncoated in the presence of small amounts of C58J, uncoating was proportional to the amount of C58J added. Therefore, uncoating is not due to a nonspecific destabilization of whole clathrin baskets after Hsc70 removes a few clathrin triskelions from the baskets. Rather, the three Hsc70s that bind to each clathrin triskelion before it is uncoated apparently change its structure, disentangling it from the other clathrin triskelions with which it is associated in the clathrin basket. The observation that Hsc70 can remove individual clathrin molecules individually from a polymerized network of clathrin is consistent with our view that Hsc70 plays an important role in the ATP-dependent clathrin exchange that occurs during clathrin-mediated endocytosis in vivo (29Wu X. Zhao X. Baylor L. Kaushal S. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The second important conclusion we can draw from our results is that, as we previously proposed in an earlier study (23Jiang R. Gao B. Prasad K. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8439-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), following uncoating a stable Hsc70-clathrin-AP complex forms. We had previously suggested that APs are bound to the uncoated Hsc70-clathrin complex because in the absence of APs, Hsc70 uncoats clathrin baskets catalytically rather than stoichiometrically. Like C58 and auxilin bound to clathrin baskets, bound C58J rapidly exchanges with free protein. Therefore, the only way to explain our observation that C58J released with the uncoated clathrin triskelions does not return to the clathrin baskets to support further uncoating is to postulate that along with Hsc70, it is stably attached to the released clathrin triskelions. In this regard, it differs from auxilin, which to act catalytically must detach from the released clathrin triskelions and return to the partially uncoated clathrin baskets to support further uncoating by Hsc70. Thus, auxilin supports uncoating catalytically, whereas C58J, like Hsc70 in the presence of APs, acts stoichiometrically. The ability of Hsc70 to form a stable complex with uncoated clathrin and an associated AP is consistent with the view that Hsc70 not only dissociates clathrin from clathrin-coated pits during clathrin exchange in vivo but also chaperones this dissociated clathrin and may be involved in its rebinding to the clathrin-coated pits (29Wu X. Zhao X. Baylor L. Kaushal S. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although both auxilin and C58J act as clathrin APs, our data demonstrate that they interact with clathrin in different ways. First, we found that, although both auxilin and C58J induce polymerization of clathrin at a 1:1 molar ratio, C58J, like C58, binds to the polymerized clathrin at a 1:1 molar ratio, whereas auxilin binds at a 3:1 molar ratio. In addition, as we discussed above, C58J supports uncoating stoichiometrically, whereas auxilin supports uncoating catalytically. Presumably these differences are related to differences in the way that auxilin and C58J interact with clathrin. C58 binds to the terminal domain of clathrin (30ter Haar E. Musacchio A. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Cell. 1998; 95: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and because C58J binds to the same site, it must support uncoating by binding to the terminal domain of clathrin. However, auxilin is able to support uncoating when the terminal domains of clathrin are removed from clathrin baskets. These data would suggest that auxilin interacts with the distal domain of clathrin, but Ungewickell and co-workers (20Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) found that the N-terminal portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain not only interacts with the distal domain of clathrin but also with its terminal domain. In addition, they pointed out similarities between the N-terminal portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain and the clathrin-binding domain of AP180. On the other hand, the C-terminal portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain adjacent to the J-domain interacts only with the distal domain of clathrin (20Scheele U. Kalthoff C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36131-36138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and we find that auxilin-C20 consisting of only this domain linked to the J-domain supports uncoating catalytically, binds quite weakly to clathrin baskets, and, under our polymerization conditions, cannot induce clathrin to polymerize. In contrast, Δ-auxilin, with only the N-terminal portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain present, binds strongly to clathrin baskets, induces clathrin to polymerize, but does not catalytically support clathrin uncoating by Hsc70. Rather, it supports uncoating stoichiometrically and then only does so when it is used to polymerize the clathrin baskets. Similarly, at pH 6, in contrast to C58J, which is similar to auxilin in that it catalytically induces binding of Hsc70 to C58-clathrin baskets, Δ-auxilin only induces Hsc70 binding to clathrin baskets when it is used to polymerize the clathrin baskets. Therefore, paradoxically, removal of the C-terminal portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding protein has a greater effect on the activity of auxilin itself than on the activity of C58J. This may be because C58 only binds to the terminal domain of clathrin, whereas the N-terminal portion of the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin interacts not only with the terminal domain but also with the distal domain of clathrin. Therefore, removal of the C-terminal portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain may interfere not only with the binding of auxilin to the distal domain of clathrin but also with proper binding of auxilin to the terminal domain of clathrin. In summary, our data suggest that the N-terminal portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain, which interacts with the terminal domain as well as the distal domain of clathrin, strengthens the binding of auxilin to clathrin and enables it to act as a clathrin AP. In contrast, the C-terminal portion of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain, which interacts only with the distal domain of clathrin, is crucial to the ability of auxilin to act catalytically, i.e.to detach from the uncoated clathrin rather than remaining stably bound like a typical AP. In addition to relating the domain structure of auxilin to its ability to support uncoating, we investigated the role of ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70. We had previously shown that the Hsp70 mutant, K71E Hsc70, which does not hydrolyze ATP, is not able to carry out uncoating and is not induced to bind to mixed AP-clathrin baskets at pH 6 by catalytic amounts of auxilin (25Rajapandi T. Wu C. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7244-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, we had not tested whether auxilin was able to induce stoichiometrically the binding of K71E Hsc70 to clathrin baskets at pH 6. Based on our studies on the ability of J-domain proteins to induce polymerization of Hsc70, we previously suggested that the ability of J-domain proteins to induce the binding of substrates to Hsc70-ATP was independent of ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 (9King C. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12452-12459Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In support of this view, in our present study we found that the induction by auxilin of the binding of K71E Hsc70 to clathrin baskets at pH 6 is ATP-dependent even though K71E Hsc70 does not hydrolyze ATP. However, just as with Δ-auxilin, this induction of binding was stoichiometric rather than catalytic. These data show that, in addition to the presence of the C-terminal subdomain of the auxilin clathrin-binding domain, ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 is involved in the ability of auxilin to induce catalytically the binding of Hsc70 to clathrin baskets at pH 6. Perhaps ATP hydrolysis is required to release the auxilin from the clathrin baskets after it induces Hsc70 binding so that it can rapidly move from triskelion to triskelion to induce Hsc70 binding catalytically. Alternatively, ATP hydrolysis may be required to prevent rapid dissociation of the Hsc70-ATP from the clathrin baskets which, in turn, would increase the amount of auxilin required for steady-state Hsc70 binding. In any event, our data show that both the distal portion of the clathrin-binding domain of auxilin and ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 are required for catalytic property of auxilin in inducing binding of Hsc70 to clathrin baskets at pH 6 and catalytically support uncoating of clathrin baskets at pH 7.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12333-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, one of the most fundamental questions about this enzyme system has remained unanswered. How are the structures of the tissue-specific isozymes of 6-Fru(P)-2-kinase/Fru-2,6-P2ase related to their differential functions in tissues that have specific physiological roles and, accordingly, different optimums of glucose metabolism? Reflecting such differences in roles, the two isozymes have been shown to have different kinetic properties, summarized in TableI (adapted from Ref. 10Sakata J. Abe Y. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15764-15770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a reasonably high amino acid sequence identity (74%), the liver isoform kinase shows a 4-fold higher affinity for Fru-6-P but half theV max compared with the testis form, whereas the bisphosphatase has at least 20-fold increased affinity for Fru-2,6-P2 and a 2-fold increase inV max (10Sakata J. Abe Y. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15764-15770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These kinetic differences suggest that glucose metabolism is uniquely related to the physiological roles of the given tissues and not just a simple housekeeping function for energy production (10Sakata J.

This is more evident by the fact that only the liver isozyme of the two isozymes is phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase upon the signal of low levels of glucose and/or glucagon. The dephosphorylation is achieved by xylulose 5-phosphate (Xyl-5-P)-dependent protein phosphatase 2A upon the detection of insulin and/or high glucose levels (14Nishimura M. Fedorov S. Uyeda K. J.

To better understand this unique enzyme system and to provide a better target for drug design, the crystal structure of the human liver isoform, which has kinetic properties nearly identical to the rat liver form of better than 98% (as suggested by sequence identity) (11Lange A.J., Li, L. Vargas A.M. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8078-8084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was determined and compared with the rat testis form, and the results are reported here. The W0 mutant form of human liver 6-Fru(P)-2-kinase/Fru-2,6-P2ase (all Trp residues and Pro2 mutated to Phe and Arg, respectively) was employed for this study because it has better expression in Escherichia coli with the kinetic properties indifferent from those of the wild type. 2K. Uyeda, unpublished data. The same mutant form was used for the studies of the testis form (7Hasemann C.A. Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified using DEAE and Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography. Crystals were prepared by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 12 mg ml−1 protein (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25, 10 mm NaPi, 15% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 6 mm ATPγS·Mg or ADP, and 5–10 mm Fru-6-P) mixed 1:1 with a mother liquor of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20–25% ethylene glycol, and 8% polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals in a size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm were grown in 4–5 days. Crystals were submerged into liquid propane for flash freezing, and the low temperature (120 K) was maintained by an X-stream (MSC, The Woodlands, TX) cryogenic cooling device. Diffraction data were collected on an R-Axis IV image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku FR590 rotating anode generator, which was operated at 50 mA, 100 kV. The x-ray beam was focused using an Osmic confocal multilayer optic system. The data were integrated using DENZO and merged and scaled with SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The reduced data were formatted for the CCP4 suite (21Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and 10% of the data were marked for free R-factor measurements in subsequent structure refinements. As shown in Table II, complete data sets with various resolution ranges depending on the liganding states were collected. All crystals belong to a C2 space group regardless of the bound ligands.

X-PLOR: A System for Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). A single polyalanine form of the testis structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1bif) was used as a search model. An X-PLOR rotation and subsequent translation search was performed using a data subset between 15.0 and 4.0 Å. A self-rotation search as well as the measurement of solvent fraction suggested a non-crystallographic dimer of the liver enzyme in 1 asymmetric unit. Assignment of the side chains and non-crystallographic dimerization was made using O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeidgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The initial model went through iterated cycles of manual model rebuilding and X-PLOR refinement, followed by two cycles of “refmac” refinement (21Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). During this procedure, a single model was the subject of all manual model corrections to prevent the accumulation of structural errors developed during the refinement cycles. When R crys/R free, reached 0.254/0.289, one molecule of ATPγS per protein molecule was built into the model, referring to an F o −F c omit map. As shown in Table II, the final model has a R crys/R free factor of 0.217/0.257 using a total of 7,545 scatterers, including solvent molecules, against 42,142 reflections. Of the 864 residues in the dimer, 89.3% are within the “most favorable region” of main chain dihedral angles distributions and none in the “disallowed region,” when judged using “procheck” (21Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The final structure was deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code of1K6M. The subsequent structures of the liver isozyme complexed with either ADP or Pi were determined by using the structure of the ATPγS complex as the starting model and by following the structural refinements procedures similar to that used for the ATPγS complex. But, to guarantee a freedom to structural refinements, the indices of reflections in the free data were kept as those of the ATPγS complex. The B-factor refinement of the Pi complex was stopped after one cycle of group B-factor refinement, and the solvent molecules were not added to the structure due to a limited resolution. The statistics of reflection data and structure refinements are summarized in TableII. The crystal structures of the liver isozyme reveal a head-to-head homodimer of 432 amino acid residues per monomer (residues 39–470) (Fig. 1 a and 2). Depending on the liganding conditions, each subunit contains an ATPγS, ADP, or Pi molecule bound to the kinase domain, and two inorganic phosphates, regardless of the liganding conditions, bound to the bisphosphatase domain (Table II). No electron density is interpretable for the N-terminal regulatory fragment of residues 1–38, in which Ser-32, the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site (24Tominaga N. Minami Y. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K.

The structure of this fragment thus remained undetermined in both the liver and testis isozymes.Figure 2Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the liver and testis isozymes.

Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Yuen M. Wang X. Mizuguchi H. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2176-2184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 b, where the ribbon diagrams of the two isozyme kinase domains are superimposed, the overall folding of the liver form is very similar to that of the testis form. The similarity in folding patterns is maintained throughout both the kinase and phosphatase domains. The main structural characteristics are conserved in the liver form,i.e. the major dimeric interactions through the kinase domains, the constellation of catalytic residues in the active sites of each domain, and the manner of intramonomer domain-domain interactions. All this together allowed us to assign the secondary structural motifs of the liver form according to those of the testis form (7Hasemann C.A. Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with no ambiguity, and for convenience of comparison, the amino acid sequences are compared with the assigned secondary structures in Fig. 2. Unless specifically mentioned, for the entire text of this report, all the amino acid sequence and numbers are according to the liver isozyme. For example, T224Q is Thr-224 in human liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase and is Gln in the same position of the testis isozyme. Although the number is small, the amino acid sequence differences between the two tissue isozymes seem to cause a variety of conformational differences. That includes a twist of the bisphosphatase domain relative to the kinase domain, resulting in an altered dimeric interface. Despite the fact that the amino acid residues involved in this interface are relatively well conserved, the bisphosphatase domain of the liver form is twisted by 5° around the dimeric axis from its position in the testis form (Fig. 1 b). We considered three possibilities of this twist as follows: an indirect effect of the mobile N terminus, a difference in crystal contacts between the two isoforms, and an intrinsic difference coming from the amino acid sequence. A possibility of an effect of phosphorylation of Ser-32 at the mobile N terminus is ignorable since the enzyme was expressed in bacterium and purified in the absence of any protein phosphatase inhibitor such as fluoride. To test its relevance to liganding states and crystal contacts, the three structures of the testis isoform all in different crystal contacts and liganding states (ATPγS, AMP-PNP, and Pi) (7Hasemann C.A. Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Yuen M. Wang X. Mizuguchi H. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2176-2184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the three structures of the liver form in three different liganding states (ATPγS, ADP, and Pi) were cross-compared by superimposing onto each other. The positional differences of Cαs were calculated and presented as TableIII. The liver form ADP complex and the testis form AMPPNP complex were excluded from this table, because they were so similar to the liver form ATPγS complex and the testis form ATPγS complex, respectively, with a difference range of <0.5 Å. It is evident that the overall difference (∼2 Å) between the two tissue isozymes is mainly caused by the bisphosphatase domain (∼3 Å). This difference is not significantly affected by the liganding states, which cause less than 1 Å in magnitude. Legitimacy of the positional difference was tested by rotating the testis bisphosphatase domain by 5°, and the result, which is 2.8 Å, was found to be close to the value in the table. Because no different space group with reasonable resolution is available for the liver form, it is impossible to directly infer the effect of crystal contacts on the liver form. However, comparisons between the structures of the testis form, which have three different space groups (P1 for the Picomplex, C2 for the AMPPNP complex, andP3121 for the ATPγS complex), allowed an indirect observation. When these three structures were compared, the positional differences caused by the different crystal contacts are neither domain-specific nor significant (<0.8 Å). This observation becomes more convincing by the fact that the major source of crystal contacts in both isoforms is provided by the conserved dimeric kinase interactions. All this together suggests that the rotated bisphosphatase is a featuring conformation of the liver form.Table IIIAverage positional differences of Cα among the isotype bifunctional enzymes and their domains (Å)Liver·ATPγS (C2)Liver·Pi(C2)Testis·ATPγSTestis·Pi2.282.250.69(P1)(1.05/3.45)(1.07/3.38)(0.63/0.76)Testis·ATPγS1.861.83(P3121)(0.86/2.82)(0.87/2.75)Liver·Pi0.34(0.22/0.45)The positional differences of the Cα atoms of the two isozymes each in two different liganding conditions (ATP and Pi) are compared after superimposing the structures onto each other.

The numbers in parentheses are representing the kinase and bisphosphatase domains, respectively. The space groups of the crystals are also in parentheses. The structures of testis·Pi and Testis·ATPγS were acquired under the PDB codes, 1bif and 3bif, respectively. Moreover, it was found that the amino acid sequence differences in the kinase domain can cause a twist of the liver form bisphosphatase domain. As in the testis form, the kinase/bisphosphatase interface of the liver enzyme includes a structure in which one β hairpin between β1–5 and β1–6 (residues 215–230 in the liver form and 213–228 in the testis form) in the kinase domain forms a set of hydrophobic interactions with the following helix α7 in the kinase domain, which in turn makes tight interactions with the bisphosphatase helix α13 (7Hasemann C.A. Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A major portion of this junction also serves as the dimeric interface through intermonomeric kinase domain interactions (Fig. 3 a). Sequence heterogeneity introduced at the three residues, T224Q, R225S, and Q232A, of this hairpin may have caused the bisphosphatase domain twist and, also, affected the dimeric interactions. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the hairpin loop in the liver type forms a new intermolecular salt bridge with Glu-208 of the dimeric partner molecule, because of a newly introduced positive charge in Arg-225, and this tends to pull the loop upward. This upward movement is strengthened by T224Q, which forms a new hydrogen bond with the carbonyl O of Asp-221 in the same subunit, losing the intersubunit hydrogen bonding with Arg-230. Q232A also helps this structural change by introducing a new hydrogen bond to Ser-215. As a result, the hairpin structure is rotated by ∼3° and shifted by 0.4–0.6 Å with respect to that of the testis form. To adjust for this structural change and to maintain tight hydrophobic interactions with the hairpin, the helix α7 has made a translational shift (Fig. 3 b), which is helped by a new hydrogen bond between Q232A and Ser-215 (Fig. 3 a). The shift of α7 induces a similar type of movement in α13. In this way, a small shift of the β-hairpin is propagated to the rest of the structural components of the junction between the kinase and bisphosphatase domains, eventually causing a 5° swing of the bisphosphatase domain (Fig. 1 b). Intramolecular rotation of the bisphosphatase domain appears to enhance the overall stability of the bisphosphatase domains in the liver form by introducing new dimeric interactions between the Fru-2,6-P2ase domains. As summarized in TableIV, the conformation distinguishes the liver isozyme from the testis form, causes a 4-fold increase in the buried surface area between the two bisphosphatase domains, and decreases the distances in the dimeric kinase/bisphosphatase interaction as well. Interestingly, neither the increased contact areas nor the decreased distances between the two bisphosphatase domains are caused by amino acid sequence differences within the bisphosphatase domain. The polymorphic sequences in the kinase domain that induce the twist between the kinase and bisphosphatase domains are the sole cause of increases in the dimeric interactions between the bisphosphatase domains.Table IVComparison of the dimeric parametersBuried surface areas caused by interactions (Å2)Source of interactionsLiverTestisΔ area Dimeric Subunit/subunit24901787703 Monomeric Kinase/bisphosphatase17001768−68 Dimeric Kinase/kinase13941259135 Dimeric Bisphosphatase/bisphosphatase 763 164599 Dimeric Kinase/bisphosphatase 333 364−31Distances of dimeric interactions (Å) involving the bisphosphatase domainsSource atoms involvedLiverTestisΔ distance Asp-233-OArg-383-Nη13.23.7−0.5 His-234-Nδ1Glu-380-Oɛ12.93.00.1 His-234-OArg-383-Nη23.95.4−1.5 Ser-237-OγAsn-245-Nδ22.94.0−1.1 Arg-238-Nη1Tyr-241-Oη2.52.8−0.3 Lys-323-NζAsp-369-Oδ23.02.70.3 Tyr-241 (hydrophobic)Tyr-2413.73.9−0.2 Tyr-241-OηArg-238-Nη12.52.8−0.3 Glu-335-Oɛ1Lys-363-Nζ2.87.3−4.5The buried surface areas were calculated using “areaimol” (30Kitajima S.

Open table in a new tab The buried surface areas were calculated using “areaimol” (30Kitajima S. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6896-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When deviations from mean B-factors of the testis ATPγS complex and the liver ATPγS complex are plotted, significant differences in the stability of the 6-Fru(P)-2-kinase (residues 39–249) and Fru-2,6-P2ase (residues 250–470) domains of the two isozymes are revealed (Fig. 4). A very similar pattern was also shown in other structures (data not shown for clear comparisons). This comparison dramatically shows that the Fru-2,6-P2ase domain of the liver isozyme is the more stable half of the monomer liver isozyme. Conversely, the 6-Fru(P)-2-kinase domain of the testis isozyme is the more stable domain. This distinct domain stability is not an artifact of different crystal contacts between the two isoforms. As shown on the bottom of the plot, most of the crystal contacts are shared, and the several unique contacts do not explain the unique stability of the tissue-specific isoforms. This difference was apparent throughout the structure refinement process, where the liver bisphosphatase domain always had an overall more interpretable density map than the kinase domain, opposite the situation seen in the testis structures. The liver bisphosphatase domain is more stable than its own kinase domain and the testis bisphosphatase domain. On the contrary, the testis kinase domain is more stable than its bisphosphatase domain and the liver kinase domain. However, it is unclear whether the increase in the buried surface area by the twisted bisphosphatase causes the liver bisphosphatase domain to be more stable. Outside of the N-terminal regulatory motif (residues 1–38), polymorphic amino acid sequences between the liver and testis isozymes are most frequent in the substrate binding loops of the kinase domain: the Fru-6-P loop (residues 80–120) and the ATP loop (residues 160–200) (Fig. 2). In the testis isozyme, it was shown that the last turn of helix α5 (residues 162–175) undergoes unwinding upon binding of ATP to recruit Lys-172 to the bridge oxygen between the β- and γ-phosphates of the bound ATP (9Yuen M. Wang X. Mizuguchi H. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12333-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Mizuguchi H. Cook P.F. Hasemann C.A. Uyeda K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8775-8784Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This ATP-driven conformational change has been suggested to be transmitted to the Fru-6-P loop via the loop coupling composed of the salt bridges between Asp-177, Arg-78, and Arg-193 and the hydrogen bonds between Arg-181 and the carbonyl oxygens of Tyr-85 and Lys-86 (9Yuen M. Wang X. Mizuguchi H. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12333-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Mizuguchi H. Cook P.F. Hasemann C.A. Uyeda K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8775-8784Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the ATP binding was suggested to be a prerequisite for the subsequent binding of Fru-6-P to the kinase domain in the testis kinase reaction, following the ordered binding of substrates. Like the testis form and as shown in Fig. 5 a, the structure of the liver form also has a “switch-on” conformation induced by the bound ATP. Neither of the two additional structures of the liver enzyme complexed with ADP or Pi shows the “switch-off” conformation, which is shown by the testis enzyme upon bindings of ADP or Pi (Fig. 5 b). Furthermore, substitution of cysteine for Arg-183 in the liver isozyme (C183R) breaks the outer lobe coupling of the ATP and Fru-6-P loops (Fig. 5 c). It is believed that the sequence differences in this region stabilize the “switch-on” conformation of the liver enzyme. Mutation in G164E appears to greatly enhance the hydrophobic interactions between I165V and Val-222 by introducing more flexibility into the first turn of the switch helix (α5), and as a result, the distance between Ile-165 and Val-222 is shortened to 3.8 Å from 4.9 Å. In addition, a different sequence at E168A introduces a new hydrogen bond to the main chain N of Gln-172. Furthermore, the residue differences of V188A, L189T, and L193M add new sources of interactions to a local hydrophobic pocket made of Tyr-180, Leu-175, Phe-192, and Ile-170 (Fig. 5 a), which has been shown to be important in the binding of ATP and Fru-6-P (9Yuen M. Wang X. Mizuguchi H. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12333-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These sequence-related structural differences altogether appear to stabilize the switch-on conformation of the liver isoform by locking down the switch-on conformation and to isolate the Fru-6-P loop from the conformational changes in the ATP loop. To have the “off” (ATP-free) conformation suggested in the testis enzyme, the new hydrophobic interactions introduced by V188A, L189T, and L193M have to be broken. Thus, it appears that the helix (α5) of the liver form would experience a much higher energy barrier than that of the testis isoform when it returns to the ATP-free conformation. Because of the additional hydrogen bond through the side chain of E168A and the strengthened local hydrophobic interactions, it is likely that the ATP-induced switch-on conformation of the liver form is more stable than that of the testis form. The two substrate loops are mutually independent from the conformations of the other, resulting in an enhanced affinity for Fru-6-P. This observation allows the conclusion that the substrate binding to the liver kinase follows a random fashion, as originally suggested by the previous kinetic studies of the liver form (30Kitajima S. Sakakibara R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6896-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that stabilized ATP-induced switch-on conformation together with the decoupled substrate loops may contribute to a 4-fold higher affinity of the liver kinase for Fru-6-P (1Pilkis S.J. Claus T.H. Kurland I.J. Lange A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 799-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 10Sakata J. Abe Y. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15764-15770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, a prominent feature of the liver isozyme is the increased stability of the bisphosphatase domain induced by the bisphosphatase twist and the concomitant increase in dimeric interactions between the bisphosphatase domains (Table IV). In addition, polymorphic amino acid residues apparently contribute to an enhanced stability of loops involved in substrate binding to the bisphosphatase domain. The sequence change at R266K introduces a new salt bridge between Arg-266 and Glu-262. In addition, a change at S273P stabilizes the loop (residues 260–280), which surrounds the 2-P position of the bisphosphatase-active site, by forming a new hydrogen bond with the main chain N of Leu-263 (Fig. 6). The amino acid difference at residue E347L pushes Glu-347 away from the hydrophobic pocket consisting of E347L, Leu-351, and Ile-455 and includes Tyr-359 instead (Fig. 6). The rearranged hydrophobic pocket shifts the loop 358–361 such that a salt bridge between Arg-360 and Asp-369 becomes more stable. The distance of this salt bridge is shortened from 3.5 to 2.7 Å, and as a result, the B-factors of Arg-360 and Asp-369 decrease by ∼27 and 7 Å2, respectively, from those of the testis form. In addition, a new salt bridge between Glu-335 and Lys-363 is formed by the enhanced dimeric bisphosphatase interactions, and as a result, the B-factors are decreased by 15 and 19 Å2 from those of the testis form. This conformational change makes the loop (residues 335–363) more stable, which serves as a lid of the active site of the bisphosphatase domain (6Lee Y.H. Ogata C. Pflugrath J.W. Levitt D.G. Sarma R.

This loop has served as a popular target of the earlier structure/function studies and has been shown to be critical in the proper binding of both Fru-6-P and Fru-2,6-P2. The site-directed mutants, Arg-352 → Ala, Lys-356 → Ala, and Arg-360 → Ala, showed more than 100-fold decreases in binding of both Fru-6-P and Fru-2,6-P2. Thus, in addition to the domain stabilization by the twist, it is likely that stabilization of both the 2-P and the 6-P loop structures by the amino acid sequence of the liver isozyme plays an important role in the 20-fold increase in its affinity for Fru-2,6-P2 compared with that of the testis form, reflecting the differences in their kinetic and allosteric properties, consistent with their different physiological roles (1Pilkis S.J.

Sequence differences between the human liver and rat testis isozymes result in both local and global differences in the structures of these isozymes. The local conformational differences in the liver form kinase domain result in a loose coupling (or decoupling) of the Fru-6-P- and ATP-binding loops and a stabilized switch-on conformation even without ATP. These structural differences may allow the Fru-6-P binding to be independent of ATP binding unlike the testis form, in which ATP-binding is prerequisite for Fru-6-P binding. This structure-related functional difference may be related to the physiological roles of the tissues that harbor these isozymes. To regulate the blood glucose levels, the liver appears to harbor an isozyme that is more sensitive to the changes in Fru-6-P concentration, which is a more accurate indicator of glucose concentration than that of ATP. Meanwhile, the testis isozyme, which functions to maintain a steady level of energy production, appears to adopt a structure more sensitive to the changes in ATP concentration, a more accurate indicator of the cellular energy level than Fru-6-P. Stabilization of the whole bisphosphatase domain by the “domain twist” and its Fru-2,6-P2-binding loops by the local sequence differences in the liver isozyme appears to enhance its affinity for Fru-2,6-P2. Considering that the Fru-2,6-P2 concentration is a critical factor in determining the flux through the glucose pathways in liver, it is reasonable that the liver bisphosphatase domain has a keen sensitivity to the concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 to actively engage in such a mission. However, by having lower affinity for Fru-2,6-P2, the testis isozyme is likely to have the bisphosphatase domain functioning not to determine direction of the pathways but to regulate only the rate of glycolysis."

Using this recombinant ST3Gal I, we screened the synthetic hexapeptide combinatorial library to explore a sialyltransferase inhibitor. We found that the hexapeptide, NH2-GNWWWW, exhibited the most strong inhibition of ST3Gal I among five different hexapeptides that were finally selected. The kinetic analysis of ST3Gal I inhibition demonstrated that this hexapeptide could act as a competitive inhibitor (K i = 1.1 μm) on CMP-NeuAc binding to the enzyme. Moreover, the hexapeptide was shown to strongly inhibit both N-glycan-specific α2,3- and α2,6-sialyltranferasein vitro, suggesting that this peptide may inhibit the broad range of sialyltransferases regardless of their linkage specificity. The inhibitory activity in vivo was investigated by RCA-I lectin blot analyses and by metabolicd-[6-3H]GlcNH2 radiolabeling analyses of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides in Chines hamster ovary cells. Our results demonstrate that the hexapeptide can act as a generic inhibitor of the N- andO-glycan-specific sialyltransferases in mammalian cells, which results in the significantly reduced NeuAc expression on cellular glycoproteins in vivo.

The cell surface oligosaccharides of mammalian cells have been known to function in various cell adhesions and molecular recognition during development, differentiation, and tumor progression (1Hakomori S.I. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). In particular, the NeuAcs (sialic acids) have been strongly implicated in tissue inflammation (2Yang J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 3McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin.

Many studies have shown that the increased sialylation is correlated with up-regulation of metastatic potential (5Yogeeswaran G. Salk P. Science. 1981; 212: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 6Fogel M. Altevogt P. Schirrmacher V. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and also that the oncogenic transformation results in an increased expression of Galβ1,4GlcNAc-specific α2,6-sialyltransferase (7Le Marer N. Stehelin D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The sialylationsin vivo are generally exerted by more than a dozen different sialyltransferases, including glycoprotein-specific α2,3-/α2,6-/α2,8-linkage transferring enzymes and glycolipid-specific α2,3-/α2,8-linkage transferring enzymes (8Katasutoshi S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 195-215Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Among these, Galβ1,3GalNAc-specific α2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3Gal I) 1The abbreviations used are: ST3Gal I, Galβ1,3GalNAc:α2,3-sialyltransferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary1The abbreviations used are: ST3Gal I, Galβ1,3GalNAc:α2,3-sialyltransferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary catalyzes the addition of NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc to Galβ1,3GalNAc in an α2,3-specific linkage and completes the chain elongation of core 1 structure in mucin-typeO-glycosylation. The cDNAs encoding ST3Gal I have been isolated from several species, such as mouse (9Lee Y.C. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Nakaoka T. Tsuji S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), human (10Chang M.L. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Lau J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), porcine (11Gillespie W. Kelm S. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21004-21010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and chicken (12Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Nakata T. Tsuji S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that ST3Gal I can compete with core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in mucin-type O-glycan synthesis (13Whitehouse C. Burchell J. Gschmeissner S. Brockhausen I. Lloyd K.O. Taylor-Papakimitriou J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the activity of ST3Gal I is elevated in breast carcinomas, and this elevation of ST3Gal I strongly blocks the conversion of core 1 to core 2 O-glycan structure, finally resulting in the shorter length and less complex form ofO-linked oligosaccharides on MUC1 in breast carcinomas (14Burchell J. Poulsom R. Hanby A. Whitehouse C. Cooper L. Clausen H. Miles D. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this regard, the identification of specific inhibitor targeting on sialyltransferases, especially on ST3Gal I, might be a invaluable tool for chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer metastasis and breast carcinoma. Previously, a number of sialyltransferase inhibitors have been reported, such as nucleosides and nucleotide sugar analogues; however, the potency of these inhibitors appears not to be promising for clinical applications (15- 22, 61). In addition, other types of priming inhibitors to block the action of sialyltransferases by competing with endogenous substrates have been described (23Sarkar A.K. Fritz T.A. Taylor W.H. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3323-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that an endogenous protein inhibitor of Galβ1,4GlcNAc:α2,6-sialyltransferase was isolated from rat serum (24Harder P.G. Jamieson J.C. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified a hexapeptide inhibitor of sialyltransferase from the synthetic hexapeptide combinatorial library using recombinant ST3Gal I enzyme expressed in insect cells. The kinetic analyses show that the hexapeptide inhibitor affects theK m value of the donor substrate, CMP-NeuAc, demonstrating that this peptide is functioning as a competitive inhibitor on ST3Gal I in terms of the donor substrate binding. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the hexapeptide turns out to be generically effective both in vivo and in vitro to the broad range of sialyltransferases regardless of their linkage specificities. Tunicamycin, α2,3-sialyltransferase and α2,6-sialyltransferase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. IgG-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Grace insect culture medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Dowex AG 1-X8 (200–400 mesh) was obtained from Bio-Rad. Galβ1,3GalNAc and Me2SO were purchased from Sigma. Radioactived-[6-3H]GlcNH2 (14.0 Ci/mmol) and CMP-[9-3H]NeuAc (33.2 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories Inc. (Logan, UT). The expression vectors in insect cells using the baculovirus system were obtained from Invitrogen. The synthetic hexapeptide combinatorial library was purchased from Postech (Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea). CHO-K1 (ATCC) was grown in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were maintained at 27 °C in Grace medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with antibiotics of penicillin and streptomycin at 50 μg/ml, respectively. The BTI-TN-5B1-4 cells (High FiveTM cells; Invitrogen) derived from Trichoplusia ni were cultured for recombinant ST3Gal I production at 27 °C in serum-free SF 900 II medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics (25Wickham T.J. Nemerow G.R. Biotechnol. Prog. 1993; 9: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus and recombinant baculovirus expressing ST3Gal I were grown and propagated in Sf9 and High FiveTM cells. The soluble form of cDNA containing the catalytic domain of ST3Gal I, which lacks 55 amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus, was prepared from pUGS α2,3-sialyltransferase (9Lee Y.C. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Nakaoka T. Tsuji S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) by PCR using sense primer (5′-TTCAGAATTCTGCACCTGCAGACACTGC-3′) containing an EcoRI site and antisense primer (5′-CATCTCGAGGCATCATCTCCCCTTGAAGAT-3′) containing an XhoI site. The amplified 0.95-kb fragment was ligated into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pcDSA expression vector (26Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid was designated as pcDSA-ST3Gal I. To construct baculovirus transfer plasmid, pFastBac-ST3Gal I, first, pcDSA-ST3Gal I was partially digested withPstI and blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and finally, the 1.2-kb DNA fragment containing the IgM signal sequence, the IgG-binding domain of the protein A sequence, and the catalytic domain of ST3Gal I cDNA was isolated by digestion with XhoI. Second, the resulting 1.2-kb DNA fragment was introduced into pFastBac-HTa insect cell expression vector (Invitrogen), which was digested with RsrII, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and then digested with XhoI. The insertion of the DNA fragment in the correct orientation was analyzed by restriction mapping, and the right sequence of the insert junctions was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system based on the site-specific transposition of expression cassette from a donor plasmid into a baculovirus shuttle vector was employed to generate the recombinant virus according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). Briefly, pFastBac-ST3Gal I was transformed intoEscherichia coli DH10Bac-competent cells harboring bacmid DNA (baculovirus whole genome) and transposition helper vector. Then the transposed single white colonies (lacZ −) was selected, and recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline lysis method. The recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into 3 × 106 Sf9 cells in a 25-cm2 T culture flask using LipofectinTM as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). After cells and DNA-lipid complex were incubated at 27 °C for 5 h during the transfection, the incubation mixture was replaced with fresh Grace medium. Three days after transfection, the culture supernatant was collected and designated as P1 viral stocks. This P1 was used for generation of the high titer viral stocks by reinfection of Sf9 cells in a 100-mm dish at 50% cell confluence. After 3-day infection, the high titer viral stocks were obtained from culture supernatant, and finally, to produce recombinant ST3Gal I, these high titer viral stocks were used to infect High FiveTM cells in the serum-free SF 900 II medium (Invitrogen) at an multiplicity of infection of 10 for 3–5 days. For the purification of ST3Gal I, the High FiveTM cell culture supernatant was applied on an IgG-Sepharose column (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C overnight, and the column was washed with TBS buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 followed by elution with 0.1 mglycine buffer (pH 2.6). The fractions containing ST3Gal I were collected and used for the screening of the peptide library. For inhibition of N-glycosylation, recombinant ST3Gal I baculovirus-infected High FiveTM cells were incubated with tunicamycin at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in serum-free SF 900 II medium. After incubation for 72 h, the medium was collected and applied on a column of IgG-Sepharose. For Western blotting, IgG-Sepharose-eluted fractions were immediately neutralized and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE under a reducing condition. The gel was electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in Tris/glycine/methanol (25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, and 20% methanol), and nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 2 h at room temperature in TBS buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 1 h with rabbit IgG antibody (rabbit polyclonal anti-protease antibody, prepared in our laboratory, 1:5000 dilution) and overlaid with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Pierce). The color was developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in 100 mmNaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.8) containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (150 μg/ml) and nitro blue tetrazolium (300 μg/ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions for the alkaline phosphatase color development kit (Bio-Rad). The assay of ST3Gal I sialyltransferase activity was performed at 37 °C for a 2-h incubation in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mmsodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 μCi of CMP-[3H]NeuAc, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 13 mmGalβ1,3GalNAc, and 2 μl of recombinant ST3Gal I enzyme. To screen the hexapeptide inhibitor, 2 μl of recombinant ST3Gal I was preincubated with 10 μl of each pool of combinatorial hexapeptide library or solvent (5% Me2SO) as a control at 37 °C for 0.5 h, and the preincubation mixture was added to the main reaction followed by further incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was applied to QAE-Sephadex equilibrated with Tris buffer (pH 9.6) containing 20 mm NaCl, and the flow-through was collected. The radioactivity contained in the flow-through was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman), and then the flow-through was applied on a column of Bio-Gel P-4 (1 × 100 cm) equilibrated with 100 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.6) to separate the reaction product from free [3H]NeuAc. The peptide sequences were identified from the initial screening of 114 pools of combinatorial peptide library, and the possible five different hexapeptide sequences (P1–P5) were prepared by solid phase chemical synthesis using a semiautomated synthesizer (Peptron Inc., Taejon, South Korea). The inhibitory activity of five hexapeptides was compared by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h in 50 μl of main reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 μCi of CMP-[3H]NeuAc, 2 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 13 mm Galβ1,3GalNAc, and 2.5 μl of recombinant enzyme preincubated with increasing concentrations of each peptide (P1–P5), respectively, or solvent (5% Me2SO) as a control at 37 °C for 0.5 h. To obtain the apparent K mand V max, the kinetic mode of ST3Gal I was monitored with varying concentrations of CMP-NeuAc and Galβ1,3GalNAc. In the case of varying concentrations of CMP-NeuAc, 2.5 μl of recombinant ST3Gal I was preincubated with a fixed concentration of P5 hexapeptide and added to the main reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), various concentrations of cold CMP-NeuAc (from 10 μm to 2 mm) with 5 × 104 cpm of CMP-[3H]NeuAc, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Galβ1,3GalNAc, followed by further incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. In case of varying concentrations of Galβ1,3GalNAc, 2.5 μl of recombinant ST3Gal I was preincubated with hexapeptide P5 and added to the main reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), various concentrations of Galβ1,3GalNAc (from 10 μm to 2 mm), 2 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm CMP-NeuAc with 5 × 104 cpm of CMP-[3H]NeuAc. The reaction was stopped with ice-cold distilled H2O and applied to QAE-Sephadex in 2 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.6) containing 20 mm NaCl. The flow-through was collected and applied to Bio-Gel P-4 column, and the reaction product was fractionated. The radioactivity contained in the product was determined by measuring in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. 10 milliunits of N-glycan-specific α2,3- or α2,6-sialyltransferase preincubated with either 100 μmof peptide inhibitor P5 or Me2SO solvent as a control, respectively, was mixed with a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0), 1 μCi of CMP-[3H]NeuAc, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Galβ1,4GlcNAc and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped, and the sample was passed over a column of QAE-Sephadex. Finally, the reaction product was separated from free [3H]NeuAc by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography. The CHO cells cultured in 60-mm dish containing 2 ml of complex culture medium were treated with a dose-dependent increase of P5 hexapeptide or FITC-P5 inhibitor (10, 30, and 100 μm) for 72 h. During this period, the medium containing an inhibitor peptide or a control peptide was freshly changed at 24 h of incubation to maintain the peptide concentration. Cells were washed with cold 1× PBS buffer (10 mmKH2PO4 and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2), and cell lysates were prepared by mild sonication in PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixtures. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar) followed by Western blot analysis. For lectin blot analysis, transferred nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight for blocking and overlaid with 6 μg/ml biotinylated RCA-I lectin (Ricinus communis agglutinin 120; Sigma) followed by streptavidin-peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 1:4000 dilution). The signal was developed on Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax-MR-1 film with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To analyze the oligosaccharides directly, CHO cells were treated with peptide and ChariotTM, a specific liposome system commercially available from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). The ChariotTMwas mixed with 50 μm P5 hexapeptide (NH2-GNWWWW), control hexapeptide (NH2-WRGGSG), and Me2SO only and used to treat CHO cells for 2 h according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Subsequently, cells were metabolicallyd-[6-3H]GlcNH2-radiolabeled for 8 h in complex medium containing the final concentration of 200 μCi/ml of radioactive sugar, and the labeled cells were resuspended in PBS buffer followed by gentle sonication on ice. The sonicated supernatants were mixed with methanol/chloroform (1:1, v/v), and lipids were extracted by vortexing. The white pellets in boundary region between the upper and lower layer were collected and washed with ice-cold 90% aceton. The aceton-washed total glycoproteins were directly treated in 50 mm NaOH containing 1 mNaBH4 at 45 °C for 16 h to allow β-elimination (28Iyer R.N. Carlson D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and the released O-linked oligosaccharides were analyzed by descending paper chromatography as described previously (29Do S.-I. Enns C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 114-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of N-linked oligosaccharides, the treatment of N-glycanase was performed as previously described (30Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2808-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the labeled cells were sonicated in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) for three times, and SDS was added for a final concentration of 0.2%. The total cell lysates was boiled at 100 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 15 min. The clear lysates was applied to Sephadex G-50 (1 × 90 cm), and the column was eluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% SDS. The void fractions containing glycoproteins were pooled and precipitated by ice-cold 90% aceton. The precipitates was redissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min followed by the addition of 5 units of N-glycanase according to manufacturer's recommendation (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min followed by rechromatography on Sephadex G-50 column. Fractionated samples containing the released oligosaccharides were pooled, KCl was added to remove residual SDS and further desalted by Sephadex G-10 chromatography. Finally,N-linked oligosaccharides were analyzed by QAE-Sephadex in 2 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.0), and the charged glycans were eluted with increasing concentrations of 20, 70, 140, and 200 mm NaCl, respectively. For mild acid treatment to prepare desialylated N- and O-linked oligosaccharides, the released glycans were treated with 2 n acetic acid at 100 °C for 1 h as described previously (29Do S.-I. Enns C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 114-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We expressed the ST3Gal I in recombinant baculovirus-infected High FiveTMcells as a soluble and secreted enzyme fused with IgG-binding domain. The ST3Gal I was purified in one step by an IgG-Sepharose column from culture supernatants, and bound ST3Gal I was eluted with 0.1m glycine buffer (pH 2.6) followed by an immediate neutralization. The eluted fractions were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 1). The soluble form of recombinant ST3Gal I was secreted as two different molecular mass forms corresponding to 41 kDa and 40 kDa (Fig.1 A). To investigate the identity of these polypeptides, first, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was directly determined by protein microsequencing, and second, ST3Gal I sialyltransferase activities of the eluted fractions were measured. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of two polypeptides were identical and found to be matched with protein A sequence of IgG-binding domain just after cleavage of IgM signal sequence (26Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ST3Gal I sialyltransferase activity was correlated with the protein intensity in Coomassie staining (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the signal sequence of mouse IgM can be correctly cleaved in High FiveTM cells and that the 1-kDa difference of molecular mass could be caused by either glycosylation or other protein modifications. To test whether the 1-kDa difference of molecular mass is caused by N-glycosylation, High FiveTM cells expressing ST3Gal I were incubated with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin to blockN-glycosylation. The culture medium was applied on a column of IgG-Sepharose, and the bound ST3Gal I was eluted by low pH buffer. But no protein was eluted out of the IgG-Sepharose column (Fig.1 C), indicating that ST3Gal I deficient inN-linked oligosaccharides seemed not to be secreted into medium. We examined the presence of ST3Gal I in the culture medium by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of culture supernatants and Western blotting; however, ST3Gal I was not contained in tunicamycin-treated medium (data not shown). We further examined whether ST3Gal I is present in cell lysates by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). When cells were treated with tunicamycin, ST3Gal I was present exclusively in cell lysates (Fig. 2 B,lanes 5 and 6), indicating thatN-glycosylation of ST3Gal I might be crucial for protein secretion in High FiveTM cells. Moreover, ST3Gal I after tunicamycin treatment still gave rise to two different molecular masses with the same 1-kDa difference (Fig. 2 B, lane 5), indicating that the difference of molecular mass does not result fromN-glycosylation. It should be mentioned that several other molecular weight forms of ST3Gal I were also detected on Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), indicating that some unprocessed and/or intermediately glycosylated forms of ST3Gal I may reside inside cells. The screening of a combinatorial hexapeptide library containing 114 peptide pools allowed us to determine the most effective amino acid residues that can be positioned in a hexapeptide sequence. The screening of the peptide library was performed as shown in Fig. 3. Screening of the first pool containing the NH2-XXXXX-X 1peptide mixtures showed that NH2-XXXXX-W was found to most strongly inhibit ST3Gal I activity (Fig. 3 A). The other three amino acid residues of glycine, asparagine, and arginine at the X 1 position appear to be less active than tryptophan. The screening of the second, third, and fourth pool of the peptide library also revealed that the tryptophan residue was the highest inhibitory amino acid at the X 2,X 3, and X 4 positions (Fig. 3, B–D). In the case of the fifth pool of NH2-XX 5-XXXX, asparagine, arginine, tryptophan, and tyrosine were identified as strongly inhibitory amino acid residues, and among these, asparagine showed the highest inhibitory activity at the X 5 position (Fig. 3 E). Finally, the sixth position was identified as glycine, which was the most inhibitory element among 19 amino acids (Fig. 3 F). Based on these results, the five possible hexapeptides were synthesized as follows: the first position from the NH2 terminus, Gly; the second position, Asn and Trp; the third position, Trp and Arg; the fourth position, Trp; the fifth position, Trp; and the sixth position, Trp and Arg. The amino acid sequences of the five hexapeptides finally chosen are listed in Fig.4 A. The relative inhibitory activity of each peptide was tested, showing that the P5 hexapeptide sequence, NH2-GNWWWW, was found to most strongly inhibit ST3Gal I activity (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Comparison of ST3Gal I-inhibitory activity of five individual hexapeptides. A, the five individual hexapeptides were synthesized and each peptide was designated as P1–P5. The peptide sequences are represented with single-letter amino acid codes. B, the comparative analysis of ST3Gal I inhibition was performed using CMP-[3H]NeuAc at varying concentrations (0–400 μm) of P1–P5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NH2-GNWWWW designated as P5 hexapeptide was utilized to study the kinetic mode of ST3Gal I inhibition. In kinetic analysis, first, recombinant ST3Gal I and radioactive CMP-[3H]NeuAc are incubated with varying concentrations of nonradioactive CMP-NeuAc under a fixed concentration of Galβ1,3GalNAc substrate (Fig.5 A). Second, enzyme and CMP-[3H]NeuAc are incubated with varying concentrations of Galβ1,3GalNAc under a fixed concentration of CMP-NeuAc (Fig.5 B). Kinetic assays were demonstrated to be linear with respect to incubation time and amount of recombinant ST3Gal I (data not shown). In Fig. 5 A, the apparent K m andV max of ST3Gal I enzyme for CMP-NeuAc were determined to be 38 μm and 650 pmol/h using 2.5 μl of purified ST3Gal I, respectively. In the presence of peptide inhibitor,K m was changed without alteration ofV max, suggesting that P5 hexapeptide was acting as a competitive inhibitor (K i = 1.1 μm) of ST3Gal I in terms of CMP-NeuAc binding (Fig.5 A). In Fig. 5 B, the apparentK m and V max of ST3Gal I enzyme for Galβ1,3GalNAc were determined to be 268 μmand V max of 1740 pmol/h using 2.5 μl of purified ST3Gal I. In the presence of peptide inhibitor,V max was changed without alteration ofK m, indicating that P5 hexapeptide was acting as a noncompetitive inhibitor (K i = 8.8 μm) of ST3Gal I in terms of Galβ1,3GalNAc binding. Together, these results demonstrate that P5 hexapeptide can competitively inhibit CMP-NeuAc binding to ST3Gal I, whereas this peptide appears not to affect Galβ1,3GalNAc binding to ST3Gal I. Based on these results, it is possible to deduce that P5 hexapeptide may inhibit other types of sialyltransferases because all sialyltransferases known thus far utilize CMP-NeuAc as a common donor substrate. Therefore, we tested whether P5 could inhibit the activities of other sialyltransferases such asN-glycan-transferring α2,3- and α2,6-sialyltransferases. As expected, P5 hexapeptide was found to significantly inhibit both α2,3-sialyltransferase (Fig.6 A) and α2,6-sialyltransferase (Fig. 6 B). To determine whether P5 hexapeptide could inhibit the expression of NeuAc in vivo, CHO cells were treated with P5 hexapeptide in normal complex medium, and cellular glycoproteins were analyzed by RCA-I lectin blotting. It has been generally known that RCA-I interacts with high affinity with Galβ1,4GlcNAc sequence in asialo forms of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary N-glycans containing terminal β-linked galactose residues (31Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9795-9799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also interacts weakly with mucin-type Galβ1,3GalNAc sequence in O-glycan structure (32Irimura T. Tsuji T.

https://openalex.org/W2124450553,"Plant kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP) is a novel member of the kinesin superfamily that interacts with calmodulin (CaM) via its CaM-binding domain (CBD). Activated CaM (Ca2+-CaM) has been shown to inhibit KCBP interaction with microtubules (MTs) thereby abolishing its motor- and MT-dependent ATPase activities. To test whether the fusion of CBD to non-CaM-binding kinesins confers Ca2+-CaM regulation, we fused the CBD of KCBP to the N or C terminus of a minus-end (non-claret disjunction) or C terminus of a plus-end (Drosophila kinesin) motor. Purified chimeric kinesins bound CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner whereas non-claret disjunction, Drosophila kinesin, and KCBP that lack a CBD did not. As in the case of KCBP with CBD, the interaction of chimeric motors with MTs, as well as their MT-stimulated ATPase activity, was inhibited by Ca2+-CaM. The presence of a spacer between the motor and CBD did not alter Ca2+-CaM regulation. However, KCBP interaction with MTs and its MT-stimulated ATPase activity were not inhibited when the motor domain and CBD were added separately, suggesting that Ca2+-CaM regulation of CaM-binding motors occurs only when the CBD is attached to the motor domain. These results show that the fusion of the CBD to animal motors confers Ca2+-CaM regulation and suggest that the CBD functions as a modular domain in disrupting motor-MT interaction. Our data also support the hypothesis that CaM-binding kinesins may have evolved by addition of a CBD to a kinesin motor domain.

Structurally kinesins contain a highly conserved motor domain that binds MTs and hydrolyzes ATP, a neck (determines motor directionality on MTs), a coiled-coil region (aids in dimerization), and a variable tail domain (involved in regulation of motor activity and/or in cargo carrying) (3Vale R.D.

The motor domain can be at the N or C terminus or in the middle. The N-terminal motors move toward the fast growing plus-end of MTs whereas the C-terminal motors translocate to the slow growing minus-end of MTs (3Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Recent genome sequence projects, coupled with cell and molecular biological studies in animals and plants, revealed that although both plants and animals contain some common motors plants are unique in containing a large number of kinesins (61 in Arabidopsis) including several plant-specific ones (7Reddy A.S.N. Day I.S. BioMed Central Genomics. 2001; 2: 2Google Scholar). Studies with a few plant kinesins indicate that they are regulated by novel mechanisms and perform plant-specific functions (2Reddy A.S.N.

One of the plant kinesins, kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (KCBP), a minus-end motor, was isolated from a number of dicot and monocot plants as a calmodulin (CaM)-interacting protein (10Reddy A.S.N.

The CaM-binding domain (CBD) in KCBP is mapped to the C terminus of the motor domain (10Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Google Scholar). Although a CaM-binding kinesin has not been identified in the completely sequenced genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens (7Reddy A.S.N. Day I.S. BioMed Central Genomics. 2001; 2: 2Google Scholar, 14Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Google Scholar), a kinesin (kinesin-C) that binds to CaM has been isolated from sea urchin (15Rogers G.C. Hart C.L. Wedman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1-8Google Scholar). KCBP and kinesin-C are similar in having a conserved neck, motor domain at the C terminus, and a CBD through which these kinesins interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. However, the KCBP and kinesin-C differ structurally in the following: (i) the length of coiled-coil region and (ii) the tail domain organization; KCBP contains a MyTH4 and a talin-like domain present in tail regions of some animal myosins (IV, X, and VIIa) whereas kinesin-C lacks these domains (7Reddy A.S.N.

Functionally KCBP is involved in plant-specific processes such as trichome morphogenesis and is associated with the preprophase band and phragmoplast in dividing cells, which are absent in animal cells (17Oppenheimer D.G.

Using KCBP-specific antibodies in microinjection studies, it has been shown that KCBP controls several aspects of cell division (21Vos J.W. Safadi F. Reddy A.S. Hepler P.K. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 979-990Google Scholar). Although the function of kinesin-C is not known, it is implicated in Ca2+-dependent events during embryonic development by maintaining MT cross-bridging in mitotic divisions (15Rogers G.C. Hart C.L. Wedman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1-8Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate the activity of kinesins, with a few exceptions, are poorly understood (22Reilein A.R. Rogers S.L. Tume M.C. Gelfand V.I. Intl. Rev. Cytol. & Cell Biol. 2001; 204: 180-238Google Scholar). Chimeric motor proteins have been used to study directionality determinants, motor velocity, and functions of various domains of kinesin family members from a number of species (5Endow S.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: E163-E167Google Scholar, 23Endow S.A. Waligora K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1200-1202Google Scholar, 24Kikkawa M. Okada Y. Hirokawa N.

Cross R.A. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5308-5314Google Scholar). Regions that control motor directionality have been determined by swapping neck regions between plus- and minus-end motors (23Endow S.A. Waligora K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1200-1202Google Scholar, 25Henningsen U. Schliwa M. Nature. 1997; 389: 93-95Google Scholar, 26Case R.B. Pierce D.W. Hom-Booher N. Hart C.L. Vale R.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 959-966Google Scholar). These chimeric motors showed reversal of their normal motor polarity i.e. NCD and kinesin move plus- and minus-end direction, respectively. Further, mutation analyses of neck regions of chimeric motors revealed the critical residues necessary for directionality (5Endow S.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: E163-E167Google Scholar, 23Endow S.A.

However, using the chimeric constructs it has been demonstrated that the myosin motor core, but not neck, determines the directionality in myosins (30Homma K. Yoshimura M. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nature. 2001; 412: 831-834Google Scholar). A series of chimeric myosins have also been utilized to characterize function and regulation of members of the myosin family (31Sata M. Stafford W.F.I. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 91-96Google Scholar, 32Uyeda T.Q. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Google Scholar, 33Takahashi M. Takahashi K. Hiratsuka Y. Uchida K. Yamagishi A. Uyeda T.Q. Yazawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1034-1040Google Scholar). For example, using a chimeric myosin composed of skeletal MHC motor domain and smooth muscle MHC long α-helix S1 and S2 regions, it has been shown that the actin-stimulated ATPase activity of chimeric MHC, but not the native skeletal MHC, is regulated by Ca2+-CaM-dependent myosin-light chain kinase phosphorylation (31Sata M. Stafford W.F.I. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 91-96Google Scholar). In the case of KCBP, activated CaM (Ca2+-CaM) inhibits the motor activity and its interaction with MTs (34Song H. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Endow S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 322-327Google Scholar, 35Narasimhulu S.B. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 957-965Google Scholar, 36Deavours B.E. Reddy A.S.N. Walker R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 408-416Google Scholar). Although kinesin-C contains a CBD, the significance of the domain in regulating motor activity is not known (15Rogers G.C. Hart C.L. Wedman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1-8Google Scholar). Tubulins and the MT-interacting regions in kinesins are highly conserved in eukaryotes (2Reddy A.S.N. Intl. Rev. Cytol. Cell Biol. 2001; 204: 98-179Google Scholar, 6Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Google Scholar). To test whether the CBD of KCBP functions as a regulatory module in non-CaM-binding kinesins, we fused the CBD of KCBP to the N or C terminus of a minus-end (NCD) and to the C terminus of a plus-end (Drosophila kinesin, DK) motor with different length spacers between the motor and CBD. We have analyzed the chimeras for their MT binding and MT-stimulated ATPase activities in the presence of Ca2+ and/or bovine CaM orArabidopsis CaM isoforms. We show here that the MT binding and MT-stimulated ATPase activities of both N- and C-terminal chimeric motors are inhibited by either bovine CaM or Arabidopsis CaM isoforms in a Ca2+-dependent manner, suggesting that the CBD of plant KCBP acts as a regulatory module in animal chimeric motors. A spacer between the motor and CBD does not alter Ca2+-CaM regulation of chimeric motors. Furthermore, the CBD confers Ca2+-CaM regulation in cis but not in trans. Adenosine 5′-[β,γ]triphosphate (AMP-PNP), Mg-ATP, malachite green, and paclitaxel (taxol) were purchased from Sigma. pET vectors, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), T7-tag antibody, and S-protein conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were from Novagen. Bovine CaM was from Calbiochem. The complete protease inhibitor mixture was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, bovine CaM-Sepharose-4B, and His-Bind column matrices were from Amersham Biosciences. Tubulin was purchased from Cytoskeleton. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. The cDNA region encoding the CBD of Arabidopsis KCBP (aa 1211–1261) was cloned intoEcoRI-HindIII digested pET28b (10Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Google Scholar). The NCD coding sequence (aa 209–700) in pET3b MC1 was PCR-amplified using the 5′ T7 forward primer and 3′ NCD-specific reverse primer (5′-GCAGAATTCTTATCGAAATTGCCGCTG-3′) with an EcoRI site. The amplified product was digested with NdeI-EcoRI and ligated into NdeI-EcoRI-digested pET28b containing the CBD (aa 1211–1261) of KCBP to generate NCD+CBD. The DK coding sequence (aa 1–375) in pET21d DK was PCR-amplified using the 5′ T7 forward primer and 3′ DK-specific reverse primer (5′-GCAGAATTCCGCGCAAGCTCGATCTCC-3′) with an EcoRI site. The PCR product was digested with NcoI-EcoRI and ligated into NcoI-EcoRI-digested pET28b containing the CBD of KCBP to generate DK+CBD. The NCD coding sequence (aa 209–700) without the CBD was constructed by deleting the CBD from NCD+CBD with EcoRI-XhoI. The DK (aa 1–375) coding sequence without the CBD was generated by digesting the DK+CBD with NcoI-EcoRI, and the resultant fragment was ligated into NcoI-EcoRI-digested pET32b. Preparation of 1.5C, 1.0C, and 0.4C KCBP constructs was described previously (10Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Google Scholar, 35Narasimhulu S.B. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 957-965Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of the NCD+CBD, DK+CBD, and KCBP with CBD, NCD, and DK, and KCBP without CBD are 64, 48, 69, 59, 61, and 45 kDa, respectively. The DK construct with a spacer and CBD (DK+S+CBD) was prepared by inserting thePstI-EcoRI-digested PCR-amplified DK sequence coding for aa 294 to 475 (forward primer, 5′-GATTCCAAGCTAACGCGCAT-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ATGAGTTCCTCCTGCTCCA-3′ with EcoRI site) into the PstI-EcoRI-digested DK+CBD construct. This DK+S+CBD construct has a 149-amino acid spacer comprising of neck and coiled-coil regions between the motor domain and CBD. The calculated molecular mass of the DK+S+CBD is 60 kDa. Another construct with the CBD at the N terminus of NCD (CBD+S+NCD) was prepared by inserting the NcoI-digested PCR-amplified CBD sequence from KCBP 0.4C construct (T7 forward primer and KCBP-specific reverse primer, 5′-ACTATCTGCCTCATCTTTTCGTGT-3′ with an NcoI site: coding for amino acids 1211 to 1261 of KCBP) in theNcoI-digested NCD construct in pET28b. The calculated molecular mass of the CBD+S+NCD protein is 68 kDa. The NCD+CBD, DK+CBD, DK+S+CBD, and CBD+S+NCD fusions were verified by sequencing. The expression of the fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After incubation for 5 h at 30 °C, the cells were pelleted and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The proteins were extracted by lysing the cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mmMg-ATP, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm lysozyme, and Complete protease inhibitor on ice for 30 min, sonicating three times (10-s each), and centrifuging for 30 min at 4 °C. The motor proteins containing the CBD were purified using a CaM-Sepharose affinity column. His-Bind affinity column was used to purify the motor proteins without the CBD. The supernatant fraction containing the motor proteins with a CBD was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Mg-ATP, and 1 mmCaCl2) CaM-Sepharose column, washed with the same buffer, and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm Mg-ATP, and 1 mm EGTA. The supernatant fraction containing the motor proteins without a CBD was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated His-Bind affinity column with TN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm Mg-ATP) plus 5 mm imidazole, washed extensively with TN buffer plus 20 mm imidazole, and eluted with TN buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. All purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm Mg-ATP at 4 °C. Total soluble and purified proteins were separated on SDS-containing gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or blotted and detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated CaM, T7-tag monoclonal antibody, or S-protein conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (37Safadi F. Reddy V.S. Reddy A.S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35457-35470Google Scholar). The preparation and purification of HRP-CaM and Arabidopsis CaM isoforms was carried out as described (37Safadi F.

Safadi F. Zielinski R.E. Reddy A.S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31727-31733Google Scholar). Polymerization of α- and β-tubulins (10 mg/ml) was performed in a buffer (80 mmPipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm GTP, 1 μm taxol, and 10% glycerol) at 35 °C for 30 min (35Narasimhulu S.B. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 957-965Google Scholar). The polymerized MTs were stabilized by adding taxol to a final concentration of 10 μm. After incubation for 3 h at 35 °C, the polymerized MTs were centrifuged at 33,000 rpm at 35 °C, and the MT pellet was dissolved in 10× cosedimentation assay buffer (1× = 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mmNaCl, 20 μm taxol). The MT-motor binding assay was performed in a 100-μl reaction containing 2.5 μm motor protein or KCBP 0.4C (encoding CBD) protein with or without taxol-stabilized 10 μm MTs (35Narasimhulu S.B. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 957-965Google Scholar). Where appropriate, 100 μm CaCl2, 15 μm CaM (bovine orArabidopsis CaM isoforms), 5 mm AMP-PNP, or 5 mm Mg-ATP were also added. After incubation at 22 °C for 20 min, the tubes were centrifuged in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc.) for 20 min at 35 °C at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant and pellet were separated, mixed with SDS loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The tubulin subunits and motor proteins were visualized by staining the gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Because KCBP 1.0C and DK+CBD motor proteins co-migrate with tubulin subunits, duplicate gels were run, and one gel was stained, and the second gel was blotted and probed with T7-tag monoclonal antibody or HRP-CaM, respectively, as described above. The cosedimentation assay for each of the motor proteins was repeated at least two times. The ATPase activity of the motors was performed in a 100-μl reaction buffer (15 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 60 nm motor protein with or without taxol-stabilized MTs (2 μm) and 3 mmMg-ATP (39Hackney D.D. Jiang W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 164: 65-71Google Scholar). CaCl2, AtCaM2, and EGTA to a final concentration of 100 μm, 1 μm, and 2 mm, respectively, were also added in appropriate reactions. Following incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, 800 μl of freshly prepared malachite green reagent and 100 μl of 34% citric acid were added to the reactions, vortexed, and incubated further at room temperature for 10 min (39Hackney D.D. Jiang W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 164: 65-71Google Scholar). The released Pi was estimated colorimetrically using 1 OD660 equals 9.45 nmol of Pi. The ATPase activity of the motor proteins was expressed in μmol of Pi released per mg of motor protein per min. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Each experiment was repeated at least three independent times. Average values obtained from triplicates were analyzed for standard deviation using Microsoft Excel. To determine whether the CBD of a plant motor functions as a modular domain, we fused the CBD of a plant KCBP to the C terminus of two Drosophila kinesins, NCD and DK, a C-terminal motor, and an N-terminal motor, respectively (Fig. 1A). The bacterial expressed motor proteins with a CBD (KCBP 1.5C, NCD+CBD, and DK+CBD) were purified using a CaM-Sepharose column, and motor proteins without a CBD (KCBP 1.0C, NCD, and DK) but with a His tag were purified using a His-Bind column. The crude bacterial-induced total proteins and purified motor proteins are shown in Fig. 1B. All the purified motor proteins yielded a single band (Fig. 1B,stained gel, lane P). Three other identical gels were blotted and probed with HRP-CaM, T7-tag antibody, or S-protein (Fig. 1B). As expected NCD+CBD, DK+CBD, and KCBP 1.5C interacted with CaM whereas NCD, DK, and KCBP 1.0C that lack a CBD did not interact with CaM in blot overlay assay (Fig. 1B,HRP-CaM). Further, chimeric motors did not bind CaM in the presence of EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator (data not shown). These results suggest that the chimeric motors NCD+CBD and DK+CBD bound CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and the plant kinesin CBD confers CaM binding ability to animal kinesins. NCD+CBD, NCD, and KCBP 1.0C that contain T7-tag were detected by T7-tag antibody (Fig. 1B, T7-tag.Ab) whereas KCBP 1.5C and DK with S-tag were detected by S-protein (Fig. 1B,S-protein). KCBP from plants (10Reddy A.S.N. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7052-7060Google Scholar) and kinesin-C from sea urchin (15Rogers G.C. Hart C.L. Wedman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1-8Google Scholar) are the only known CaM-binding kinesins. Previously we have shown that the activity of KCBP is modulated by bovine CaM (34Song H. Golovkin M. Reddy A.S.N. Endow S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 322-327Google Scholar, 35Narasimhulu S.B. Reddy A.S.N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 957-965Google Scholar, 36Deavours B.E. Reddy A.S.N. Walker R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 408-416Google Scholar). Here, we tested whether the fusion of plant kinesin CBD to phylogenetically divergent animal plus- and minus-end motors confers Ca2+-CaM regulation. The NCD+CBD has a 36-amino acid spacer whereas in the DK+CBD the CBD is separated from the motor by the neck and a short coiled-coil region of about 49 amino acids. Initially, we tested the binding of all three motor proteins (KCBP 1.5C, NCD+CBD, and DK+CBD) to MTs using a cosedimentation assay in the presence of ATP, AMP-PNP (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog), Ca2+, CaM, or Ca2+-CaM. As shown in Fig. 2, the KCBP 1.5C motor protein cosedimented with MTs in the pellet fraction in the presence of AMP-PNP and Ca2+ or CaM. In the presence of Ca2+-CaM (either bovine or Arabidopsis CaM) and AMP-PNP, the motor protein did not cosediment with the MTs and remained in the soluble fraction suggesting that motor protein interaction with MTs is inhibited by Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 2, K 1.5C). Because the KCBP 1.0C motor co-migrates with the tubulin subunits, a duplicate gel was blotted and probed with T7-tag antibody (Fig. 2,T7-tag.Ab). KCBP without the CBD (K 1.0C) interacted and cosedimented with the MTs in the presence of AMP-PNP and Ca2+, CaM, or both (Fig. 2, K 1.0C). KCBP 1.0C motor, like KCBP 1.5C, remained in the soluble fraction in the presence of Mg-ATP. These results suggest that all three plant CaM isoforms, like bovine CaM, modulate the interaction of KCBP motor through its CaM-binding domain. Using the cosedimentation assay we analyzed the interaction of chimeric NCD+CBD and native NCD motor with MTs. As shown in Fig. 3, although NCD+CBD or NCD in the absence of MTs remained in the soluble fraction even after high speed ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3, No Mt), when combined with MTs they cosedimented with MTs in the presence of AMP-PNP and Ca2+ or CaM (Fig. 3). However, when NCD+CBD was incubated with MTs in the presence of AMP-PNP and both Ca2+ and CaM or in the presence of ATP alone, the motor protein did not interact and cosediment with the MTs (Fig. 3, compare Mt/Ca,Mt/CaM, and Mt/Ca CaM). In contrast, NCD without CBD (Fig. 3, NCD) interacted and cosedimented with the MTs despite the presence of Ca2+-CaM. These results show clearly that NCD+CBD and NCD are regulated in the same manner as KCBP 1.5C and KCBP 1.0C by Ca2+-CaM, respectively. We then tested the effect of Ca2+-CaM on the chimeric DK+CBD in which the CBD is fused to a plus-end motor and native DK motor domain in cosedimentation assays. Because the DK+CBD co-migrates with MTs, a duplicated gel was blotted and probed with HRP-CaM to detect the DK+CBD motor protein (Fig. 4,HRP-CaM). Like KCBP 1.5C and NCD+CBD, the DK+CBD is also regulated by Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 4). In the presence of both Ca2+-CaM, but not in the presence of Ca2+ or CaM alone, DK+CBD chimeric motor did not bind MTs, and the motor protein remained in the soluble fraction (Fig. 4, DK+ CBD; see Mt/Ca CaM). In contrast to DK+CBD, DK bound with MTs in the presence of both Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 4, DK). Our results with DK without the CBD in pelleting assay are in agreement with the MT-binding activity of the DK motor (aa 1–337) reported previously (40Song H. Endow S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11203-11209Google Scholar). Because we fused plant CBD to animal motors and used bovine CaM to show the negative regulation of chimeric NCD+CBD and DK+CBD motors with MTs, we tested whether Arabidopsis CaM2, -4, and -6 isoforms regulate the chimeric motors in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Although these AtCaM isoforms differ in a few amino acids (38Reddy V.S. Safadi F. Zielinski R.E. Reddy A.S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31727-31733Google Scholar), they inhibited the interaction of chimeric motors (NCD+CBD and DK+CBD) with MTs and had no affect on the interaction of motors without CBD (NCD and DK; see Figs.3 and 4, Mt/Ca CaM). In the presence of Ca2+ and one of the AtCaM isoforms (CaM2, -4, or -6), the motors with CBD remained in the soluble fraction (see Figs. 3 and 4, bottom panel, Mt/Ca CaM) whereas the motors without CBD cosedimented with MTs (see Figs. 3 and 4, bottom panel,Mt/Ca CaM). These results indicate that bovine and allArabidopsis CaM isoforms are able to interact with CBD-containing motors and inhibit their interaction with MTs. These data suggest that activated CaM regulates the two chimeric (NCD+CBD and DK+CBD) motors, as well as KCBP 1.5C in a similar fashion although NCD and DK are minus- and plus-end-directed motors that perform different functions in Drosophila. DK is involved in membrane transport and is essential for neuromuscular function whereas NCD is involved in stabilizing bipolar spindle assembly during metaphase and chromosome distribution in female meiosis and early mitosis in oocytes and embryos (1Goldstein L.S.B. Philip A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 141-183Google Scholar, 22Reilein A.R. Rogers S.L. Tume M.C. Gelfand V.I. Intl. Rev. Cytol. & Cell Biol. 2001; 204: 180-238Google Scholar). To further confirm the Ca2+-CaM negative regulation of chimeric motors, we determined MT-stimulated ATPase activity of these motors in the presence of Ca2+, CaM, or both. Because allArabidopsis CaM isoforms showed inhibition of motor interaction with MTs, and because AtCaM2 has 2-fold higher affinity for KCBP 1.5C (38Reddy V.S. Safadi F. Zielinski R.E. Reddy A.S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31727-31733Google Scholar), we used AtCaM2 in ATPase assays. KCBP, NCD, and DK with or without CBD showed basal ATPase activity in the absence of MTs (Fig. 5). The ATPase activity of KCBP, NCD, and DK with and without CBD in the presence of MTs is increased by 15–21-fold (Fig. 5). The MT-stimulated ATPase activity of motors with or without the CBD was not affected in the presence of Ca2+ or AtCaM2 alone (Fig. 5), suggesting that there is no influence of the fusion of the CBD to NCD and DK motors on the ATPase function of the chimeras. Interestingly, as in the MT-pelleting assay, the MT-stimulated ATPase activity of KCBP 1.5C, NCD+CBD, and DK+CBD was reduced by 90, 89, and 88%, respectively, in the presence of both Ca2+ and AtCaM2 (Fig. 5A). However, the MT-stimulated ATPase activ"

However, neither the E. coli SSB protein nor the T4 gene 32 protein can replace gene 2.5 protein in cells infected by T7 phage lacking gene 2.5 (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This specificity for gene 2.5 protein is not surprising as there is little sequence homology between the proteins, and wt gene 2.5 protein differs from the other proteins significantly in a number of biochemical properties. For instance, the T7 protein binds to DNA with a lower affinity than either E. coli SSB protein or T4 gene 32 protein (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of these proteins also differ with wt gene 2.5 protein existing as a stable dimer in solution (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas E. coli SSB protein forms a tetrameter (14Weiner J.H. Bertsch L.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1972-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and T4 gene 32 protein is a monomer that forms multimers at high concentrations (15von Hippel P.H. Kowalczykowski S.C.

In addition to interacting with itself, wt gene 2.5 protein also interacts specifically with T7 DNA polymerase and the product of T7 gene 4, a helicase/primase (17Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Churchich J.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli SSB protein and T4 gene 32 protein feature acidic carboxyl-terminal motifs that are involved in protein-protein interactions (18Curth U.

Similarly, the acidic carboxyl terminus of wt gene 2.5 protein is required to mediate interactions with other replication proteins (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including those that coordinate leading and lagging strand synthesis by T7 replication proteins on a minicircle template in vitro (11Lee J. Chastain P.D., II Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because of its critical role in interactions with other replication proteins, mutagenesis studies on gene 2.5 protein to date have focused on the carboxyl terminus (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one study (23Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a truncated gene 2.5 protein missing the final 21 amino acids was produced. Expressing this altered gene 2.5 protein in E. coli did not support the growth of a T7 phage deleted in gene 2.5 (23Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated gene 2.5 protein itself is a monomer in solution but retains the ability to bind DNA (23Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It neither stimulates DNA synthesis by T7 DNA polymerase nor does it interact physically with that protein (23Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second study examined chimeric proteins in which the carboxyl-terminal motif of wt gene 2.5 protein was replaced with the complementary motif of T4 gene 32 protein and E. coli SSB protein (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The chimeric proteins could support phage growth, form dimers, and interact with T7 DNA polymerase (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When the carboxyl-terminal motif of T7 wt gene 2.5 protein was used to replace that of E. coli SSB protein and T4 gene 32 protein, the chimeric proteins could not substitute for wt gene 2.5 protein to support the growth of a gene 2.5-deleted phage (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These results suggest that although the carboxyl terminus is required for protein-protein interactions, it does not account for the specificity of those interactions (13Kong D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently a three-dimensional crystal structure of a carboxyl terminus deleted form of T7 gene 2.5 protein was published (24Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The protein has a conserved oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold (25Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), similar to that of T4 gene 32 protein (26Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and E. coli SSB protein (27Raghunathan S. Ricard C.S. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6652-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 28Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The structure suggests models for DNA binding and dimerization (24Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); however, there are no mutagenesis studies to either support or refute these models. In fact, outside of the studies on the carboxyl terminus described above, there is a lack of experimental evidence to define the functional domains of wt gene 2.5 protein. To begin mapping these domains, we developed a screen for lethal mutations in gene 2.5. A similar screen was successfully used to identify lethal mutants of the T7 helicase/primase (29Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Presumably, mutations that are lethal will occur in regions critical to wt gene 2.5 protein functions or proper folding. In the present study we characterize three of the altered proteins biochemically, and we show that they define the interface for dimer formation, demonstrating that dimerization is an essential property of gene 2.5 protein.

Construction of the T7 deletion phage (T7Δ2.5) was described previously (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). T7Δ2.5 phage used in the in vivo DNA synthesis experiments was provided by Jaya Kumar (Harvard Medical School). The plasmids encoding gene 2.5, pETGP2.5 and pETGP2.5-PPS were provided by James Stattel (Harvard Medical School). The parent vector of pETGP2.5-PPS, pET19bPPS, which encodes a tag of 10 histidine residues and a rhinovirus C protease (PreScission protease, Amersham Biosciences) cleavage site located upstream of the start codon, was kindly provided by Tapan Biswas (Harvard Medical School). The following oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc.: T72.5NdeI, 5′-CGTAGGATCCATATGGCTAAGAAGATTTTCACCTC-3′; T72.5BamHI, 5′-CGTAGGATCCACTTAGAAGTCTCCGTC-3′; and Oligo 70, 5′-GACCATATCCTCCACCCTCCCCAATATTGACCATCAACCCTTCACCTCACTTCACTCCACTATACCACTC-3. The following oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies: T7 promoter, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGG-3′; pET17up, 5′-CTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATG-3′; T7 terminator, 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′; and DS17b, 5′-GCTTCCTTTCGGGCTTTG-3′. The oligonucleotide BCMP206, 5′-TAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACG-3′, was synthesized by the Biopolymer Laboratory, Harvard Medical School. M13 (mGP1-2) DNA and T7 DNA polymerase lacking exonuclease activity (30Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6447-6458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Stan Tabor (Harvard Medical School). Wild-type and altered gene 2.5 proteins were purified as described below. Gene 2.5 protein-Δ26C was provided by Eric Toth (Harvard Medical School). His-gene 2.5 protein-Δ26C was provided by James Stattel (Harvard Medical School). T7 DNA polymerase was provided by Don Johnson and Joon-Soo Lee (Harvard Medical School). A library of randomly mutated plasmids was created using the mutator E. coli strain XL1-Red (Stratagene). The plasmid pETGP2.5 was transformed into XL1-Red, and transformants were plated on LB plates supplemented with 60 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, 2 ml of LB were added to plates to facilitate the scraping of the colonies. Ampicillin was added to a concentration of 60 μg/ml, and the culture of pooled colonies were grown overnight at 37 °C. The next day plasmid DNA was prepared from the bacteria using an RPM kit (Qbiogene). Selection of lethal mutations in gene 2.5 was based on the complementation assay described previously (1Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When gene 2.5 is expressed on a plasmid, the phage T7Δ2.5 can grow in E. coli HMS262. The screen was performed in a manner similar to that used to uncover lethal mutants of bacteriophage T7 gene 4 (29Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Washington M.T. Patel S.S. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26819-26824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with alterations noted below. Randomly mutated plasmids generated from pETGP2.5 were introduced intoE. coli HMS262 by electroporation using an E. coli Pulser Transformation Apparatus (Bio-Rad) in 19 separate experiments. Electrocompetent E. coli HMS262 cells were prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Bio-Rad). In each experiment, 1 ng of DNA was mixed with 40 μl of electrocompetent cells and incubated on ice for 5 min. The mixtures were transferred to 0.1-cm cuvettes (Bio-Rad). Cuvettes were pulsed at 1.80 kV. One ml of SOC (2% bactotryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 20 mm glucose) was added immediately after pulsing, and the mixture was then transferred to a 15-ml polystyrene tube. Cells were allowed to recover by shaking for 1 h at 37 °C. One hundred fifty μl of cells were plated on LB plates containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin, which were overlaid with 2.5 ml of top agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast, 0.5% NaCl, 0.7% agar (pH 7.0)) containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin either alone or with 107 plaque-forming units of T7Δ2.5 phage. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The next morning, colonies that formed on the LB plates with ampicillin were counted to determine the efficiency of electroporation. Colonies that formed on the plates overlaid with T7Δ2.5 phage were counted, then streaked on LB plates with 60 μg/ml ampicillin, and cross-streaked with T7Δ2.5 phage to confirm that the cells could not support the replication of the gene 2.5 deleted phage. Approximately 0.6% of the colonies screened could not support the growth of T7Δ2.5 phage. After streaking, a collection of 291 cultures of transformants that are unable to support the growth of T7Δ2.5 phage were frozen as glycerol stocks. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 5-ml cultures of 216 independent transformants. Each plasmid was analyzed by restriction digests with NdeI and BamHI (New England Biolabs) to ensure that a 699-bp fragment was released. This analysis eliminated 14 plasmids from further consideration. The remaining 202 plasmids were sequenced by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center High-Throughput DNA Sequencing Facility using the sequencing primers pET17up and DS17b. Readable sequence was obtained for 190 plasmids. DNA synthesis was measured by a method modified from Richardson and co-workers (31Saito H. Richardson C.C. J. Virol. 1981; 37: 343-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kumar J.K. Kremsdorf R. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46151-46159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A culture of Davis minimal media supplemented with 60 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with E. coli HMS262 transformed with pETGP2.5, pETGP2.5-P22L, pETGP2.5-F31S, or pETGP2.5-G36S and grown at 30 °C in a gyratory shaker. Cells were grown to a density of 3 × 108 cells per ml and then infected with T7Δ2.5 phage at a multiplicity of infection of 7. At 5-min intervals post-infection, 200-μl samples were removed, and [3H]thymidine (50 μCi/ml) was added. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 s and then terminated by adding 40 μl of an ice-cold solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS. Sixty μl of the terminated reactions were spotted onto DE81 filters. Filters were washed 3 times in 0.3 m ammonium formate, 2 times in ethanol, and then air-dried. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was then determined by liquid scintillation counting. Wild-type and altered gene 2.5 protein were purified by a procedure developed by Stattel and Richardson. 2J. Stattel and C. C. Richardson, unpublished data. The plasmids pET2.5, pET2.5-P22L, pET2.5-F31S, and pET2.5-G36S were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). One- (pET2.5-P22L and pET2.5-F31S) or 8-liter cultures (pET2.5, pET2.5-G36S) were grown in LB with 60 μg/ml ampicillin to an OD of 1.0. Cells were induced for 4 h after adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml/liter of culture lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose), frozen in dry ice, and stored at −70 °C. Lysozyme (Sigma) was added to thawed cells (final concentrated 1 mg/ml) and stirred in the cold for 1 h. Lysed cells were warmed to 20 °C in a 37 °C bath, then chilled on ice, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 45 min at 100,000 × g. Polyethyleneimine (pH 7.5) was added to the supernatant (final concentration, 0.1%), and the mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 21,000 × g. The resulting pellet was suspended in 75 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol) containing 1 m NaCl, stirred for 1 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and then diluted with Buffer A to a final volume of 150 ml. To precipitate the proteins, (NH4)2SO4 was added to 80% saturation, and the solution was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was suspended in 60 ml of Buffer A and filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter. The sample was loaded onto a POROS HQ column (PE Biosystems) and gene 2.5 protein eluted in a 50 mm to 1m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing gene 2.5 protein were pooled, and the protein was precipitated by adding (NH4)2SO4 to 60% saturation. The solution was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in Buffer G (50 mmKPO4 (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol) to a concentration of no more than 5 mg/ml. The sample was loaded onto a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions that contained gene 2.5 protein were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer S (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol), and then stored at −20 °C. Purified wt gene 2.5 protein, gene 2.5 protein-P22L, and gene 2.5 protein-F31S were over 99% pure as determined by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining and were free of contaminating DNA-dependent nuclease activity (data not shown). Protein concentrations were calculated from UV spectrophotometer readings at 280 mm, using the calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm (33Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5009) Google Scholar) of 2.58 × 104m−1 cm−1. This procedure consistently yielded only small amounts of gene 2.5 protein-G36S, and the preparations were contaminated with a DNA nuclease. For this reason gene 2.5 protein-G36S was expressed and purified as a 10-histidine fusion protein as described below. Separate 1-liter cultures of BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET19b2.5PPS, pET19b2.5PPS-P22L, pET19b2.5PPS-F31S, and pET19b2.5PPS-G36S were grown, induced, and harvested as described above. Pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer B (50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl) containing 70 mmimidazole, then frozen in dry ice, and stored at −70 °C. Lysozyme (Sigma) was added to thawed cells (final concentration 1 mg/ml), and the suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 2 h. One hundred twenty five units of Benzonase nuclease (Novagen) was added to lysates that were then rapidly warmed to ∼20 °C in a 37 °C bath, chilled on ice, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 8,000 ×g. Supernatants were loaded onto a 5-ml column packed with nickel-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer B containing 70 mm imidazole and proteins eluted in 2 column volumes of Buffer B containing 500 mmimidazole. Histidine-tagged gene 2.5 protein (His-gene 2.5 protein), His-gene 2.5 protein-P22L, His-gene 2.5 protein-F31S, and His-gene 2.5 protein-G36S were dialyzed against Buffer S, and stored at −20 °C. An aliquot of His-gene 2.5 protein-G36S was then processed to remove the amino-terminal tag. To cleave the histidine tag, 50 μg of PreScission protease was added to the eluted fraction, and the entire protein solution was dialyzed for18 h against Buffer C (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 225 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) using 10-kDa cut-off dialysis membrane (Pierce). The dialyzed protein solution was passed through a 1-ml GSTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) at a rate of 0.5 ml/min to remove the PreScission protease. Proteins were then re-applied to a 5-ml Ni-NTA column to ensure removal of any protein that still contained the histidine tag. Purified proteins were dialyzed into Buffer S and stored at −20 °C. Proteins prepared in this manner were determined to be over 95% pure and free of contaminating nuclease activity. Gel filtration analysis was performed as described previously (2Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, in three independent experiments 50 μg of wt gene 2.5 protein, gene 2.5 protein-P22L, gene 2.5 protein-F31S, and gene 2.5 protein-G36S diluted in Buffer S (final concentration 4 μm) were applied to a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.50 ml/min. The elution of each protein was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Chromatography was carried out at 4 °C in Buffer G (50 mm KPO4 (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). The running buffer for high salt experiments was 50 mmKPO4 (pH 7.0), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. The peak elution volume (v e) was taken to be the average of the volumes at which each protein eluted in three experiments. The void volume (v 0) and total volume (v t) were determined by independently applying blue dextran and xylene cyanol, respectively. The fractional retention (K av) was calculated using the formulaK av = (v e −v 0)/(v t −v 0), where v e is the peak elution volume. A standard curve of K av versus log M r was generated by applying both high and low molecular weight protein standards (AmershamBiosciences) to the column under the conditions described above. Standard curves were generated at both salt concentrations examined in this study. The oligodeoxynucleotide 70 was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-33P]ATP and then purified using micro BioSpin 6 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The 15-μl reactions included 3 nm33P-labeled 70-mer oligonucleotide, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and various concentrations (from 0 to 10 μm) of either wt gene 2.5 protein, gene 2.5 protein-P22L, gene 2.5 protein-F31S, or gene 2.5 protein-G36S diluted in a buffer of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were immediately put on ice and then loaded onto a 10% TBE Ready Gel (Bio-Rad) running in 0.5× Tris/glycine buffer (12.5 mm Tris base, 95 mm glycine, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Gels were run at 80 V for 2 h at 4 °C and then dried and exposed to a Fujix PhosphorImager plate for quantitation using ImageQuant software. Dissociation constants were calculated from the average of three experiments using the Langmuir isotherm formula. In the experiments where the salt concentration was varied, KCl was replaced by NaCl at a variety of concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, or 400 mm). In these experiments gene 2.5 protein concentration was 1.3 μm. The ability of wt gene 2.5 protein to facilitate the annealing of homologous strands of DNA was assessed using an in vitro annealing assay developed by Tabor and Richardson. 3S. Tabor and C. C. Richardson, unpublished data. The assay measures the annealing of a radiolabeled ssDNA fragment of M13 DNA to unlabeled circular M13 ssDNA. The labeled fragment was generated in a 60.5-μl reaction by annealing 60 pmol of the oligonucleotide BCMP206 to 8 pmol of M13 (mp1-2) in a buffer containing 25 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), and 50 mm NaCl. The annealed primer was partially extended by T7 DNA polymerase-Δ28 in a 77.75-μl reaction containing 10 mm MgCl2, 3.9 mm DTT, 0.13 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μCi [α−32P]dGTP, and a limiting (8 μm each) quantity of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. After 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was supplemented with 80 μmeach of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and DNA synthesis was completed in 15 min at room temperature. Reactions were then incubated for 10 min at 70 °C to inactivate the polymerase. Next, E. coli SSB protein was added, and the DNA was digested with Acc65-1 (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 37 °C. Reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1), and DNA was purified using microspin S-400 columns (Amersham Biosciences). ssDNA fragments were generated by adding NaOH to a final concentration of 100 mmand incubating at room temperature for 5 min. HCl and Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) were each added to a final concentration of 100 mm, and DNA fragments were separated on a 1.4% agarose gel. After electrophoresis the 310-bp band was cut from the gel, and DNA was isolated using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). DNA annealing was assayed in 20-μl reactions containing 4 nm32P-labeled ssDNA fragment, 20 μm M13 mGP1–2 ssDNA, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0–30 μm wt gene 2.5 protein or altered gene 2.5 proteins. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 8 min and then analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel at 75 V for 1 h at room temperature, then dried, and exposed to a Fujix PhosphorImager plate. Time course experiments were carried out under the same conditions except all reactions contained a constant amount of gene 2.5 protein (gene 2.5 protein, 10 μm; gene 2.5 protein-P22L, 10 μm; gene 2.5 protein-F31S, 10 μm; gene 2.5 protein-G36S, 30 μm). Reactions were stopped by adding SDS to a final concentration of 0.5% and then immediately put on ice. The interaction between gene 2.5 protein and T7 DNA polymerase was assayed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using the BIAcore 3000 system.

Vpr was also shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells and budding yeasts, an effect that was proposed to lead to growth arrest and cell killing in budding yeasts and apoptosis in human cells. In this study, we used a genetic selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify hexameric peptides that suppress the growth arrest phenotype mediated by Vpr. Fifteen selected glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused peptides were found to overcome to different extents Vpr-mediated growth arrest. Amino acid analysis of the inhibitory peptide sequences revealed the conservation of a di-tryptophan (diW) motif. DiW-containing GST-peptides interacted with Vpr in GST pull-down assays, and their level of interaction correlated with their ability to overcome Vpr-mediated growth arrest. Importantly, Vpr-binding GST-peptides were also found to alleviate Vpr-mediated apoptosis and G2 arrest in HIV-1-producing CD4+T cell lines. Furthermore, they co-localized with Vpr and interfered with its nuclear translocation.

Adzhubei A. Rev. Med. Virol. 1999; 9: 39-49Google Scholar and 2Zhao Y. Elder R.T. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 905-916Google Scholar). Several functions of Vpr have been demonstrated in vitro underlining the importance of this protein for HIV replication and pathogenesis. Vpr is packaged into viral particles, suggesting that it may play a role in early events during HIV-1 infection (3Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J.

Indeed, some experimental evidence indicates that Vpr increases HIV-1 replication in non-dividing cells such as macrophages, possibly by facilitating with other viral components nuclear import of the large viral pre-integration complex (5Fouchier R.A.

Interestingly, Vpr localizes predominantly to the nucleus in a variety of cell types and was found to contain two non-canonical nuclear localization signals located in the N terminus and the C-terminal part of the protein (5Fouchier R.A.

This property of Vpr was proposed to enhance viral replication because HIV-1 transcription is presumably more active during the G2 phase of the cell cycle (14Goh W.C. Rogel M.E. Kinsey C.M.

Vpr-mediated cell cycle G2 arrest can be observe in cells from distantly related eukaryotes including human and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and was shown to occur through inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2/Cdk1 (16He J.

In all eukaryotic cells, entry into mitosis is regulated by the phosphorylation status of Cdc2/Cdk1, which is phosphorylated by Myt1 and Wee1 protein kinases during G2 and rapidly dephosphorylated by the Cdc25C phosphatase to trigger entry into mitosis. Both Wee1 and Cdc25C activities are themselves regulated at the level of their subcellular localization as well as by upstream kinase/phosphatase networks (20Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Google Scholar). Indeed, recent genetic studies with fission yeast suggest that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest through a pathway involving protein phosphatase 2A, acting on both Wee1 and Cdc25C (21Masuda M. Nagai Y. Oshima N. Tanaka K. Murakami H. Igarashi H. Okayama H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2636-2646Google Scholar, 22Elder R.T. Yu M. Chen M. Zhu X. Yanagida M. Zhao Y. Virology. 2001; 287: 359-370Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Vpr targets a well conserved cellular pathway controlling the G2 checkpoint during cell cycle. However, although Vpr has been shown to interact with various host proteins (23BouHamdan M. Benichou S. Rev F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 9732-9742Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism underlying Vpr-induced cell cycle G2 arrest in HIV-1-infected cells remains undefined.In addition to nuclear targeting and cell cycle G2 arrest activities, Vpr was also shown to differentially regulate the occurrence of apoptosis in human cells. In particular, it has been reported that during active HIV-1 replication, Vpr can induce cell killing by apoptosis by a mechanism that is independent from cell cycle G2 arrest (15Yao X.-J.

Moreover, several studies showed that Vpr is capable of regulating either positively or negatively, apoptosis depending on the level of protein expression or the state of immune activation (31Ayyavoo V.

Kagawa S. Adachi A. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1011-1017Google Scholar). More recently, Vpr was shown to induce mitochondrial membrane permeability dysfunction in both human and budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), an observation that led some to propose that this effect might be responsible for Vpr-mediated apoptosis in human cells and growth arrest and cell killing in budding yeasts (33Jacotot E.

Med. 2001; 193: 509-519Google Scholar) showed that the addition of extracellular Vpr or Vpr C-terminal peptides to human cells or isolated mitochondria could permeabilized mitochondria, leading to a decreased membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. The major target for Vpr in the mitochondrial membrane appears to be the permeability transition pore complex given that a polypeptide corresponding to Vpr C-terminal was reported to bind specifically adenine nucleotide translocator, a major component of the permeability transition pore complex (34Jacotot E. Ferri K.F. El Hamel C. Brenner C. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Rustin P. Metivier D. Lenoir C. Geuskens M. Vieira H.L. Loeffler M. Belzacq A.S. Briand J.P. Zamzami N. Edelman L. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 509-519Google Scholar). Experiments in budding yeast further support that Vpr induces cell killing through mitochondrial membrane permeability by interaction with permeability transition pore complex. Externally added Vpr kills budding yeast, and the same region of Vpr is required to kill both yeast and mammalian cells (33Jacotot E. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Ferri K.F. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Costantini P. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Briand J.P. Irinopoulou T. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Cointe D. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 33-46Google Scholar, 34Jacotot E.

Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 509-519Google Scholar). Even though the mechanism involved in Vpr-induced apoptosis and cell killing is still not fully understood, all of these studies indeed stress the importance of Vpr during HIV-mediated pathogenesis.In the present study, we used a genetic selection in S. cerevisiae budding yeasts to select a panel of 15 glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused hexameric peptides that suppress the growth arrest phenotype of HIV-1 Vpr. Sequence analysis reveals that a common di-tryptophan amino acid motif is conserved in all inhibitory peptides, suggesting that this motif is critical for the ability of GST-peptides to interfere with HIV-1 Vpr activity in budding yeasts. Mechanistic analyses indeed reveal that the peptide-mediated growth arrest inhibition is not the result of a lack of synthesis nor degradation of Vpr but is instead mediated via an interaction between GST-peptide fusion proteins and Vpr. Interestingly, expression of Vpr-binding GST-fused peptides in human CD4+ Jurkat T cell lines alleviated Vpr-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle G2arrest upon infection with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 virus. Furthermore, intracellular localization analysis revealed that the inhibitory GST-peptides co-localized with HIV-1 Vpr in mammalian cells and interfered with the protein nuclear translocation. This yeast genetic selection system represents a novel approach of identifying peptide inhibitors of HIV-1 Vpr biological activities and provides information about amino acid motifs that may be present in Vpr-interacting cellular factors or downstream effectors.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have taken advantage of the growth arrest phenotype induced by Vpr in budding yeast to screen a GST-fused hexameric peptide library for GST-peptide fusions capable of inhibiting Vpr cell growth arrest activity. Fifteen GST-peptides that had the capacity to overcome Vpr-mediated growth arrest were identified using this genetic selection system. Given that the G2 to M transition of budding yeast is regulated differently than in fission yeast or mammalian cells (inhibitory phosphorylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 of budding yeast does not play a major role in this transition (48Gu J. Emerman M. Sandmeyer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4033-4042Google Scholar, 54Amon A. Surana U. Muroff I. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1992; 355: 368-371Google Scholar, 55Sorger P.K. Murray A.W. Nature. 1992; 355: 365-368Google Scholar)), it is unlikely that the selected peptides overcome Vpr-mediated budding yeast growth arrest by interfering with specific interactions between Vpr and cellular components regulating inhibitory phosphorylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase and the G2-M transition, as was demonstrated in mammalian cells and fission yeast (16He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Google Scholar, 17Re F. Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6859-6864Google Scholar, 19Zhao Y. Cao J. O'Gorman M.R. Yu M. Yogev R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5821-5826Google Scholar). Rather, intracellular expression of Vpr in budding yeast was shown to induce growth defects by a mechanism that appears to involve mitochondrial dysfunction (35Macreadie I.G. Thorburn D.R. Kirby D.M. Castelli L.A. de Rozario N.L. Azad A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 145-149Google Scholar). Macreadie et al.(35Macreadie I.G. Thorburn D.R. Kirby D.M. Castelli L.A. de Rozario N.L. Azad A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 145-149Google Scholar) find that constitutive production of Vpr in S. cerevisiae caused a respiratory deficiency due to effects on several mitochondrial enzymes. This deficiency caused some interference with yeast growth on fermentable carbon sources such as glucose but caused a complete block to growth on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol or ethanol, where mitochondrial respiratory function is required. In addition, when added externally, Vpr was found to cause yeast cell killing by a mechanism that involves defects in mitochondrial membrane permeability (33Jacotot E. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Ferri K.F. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Costantini P. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Briand J.P. Irinopoulou T. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Cointe D. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp.

Briand J.P. Zamzami N. Edelman L. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 509-519Google Scholar). Although in both cases experimental evidence suggests that Vpr may act through the mitochondria, it still unclear whether intracellular yeast growth arrest and external cytocidal effects are related (33Jacotot E. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Ferri K.F. Vieira H.L. Zamzami N. Costantini P. Druillennec S. Hoebeke J. Briand J.P. Irinopoulou T. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Cointe D. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Roques B.P. Kroemer G.

Castelli L.A. Sankovich S.A. Smith S.C. Curtain C.C. Macreadie I.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 287-290Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these data strongly suggest that the GST-peptides identified in this study were selected on the basis of their ability to prevent or overcome Vpr-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.Using the GST pull-down binding assay, we have clearly showed that a set of representative GST-peptides interacted with Vpr, however, with different efficiencies. Interestingly, the growth arrest inhibitory effect mediated by the GST-peptides correlated very well with their Vpr binding efficiency. GST-p18 was found to have the strongest inhibitory effect (Fig. 3A) and was shown to strongly bind Vpr (Fig. 4A). In contrast, GST-p4 was found to have the weakest effect on Vpr-mediated growth arrest (Fig. 3A) and the lowest Vpr binding efficiency (Fig. 4A). These results strongly suggest that the interaction of the GST-peptides with Vpr interferes with its ability to induce a growth arrest in budding yeasts.Sequence analysis of the GST-peptides exhibiting anti-Vpr activity revealed that they all contained a conserved diW motif. The conservation of such a motif within all selected peptides strongly suggest that it may be critical for the peptide ability to interact with Vpr and inhibit its biological activity. Indeed, randomly selected GST hexameric peptides that did not contain a diW motif were not found to inhibit Vpr-mediated growth arrest in budding yeast (data not shown). In addition, the most potent GST-peptides displayed a stretch of hydrophobic residues at their C terminus that might also confer selected peptides with some inhibitory activity (Fig. 2). However, the exact contribution of the diW motif and the hydrophobic C terminus to the peptide anti-Vpr activity remains to be determined. Interestingly, among 15 selected GST-peptides, four (GST-p16, -p17, -p13, and -p10) harbored a previously reported WXXF motif (49BouHamdan M. Xue Y. Baudat Y. Hu B. Sire J. Pomerantz R.J. Duan L.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8009-8016Google Scholar). The WXXF motif was shown to be a Vpr-interacting domain and was found to be present in the Vpr-interacting protein uracil DNA glycosylase (49BouHamdan M. Xue Y. Baudat Y. Hu B. Sire J. Pomerantz R.J. Duan L.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8009-8016Google Scholar). Several studies have also shown that fusion of WXXF motif to heterologous protein allowed these fusion proteins to be targeted into HIV-1 viral particles via an interaction between Vpr and the WXXF-containing protein (49BouHamdan M. Xue Y. Baudat Y. Hu B. Sire J. Pomerantz R.J. Duan L.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8009-8016Google Scholar, 57Kulkosky J. BouHamdan M. Geist A. Pomerants R.J. Virology. 1999; 255: 77-85Google Scholar, 58Okui N. Sakuma R. Kobayashi N. Yoshikura H. Kitamura T. Chiba J. Kitamura Y. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 537-546Google Scholar). Our sequence and functional analyses reveal the conservation of a diW motif in all peptides that were selected for their abilities to reestablish yeast cell growth. The presence of a phenylalanine in the context of a WXXF motif did not appear to be absolutely necessary, as demonstrated by the sequence of GST-p18, the strongest Vpr inhibitor, which contained the sequence SEWWVWV (Figs. 2 and 3). This difference may reflect the different experimental designs that were used to select these Vpr-binding peptides. BouHamdan et al. (49BouHamdan M. Xue Y. Baudat Y. Hu B. Sire J. Pomerantz R.J. Duan L.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8009-8016Google Scholar) used a phage display approach to select peptides that had the ability to bind recombinant Vpr in in vitro cell-free conditions, whereas the genetic system described in this study selects peptides on the basis of their ability to inhibit a Vpr biological activity intracellularly. It is possible that the presence of phenylalanine in the WXXF motif can substitute for the second tryptophan in the diW motif to provide Vpr binding affinityin vitro. However, the diW motif and the hydrophobic properties of the peptides may be necessary in vivo to ensure that the inhibitory peptides reach the cellular compartment where Vpr interacts with critical cellular partner(s) or, alternatively, may promote steps after Vpr binding that lead to inhibition of Vpr-mediated growth arrest. These peptide properties cannot be selected for using phage display given that the assay is based on a peptide-recombinant protein interaction that occurs in a cell-free system.Cell cycle G2 arrest and modulation of apoptosis are two of the main biological activities associated with Vpr during HIV-1 infection. Interestingly, diW-containing GST-peptides that were shown to efficiently interact with Vpr in yeast cells, including GST-p12 and GST-p18, interfered with Vpr-mediated G2 arrest and apoptosis in Jurkat T cells upon infection with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 virus (Fig. 5). The degree of inhibition of Vpr-mediated G2arrest and apoptosis was once again found to correlate with the efficiency of Vpr binding. Unexpectedly, GST p4 was shown to have a weak but reproducible inhibitory effect on Vpr-mediated G2arrest in Jurkat and 293 T cells (Figs. 5 and 6) even though it did not interact very efficiently with Vpr. GST-p4 did not exhibit any significant inhibitory effect on Vpr-mediated apoptosis as compared with GST-p12 and GST-p18 (Fig. 5). This differential effect of GST-p4 on Vpr-mediated G2 arrest and apoptosis may reflect the distinct requirements of these two Vpr biological activities and the lack of direct correlation that may exist between them. In this regard, our data support the conclusion of recent studies showing that induction of apoptosis by HIV-1 Vpr occurs independently of G2 arrest (29Nishizawa M. Kamata M. Mojin T. Nakai Y. Aida Y. Virology. 2000; 276: 16-26Google Scholar, 53Nishino Y. Myojin T. Kamata M. Aida Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 550-554Google Scholar). Another interesting observation of our study is that Vpr-binding GST-peptides (including GST-p16 and GST-p18) interfered with Vpr nuclear accumulation since Vpr was found mainly in a region close to the nuclear membrane in cells that coexpressed GST-p16 and p18. These results provide indirect evidence that some diW-containing GST-peptides (GST-p18 and -p16) interact with Vpr in mammalian cells. The requirement of Vpr nuclear localization for the protein cell cycle G2 arrest or proapoptotic activities still remains controversial (52Subbramanian R.A. Kessous-Elbaz A. Lodge R. Forget J. Yao X.J. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1103-1111Google Scholar, 59Chen M. Elder R.T. Yu M. O'Gorman M.G. Selig L. Benarous R. Yamamoto A. Zhao Y. J.

In this regard, it is still unclear whether the effect of these GST-peptides on Vpr nuclear localization is directly linked to their ability to interfere with Vpr cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Alternatively, diW-containing GST-peptides by interacting with Vpr may sequester the protein or act as dissociative inhibitors, thus preventing critical protein-protein interactions required for Vpr biological activities. Future studies will investigate the effect of these inhibitory peptides on Vpr interactions with known cellular partners.Because different functions of Vpr may optimize HIV-1 replication and contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo, this protein has been proposed to be a target for the development of antiviral strategies. Several studies report different strategies to inhibit Vpr functions during HIV-1 replication, such as Vpr dominant mutant (R73S) (62Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Rappaport J. Serio D. Chen W. Srinivasan A. Amini S. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 947-950Google Scholar), antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (RU486) (63Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Staube R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Google Scholar), and pentoxifylline (64Poon B. Jowett J.B. Stewart S.A. Armstrong R.W. Rishton G.M. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3961-3971Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of a genetic selection system in budding yeast that allows the in vivoidentification of hexameric peptide inhibitors that have functional relevance since they inhibit the function of target proteins, in this case Vpr, intracellularly. Overall, this study demonstrates that this genetic selection system provides a powerful tool for the rapid identification of potent inhibitors of biological processes in large combinatorial libraries.

Several functions of Vpr have been demonstrated in vitro underlining the importance of this protein for HIV replication and pathogenesis. Vpr is packaged into viral particles, suggesting that it may play a role in early events during HIV-1 infection (3Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J.

Indeed, some experimental evidence indicates that Vpr increases HIV-1 replication in non-dividing cells such as macrophages, possibly by facilitating with other viral components nuclear import of the large viral pre-integration complex (5Fouchier R.A.

The bound ATP molecules are hydrolyzed slowly by the GroEL subunit, and this has the effect of priming the cage formed by GroEL and GroES for release. Then, an additional seven molecules of ATP are bound to another heptameric ring bound back-to-back to the initial GroEL heptamer (the trans ring), and this binding triggers the release of the refolding protein molecule, ADP, and bound GroES.The numerous conformational changes of GroEL may be localized to three distinct domains found in the GroEL subunit (5Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The apical domain is responsible for the recognition and binding of refolding protein molecules and the co-chaperonin GroES. The equatorial domain possesses the binding site for the nucleotide ATP, which acts as the modulating factor of these conformational changes. The intermediate domain transfers various signals between the two former domains to produce a concerted movement of the GroEL subunit. Mutations in each of these domains result in alterations in the facet of the chaperonin mechanism that is most reflective of the specific role of each domain (4Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K.

Many subtle changes may be seen when mutations and other alterations are introduced into the intermediate domain, as this has the effect of altering the cooperation of the other two domains to complete a functional chaperonin cycle (7Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Martin J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5050-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In a previous study, our laboratory evaluated the effects of three mutant GroEL proteins whose mutations were each located in a different domain of the GroEL subunit (7Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two of these mutants, GroEL T89W and GroEL Y203C, produced predictable effects in their respective domains: GroEL T89W (12Mizobata T. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Nagai J. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25600-25607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), in the ATP hydrolytic abilities localized in the equatorial domain, and GroEL Y203C, in the substrate-binding characteristics of the apical domain. However, the most interesting mutant was localized in the intermediate domain. GroEL C138W was a mutant that was apparently indistinguishable from the wild-type chaperonin under normal experimental conditions. However, when we introduced into the experimental field a refolding protein molecule, bovine rhodanese, at 25 °C, we observed a complete arrest of both rhodanese refolding and ATP hydrolysis by GroEL. This arrest was seemingly unrelated to the presence or absence of GroES. Further experiments showed that at 25 °C, GroEL C138W formed a stable ternary complex in which rhodanese and GroES were simultaneously bound to the apical domain. More interestingly, this ternary complex could be induced to complete the chaperonin cycle by a simple increase in temperature to 37 °C. This result was interpreted to reflect the transfer of conformational signals between the equatorial domain and the apical domain, which were necessary for a coordinated movement of the GroEL subunit.In the present article, we show some further results obtained using the novel characteristics of this mutant chaperonin. We found that the arrested ternary complex formed by GroEL C138W was a general phenomenon, and similar arrested complexes could be formed with a number of refolding proteins in addition to bovine rhodanese, with molecular masses ranging from 33 to 85 kDa. Furthermore, bothcis-ternary complexes and trans-ternary complexes formed in this manner could be induced to resume folding upon a simple increase in the experimental temperature. Stopped-flow fluorescence analysis of the introduced tryptophan residue showed that a conformational change with an apparent rate constant of 82 s−1 in the presence of 1 mm ATP at 37 °C was strongly affected by this mutation. This conformational change became undetectable when the temperature was decreased from 37 to 25 °C, indicating that the mutation specifically rendered this conformational change temperature-dependent. We confirm in this report a previous assertion that this conformational change governs the release of substrate protein from the GroEL apical domain (13Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and from the nature of the arrested complex, propose a sequence of events which occur at the apical domain of GroEL immediately after ATP binding, that seemingly assures the efficient transfer of bound protein molecules into the GroEL central cavity.DISCUSSIONStudies regarding chaperonin-facilitated protein folding are presently concentrating on linking specific movements of the GroEL subunit, detectable by various spectrophotometric means, to the various steps of the functional cycle revealed in refolding assay studies (3Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M., Xu, Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar,4Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A.

Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A powerful general strategy would be to map various loss-of-function mutations of the GroEL molecule to specific stages in the presently postulated chaperonin molecular mechanism. As part of our efforts to elucidate in detail the molecular mechanism of chaperonin function, we report here our findings regarding GroEL C138W, a mutant chaperonin that displays temperature-dependent chaperonin activities.We first set out to determine if we could detect the complex in other refolding reactions in addition to rhodanese, thereby demonstrating the ubiquity of this intermediate under various in vitroexperimental conditions. The results shown in Fig. 1 and Table Iclearly demonstrate that the arrested complex of GroEL C138W, GroES, and refolding protein may be observed in numerous proteins with molecular masses greater then 30 kDa.Supporting evidence to the notion that this arrested complex is an integral part of the chaperonin-facilitated protein folding reaction, rather than an artifact of it, was obtained by analyzing the specific composition of the arrested complex, and also the fate of this complex after resumption of the refolding reaction upon temperature increase. From the results shown in Fig. 2 and Table II, we have first found that a number of proteins, specifically, proteins with molecular masses between 30 and 54 kDa, form both cis- andtrans-ternary complexes. This limit in size with regard to the ability to form an arrested cis complex is similar in range and agrees well to the values obtained in other studies regarding the maximum size of the proteins that are able to fold inside the GroEL central cavity (20Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 21Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, from the results in Figs. 3 and4, we may conclude that both of these forms are reversibly arrested, that is, both the trans and cis forms of the arrested complex resume folding upon a temperature increase at 37 °C. This result argues rather strongly that GroEL C138W forms an arrested ternary complex at 25 °C which is very close to, if not completely part of, an actual transient intermediate found in the active cycle of the wild-type chaperonin. A unique set of circumstances has served to arrest the chaperonin cycle at a certain stage in this mutant chaperonin.A very important question which must be addressed with regard to the specific characteristics of the arrested ternary complex is the state of the nucleotides which were bound during the initial formation. The state of the nucleotide would be important in determining the relative position of this intermediate in the overall chaperonin mechanism. Our initial assumption regarding this question was that the arrested complex would not undergo additional hydrolysis cycles once formed, in other words, that the arrested complex would be an ATP-GroEL-rhodanese-GroES complex (7Kawata Y. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Miyazaki T. Higurashi T. Mizobata T. Nagai J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15731-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Surprisingly however, the results shown in Fig. 5 suggest strongly an alternate scenario; that once formed, the chaperonin undergoes at least one cycle of heptameric ATP hydrolysis. Although further experimentation is necessary in order to explain this extremely interesting experimental result, the fact that even under these conditions, the arrested complex is capable of resuming its function after temperature increase, compels us to regard this result to be relevant to the overall mechanism. Although it is a highly speculative possibility at this point, it may be that the molecular mechanism which underlies chaperonin function is much more complex than a simple linear and orderly progression of molecular events.The next question in our study would then be to determine the specific conformational change which is responsible for this arrest in the chaperonin cycle. Fortunately, stopped-flow fluorescence studies of the introduced tryptophan provided a very important clue. As shown in Fig. 6, when GroEL C138W was mixed with ATP at 37 °C, two kinetic phases, one with an apparent rate constant of 82.1 s−1 and the other with an apparent rate constant of about 19.5 s−1were observed. Strikingly, the fast phase was undetectable at 25 °C, and the increase in fluorescence intensity was composed from a single kinetic phase with a rate constant of 12.6 s−1. The rate constant of the fast kinetic phase seen at 37 °C has been previously observed in other studies using pyrenyl-labeled GroEL. Jacksonet al. (13Jackson G.S. Staniforth R.A. Halsall D.J. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Burston S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2554-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) determined that upon binding of ATP, pyrenyl GroEL displays an increase in pyrenyl-derived fluorescence whose apparent rate constant is identical to the rate seen in the present study. This kinetic phase displayed a maximum apparent rate constant of about 180 s−1 at saturating ATP concentrations, and represents a form of GroEL that strongly binds ATP with a lower affinity for refolded protein molecules. They postulated that this step would be the key conformational change which is responsible for the release of protein molecules from GroEL, and our results have succeeded in demonstrating this more directly, with regard to both cisand trans ternary species. What is most interesting about this intermediate is, however, that during the formation of the ternary complex the binding of the co-chaperonin GroES proceeded without the release of protein folding intermediates into the bulk solution, and a state arose (in the cis-ternary complex) where GroES and refolding protein were simultaneously bound to the same heptameric ring of GroEL. The fact that this intermediate was formed suggests that the binding of GroES precedes the final release of refolding protein into the GroEL cylinder. The specific process of the binding of GroES to the GroEL apical domain and the subsequent release of refolding protein into the GroEL cylinder is the subject of recent intense experimental efforts (3Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M., Xu, Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 4Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Our present results suggest strongly the following scenario regarding the specific process by which GroES binds and dislodges the refolding protein molecule into the central cavity: upon ATP binding, the apical domain of GroEL shifts to allow the binding of GroES, while still bound to the refolding protein molecule. GroEL then undergoes a large conformational change involving the intermediate domain that lowers the affinity of the GroEL apical domain for protein folding intermediates, and the protein molecule is dropped into the central cavity. In this process, a transient intermediate is formed where the apical domain of GroEL simultaneously binds GroES and the refolding protein molecule (see Fig. 8).Such a sequence of events would be an attractive mechanism, as this would ensure that proteins bound to GroEL and subsequently placed in the cis conformation relative to GroES would be efficiently transferred into the GroEL central cavity. Diffusion of the partially refolded protein into the surrounding medium would be prevented. Also, supportive evidence for the above mechanism may be found in a number of previous studies. Cliff et al. (28Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have used various tryptophan mutants to map the various movements of the GroEL subunit. They have shown that GroEL undergoes a very rapid conformational change in addition to the one documented in this study, with an apparent rate constant greater than 100 s−1 in the presence of 175 μm ATP. We ourselves have documented an extremely rapid movement of the GroEL subunit which occurs immediately after ATP binding using the GroEL T89W mutant (12Mizobata T. Kawagoe M. Hongo K. Nagai J. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25600-25607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and inferred from refolding assays that this conformational change was part of the protein release mechanism of GroEL. It is possible that one of these conformational changes result in a GroES-binding conformation. Also, Farr et al. (29Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R. Kirchhausen T. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 561-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have shown in experiments involving covalent GroEL heptamers that GroEL rings impaired in substrate protein binding activity are nevertheless capable of binding to GroES. This interesting experimental result suggests indirectly the possibility that the refolding protein molecule and GroES may simultaneously bind to the same ring of GroEL in a biologically significant manner. The elucidation of the specific role of this ternary complex will most likely require many more experiments under a variety of conditions.Recent studies have highlighted the differences between protein foldingin vitro and in vivo, placing emphasis on differences such as the concentration of macromolecules, and the extreme heterogeneity of the environment within a typical cell (30Martin J. Hartl F.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,31Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The characteristics of the chaperonin GroEL, which is active under both cellular conditions and also under laboratory conditions, must be relevant to both of these conditions. In order to evaluate roughly the effects of the C138W mutation on the in vivo characteristics of GroEL, we examined if GroEL C138W could substitute for the wild-type chaperonin in vivo. As shown in Fig. 7, GroEL C138W was capable of substituting for the wild-type chaperonin at 37 °C, but was unable to do so at 25 °C. This excellent correlation of in vivo phenotype to in vitro function indicated that first, the behavior of GroEL C138W at 37 °C was sufficiently identical to the wild-type protein to allow substitution in vivo, and second, that the changes which were brought about by the mutation (temperature-dependent restriction of conformational change) are of strong relevance to the in vivo activity of GroEL. We believe, therefore, that the characteristics of GroEL C138W revealed in the present study is very relevant to the actual molecular cycle utilized by the wild-type chaperonin, and provides us with a number of important clues regarding the sequence of events which take place immediately after binding of ATP to the GroEL ring.Fig. 8 summarizes our conclusions in this study. The main assertion which we make based upon our results involves the sequence by which GroES is bound and refolding protein released following ATP binding to the GroEL subunit. We propose that the binding of GroES occurs prior to the final release of refolding protein into the GroEL cylinder. The key conformational change that dictates protein release was found to involve a large movement in the intermediate domain, with an apparent rate constant of 82 s−1 in the presence of 1 mm ATP. This conformational change, documented in other studies previously, is rendered temperature sensitive in GroEL C138W, which allowed a detailed characterization of this intermediate state. In further experiments, a more detailed process by which GroEL manages to enclose refolding protein molecules into the relative safety of its central cavity, with special regard to the hydrolysis of ATP, should become clear. The chaperonin GroEL from Escherichia coli binds numerous proteins in vivo and in vitro and facilitates their folding by providing a space within its unique quaternary structure where protein molecules can safely complete their folding processes (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2765) Google Scholar, 2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Prot. Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The specific steps involved in binding, isolating, and then releasing the refolding protein molecules involve a series of intricately associated conformational changes that are performed by the GroEL protein. The conformational changes that are controlled by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP and the participation of an accessory chaperonin, GroES. The presently accepted cycle of chaperonin-facilitated protein folding (3Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M., Xu, Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L.

Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) consists of an initial binding of the refolding protein to GroEL and subsequent binding of ATP and GroES, which drops the refolding protein molecule into a cylindrical cavity formed by seven subunits of GroEL and seven subunits of GroES. The bound ATP molecules are hydrolyzed slowly by the GroEL subunit, and this has the effect of priming the cage formed by GroEL and GroES for release. Then, an additional seven molecules of ATP are bound to another heptameric ring bound back-to-back to the initial GroEL heptamer (the trans ring), and this binding triggers the release of the refolding protein molecule, ADP, and bound GroES. The numerous conformational changes of GroEL may be localized to three distinct domains found in the GroEL subunit (5Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L.

https://openalex.org/W1991828645,"Liver fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) is able to bind to anionic phospholipid vesicles under conditions of low ionic strength. This binding results in the release of ligand, the fluorescent fatty acid analogue 11-dansylaminoundecanoic acid (DAUDA), with loss of fluorescence intensity (Davies, J. K., Thumser, A. E. A., and Wilton, D. C. (1999)<i>Biochemistry</i> 38, 16932–16940). Using a strategy of charge reversal mutagenesis, the potential role of specific cationic residues in promoting interfacial binding of FABP to anionic phospholipid vesicles has been investigated. Cationic residues chosen included those within the α-helical region (Lys-20, Lys-31, and Lys-33) and those that make a significant contribution to the positive surface potential of the protein (Lys-31, Lys-36, Lys-47, Lys-57, and Arg-126). Only three cationic residues make a significant contribution to interfacial binding, and these residues (Lys-31, Lys-36, and Lys-57) are all located within the ligand portal region, where the protein may be predicted to exhibit maximum disorder. The binding of tryptophan mutants, F3W, F18W, and C69W, to dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol vesicles, containing 5 mol% of the fluorescent phospholipid dansyldihexadecanoylphosphatidylethanolamine, was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). All three mutants showed enhanced dansyl fluorescence due to FRET on addition of phospholipid to protein; however, this fluorescence was considerably greater with the F3W mutant, consistent with the N-terminal region of the protein coming in close proximity to the phospholipid interface. These results were confirmed by succinimide quenching studies. Overall, the results indicate that the portal region of liver FABP and specifically Lys-31, Lys-36, and Lys-57 are involved in the interaction with the interface of anionic vesicles and that the N-terminal region of the protein undergoes a conformational change, resulting in DAUDA release."

The tendency of the two isolated isoforms to interconvert into each other has so far made it difficult to attribute the functional properties of BS-RNase to either isoform. Herein, molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis were used to engineer the refolding pathway of BS-RNase and obtain a stable variant of its non-swapping isoform. The protein was engineered with two extra disulfide bridges linking the N-terminal helix of each subunit to the main body of the same subunit. Purified as an active enzyme, the BS-RNase variant was found to be very resistant to thermal denaturation. Its functional characterization revealed that the lack of swapping has a negative effect on the cytotoxic activity of BS-RNase.

Structurally, BS-RNase is a homodimeric enzyme with a subunit amino acid sequence 83% identical to that of bovine pancreatic RNase A, the most studied member of the superfamily of pancreatic-type RNases (3Beintema J.J. Breukelman H.J. Carsana A. Furia A. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 245-269Google Scholar). However, RNase A and all other members of the superfamily are monomeric enzymes, whereas BS-RNase is a covalent dimer with the two subunits linked by two disulfides between Cys-31 and Cys-32 of one subunit and Cys-32′ and Cys-31′, respectively, of the partner subunit. Another singular feature of BS-RNase is that the protein has two quaternary structures. In one of them (termed MXM), determined by x-ray crystallography (4Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; D49: 389-402Google Scholar), the two subunits exchange or swap their N-terminal α-helices (Fig. 1). Each of them folds onto the adjacent protomer, generating composite active sites,i.e. each contributed by both subunit chains. In the second structure (termed M=M), identified through biochemical studies (5Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Google Scholar) and analyzed by x-ray crystallography, 2L. Mazzarella, F. Sica, A. Di Fiore, R. Berisio, and R. Piccoli, manuscript in preparation. there is no interchange between subunits (Fig. 1). It has been found that when the two quaternary forms of BS-RNase are isolated, they convert slowly into each other under pseudo-physiological conditions until the equilibrium ratio of 2:1 is reached between the MXM and the M=M forms. Thus, BS-RNase may be described as an equilibrium mixture of MXM and M=M isoforms. BS-RNase also possesses a strong antitumor action, characterized extensively on both cultured malignant cells and solid tumors induced in mice (reviewed in Ref. 6Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Function. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 491-514Google Scholar). This activity consists in a selective cytotoxic action toward cancer cells (7Vescia S. Tramontano D. Augusti Tocco G. D'Alessio G. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 3740-3744Google Scholar, 8Matousek J. Experientia (Basel). 1973; 29: 858-859Google Scholar, 9Laccetti P. Portella G. Mastronicola M.R. Russo A. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Vecchio G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4582-4586Google Scholar, 10Laccetti P. Spalletti Cernia D. Portella G. De Corato P. D'Alessio G. Vecchio G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4253-4256Google Scholar) and is exerted by the enzyme in the cell cytosol, where it degrades rRNA, thus leading the cell to death (11Mastronicola M.R. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 242-249Google Scholar). None of the other mammalian RNases is provided with antitumor activity. This has been attributed (12Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 10407-10412Google Scholar, 13Murthy B.S. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3880-3885Google Scholar) to their monomeric structure, which makes them susceptible to inhibition by the cytosolic RNase inhibitor (CRI). CRI is a 50-kDa protein (14Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Google Scholar, 15Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Progr. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-30Google Scholar) that binds tightly to monomeric mammalian RNases (16Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1028-1043Google Scholar, 17Acharya K.R. Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Google Scholar) and inhibits competitively their ribonucleolytic activity with Ki values in the fm range. Dimeric BS-RNase cannot bind to CRI (13Murthy B.S. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3880-3885Google Scholar, 18Murthy B.S. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 343-348Google Scholar), hence it preserves its ribonucleolytic activity inside the cytosol. Recently, it has been shown that monomeric BS-RNase becomes cytotoxic when it is engineered into a variant resistant to CRI (19Antignani A. Naddeo M. Cubellis M.V. Russo A. D'Alessio G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3492-3496Google Scholar). The two isolated isoforms of BS-RNase, M=M and MXM, are both endowed with cytotoxic activity toward malignant cells but differ in their potency, with M=M less active than MXM. Given the intrinsic instability of M=M and the relatively long time required for the cytotoxicity tests (at least 48 h), it cannot be excluded that the cytotoxic activity of M=M is because of its transformation into the MXM isoform. In the present study, molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis have been used to alter the refolding pathway leading to dimeric BS-RNase, with the aim to obtain a stable variant of the M=M isoform of BS-RNase, called 24C-BS-RNase, containing an extra disulfide bridge in each subunit, linking the N-terminal arm to the subunit body. The functional characterization of 24C-BS-RNase, with no exchange of N-terminal helices between subunits, has been used to probe the role of the swapping in the unusual functional properties of BS-RNase. Purification of BS-RNase from bull seminal vesicles and isolation of its M=M and MXM isoforms were performed as described (20D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Piccoli R. Russo A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 248-263Google Scholar). Protein sequence analyses were performed by automated Edman degradation of the polypeptide chain with an Applied Biosystems sequencer (model 473A), equipped with a high performance liquid chromatography apparatus for identification of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass measurements were performed at the Center for Mass Spectrometry (Naples, Italy). The analysis of the quaternary structure of BS-RNase and 24C-BS-RNase by selective reduction of the intersubunit disulfides followed by gel filtration was performed as described (5Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Google Scholar). For the reaction with divinyl sulfone the procedure proposed in Ref. 21Ciglic M.I. Jackson P.J. Raillard S.A. Haugg M. Jermann T.M. Opitz J.G. Trabesinger-Ruf N. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4008-4022Google Scholarwas followed with modifications (22Russo N. Antignani A. D'Alessio G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3585-3591Google Scholar). The mutated DNA coding for 24C-BS-RNase was obtained by PCR. The template for PCR was the expression plasmid pET-BS, which contains a semi-synthetic cDNA coding for BS-RNase, placed under the transcriptional control of T7 phage promoter (20D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Piccoli R. Russo A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 248-263Google Scholar). The segment amplified corresponds to the entire cDNA and contains unique NdeI and HindIII restriction sites at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The 5′ amplification primer (5′-GAGATATACATATGAAAGAAAGCTGTGCTGCTAAA-3′) introduced the Ala-4 → Cys mutation, whereas the 3′ primer (5′-CTAAAGCTTCTACACTGAAGCATCGAAGTGGCATGGCACGGAC-3′) introduced the Val-118 → Cys mutation. The PCR product was purified, digested withNdeI and HindIII, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET-BS (20D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Piccoli R. Russo A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 248-263Google Scholar). The identity of the resulting expression plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence. The main steps in the preparation of 24C-BS-RNase were as follows: 1) expression inEscherichia coli of the mutated cDNA coding for 24C-BS-RNase, 2) isolation of bacterial inclusion bodies containing the recombinant protein, 3) its refolding to a monomeric species in a glutathione buffer, 4) purification of the monomer by gel filtration, 5) its dimerization by intersubunit disulfide bridging, and 6) purification by gel filtration of the final dimeric species. These steps were performed as described (20D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Piccoli R. Russo A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 248-263Google Scholar) except for the following. 1) The renaturation step in the glutathione buffer lasted 48 h. 2) Residue Met-(-1) of the recombinant polypeptide chain was removed by treatment with Aeromonas proteolytica aminopeptidase (23Prescott J.M. Wilkes S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 530-543Google Scholar), performed on the purified monomeric species. In particular, the monomer-containing fractions eluted from the gel filtration were pooled and supplemented directly with 10 μm ZnSO4and 10 nm aminopeptidase. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of Na2EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. The processed monomeric protein was then treated with DTT as the first step of the dimerization procedure. 3) The dimeric species, isolated by gel filtration, were concentrated by ultrafiltration and loaded on a high performance liquid chromatography apparatus equipped with a C4 column. Elution was performed with a 60-min linear gradient from 10 to 45% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The main peak of absorbance at 280 nm was collected, lyophilized, and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm NaCl. The purified protein was then incubated at 37 °C for 96 h. The latter treatment is used routinely to equilibrate the two quaternary isoforms of BS-RNase (20D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. Piccoli R. Russo A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 248-263Google Scholar). The protein sample was quantitated by spectrophotometry using a value of E1% at 280 nm of 4.65, equivalent to that of wild-type BS-RNase, and was stored at −20 °C. Yields of 24C-BS-RNase typically ranged between 1 and 2 mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture. CD measurements were performed on a JASCO 715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a PTC-348 thermostat and quartz cells of 0.1-cm optical path length. All protein samples were dissolved at 0.3 mg/ml concentration in 10 mmTris acetate buffer, pH 8.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl. Far-UV spectra (200–250 nm) were recorded at 20 °C with a response of 16 s, a 2.0-nm band window, and a scan rate of 5 nm/min. Thermal unfolding curves were recorded at 220 nm, in a temperature range from 20 to 90 °C, with a scan rate of 1.0 K/min. Molar ellipticities per mean residue, [ϑ], were calculated from the equation [ϑ] = [ϑ]obs mrm/10 l c, where mrm is the mean residue molecular mass (117 Da for BS-RNase),l is the cell path length, and c is the protein concentration. The instrument was calibrated with an aqueous solution of d-10-(+) camphorsulfonic acid at 290 nm (24Yang J.T. Wu C.S.C. Martinez N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Google Scholar). Units of ribonucleolytic activity toward yeast RNA were measured according to Kunitz (25Kunitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 563-568Google Scholar), except that reactions were performed in 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mg/ml RNA. Hydrolytic activity toward cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate was measured at 25 °C by a spectrophotometric method (26Piccoli R. Di Donato A. D'Alessio G. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 329-336Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were made of 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, containing 0.1m NaCl, 0.2–0.6 μm enzyme, and 4 mm substrate. One enzyme unit was defined as the amount of enzyme hydrolyzing 1 micromole of substrate per min. Staining for RNase activity of samples run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was performed according to Ref. 27Blank A. Sugiyama R.H. Dekker C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 267-275Google Scholar. Cytotoxicity assays toward cultured SVT2 fibroblasts were performed as described (28Bracale A. Spalletti-Cernia D. Mastronicola M. Castaldi F. Mannucci R. Nitsch L. D'Alessio G. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 553-560Google Scholar). Reported values of enzyme-specific activity and of IC50 values for cytotoxic activity are the mean ± S.E. of three to four determinations. The isolated M=M isoform of native BS-RNase is unstable. It spontaneously evolves into the MXM isoform until an equilibrium is reached, with the swapping isoform accounting for about two-thirds of the molecules in solution. This transition from a quaternary structure to another also occurs during the refolding pathway of BS-RNase (Fig. 2A). The unfolded polypeptide chain, containing 10 cysteines, first refolds into the monomeric species characterized by four disulfide bridges (29Parente A. D'Alessio G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 381-387Google Scholar); then monomers associate into non-swapping dimers (M=M isoform) through the formation of two intersubunit disulfides involving the remaining two cysteines. Finally two-thirds of the subunits swap their N-terminal helices to generate the MXM isoform (5Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Google Scholar). With the purpose of obtaining a stable variant of the M=M isoform of BS-RNase, we designed the introduction of a trap in the refolding pathway of the protein that would prevent the transformation of M=M into MXM. The strategy consisted in grafting on each subunit of the protein a new disulfide bridge to connect the N-terminal helix of each subunit to the main subunit body. Such a bridge would form during the first refolding step of the protein, in which the unfolded polypeptide chain folds into a monomer (Fig. 2B). In the subsequent refolding step, monomers would associate into non-swapping dimers, but they would not be able to evolve into the MXM isoform because of the trap produced by the extra disulfide bridges (Fig. 2B). Previous biochemical investigations (30Piccoli R. De Lorenzo C. Dal Piaz F. Pucci P. D'Alessio G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8000-8006Google Scholar) and simulation studies (31Cubellis M.V. D'Alessio G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 775-782Google Scholar) have shown that the first step in the M=M ⇄ MXM interconversion is the unfolding and displacement of the N-terminal arm from each BS-RNase subunit. Thus, the block imposed by the disulfides on the displacement of the N-terminal arm would block the conversion of M=M into MXM completely. A variant of monomeric RNase A with an extra disulfide bridge connecting the N-terminal helix and the main protein body has been obtained already by introducing cysteine residues in positions 4 and 118 of the polypeptide chain (32Klink T.A. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17463-17467Google Scholar). The inspection of the three-dimensional structure of BS-RNase, both as MXM dimer with swap (4Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; D49: 389-402Google Scholar) and as M=M dimer with no swap,2 revealed that Ala-4 and Val-118 are in close proximity with each other also in BS-RNase (Fig. 3A). Mutation of these residues to cysteine was then simulated with the aid of the computer program PDB Viewer (33Guex N. Experientia. 1996; 52: A26Google Scholar), and the resulting model was subjected to energy minimization with SWISS-MODEL (34Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). In the final model, the side chains of the newly introduced cysteines were found to be positioned as required for the formation of a canonical disulfide bridge (Fig. 3B). The disulfide would be located outside the active site area and would link the N-terminal helix and one edge of a large β-sheet belonging to the main subunit body. A closer examination of the new disulfide bridges within the two subunits of the model showed that they have virtually identical structures, whose stereochemistry is characterized by the following: 1) CA-CA′, CB-CB′, and SG-SG′ distances of 5.3, 4.2, and 2.0 Å, respectively, 2) CB-SG-SG′ and CB′-SG′-SG angles both of 109°, and 3) a right-handed chirality with a chi3 angle of +98°. These values are within the ranges defined by the geometries of disulfide bridges in the crystallographic structures of proteins (35Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Google Scholar, 36Sowdhamini R. Srinivasan N. Shoichet B. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 3: 95-103Google Scholar, 37Burton R.E. Hunt J.A. Fierke C.A. Oas T.G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 776-785Google Scholar). In conclusion, the modeling session described above suggested that mutation of Ala-4 and Val-118 to cysteines should yield a refolded dimer of BS-RNase endowed with two extra disulfide bridges that link each N-terminal helix to the main body of the same subunit. The protein should be enzymatically active and locked into the non-swapping, M=M conformation. The preparation of this variant of BS-RNase, containing 24 Cys residues per dimer, hence termed 24C-BS-RNase, was subsequently undertaken. The cDNA coding for wild-type BS-RNase was mutagenized by PCR to introduce codons for Cys-4 and Val-118. The mutated cDNA was then sequenced and expressed in E. coliunder the transcriptional control of the T7 phage promoter. The recombinant protein was then recovered from the inclusion bodies and refolded in the presence of a mixture of glutathione and oxidized glutathione. The resulting monomeric species was then purified by gel filtration and treated with A. proteolytica aminopeptidase to remove the N-terminal Met-(-1) residue that characterizes most of the heterologous proteins expressed in E. coli. The processed monomer was then dimerized by favoring the intersubunit disulfide bridging and finally purified by gel-filtration followed by reverse phase chromatography. The purified 24C-BS-RNase variant was then subjected to structural characterization. First, the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4, the protein migrates as a single band with an apparent molecular size lower than that of wild-type BS-RNase. A similar result was obtained when the gel was stained for ribonucleolytic activity (see Fig. 4). These results showed that the purified protein is homogeneous and active enzymatically but raised doubts about the structural integrity of the polypeptide chain, as its unusual electrophoretic mobility could be attributed to unexpected proteolytic cleavages of the polypeptide chain by E. coli proteases or to an incorrect processing by theAeromonas aminopeptidase. This possible damage was investigated by N-terminal protein sequencing and molecular mass determination. The former analysis revealed an N-terminal Lys-Glu-Ser sequence, as expected for a correctly processed protein. The molecular mass, determined by mass spectrometry, resulted to be 27,274.6 Da, a value that is not significantly different from the expected value (27,283.6 Da), calculated for a variant of BS-RNase with the Ala-4 → Cys and Val-118 → Cys mutations and two extra disulfide bridges. The unusual migration on SDS-PAGE of 24C-BS-RNase was thus taken as an indication that the newly introduced cysteines had indeed formed the expected extra disulfide bridges, thus providing the protein with a more compact structure. The newly introduced disulfide bridges of 24C-BS-RNase were next analyzed by amino acid sequence determinations performed on the isolated protein variant and after full reduction of its disulfides with DTT followed by modification of the exposed cysteines with 4-vinylpyridine. Before reduction, no amino acid was found by sequence determination at position 4. Given the chemistry of the Edman reaction, this indicated that Cys-4 was not free but linked to another Cys residue in a disulfide bridge. When the protein disulfides were reduced, and the resulting cysteine residues were modified with 4-vinylpyridine, the sequence determinations revealed the expected modified cysteine in position 4 of the polypeptide chain. In conclusion, the results indicate that 24C-BS-RNase is an enzymatically active dimeric protein differing from wild-type BS-RNase by the presence of extra disulfide bridges linking Cys-4 and Cys-118 in each subunit. The quaternary structure of 24C-BS-RNase was investigated by two different methods. In the first method (5Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Google Scholar), the two intersubunit disulfide bridges are reduced selectively by limited amounts of DTT, and the reaction products are analyzed by gel filtration. If the protein is entirely in the M=M form,i.e. its quaternary structure is stabilized only by the two intersubunit disulfides, the procedure yields monomers. If the protein is in the MXM form, reduction of the intersubunit disulfides yields non-covalent dimers, whose quaternary structure is stabilized by the swap of the N-terminal helices. When a sample of native BS-RNase (naturally occurring as a mixture of about 30% M=M and 70% MXM) is subjected to selective reduction of its intersubunit disulfides and analyzed by gel filtration, two products are observed (Fig. 5): a monomeric species deriving from M=M and a dimeric species deriving from MXM. It is noteworthy that the areas of the two peaks reflect the relative amounts of M=M and MXM present originally in the protein sample. When 24C-BS-RNase was reduced selectively and analyzed, the gel filtration revealed only one peak, with the molecular size of a monomer. This result indicates that 24C-BS-RNase behaves as the M=M form of BS-RNase,i.e. it consists entirely of a non-swapping dimer. The second method employed to investigate the quaternary structure of 24C-BS-RNase is based on the use of a bifunctional reagent, divinyl sulfone, which reacts simultaneously with the enzyme catalytic residues His-12 and His-119 (21Ciglic M.I. Jackson P.J. Raillard S.A. Haugg M. Jermann T.M. Opitz J.G. Trabesinger-Ruf N. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4008-4022Google Scholar). When the active site of a dimer is composite (as in the case of MXM), with His-12 from one polypeptide chain and His-119 from the other, the cross-link joins the two chains, yielding a cross-linked dimer. If the active site of a dimer is not composite (the M=M case), divinyl sulfone acts as it does in a monomeric RNase, linking two histidines from the same polypeptide chain. 24C-BS-RNase and two controls, BS-RNase and RNase A, were treated with divinyl sulfone, and the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions to distinguish cross-linked from disulfide-linked dimers (Fig. 6). As expected, RNase A migrated as a monomer, whereas BS-RNase showed two bands arising from the MXM and M=M isoforms. The only detectable product of reacted 24C-BS-RNase was a monomer, thus providing an additional indication that the engineered protein is provided with the non-swapping conformation only. The thermal stability of the 24C-BS-RNase variant was investigated by circular dichroism. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C for BS-RNase, its MXM and M=M isoforms, and for 24C-BS-RNase (Fig. 7). As described previously (38Giancola C. Del Vecchio P. De Lorenzo C. Barone R. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Barone G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7964-7972Google Scholar), the BS-RNase spectrum has an intermediate intensity between those of MXM and M=M, with M=M being the isoform showing a lower content of secondary structure. Furthermore, the spectra of the isolated isoforms are distinguished readily from that of native BS-RNase, the mixture of the two isoforms, by the lack of distinct minima and shoulders. The spectrum of 24C-BS-RNase was found to be very similar to that of M=M (see Fig. 7), with a minimum at about 212 nm and a shoulder at about 216 nm. This similarity provided further evidence that the 24C-BS-RNase variant is an M=M-like non-swapping dimer. A melting curve for the temperature-induced denaturation of 24C-BS-RNase was obtained, in parallel with the curve for isolated M=M, by raising the temperature from 20 to 90 °C gradually and recording the molar ellipticity at 220 nm. The results, illustrated in Fig. 8, show that for both proteins the molar ellipticity at high temperature is lower than zero: [ϑ]220 = −4500 and −4600 deg dmol−1cm2 for M=M and 24C-BS-RNase, respectively. This indicates that at high temperatures the two proteins contain residual secondary structure even though most parts of the polypeptide chain are unordered. The denaturation temperature of the M=M isoform of BS-RNase was confirmed to be 63 °C (38Giancola C. Del Vecchio P. De Lorenzo C. Barone R. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Barone G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7964-7972Google Scholar); that of 24C-BS-RNase was instead much higher, at 72 °C (see Fig. 8). The data of a higher stability of the 24C-BS-RNase variant, as indicated by the CD analyses, are in line with, and shed light on, the results of the SDS-PAGE runs described above (see Fig. 4), in which the protein showed a higher electrophoretic mobility. It can be inferred that the higher mobility of 24C-BS-RNase can be attributed confidently to the much more compact structure of the variant, compared with the native protein. Similar and contrasting results have been obtained when extra disulfide bridges were introduced into proteins by site-directed mutagenesis (39Wetzel R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 478-482Google Scholar,40Betz S.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1551-1558Google Scholar). In some cases the protein structure was stabilized; in others the mutant proteins were found to be less stable (41Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Google Scholar, 42Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Levitt M. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6562-6566Google Scholar, 43Matsumura M. Signor G. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1989; 342: 291-293Google Scholar). A proposal originated from these studies (42Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Levitt M. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6562-6566Google Scholar) was that an increase of protein stability is obtained when the novel disulfide is introduced in a flexible region of the protein. The 4–118 disulfide grafted into BS-RNase is not located in a flexible region of the protein. It links the N-terminal α-helix with the 116–124 strand of a large β-sheet (see Fig. 3A). However, this α-helix is connected to the main body of the subunit through a linker peptide spanning residues 16–22. By x-ray crystallography, it has been found that this peptide linker is certainly flexible, as it assumes two distinct conformations in the MXM isoform of BS-RNase (4Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; D49: 389-402Google Scholar), and is totally disordered in the M=M isoform and in a monomeric derivative of the protein. 3L. Mazzarella, F. Sica, A. Di Fiore, and A. Zagari, manuscript in preparation. It is tempting to surmise that the newly inserted 4–118 disulfide can stabilize the linker peptide, thus conferring stability to a large region of the protein. Pancreatic-type RNases digest RNA by a two-step transphosphorolytic-hydrolytic reaction. In the first step, the RNA is depolymerized to nucleoside or oligonucleotide 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates. This step is quite fast and follows standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In the second step, the products of the previous reaction are hydrolyzed to nucleoside- or oligonucleotide-3′-phosphates. The enzymatic activity of 24C-BS-RNase was tested in a spectrophotometric assay toward yeast RNA, a conventional RNase substrate, to monitor the first step of the reaction. The engineered enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 84 ± 5 units/mg, a value that is about one-half of the activity of the wild-type protein (192 ± 6 units/mg). A similar decrease in catalytic activity, with respect to that of the native enzyme, was found when 24C-BS-RNase was tested with cytidine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (C>p), a substrate for the second, hydrolytic reaction step. At 4 mmC>p concentration, the enzyme was found to have a specific activity of 17 ± 4 units/mg, i.e. about one-half that of the native enzyme (36 ± 6 units/mg) assayed under identical conditions. The reduced catalytic activity of the 24C-BS-RNase variant may not be surprising, for several reasons. It has been mentioned above that the insertion in the molecule of the extra disulfides has a dramatic effect on its stability, with an obvious increase in structural rigidity of the whole molecule. Then, in particular, we should consider the domain motions that BS-RNase (44Vitagliano L. Adinolfi S. Riccio A. Sica F. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1691-1699Google Scholar), as RNase A (45Vitagliano L. Merlino A. Zagari A. Mazzarella L. Proteins. 2002; 46: 97-104Google Scholar), undergoes upon ligand binding. The new links imposed between Cys-4 in the N-terminal helix and Cys-118 in the nearest β-sheet from the main subunit body may well have a detrimental effect on these dynamics primed by quasi-substrate binding. Furthermore, although the new disulfide is located outside the subunit active site as defined by the catalytic triad (His-12, His-119, Lys-41), it is immediately adjacent with its Cys-118 to one member of the triad. It is known that in RNase A (46Gilliland G.L. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 306-341Google Scholar), but also in BS-RNase (4Mazzarella L. Capasso S. Demasi D. Di Lorenzo G. Mattia C.A. Zagari A. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; D49: 389-402Google Scholar), the side chain of His-119 may assume two alternative conformations, a clear indication of local flexibility in that region of the active site. In fact, the active site of these RNases comprises a rigid and a flexible region, the former made up of His-12, Asn-44, and Thr-45, and the latter made up of His-119, Asp-83, and Asp-121. Clearly, the presence of the novel disulfide within 3 Å from the position of His-19 can affect the flexibility of the latter region dramatically, thus hindering the dynamics primed by substrate binding in the enzyme molecule. It may be mentioned that Matsumura and Matthews (47Matsumura M. Matthews B.W. Science. 1989; 243: 792-794Google Scholar) succeeded in switching off the activity of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme by engineering a disulfide in the active site of the enzyme. Recently, Park and Raines (48Park C. Raines R.T. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 939-942Google Scholar) inserted a redox switch in RNase A by introducing a new disulfide bond in the N-terminal helix of the protein, not far from the active site. When the disulfide was in the oxidized state, catalytic activity was reduced by 70%. When 24C-BS-RNase was tested for cytotoxic activity on tumor cells, the engineered protein was found to be able to inhibit the proliferation of malignant SVT2 fibroblasts. The inhibition was dose-dependent with an IC50 value of 61 ± 9 μg/ml, a value about 3-fold higher than that of native BS-RNase (20 ± 5 μg/ml) assayed in parallel experiments. These results indicate that the swapping of the N-terminal helices between subunits is not essential for the antitumor activity of BS-RNase; however, they also indicate that the absence of swapping decreases the cytotoxic activity of the protein. These data are in agreement with previous results suggesting that the isolated M=M isoform of BS-RNase was less active than the MXM form on malignant cells (49Cafaro V. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. Bracale A. Mastronicola R. Di Donato A. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 31-34Google Scholar). We can now conclude that M=M is endowed with an intrinsic cytotoxic activity, which may not be ascribed to its partial conversion to the MXM isoform under the conditions of the assay (48 h in culture medium at 37 °C). The possibility that the lower cytotoxic activity of 24C-BS-RNase is because of its lower catalytic activity is very unlikely. When 24C-BS-RNase reaches the cytosol, its RNase activity, 102- to 104-fold higher than that of onconase, another effective antitumor RNase (6Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Function. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 491-514Google Scholar), is certainly adequate to initiate degradation of rRNA, hence to block protein synthesis and kill the cell. On the other hand, the finding of cytotoxic activity in 24C-BS-RNase, as in M=M, would not be in line with current data and hypotheses (12Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 10407-10412Google Scholar,13Murthy B.S. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3880-3885Google Scholar, 19Antignani A. Naddeo M. Cubellis M.V. Russo A. D'Alessio G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3492-3496Google Scholar), which assign a key role of control against exogenous RNases to CRI. According to this model, monomeric RNases cannot be active as cytotoxic agents, as in the cytosol they are neutralized by CRI. In fact, when monomeric RNases are rendered resistant to CRI, they acquire cytotoxic activity (12Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 10407-10412Google Scholar, 19Antignani A. Naddeo M. Cubellis M.V. Russo A. D'Alessio G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3492-3496Google Scholar). Thus, 24C-BS-RNase and M=M would be expected to be devoid of cytotoxic activity, given that the intersubunit disulfides should be cleaved in the reducing environment of the cytosol, and the dimers should dissociate into monomers. It has been shown (50Kim J.S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10525-10530Google Scholar, 51Kim J.S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31097-31102Google Scholar) that the intersubunit disulfides of BS-RNase are cleaved readily when incubated in a mixture of glutathione and oxidized glutathione, which closely mimics the reducing environment of cytosol. However, it should be considered that disulfide cleavage in the cytosol may not affect the entirety of the RNase molecules entering the cytosol instantaneously. The small fraction of 24C-BS-RNase that remains dimeric soon after the protein enters the cytosol can escape CRI and damage rRNA, hence the protein synthesis machinery. The transient survival of a dimeric fraction of the RNase molecules that reach the cytosol explains the resistance to CRI of 24C-BS-RNase and M=M and their cytotoxicity. These considerations also explain why 24C-BS-RNase, and M=M, are much less cytotoxic when compared with the MXM isoform, which maintains its dimeric, albeit non-covalent, structure fully, and hence is fully resistant to CRI. BS-RNase has a very complex folding pathway comprising the oxidation of 20 cysteines (8% of the total number of residues). 16 of them form eight intra-subunit disulfide bridges, whereas the remaining four cysteines are responsible of the formation of two intersubunit disulfides. Despite this complexity, the present study has shown that four other cysteines can be introduced in BS-RNase dimers. The engineered variant 24C-BS-RNase was obtained as an active enzyme with each N-terminal helix linked covalently to the main protein body of the same subunit. The covalent link blocks the displacement of the N-terminal arm from the subunit body, a necessary step in the refolding pathway that leads to a partial conversion of the first folded quaternary conformation, with no swap (M=M), into the conformation with swap (MXM). The protein was found to be very stable and represented a valuable tool for probing the role of the swapping in the enzymatic and antitumor activities of BS-RNase."
