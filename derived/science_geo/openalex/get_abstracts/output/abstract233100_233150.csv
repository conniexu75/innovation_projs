https://openalex.org/W2151011478,"In adult skin, each hair follicle contains a reservoir of stem cells (the bulge), which can be mobilized to regenerate the new follicle with each hair cycle and to reepithelialize epidermis during wound repair. Here we report new methods that permit their clonal analyses and engraftment and demonstrate the two defining features of stem cells, namely self-renewal and multipotency. We also show that, within the bulge, there are two distinct populations, one of which maintains basal lamina contact and temporally precedes the other, which is suprabasal and arises only after the start of the first postnatal hair cycle. This spatial distinction endows them with discrete transcriptional programs, but surprisingly, both populations are growth inhibited in the niche but can self-renew in vitro and make epidermis and hair when grafted. These findings suggest that the niche microenvironment imposes intrinsic ""stemness"" features without restricting the establishment of epithelial polarity and changes in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2104417933,"Fast excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by activation of synaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors. In hippocampal slices, we report that stimulation of Schaffer collaterals evokes in CA1 neurons delayed inward currents with slow kinetics, in addition to fast excitatory postsynaptic currents. Similar slow events also occur spontaneously, can still be observed when neuronal activity and synaptic glutamate release are blocked, and are found to be mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes acting preferentially on extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. The slow currents can be triggered by stimuli that evoke Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes, including photolysis of caged Ca2+ in single astrocytes. As revealed by paired recording and Ca2+ imaging, a striking feature of this NMDA receptor response is that it occurs synchronously in multiple CA1 neurons. Our results reveal a distinct mechanism for neuronal excitation and synchrony and highlight a functional link between astrocytic glutamate and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors."

We report here the real-time visualization of cargo sorting and endocytosis by clathrin-coated pits in living cells. We have detected the formation of coats by monitoring incorporation of fluorescently tagged clathrin or its adaptor AP-2; we have also followed clathrin-mediated uptake of transferrin and of single LDL or reovirus particles. The intensity of a cargo-loaded clathrin cluster grows steadily during its lifetime, and the time required to complete assembly is proportional to the size of the cargo particle. These results are consistent with a nucleation-growth mechanism and an approximately constant growth rate. There are no strongly preferred nucleation sites. A proportion of the nucleation events are weak and short lived. Cargo incorporation occurs primarily or exclusively in a newly formed coated pit. Our data lead to a model in which coated pits initiate randomly but collapse unless stabilized, perhaps by cargo capture."
https://openalex.org/W2099067892,"Methylation of arginine residues within histone H3 has been linked to active transcription. This modification appears on the estrogen-regulated pS2 promoter when the CARM1 methyltransferase is recruited during transcriptional activation. Here we describe a process, deimination, that converts histone arginine to citrulline and antagonizes arginine methylation. We show that peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) specifically deiminates, arginine residues R2, R8, R17, and R26 in the H3 tail. Deimination by PADI4 prevents arginine methylation by CARM1. Dimethylation of arginines prevents deimination by PADI4 although monomethylation still allows deimination to take place. In vivo targeting experiments on an endogenous promoter demonstrate that PADI4 can repress hormone receptor-mediated gene induction. Consistent with a repressive role for PADI4, this enzyme is recruited to the pS2 promoter following hormone induction when the gene is transcriptionally downregulated. The recruitment of PADI4 coincides with deimination of the histone H3 N-terminal tail. These results define deimination as a novel mechanism for antagonizing the transcriptional induction mediated by arginine methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2023630351,"Mouse knockout technology provides a powerful means of elucidating gene function in vivo, and a publicly available genome-wide collection of mouse knockouts would be significantly enabling for biomedical discovery. To date, published knockouts exist for only about 10% of mouse genes. Furthermore, many of these are limited in utility because they have not been made or phenotyped in standardized ways, and many are not freely available to researchers. It is time to harness new technologies and efficiencies of production to mount a high-throughput international effort to produce and phenotype knockouts for all mouse genes, and place these resources into the public domain."
https://openalex.org/W2008563981,"In the cell, Dnmt1 is the major enzyme in maintenance of the pattern of DNA methylation after DNA replication. Evidence suggests that the protein is located at the replication fork, where it could directly modify nascent DNA immediately after replication. To elucidate the potential mechanism of this process, we investigate the processivity of DNA methylation and accuracy of copying an existing pattern of methylation in this study using purified Dnmt1 and hemimethylated substrate DNA. We demonstrate that Dnmt1 methylates a hemimethylated 958-mer substrate in a highly processive reaction. Fully methylated and unmethylated CG sites do not inhibit processive methylation of the DNA. Extending previous work, we show that unmethylated sites embedded in a hemimethylated context are modified at an approximately 24-fold reduced rate, which demonstrates that the enzyme accurately copies existing patterns of methylation. Completely unmodified DNA is methylated even more slowly due to an allosteric activation of Dnmt1 by methylcytosine-containing DNA. Interestingly, Dnmt1 is not able to methylate hemimethylated CG sites on different strands of the DNA in a processive manner, indicating that Dnmt1 keeps its orientation with respect to the DNA while methylating the CG sites on one strand of the DNA.

In vertebrates, DNA is modified at cytosine residues to form 5-methylcytosines. DNA methylation occurs predominantly in the context of CG dinucleotides, which are methylated to 60-80%. The modified CGs are not randomly distributed but form a tissue- and cell-specific pattern (1Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5486) Google Scholar, 2Jones P.A. Takai D. Science. 2001; 293: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Methylation is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, in the context of X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and development (3Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). On the other hand, methylcytosine is a hot spot of mutation, and aberrant methylation is involved in aging and cancer (4Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). 5-Methylcytosine is introduced into the DNA after replication by DNA methyltransferases. Until now, three families of DNA methyltransferases have been identified in mammals: Dnmt1, Dnmt2, and Dnmt3 (5Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). All cytosine-C5-methyltransferases contain a domain of ∼500 amino acid residues, which is characterized by the presence of 10 conserved amino acid motifs, shared between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytosine-C5-methyltransferases (6Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 7Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic part, the Dnmt1 and the Dnmt3 enzymes contain large N-terminal regulatory parts (5Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 7Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dnmt2 is the smallest enzyme among the eukaryotic methyltransferases. It consists only of the catalytic part, which is similar to prokaryotic cytosine-C5-methyltransferases. It was shown only recently to be an active methyltransferase (8Hermann A. Schmitt S. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31717-31721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Dnmt3 family comprises three different proteins, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b have a regulatory N-terminal domain, which is not essential for catalysis (9Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20409-20414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Reither S. Li F. Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both enzymes do not distinguish between unmethylated and hemimethylated substrates and are supposed to mediate de novo methylation together with Dnmt1 (11Fatemi M. Hermann A. Gowher H. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4981-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Kim G.D. Ni J. Kelesoglu N. Roberts R.J. Pradhan S.

Vogelstein B. Nature. 2002; 416: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a is distributive on unmethylated substrates, whereas Dnmt3b is a processive enzyme (9Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20409-20414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The third member of the Dnmt3 family, Dnmt3L, does not have a functional catalytic domain and is catalytically inactive (14Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Dnmt1 prefers hemimethylated DNA over unmethylated DNA up to 40-fold in vitro (15Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In vivo, it is supposed to be responsible for copying the existing methylation pattern of the DNA and is therefore called maintenance methyltransferase (5Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Dnmt1 is a very large protein of 184 kDa. It has an extended N-terminal regulatory domain that contains a nuclear localization sequence (16Bestor T.H. Verdine G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), a replication foci targeting domain (17Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), and a cysteine-rich Zn2+ binding domain (18Bestor T.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 19Chuang L.S. Ng H.H. Chia J.N. Li B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Another domain shows homology with Polybromo-1 protein from chicken (16Bestor T.H. Verdine G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which plays a role in the transport of Dnmt1 to the replication foci as well (20Liu Y. Oakeley E.J. Sun L. Jost J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Many proteins have been reported to interact with the N-terminal part of Dnmt1 by yeast two-hybrid and/or interaction assays (21Liu Z. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar, 22Margot J.B.

It seems that the N terminus forms a platform for the binding of proteins involved in chromatin condensation and gene regulation. One example is the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a protein also known as a processivity factor for the DNA polymerases ϵ/δ (27Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 28Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Previous evidence for a processive methylation of DNA by Dnmt1 dates back more than 20 years, when Bestor and Ingram (29Bestor T.H. Ingram V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5559-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) investigated the mechanism of a new DNA methyltransferase activity, later identified to be Dnmt1. In their experiments, they showed a higher methylation rate of Dnmt1 on longer DNA molecules, a finding that suggests that Dnmt1 is a processive enzyme. However, this result could also be explained by a preferential binding of the enzyme to longer substrates, not necessarily involving repetitive methylation on the same substrate molecule. In addition, due to technical reasons, unmethylated DNA, which is not the preferred substrate of the enzyme and does not reflect the physiological situation, was used in these experiments. Since a processive DNA methylation reaction is defined as the preference of the enzyme to transfer more than one methyl group to one DNA molecule without the release of the DNA, one has to study the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of methylation intermediates to definitely prove or disprove a processive mechanism. Methylation intermediates are defined in the context of this work as DNA molecules that have been modified at some, but not at all, target sites. Here, we have studied the processivity of Dnmt1 using different hemimethylated DNA substrates of 80 and 957 bp. We employ a restriction protection assay to follow the methylation state of individual hemimethylated CG sites. In addition, we have investigated the accuracy of the enzyme in copying the original methylation pattern of the DNA. Our results show that Dnmt1 is a processive and accurate enzyme, which is an important prerequisite for its role in vivo. Oligodeoxynucleotides—Oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Interactiva (Ulm, Germany) in HPLC 1The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.- and PAGE-purified form. The concentration of oligodeoxynucleotide stocks were calculated from the A260 nm using molar extinction coefficients provided by the supplier. Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide substrates were formed by annealing identical amounts of complementary single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides. The 80-mer oligodeoxynucleotides contained three repeated sequences, comprising 20 nucleotides, flanked by 10 variable nucleotides at each site to prevent nonspecific annealing. The target site for methylation is situated in the middle of the 20-mer repeated sequence. The oligodeoxynucleotides displayed different methylation status. In the case of the hemi3 oligonucleotide substrate, 2 nucleotides were changed to remove the restriction site. In the case of the hemiturn oligonucleotide substrate, the entire central 20-mer repeated sequence was inverted. In Scheme 1, the recognition sequence for Dnmt1 is indicated with bold letters, and the GATC recognition sequence of the Sau3AI restriction enzyme is underlined. The substrate plasmid pAT153 (NCBI accession number: L08853) was used as template for the generation of a longer hemimethylated substrate. It was mutated to remove the Sau3AI cleavage site at position 1129 and thereby create a substrate with four GATCG sites but no additional GATC site. The mutation was introduced by a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol after Jeltsch and Lanio (30Jeltsch A. Lanio T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). For this mutagenesis, the first step is to create a megaprimer, with two primers, one of them containing the mutation. The mutagenesis primer was purchased from Interactiva in HPLC-purified form. Oligodeoxynucleotides used as primers for the generation of a longer hemimethylated substrate were purchased from Interactiva in HPLC-purified form. The forward primer was 5′-phosphorylated, as shown in Scheme 2. Expression and Purification of Dnmt1—A pupal ovarian cell line (SF21) from Spodoptera frugiperda was used for expression of the full-length murine Dnmt1. SF21 cells were maintained in suspension culture with SF900II medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C, adding antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen) and Pluronic F-68 (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) each. Recombinant baculovirus encoding full-length Dnmt1 containing a His6 tag at the N-terminal end was prepared using the Bac-to-Bac (pFastBacHTc transfer vector) expression system from Invitrogen as described by the manufacturer. The cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 5 at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. After incubation for 72 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.5). For protein purification, ∼2 × 108 infected cells were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 0.01% Lubrol, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (P8849, Sigma). The cells were disrupted by sonication for 5 min on ice and then centrifuged for 45 min at 40,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with buffer A, the protein was eluted with 2 ml of buffer A supplemented with 250 mm imidazole and dialyzed against buffer B (30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 0.01% Lubrol, and 77% glycerol). The concentration of purified Dnmt1 was estimated using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Supplemental Fig. 1) and suitable molecular mass markers of known concentration. Methylation and Restriction Analysis of the 80-mer Oligodeoxynucleotide Substrates—The upper or lower strand of the substrate was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed by adding equal amounts of the complementary strands, heating 10 min to 90 °C, and slowly cooling to ambient temperature. After precipitating the DNA with ethanol, the exact amount of DNA was measured by OD260 nm using an extinction coefficient of ϵ260 nm = 20 cm-1 liter/gram-1. These substrates contain repetitive sequences that may potentially lead to a variety of secondary structures and formation of stem loop structures. We have confirmed successful annealing by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Supplemental Fig. 2). Annealed double-stranded DNA can be clearly separated from single-stranded DNA, demonstrating the absence of residual amounts of single strands. In addition, we show that the annealed substrates are completely cleaved by DpnII (Supplemental Fig. 2), which demonstrates successful and complete annealing as well. Methylation reactions were carried out at 37 °C in methylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 1 mmS-adenosyl-l-methionin (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The substrate was used at a concentration of 3.8 nm DNA. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 6.5 nm in all experiments, except for the experiment with unmethylated oligonucleotide, in which the Dnmt1 concentration was increased 10-fold (65 nm). The methylation reaction was stopped at different times by adding ethanol, and the precipitated and purified DNA was digested with 4 units of Sau3AI. For the Sau3AI digest, additional unmethylated 80-mer oligodeoxynucleotide was added to a final concentration of 50 nm to improve the efficiency of the cleavage reaction (31Friedhoff P. Lurz R. Luder G. Pingoud A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23581-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cleavage products were separated on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and analyzed using an Instant Imager (Canberra Packard). All the experiments were repeated at least four times. Despite prolonged incubation times and the addition of stimulatory oligonucleotides, the digestion of the 80-mer substrate with Sau3AI was never found to be complete, which had to be considered in the quantification of the exact amount of methylation by Dnmt1. Due to incomplete cleavage, a certain amount of unmethylated DNA was not cleaved, suggesting that it was methylated. For this reason, the relative amount of incompletely cleaved DNA in relation to the amount that was completely cleaved was calculated from control reactions for each gel and each experiment (typically in the range of 2-5%). This fraction was used for correction of the Dnmt1-treated samples. Incompletely digested DNA contributes to the amount of intermediate detectable in the analysis, although it does not originate from incompletely methylated substrate. Therefore, the contribution of incomplete digestion to the apparent amount of intermediates was corrected by calculating the amount of incomplete digestion for each lane, by multiplication of the amount of cleaved DNA with the fraction of incomplete digestion in the respective experiment. For example, assume that 3% incomplete digestion was detected in the control lane, and in the kinetic analysis, one lane shows 5% intermediates and 70% unmethylated substrate. Under these circumstances, incomplete digestion contributes by 2.1% (= 70% × 0.03) to the amount of intermediate detected. Therefore, the real amount of incompletely methylated DNA is 2.9% (= 5% - 2.1%). Methylation Analysis of a longer Hemimethylated Substrate—We also studied the processivity of Dnmt1 using a hemimethylated substrate with a length of 957 bp, which contains four GATCG sites. To generate the substrate, we used a protocol modified after Thomas et al. (32Thomas E. Pingoud A. Friedhoff P. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The 957-mer oligonucleotide was obtained by PCR with the primers 5′P-P1 and P2, using the mutated plasmid pAT153 as template (PCR protocol: 1 × 95 °C for 3 min; 30 × 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; 1 × 72 °C for 5 min). This PCR product was methylated at all CG sites in both DNA strands by the CG-specific methyltransferase M.SssI (kindly provided by Dr. M. Roth, Institut für Biochemie, Justus-Liebig Universität Giessen, Giessen, Germany); the completeness of the methylation was confirmed by digestion of the DNA with R.HpaII (MBI Fermentas). The methylated PCR product was digested by λ-exonuclease (New England Biolabs) in the buffer provided by the company for 60 min at 37 °C; 1 unit was used for 1 μg of PCR product. λ-Exonuclease selectively digests one strand of double-stranded DNA from a phosphorylated 5′-end. Since the forward primer in the PCR reaction was phosphorylated, it leads to the selective removal of the upper strand of the PCR product. Digestion with λ-exonuclease was complete as judged from a native acrylamide gel, in which no double-stranded PCR product was detectable after digestion. Subsequently, the methylated single strand was used as template for a primer extension reaction. In this 50-μl reaction, the template, primer 5′P-P1, and dNTPs were incubated with Taq polymerase (Stratagene) in the buffer provided by the company supplemented with 0.37 MBq [α-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytic). The temperature profile of the extension reaction was: 95 °C for 3 min, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 5 min, 90 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 5 min, 88 °C for 2 min, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 15 min. The hemimethylated substrate was purified with a spin column (Macherey-Nagel), and the amount of DNA was determined using an extinction coefficient of ϵ260 nm = 20 cm-1 Lg-1. The final hemimethylated substrate was incubated with HpaII and Sau3AI restriction enzyme. HpaII did not cleave the DNA, confirming the completeness of the hemimethylation since hemimethylated CCGG sites are not cut, whereas Sau3AI was cleaving the substrate (Supplemental Fig. 3). Methylation reactions with Dnmt1 were carried out at 37 °C in methylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 1 mmS-adenosyl-l-methionin (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The substrate was used at a concentration of 2 nm DNA; the reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme to a final concentration of 4 nm. The methylation reaction was stopped at different time points by the addition of 5 volumes of 100% ethanol. After ethanol precipitation, the DNA was digested by Sau3AI as described previously. Cleavage products were separated on a 6% (w/v) native polyacrylamide gel, and the radioactivity was analyzed using an Instant Imager (Canberra Packard). The aim of our studies was to investigate the processivity and accuracy of the DNA methylation reaction by Dnmt1. For this purpose, we have analyzed the processivity of Dnmt1 on substrates differing in the length, the number of CG target sites, and the methylation state of these sites. We employed a restriction protection assay in which the DNA after methylation is incubated with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme such that methylated sites are not cut. With this method, the rate of methylation of each individual site can be analyzed, and one can follow the appearance and disappearance of intermediates of the methylation reaction precisely. Since Dnmt1 prefers hemimethylated substrates and one of its functions is to act as the maintenance methyltransferase after DNA replication, we have employed hemimethylated substrates modified in one DNA strand and studied the methylation of the second DNA strand. To this end, one needs to distinguish between hemimethylated and fully methylated CG sites. However, there is no restriction enzyme available that recognizes a CG site and at the same time distinguishes between the hemimethylated and fully methylated state of the substrate. Therefore, we have designed substrates containing GATCG sites in which the recognition sequence of Sau3AI (GATC) is overlapping with the CG recognition sequence of Dnmt1. Sau3AI cleaves the DNA when the GATC site is not methylated. If the CG of the lower strand is methylated (GATCG/CmGATC), the methyl group is not part of the recognition site of the restriction enzyme, and the site is cleaved although the CG site is hemimethylated. After Dnmt1 has modified the hemimethylated CG site, a fully methylated CG site is generated. The methyl group introduced by Dnmt1 is in the recognition site of Sau3AI (GATmCG/mC-GATC), and DNA cleavage is inhibited (Fig. 1) because Sau3AI does not cut hemimethylated GATC sites (33Hermann A. Jeltsch A. BioTechniques. 2003; 34 (928, 930): 924-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Methylation of a 958-bp Substrate—Processivity is dependent on the length of the substrate, and in vivo, Dnmt1 is confronted with a very long stretch of hemimethylated DNA after DNA replication. To simulate this situation in vitro, a long substrate, in which all CG sequences are hemimethylated, is required. Such substrates can be produced following a published protocol (32Thomas E. Pingoud A. Friedhoff P. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a first step, a 958-mer PCR product containing four GATCG sites was generated using an upper primer phosphorylated on its 5′-end. Then, this PCR product was methylated with M.SssI. By λ-exonuclease digestion, which specifically hydrolyzes one strand of double-stranded DNA starting from a phosphorylated 5′-end, a methylated single strand was obtained. In the third step, the single strand was used as template for a primer extension reaction using radioactive [α-32P]ATP to produce a double-stranded DNA, containing four hemimethylated GATCG sites (Fig. 2A). The completeness of the hemimethylation was confirmed by complete protection of the substrate against HpaII digestion (Supplemental Fig. 3). Since the substrate is internally labeled, all Sau3AI cleavage fragments are detectable on the gel, even after incomplete methylation of the DNA by Dnmt1. The processivity of the methylation reaction can be deduced from the pattern of unmethylated DNA, fully methylated DNA, and methylation intermediates. A distributive enzyme will leave its substrate after each turnover. Thus, for statistical reasons, the enzyme will bind to unmethylated substrates in the early phases of the reaction, and DNA molecules carrying one, two, or three methyl groups will accumulate before significant amounts of completely methylated final product appear. In contrast, a processive enzyme will stay on each substrate until it is completely methylated such that the final product appears even at the earliest time points of the reaction. A simulation of a distributive and a processive methylation reaction of the 958-mer oligonucleotide is shown in Fig. 2C for comparison. We have performed these experiments under conditions of excessive or equimolar enzyme. However, due to an unfavorable binding constant and low absolute concentrations, this does not implicate more than one enzyme being bound to each substrate on average. Therefore, our results can be interpreted in a theoretical framework assuming that on each substrate molecule, just one enzyme is active. The time course of methylation of the 958-mer oligonucleotide by Dnmt1 shows that there are only a few intermediates detectable (total amount <5%, Fig. 2, B and D). The high degree of processivity of the reaction is illustrated by comparison of the reaction profile shown in Fig. 2D with simulated profiles, calculated under the assumption of a fully distributive and fully processive reaction (Fig. 2C). Our data demonstrate that 95% of all substrates are methylated at all four sites in a processive reaction. The probability to continue DNA methylation after each catalytic event therefore can be estimated to be 98.8% (0.9884 = 0.95). We conclude that Dnmt1 methylates hemimethylated DNA, comprising 958 bp in a highly processive manner. Methylation of Synthetic 80-mer Oligonucleotides—After having shown that Dnmt1 modifies DNA in a processive reaction, we attempted to investigate the influence of the methylation state of adjacent CG sites on the processivity as well as the accuracy of the enzyme in copying an existing methylation pattern. To this end, synthetic oligonucleotide substrates were employed to investigate partially unmethylated and fully methylated substrates as well. These experiments were carried out using 80-mer oligonucleotide substrates containing three 20-mer repeats; 10 nucleotides specific for each end were added to ensure accurate annealing. The GATCG recognition site of Dnmt1 is embedded in the repeats, and the repeated structure was chosen to ensure that the methylation of Dnmt1 is not influenced by different flanking nucleotides, and all three sites are modified at the same intrinsic rate. The oligodeoxynucleotide substrates were radioactively labeled at one 5′-end. Therefore, only fragments containing the original 5′-end were detectable on the gel. After Sau3AI cleavage of an unmethylated substrate, a 19-mer oligonucleotide product is generated, whereas the fully methylated 80-mer oligonucleotide is not cleaved at all. If the methylation is not complete, intermediate products could appear, with lengths of 39 or 59 nucleotides, depending on whether one or two restriction sites are protected. Additional intermediates are possible but not detectable in this setup. All experiments were performed in two ways with substrates carrying the label in the upper and lower strand; each individual experiment was repeated at least four times. This setup ensures that for each substrate, four out of five possible methylation intermediates are detected. We did not observe significant differences in the kinetics of methylation between substrates labeled in the upper or lower strand in any case. This was expected since such differences would only occur if the intrinsic rates of methylation are different at the three sites, which was unlikely because the methylation sites are embedded in an identical sequence context. Methylation of an Unmethylated Oligonucleotide—In the first experiment, we investigated the methylation of an unmethylated substrate (Fig. 3) and compared it with a hemimethylated one (Fig. 4). In these substrates, all three CG sites are either unmethylated or hemimethylated. The unmethylated oligonucleotide is likely to be a very poor substrate for Dnmt1 because methylation reactions with short oligonucleotides containing a single unmethylated CG site showed a 40-50-fold reduced rate of methylation as compared with an identical substrate that is hemimethylated (15Fatemi M.

https://openalex.org/W2058306877,"We present an analysis of chromatin fiber structure across the human genome. Compact and open chromatin fiber structures were separated by sucrose sedimentation and their distributions analyzed by hybridization to metaphase chromosomes and genomic microarrays. We show that compact chromatin fibers originate from some sites of heterochromatin (C-bands), and G-bands (euchromatin). Open chromatin fibers correlate with regions of highest gene density, but not with gene expression since inactive genes can be in domains of open chromatin, and active genes in regions of low gene density can be embedded in compact chromatin fibers. Moreover, we show that chromatin fiber structure impacts on further levels of chromatin condensation. Regions of open chromatin fibers are cytologically decondensed and have a distinctive nuclear organization. We suggest that domains of open chromatin may create an environment that facilitates transcriptional activation and could provide an evolutionary constraint to maintain clusters of genes together along chromosomes."

YM-254890 blocks Gαq/11-coupled ADP receptor P2Y1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. Here we report that YM-254890 is a selective Gαq/11 inhibitor. YM-254890 blocked Ca2+ mobilization mediated by several Gαq/11-coupled receptors but not by Gαi- or Gα15-coupled receptor, indicating that phospholipase Cβ activation and subsequent signaling molecules are not the target of YM-254890. YM-254890 completely prevented the serum response factor (SRF)-mediated gene transcription induced by GαqR183C, which is constitutively active in a receptor-dependent manner because of its reduced kcat of GTP hydrolysis. Conversely, YM-254890 had only a modest effect on the SRF-mediated gene transcription by GαqQ209L, which is GTPase-deficient (activated) Gαq. These suggested that the acting point of YM-254890 is receptor-Gαq interaction or the subsequent guanine nucleotide exchange step. The fact that YM-254890 (i) inhibited the SRF-mediated gene transcription by Gαqi5, which interacts with Gαi-coupled receptor and possesses the effector function of Gαq, and (ii) had no effect on the Kd value of high affinity [3H]2MeSADP binding to P2Y1, which reflects the agonist-receptor-Gα ternary complex, suggested that receptor-Gαq/11 interaction is not the target of YM-254890. On the other hand, specific [35S]GTPγS binding to Gαq/11 stimulated by the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and P2Y1 were inhibited by YM-254890. These data indicate that YM-254890 blocks the exchange of GDP for GTP in Gαq/11 activation. This novel Gαq/11-selective inhibitor is a promising and powerful tool for studying Gαq/11 protein activation, Gαq/11 -coupled receptor signaling, and Gαq/11-mediated biological events."
https://openalex.org/W2033125798,"The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus is believed to be an integral part of the viral replicase. Despite extensive investigation, the role of this protein remains elusive. Only limited biochemical characterization of NS5A has been performed, with most research to date involving the myriad of host proteins and signaling cascades that interact with NS5A. The need for better characterization of NS5A is paramount for elucidating the role of this protein in the virus life cycle. Examination of NS5A using bioinformatics tools suggested the protein consisted of three domains and contained an unconventional zinc binding motif within the N-terminal domain. We have developed a method to produce NS5A and performed limited proteolysis to confirm the domain organization model. The zinc content of purified NS5A and the N-terminal domain of NS5A was determined, and each of these proteins was found to coordinate one zinc atom per protein. The predicted zinc binding motif consists of four cysteine residues, conserved among the Hepacivirus and Pestivirus genera, fitting the formula of CX17CXCX20C. Mutation of any of the four cysteine components of this motif reduced NS5A zinc coordination and led to a lethal phenotype for HCV RNA replication, whereas mutation of other potential metal coordination residues in the N-terminal domain of NS5A, but outside the zinc binding motif, had little effect on zinc binding and, aside from one exception, were tolerated for replication. Collectively, these results indicate that NS5A is a zinc metalloprotein and that zinc coordination is likely required for NS5A function in the hepatitis C replicase.

Since the discovery of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; NTR, non-translated regions; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; cfu, colony-forming units; NS, non-structural; TPCK, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone; LCS, low complexity sequence; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. as the causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989 (1Choo Q.-L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar), understanding the biology of this pathogen has been a major focus of both basic and clinical research. HCV is a significant global public health problem, with estimates placing nearly 3% of the world population, roughly 170 million people, as HCV-infected (2Anonymous Wkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 1997; 72: 341-344PubMed Google Scholar). Despite recent advances, current HCV therapeutics are inadequate for the majority of patients. HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses and is the sole member of the Hepacivirus genus (3Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fourth Ed. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia2001: 991-1041Google Scholar). The HCV genome consists of a ∼9.6 kb RNA molecule containing a large open reading frame flanked by structured 5′- and 3′-non-translated regions (NTR). Viral RNA is translated to generate a polyprotein precursor via an internal ribosome entry site within the 5′-NTR. The ten HCV proteins are organized in the polyprotein in the order: NH2-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH (4Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional protein, F (for frameshift protein) or ARFP (alternate reading frame protein), generated from an overlapping reading frame in the core (C) protein coding sequence, has been proposed (5Walewski J.L. Keller T.R. Stump D.D. Branch A.D. RNA. 2001; 7: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6Xu Z. Choi J. Yen T.S. Lu W. Strohecker A. Govindarajan S. Chien D. Selby M.J. Ou J.

The polyprotein undergoes a series of membrane associated co- and post-translational cleavages by viral and host cell proteases to yield the mature forms of the individual HCV proteins (8Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The structural proteins, C, E1, and E2 are directed to the ER-Golgi complex and processed by resident enzyme activities to generate the components for the assembly of progeny. The small hydrophobic p7 protein has been demonstrated to form ion channels in the host cell membrane, although the functional consequences of this observation are not clear (9Griffin S.D. Beales L.P. Clarke D.S. Worsfold O. Evans S.D. Jaeger J. Harris M.P. Rowlands D.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The non-structural (NS) proteins are processed by the two distinct viral protease activities (8Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 10Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The integral membrane NS2 protein, together with the N-terminal region of the NS3 protein, constitutes the NS2–3 cysteine proteinase that catalyzes the cleavage between NS2 and NS3 (8Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 10Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NS2 protein has no known function after this cleavage has occurred, and this protein is not required for RNA replication in cell culture (11Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 12Lohmann V. Korner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The NS3 protein, in conjunction with the NS4A cofactor, serves as a serine proteinase for the cleavage of the remaining non-structural proteins (10Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Akagi T. Mori S. Kakiuchi N. Kato N. Tanaka T. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J.

Once cleaved, the NS proteins assemble into the membrane associated HCV RNA replicase complex. The putative HCV replicase complex has been imaged in replicon-containing cell lines in a structure deemed the membranous web (15Gosert R. Egger D. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Moradpour D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This complex has been shown to contain all of the HCV NS proteins, as well as actively replicating HCV RNA (15Gosert R. Egger D. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Moradpour D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the HCV replicase using the HCV replicon system has defined NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B as essential components of the replicase (11Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 12Lohmann V. Korner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The functions of a number of the NS proteins have been at least partially defined. In addition to NS3 aforementioned role in polyprotein processing, its C-terminal domain serves as an RNA helicase activity likely utilized during replication (16Tai C.-L. Chi W.-K. Chen D.-S. Hwang L.-H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8477-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small NS4A protein serves as a cofactor for both the protease and helicase activities of NS3 (14Failla C. Tomei L. DeFrancesco R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3753-3760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). NS4B is an integral membrane protein that has a direct role in reorganization of cellular membranes to form the membranous web (18Egger D. Wolk B. Gosert R. Bianchi L. Blum H.E. Moradpour D. Bienz K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Additionally, this protein has been proposed to function as a membrane-bound scaffolding upon which the remaining replicase components assemble. The NS5B protein serves as the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (1Choo Q.-L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar). The function of NS5A in the replicase is not clear, but this protein appears to be an absolutely required component of the replicase and is required for HCV replication (11Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 12Lohmann V. Korner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). NS5A is a large (56–58 kDa), hydrophilic phosphoprotein of unknown function. The ability of adaptive mutations in NS5A to greatly stimulate HCV replication in cell culture, and the association of this protein with other members of the putative replicase suggests NS5A plays an important role in RNA replication (11Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 12Lohmann V. Korner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The NS5A protein exists in multiple phosphorylation states, designated p56 (basal) and p58 (hyper), based on their migration on SDS-PAGE gels. Considerable effort has been placed in mapping NS5A phosphorylation sites and identifying the enzyme(s) responsible for this activity. Despite this, our knowledge of phosphate acceptor sites is rudimentary and the kinase(s) remains elusive (19Kaneko T. Tanji Y. Satoh S. Hijikata M. Asabe S. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Reed K.E. Xu J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7187-7197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Reed K.E. Rice C.M. J. Biol.

Although some NS5A adaptive mutations affect the phosphorylation state of NS5A in HCV replicons (11Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), the link between NS5A phosphorylation and replication is unknown. Additional roles for NS5A in modulating various cell signaling cascades have been proposed, perhaps based on the observed interaction of NS5A with cellular kinase activities, but the relevance of many of these to replication and pathogenesis remains to be demonstrated (see Ref. 25Tellinghuisen T.L. Rice C.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar for review). Despite the vast number of NS5A-related publications, surprisingly little effort has been devoted to the basic biochemical characterization of this protein. One area of recent attention has been the interaction of NS5A with cellular membranes. NS5A has been shown to be post-translationally associated with endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes via an N-terminal amphipathic α-helix that has been proposed to be partially buried in one leaflet of the cellular membrane (26Brass V. Bieck E. Montserret R. Wolk B. Hellings J.A. Blum H.E. Penin F. Moradpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8130-8139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Disruption of this helix leads to a diffuse cytoplasmic localization of NS5A and is lethal for HCV RNA replication (27Elazar M. Cheong K.H. Liu P. Greenberg H.B. Rice C.M. Glenn J.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6055-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These data, combined with subcellular co-localization studies, replicase component interaction studies, and NS5A adaptive replicon mutants provide an increasing body of evidence suggesting the importance of NS5A in the RNA replicase. One area that is clearly lacking in NS5A research is an identification and evaluation of the domain organization of the protein and a biochemical evaluation of potentially important sequence motifs. In this study, a combination of bioinformatics analysis, biochemical assays with purified NS5A protein, and replication studies, with the replicon system, were used to characterize NS5A. We have generated a model for the domain organization of NS5A, which was confirmed by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry. Analysis of the sequence of NS5A has suggested the presence of an unconventional, yet highly conserved, zinc metal ion coordination site within the N-terminal domain, which was evaluated by a combination of reverse genetics in the replicon system and atomic absorption spectroscopy using purified NS5A protein. The data presented herein provide the first model of NS5A domain organization and defines the essential zinc binding properties of NS5A, observations that further our understanding of this enigmatic protein. Cloning and in Vitro Mutagenesis—All mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange (Stratagene) in vitro mutagenesis system following the manufacturer's standard protocols. Mutations were generated in the shuttle vector pSL1180GIT, which contained the BsrG1-MfeI fragment of the Con1/SG-neo GIT replicon encompassing the NS5A coding sequence and surrounding region. The Con1/SG-neo GIT replicon is identical to the subgenomic replicons described previously (11Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), with the exception of the presence of two adaptive mutations in NS3 (E1202G, T1280I) and one in NS4A (K1846T), thereby allowing analysis of NS5A mutants on a wild-type NS5A backbone (28Lohmann V. Hoffmann S. Herian U. Penin F. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3007-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). All mutations generated by QuikChange mutagenesis were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the final replicon plasmids. Fragments of interest (e.g. NS5A coding sequence) were then subcloned into the appropriate vectors for protein expression or replicon experiments as described below. For replicon experiments, the BsrG1-MfeI fragment of pSL1180GIT containing the desired mutation was directly cloned back into the parental Con1/Sg-neo GIT replicon plasmid. For protein expression clones, pSL1180GIT DNA containing the desired mutation was used as a template for PCR amplification of the NS5A coding sequence corresponding to amino acids 25–448 of NS5A (NS5A-Δh). PCR primers were designed to create an in-frame 5′-SacII restriction site for fusion of NS5A-Δh to the ubiquitin coding sequence cloned into the NdeI (ATG start codon) site of pET30b. The 3′-end of the NS5A coding sequence was altered to include a KpnI site for the in-frame fusion with the linker, enterokinase cleavage site, and polyhistidine tag of pET30b. Domain I expression constructs were constructed similarly, with the exception of the introduction of the 3′-KpnI site in a location to generate an NS5A coding sequence terminating at amino acid 215 with a fusion to the linker, enterokinase cleavage site, and polyhistidine tag of pET30b. Clones generated in pET30b using PCR were confirmed by an additional round of DNA sequencing to ensure no PCR-based mutations were present. Numbering of NS5A amino acid residues corresponds to the first serine residues of NS5A as residue number one. Mutations of amino acids in NS5A are designated by; single letter amino acid code of the parental sequence, the residue number in NS5A, and the altered amino acid present in the mutant construct, for example, a change of cysteine 141 of NS5A to a glycine residue would be described as C141G. Conversion of this numbering scheme to the amino acid numbering scheme of the complete 1b genotype HCV polyprotein requires the addition of 1972 to the numbers used in this article. HCV genotype sequences used for sequence alignments in this article are designated by their corresponding GenBank™ data base accession numbers. Cell Culture—Huh-7.5 (human hepatoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 3 days at a split ratio of 1:4 after treatment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. All experiments were performed using cells between passage number 28–35 expanded from an original seed stock of the Huh7.5 cell clone described previously (29Blight K.J. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13001-13014Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In Vitro RNA Transcription—In vitro RNA transcription of HCV replicon RNAs was performed as described previously (11Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Cesium chloride density gradient purified Con1/SG-neo GIT DNA was linearized with ScaI (New England Biolabs), followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNA transcripts were synthesized at 37 °C for 1.5 h in a 50-μl reaction containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 2mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm each rNTP, 100 units of RNAsin (Roche Applied Science), 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Epicenter Technologies), and 3 μg of linearized DNA template. Following transcription, 10 units of DNase I (Ambion) was added, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min to remove the DNA template. RNA was then purified using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The optional on-column DNase treatment described for the RNAeasy kit was used to further remove residual DNA template. RNA yield was determined by quantification with a UV spectrophotometer. The quality of RNA was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Electroporation of HCV Replicons and G418 Selection—Experiments using HCV replicons were performed essentially as described previously, with minor modifications (11Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent Huh-7.5 cells at were trypsinized, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at a concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in ice-cold RNase-free phosphate-buffered saline. A 400-μl aliquot of cells was then mixed with 1 μg of HCV replicon RNA and electroporated using a BTX square wavelength electroporator in a 0.2-mm gap cuvette (five 99 ms pulses, 900 volts, 1.1-s time interval). Following a 10-min recovery period at room temperature, cells were diluted in 9.6 ml of complete medium and plated into 100-mm dishes. Cells were plated a 1 × 106, 1 × 105, and 1 × 104 cells at a fixed overall cell density of 1 × 106 cells/plate, with the remaining cell density consisting of cells electroporated with a replication-deficient Con1/SG-neo GIT pol– RNA. Selection of replicon-containing colonies was performed 2 days post-electroporation by the addition of complete medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. Selection was carried out for a period of 2 weeks post-electroporation with fresh G418 containing media added to the cells every 4 days. Following selection, cells were fixed with 7% formaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet in 50% ethanol. G418 selection was performed for 3 weeks for the data presented in Fig. 5, as one mutant had a small colony phenotype. G418-resistant colonies were then counted as used to calculate transduction efficiency in units of colony forming units (cfu) per microgram of input RNA. All experiments presented are the average of three independent RNA preparations delivered by three independent electroporations. NS5A-Δh Expression and Purification—For the expression of NS5A-Δh, 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/liter of kanamycin and 25 μg/liter of chloramphenicol was inoculated from an overnight culture of Escherichia coli BL21(de3) containing pET30ubiNS5A-Δh and the ubiquitin-specific protease pCG1 plasmids such that the cell density was at approximately OD600 of 0.05. Cells were grown at 37 °C and 250 rpm until an OD600 of 0.55 was reached. Cells were then chilled at 4 °C for 30 min, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 5 h at 25 °C and 250 rpm. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) per liter. Cells were lysed by three passes through a cold Avestin air emulsifier at 15,000 psi. Following lysis, cell extracts were clarified at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Clarified extracts were then loaded on a 5-ml bed volume HiTrap nickel IMAC column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Following extensive washing with buffer A and buffer A supplemented with 1 m NaCl, NS5A-Δh was eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient of buffer A supplemented with 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing NS5A-Δh were pooled and exchanged into buffer B (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl) using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column at a flow rate of 8 ml/min (Amersham Biosciences). Desalted protein was then concentrated via Amicon ultracentrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Concentration of purified NS5A-Δh was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Protein yields were typically between 2 and 5 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Domain Mapping of NS5A by Limited Trypsinization—Fifteen micrograms per sample of purified NS5A-Δh in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 30% glycerol were digested with 2 μl of a 50% slurry of agarose bead immobilized TPCK-treated trypsin (Pierce Biotechnology) equilibrated in the same buffer. Digestion was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for a total of 3 h, with samples removed every 30 min for analysis. Once removed, these samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge to pellet the immobilized trypsin. Supernatants were removed, mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer, and boiled for 2 min. These aliquots were then run on 12% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gels according to the method of Laemmli. Gels were electroblotted to a 0.2-micron pore polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the buffer, 10 mm CAPS (pH 11.0), 10% methanol. Following staining of membranes for 10 min with 0.5% Ponceau-S stain in 1% acetic acid and destaining in water, bands corresponding to the major proteolytic products were excised and submitted to the Rockefeller University Proteomics Resource Center for analysis by N-terminal Edman degradation and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Production of HCV NS5A-Domain I-Δh—For the expression of NS5A-Domain I-Δh, 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/liter of kanamycin and 25 μg/liter of chloramphenicol was inoculated from an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(de3) containing pET30ubi-NS5A-Domain I-Δh and pCG1 plasmids such that the cell density was at approximately OD600 of 0.05. Cells were grown at 37 °C and 250 rpm until an OD600 of 0.55 was reached. Cells were then chilled at 4 °C for 30 min, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 5 h at 25 °C and 250 rpm. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm NaCl) per liter. Cells were lysed by three passes through a cold Avestin air emulsifier at 15,000 psi. Following lysis, cell extracts were clarified at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Clarified extracts were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, with the bulk of NS5A-Domain I-Δh present in the 5–25% saturation pellet. Ammonium sulfate pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer C and applied to a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column at a flow rate of 8 ml/min (Amersham Biosciences). The desalted protein was then loaded onto a HiPrep 16/20 DEAE column equilibrated with buffer C at 2.5 ml/min and eluted with a linear 500 mm NaCl gradient. Pooled DEAE elution fractions were then loaded on a 5-ml bed volume HiTrap nickel IMAC column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Following extensive washing with buffer C and buffer C supplemented with 1 m NaCl, NS5A-Domain I-Δh was eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient of buffer C supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing NS5A-Domain I-Δh were pooled and exchanged into buffer B (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl) using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column at a flow rate of 8 ml/min (Amersham Biosciences). Desalted protein was then concentrated via Amicon ultracentrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Concentration of purified NS5A-Domain I-Δh was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Protein yields were typically between 10 and 12 mg/liters of bacterial culture. Atomic Absorption Analysis—Atomic absorption experiments were performed by the Trace Metal Core Facility, The Department of Environmental Sciences, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. All experiments were performed according to the standard operating procedures of the core facility. Background zinc level of the protein analysis buffer was performed, and this value was subtracted from all values determined for protein samples. All values reported are the average of three independent measurements of two independently prepared aliquots of each sample. Zinc values determined were based on comparison with a zinc standard calibration curve. All glass and plasticware used for the preparation of NS5A-Δh and NS5A-Domain I-Δh were acid-washed overnight in 50% nitric acid followed by copious washing in ultrapure de-ionized water. All buffers and reagents were prepared using the highest quality grade of chemicals commercially available. Concentrations of NS5A-Δh and NS5A-Domain I-Δh used for the calculation of protein:zinc molar ratios were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Computer-aided Comparative Sequence Analyses—Amino acid sequences were derived from the GenPeptides data base maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Sequence alignments were produced with the Gibbs sampler (30Lawrence C.E. Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Liu J.S. Neuwald A.F. Wootton J.C.

https://openalex.org/W1964231591,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and in cancer therapy. Although the unfolded protein response is known to alleviate ER stress by reducing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, the exact survival elements and their downstream signaling pathways that directly counteract ER stress-stimulated apoptotic signaling remain elusive. Here, we have shown that endogenous Akt and ERK are rapidly activated and act as downstream effectors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in thapsigargin- or tunicamycin-induced ER stress. Introduction of either dominant-negative Akt or MEK1 or the inhibitors LY294002 and U0126 sensitized cells to ER stress-induced cell death in different cell types. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of gene expression during ER stress revealed that cIAP-2 and XIAP, members of the IAP family of potent caspase suppressors, were strongly induced. Transcription of cIAP-2 and XIAP was up-regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway as shown by its reversal by dominant-negative Akt or LY294002. Ablation of these IAPs by RNA interference sensitized cells to ER stress-induced death, which was reversed by the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. The protective role of IAPs in ER stress coincided with Smac release from mitochondria to the cytosol. Furthermore, it was shown that mTOR was not required for Akt-mediated survival. These results represent the first demonstration that activation of endogenous Akt/IAPs and MEK/ERK plays a critical role in controlling cell survival by resisting ER stress-induced cell death signaling.

Disruption of ER homeostasis interferes with protein folding and leads to the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. This condition has been designated “ER stress” (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). ER stress can be triggered by a number of stimuli that perturb ER function, such as Ca2+ depletion from the ER lumen, inhibition of N-linked glycosylation, reduction of disulfide bonds, overexpression of certain proteins, and nutrient/glucose deprivation (2Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). ER stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, including neuronal degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (3Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat.

Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). It is also related to cancer therapy (7Adams J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2002; 14: 628-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The balance between cell survival responses and cell death responses decides the occurrence and development of these diseases. Thus, a better understanding of cell survival responses to ER stress can aid the understanding and development of new therapies for these diseases. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a important adaptive response to ER stress, which includes transcriptional induction of UPR genes, translational attenuation of global protein synthesis, and ER-associated protein degradation (8Liu C.Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1861-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In mammals, three ER transmembrane proteins, IRE1, ATF6, and PERK, mediate the UPR. Activated IRE1 and ATF6 stimulate transcription of ER chaperone genes (9Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PERK phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α, which halts translation and prevents the continual accumulation of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (10Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). ER-associated protein degradation stimulates the degradation and clearance of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen (11Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 12Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, if these adaptive responses are not sufficient to relieve the ER stress, the cell dies through apoptosis. Apoptosis is primarily mediated by a family of caspases. Two separable pathways leading to caspase activation have been characterized. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by ligation of transmembrane death receptors to activate caspase-8 and -10. The intrinsic pathway requires disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and release of mitochondrial proteins, including Smac/DIABLO, HtrA2, and cytochrome c. Cytochrome c functions with Apaf-1 to induce activation of caspase-9, thereby initiating the apoptotic caspase cascade, whereas Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2 bind to and antagonize IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) (13Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). It has been reported that activation of caspase-3, -4, -8, -9, and -12 is required for ER stress-induced cell death (14Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 15Song L. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol.

Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The UPR rescues cells mainly through removing unfolded proteins. It has not been reported that the UPR has a direct inhibitory effect on the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Here, we hypothesize that ER stress activates in parallel UPR and cell survival mechanisms that counteract apoptotic signals and facilitate UPR function. In this study, we evaluate the hypothesis that certain survival elements directly counteract ER stress-induced apoptotic signaling. We demonstrate that endogenous PI3K/Akt and MEK1/ERK are acutely activated in ER stress and subsequently prevent the apoptosis response. We examine the possible interaction between the survival elements and anti- or pro-apoptotic genes. We demonstrate that endogenous Akt is required for transcriptional regulation of specific IAPs. Furthermore, we show that ablation of these IAPs sensitizes stressed cells to death and that this can be reversed by a caspase inhibitor. Smac/DIABLO are indeed released during ER stress. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized important response that controls cell survival during ER stress. Materials—Tunicamycin, thapsigargin, Hoechst 33342, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, the MEK1 inhibitor U0126, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell Culture—The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and its stable transfectants, the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, and the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The human lung cancer cell line H1299 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium. All media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Before being challenged with tunicamycin or thapsigargin, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Plasmids and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—pCMV6-Akt(K179M), encoding dominant-negative Akt(K179M) (a gift of Dr. Carlos L. Arteaga, Vanderbilt University), was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+)HA vector. The pMCL(+)HA-tagged MEK1(K97M) construct, containing dominant-negative MEK1(K97M) (a gift of Dr. Natalie Ahn, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO), was digested with KpnI and HindIII and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(-) plasmid (Invitrogen). pcDNA3.1(+)HA-Akt(K179M), pcDNA3.1(-)HA-MEK1(K97M), and empty vector transfectants were produced by sequentially transfecting MCF-7 and H1299 cells with each construct using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The stably expressing cells were selected in the presence of G418 (800 μg/ml) for 4 weeks, and the surviving clones were pooled (mass culture). The transfectants were identified by Western blotting by anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody. For each construct, three mass cultures were used for further experiments. Western Blotting and Antibodies—After treatment as indicated, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on Novex Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with each primary antibody, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The protein bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used in our study: anti-eIF2α pAb, anti-phospho-Ser51 eIF2α pAb, anti-Akt pAb, anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt pAb, anti-ERK1/2 pAb, anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 ERK1/2 pAb, anti-SAPK/JNK pAb, anti-phospho-Thr183/Tyr185 SAPK/JNK pAb, anti-p38 pAb, anti-phospho-Thr180/Tyr182 p38, anti-phospho-Ser2448 mTOR pAb, and anti-XIAP pAb (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-cIAP-2 monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Inc.); anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma); and anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance). RT-PCR—Cells were treated with the indicated reagents, and total RNA was extracted by the TRIzol® method (Invitrogen). It was subjected to RT-PCR in a two-step protocol using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase. The number of cycles and the annealing temperature were adjusted depending on the genes amplified. 2Primer sequences are available upon request. Ablation of Endogenous cIAP-2 and XIAP by RNA Interference—A 21-nucleotide siRNA duplex with 3′-dTdT overhangs corresponding to cIAP-2 mRNA (AACAGTGGATATTTCCGTGGC) (19Wen L. Zhuang L. Luo X. Wei P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39251-39258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and to XIAP mRNA (AAGTGGTAGTCCTGTTTCAGC) (20Burstein E. Ganesh L. Dick R.D. Van De Sluis B.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was synthesized (Dharmacon), and control siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. siRNA transfections were performed using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). 2 × 105 MCF-7 cells or 1 × 106 SH-SY5Y cells plated in 6-well plates were transfected twice following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) at 24-h intervals. 48 h after the second transfection, the cells were treated and used for Western blot analysis or MTT assay. MTT Assay—Cell viability was evaluated using an MTT reduction conversion assay (21Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2002; 99: 16093-16098Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 6-well plates were treated as required. Then, 100 μl of MTT at 5 mg/ml was added to each well, and incubation was continued for 2 h. The formazan crystals resulting from mitochondrial enzymatic activity on MTT substrate were solubilized with Me2SO. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Cell survival was expressed as absorbance relative to that of untreated controls. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Thapsigargin- and tunicamycin-treated MCF-7 cells were stained with MitoTracker (Molecular Probes, Inc.), washed, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. A rabbit anti-Smac pAb (IMGENEX) diluted 1:500 was used to detect the respective proteins. After washing, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added for 1 h, followed by a 5-min treatment with Hoechst 33342. As a negative control, cultures were incubated with the secondary antibody only. Fluorescence was observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope with a Zeiss F-Fluar ×40/1.3 oil immersion objective and the appropriate filter sets (Chroma Technology Corp.). Digital images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiocam and Axiovision software. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—The in situ TUNEL cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and DNA breaks were labeled by incubation (60 min, 37 °C) with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and nucleotide mixture containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dUTP. Fluorescence was observed using a fluorescence microscope as mentioned above. Subcellular Fractionation—Thapsigargin- and tunicamycin-treated MCF-7 cells were collected at the indicated time points. Cell pellets were resuspended in sucrose-supplemented cell extraction buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 mg/ml pepstatin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin). After sitting on ice for 15 min, the cells were homogenized with 15 strokes, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was further spun at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was then isolated from the pellet containing the mitochondrial fraction. The purity of the cytoplasmic fraction was assessed by confirming the absence of cytochrome c oxidase by Western blotting. Statistics—Data are given as the means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to determined the significance of differences. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Thapsigargin or Tunicamycin Induces the Unfolded Protein Response and Apoptosis—Incubation of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with the ER stressors thapsigargin and tunicamycin rapidly induced mRNA expression of two known UPR target genes, viz. the ER resident molecular chaperone BiP and the transcription factor CHOP (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α also occurred under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). Despite these adaptive responses, prolonged ER stress induced apoptosis. TUNEL staining showed that apoptosis occurred after thapsigargin or tunicamycin treatment for 18 h, and Hoechst staining showed an apoptotic phenotype with condensed nuclei (Fig. 1C). On the basis of a quantitative cell viability assay (MTT assay), ER stress induced cell death in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D) and human lung cancer H1299 cells (data not shown) in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, co-incubation of MCF-7 cells with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk significantly decreased thapsigargin-induced cell death from 48 to 29%. Similar results were obtained in tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that ER stress-induced cell death is caspase-dependent. ER Stress-induced Activation of Endogenous PI3K/Akt Is a Cell Survival Response—In addition to the UPR, it remains unclear whether cell survival mechanisms that can directly resist ER stress-activated apoptotic signals are activated in parallel by ER stress. Akt, which has been identified as a critical survival factor that can protect cells from different kinds of apoptotic stimulation (23Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar), appeared a likely candidate. To test this, extracts from thapsigargin- or tunicamycin-treated MCF-7 cells were immunoblotted with antibody specific to Akt phosphorylated at Ser473. As shown in Fig. 2A, phosphorylation activation of Akt was observed at 2 h with thapsigargin and at 4 h with tunicamycin. The activation returned to basal levels by 12 h. The activation was completely blocked by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (see Fig. 5B). These results reveal that ER stress acutely induces PI3K-mediated Akt activation.Fig. 5PI3K mediates ER stress-induced activation of ERK. A, MCF-7 cells were exposed to thapsigargin (TG; 2 μm) or tunicamycin (TU; 2 μg/ml) with Me2SO (DMSO) as a control, LY294002 (LY; 20 μm), U0126 (20 μm), and LY294002 plus U0126 for 30 h. Cell viability was scored by MTT assay. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. for three independent experiments. Cell survival is expressed as absorbance relative to that of the relevant controls, viz. Me2SO, Me2SO plus LY294002, Me2SO plus U0126, and Me2SO plus LY294002 and U0126. B, MCF-7 cells treated for 1 h with vehicle (Me2SO), LY294002 (20 μm), and U0126 (20 μm) were exposed to thapsigargin (2 μm) for the indicated times. The whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with the antibodies indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thapsigargin and tunicamycin are two pharmacologically distinct ER stress inducers. Activation of the Akt pathway by both thapsigargin and tunicamycin in MCF-7 cells demonstrated that ER stress-induced Akt activation was not restricted to one ER stressor. To further explore whether ER stress-induced Akt activation is a general event among different cells, we investigated ER stress-induced Akt activation in cells originating from different human organs. Thapsigargin or tunicamycin also acutely induced phosphorylation of Akt in human lung cancer H1299 cells (Fig. 2B) and human prostate cancer PC-3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that acute activation of the Akt pathway is a rather general cell response to ER stress. To elucidate whether activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is required to protect cells from ER stress-induced cell death, we first assessed the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. As shown by phase-contrast microscopy and a cell viability assay (MTT assay) in Fig. 2 (C and D), co-incubation with LY294002 significantly sensitized MCF-7 cells to thapsigargin- or tunicamycin-induced cell death. LY294002 treatment alone had no effect on cell viability. Similar results were obtained when the same experiments were performed with H1299 cells (Fig. 2D). To further confirm that Akt signaling is protective of cell survival during ER stress, we established MCF-7 cell pools stably expressing HA-tagged dominant-negative (DN) Akt in which a point mutation (K197M) was introduced at a site required for kinase activity. Control cells were transfected with empty vector. Stable transfectants were identified by Western blotting with an HA-specific monoclonal antibody. A cell viability assay showed that ectopic expression of DN-Akt significantly increased thapsigargin- and tunicamycin-induced cell death (Fig. 2E). Similar results were obtained in H1299 cell expressing DN-Akt (data not shown). These results provide evidence that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is a critical cell survival response to ER stress. Akt-dependent Activation of mTOR Is Not Required for Akt-mediated Survival Signaling in ER Stress—Recent research has shown that mTOR, an established Akt effector, is essential for Akt-mediated survival signaling (24Chung J. Bachelder R.E. Lipscomb E.A. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Wendel H.G. De Stanchina E. Fridman J.S. Malina A. Ray S. Kogan S. Cordon-Cardo C. Pelletier J. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2004; 428: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). There is also much evidence that mitogens and growth factors stimulate phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 (26Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar, 27Kam Y. Exton J.H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to investigate the role of mTOR in regulation of ER stress considering its critical controlling role in protein synthesis. Acute phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 was found in MCF-7 cells treated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin, which was blocked by either LY249002 or expression of DN-Akt (Fig. 3A). Next, we tested whether activated mTOR contributes to cell survival during ER stress. As shown in Fig. 3B, co-incubation of MCF-7 cells with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, did not increase ER stress-induced cell death. Our data indicate that ER stress induces phosphorylation of mTOR in an Akt-dependent manner; however, this is not involved in cell survival. ER Stress-induced Endogenous ERK Activation Protects Cells from ER Stress-induced Cell Death—In addition to the PI3K/Akt pathway, the MAPK family, comprising ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, also mediates many stress responses. Although the role of the ERK pathway in regulation of apoptosis in mammalian cells is controversial, it is well established in Drosophila that the activated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway promotes survival through phosphorylating head involution-defective protein (28Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H. Cell. 1998; 95: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The exact role of ERK in ER stress has not been characterized. Activation of ERK occurs through phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues by an upstream MAPK kinase (MEK1). To investigate the role of the MAPK family in ER stress, we first tested whether MAPK is activated upon ER stress. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was induced in MCF-7 cells after exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin. JNK was also phosphorylated, consistent with previous reports (29Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science. 2000; 287: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar, 30Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), but the phosphorylation of p38 was not induced (Fig. 4A). Confirming the activation of the ERK pathway, the MEK1 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibited thapsigargin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (see Fig. 5B). ER stress-induced activation of ERK was also observed in H1299 cells (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined whether activation of the MEK1/ERK pathway could protect cells from ER stress-induced cell death. As shown by phase-contrast microscopy and MTT assay in Fig. 4 (C and D), the MEK1 inhibitor U0126 increased thapsigargin- and tunicamycin-induced cell death in MCF-7 and H1299 cells. Treatment with U0126 alone had no effect on cell viability. To further confirm the protective role of the MEK1/ERK pathway, we generated stable MCF-7 cell pools expressing an HA-tagged DN-MEK1 mutant. Control cells were transfected with empty vector. Stable transfectants were identified by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. MTT assay showed that expression of DN-MEK1 increased thapsigargin- and tunicamycin-induced cell death (Fig. 4E). Similar results were obtained in H1299 cells expressing DN-MEK1 (data not shown). These results suggest that activation of the MEK1/ERK pathway is also a cell survival response to resist ER stress. PI3K Mediates ER Stress-induced ERK Activation—The aforementioned results demonstrated that ER stress activated both the PI3K/Akt and MEK1/ERK pathways, so it was interesting to investigate whether there is cross-talk between the two pathways. MTT assay revealed that, in MCF-7 cells, inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 resulted in more ER stress-induced cell death compared with treatment with U0126 (Fig. 5A). The effect of co-treatment with both LY294002 and U0126 on ER stress-induced cell death was similar to that with LY294002 alone (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that PI3K may be an upstream signal that activates ERK during ER stress. To explore the relationship between PI3K and ERK, MCF-7 cells were incubated with thapsigargin in the presence of LY294002, U0126, or vehicle (Me2SO). Western blotting showed that U0126 totally inhibited ERK activation, but had little or no effect on thapsigargin-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, LY294002 completely blocked Akt activation, but also significantly decreased thapsigargin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained in tunicamycin-treated cells (data not shown). These results reveal that, in MCF-7 cells, ER stress-induced activation of ERK is PI3K-dependent. ER Stress-induced Expression of cIAP-2 and XIAP Is Required for Sustaining the Survival of Cells under ER Stress— Several lines of evidence indicate that caspase activation is an important component of ER stress-induced cell death (14Nakagawa T.

https://openalex.org/W2021554725,"The delicate leaflets that make up vertebrate heart valves are essential for our moment-to-moment existence. Abnormalities of valve formation are the most common serious human congenital defect. Despite their importance, relatively little is known about valve development. We show that the initiation of heart valve morphogenesis in mice requires calcineurin/NFAT to repress VEGF expression in the myocardium underlying the site of prospective valve formation. This repression of VEGF at E9 is essential for endocardial cells to transform into mesenchymal cells. Later, at E11, a second wave of calcineurin/NFAT signaling is required in the endocardium, adjacent to the earlier myocardial site of NFAT action, to direct valvular elongation and refinement. Thus, NFAT signaling functions sequentially from myocardium to endocardium within a valvular morphogenetic field to initiate and perpetuate embryonic valve formation. This mechanism also operates in zebrafish, indicating a conserved role for calcineurin/NFAT signaling in vertebrate heart valve morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2026754734,"Dscam is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily protein required for the formation of neuronal connections in Drosophila. Through alternative splicing, Dscam potentially gives rise to 19,008 different extracellular domains linked to one of two alternative transmembrane segments, resulting in 38,016 isoforms. All isoforms share the same domain structure but contain variable amino acid sequences within three Ig domains in the extracellular region. We demonstrate that different isoforms exhibit different binding specificity. Each isoform binds to itself but does not bind or binds poorly to other isoforms. The amino acid sequences of all three variable Ig domains determine binding specificity. Even closely related isoforms sharing nearly identical amino acid sequences exhibit isoform-specific binding. We propose that this preferential homophilic binding specificity regulates interactions between cells and contributes to the formation of complex patterns of neuronal connections."
https://openalex.org/W2033154776,"Drosophila MEI-S332 and fungal Sgo1 genes are essential for sister centromere cohesion in meiosis I. We demonstrate that the related vertebrate Sgo localizes to kinetochores and is required to prevent premature sister centromere separation in mitosis, thus providing an explanation for the differential cohesion observed between the arms and the centromeres of mitotic sister chromatids. Sgo is degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex, allowing the separation of sister centromeres in anaphase. Intriguingly, we show that Sgo interacts strongly with microtubules in vitro and that it regulates kinetochore microtubule stability in vivo, consistent with a direct microtubule interaction. Sgo is thus critical for mitotic progression and chromosome segregation and provides an unexpected link between sister centromere cohesion and microtubule interactions at kinetochores."
https://openalex.org/W2157129863,"Rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mikiss) possess two genes encoding putative leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins similar to human TLR5. Molecular cloning of these two LRR proteins suggested the presence of a TLR5-like membrane form (rtTLR5M) and a soluble form (rtTLR5S). Here we elucidated the primary structures and the unique combinational functions of these fish versions of TLR5. The LRR regions of rtTLR5S and rtTLR5M exhibited 81% homology and relatively high (35.6 and 33.7%) homology to the extracellular domains of human TLR5 (huTLR5). Thus, two distinct genes encode the TLR5 orthologs in fish, one of which has a consensus intracellular domain (TIR). In order to test their functions, we constructed fusion proteins with the LRR region of rtTLR5S (S-chimera) or that of rtTLR5M and the TIR of huTLR5 (M-chimera). The S- and M-chimeras expressed in HeLa or CHO cells signaled the presence of Vibrio anguillarum flagellin, resulting in NF-κB activation. rtTLR5M was ubiquitously expressed, whereas rtTLR5S was predominantly expressed in the liver. In the hepatoma cell lines of the rainbow trout RTH-149, stimulation of rtTLR5M with V. anguillarum or its flagellin allowed the up-regulation of rtTLR5S. Flagellin-mediated NF-κB activation was more significant in the presence of or simultaneous expression of rtTLR5S. Therefore, a two-step flagellin response occurred for host defense against bacterial infection in fish: (a) flagellin first induced basal activation of NF-κB via membrane TLR5, facilitating the production of soluble TLR5 and minimal acute phase proteins, and (b) the inducible soluble TLR5 amplifies membrane TLR5-mediated cellular responses in a positive feedback fashion.

Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). The NF-κB activation pathway and type I Ifn-producing pathway are usually activated in response to microbial constituents, which is referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (2Seya T. Shingai M. Tanabe M. Matsumoto M. Rev. Med. Virol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar). TLRs are signaling receptors that engage in an innate immune recognition together with catch-up receptors (opsonin receptor, etc.). This precedes activation of the acquired immune system, including T/B lymphocytes. Although it has been believed that the innate immune system (including TLRs) is present in all vertebrates as well as invertebrates, no functional properties of the TLR have been reported in lower vertebrates. The functional feature of TLRs has been extensively investigated in human and mice. The results of these studies are generally compared with those of Drosophila, which have a Toll family of proteins with considerably different functional properties (4Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar).In humans, ten members of the TLR family (TLR1–10) have been identified (1Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar, 2Seya T. Shingai M. Tanabe M. Matsumoto M. Rev. Med. Virol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev.

All TLRs have an extracellular domain containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) flanked by a C-terminal region and a cytoplasmic signaling domain, called the Toll/IL-1 receptor homology domain (TIR) (1Medzhitov R.

Each TLR recognizes a distinct ligand(s) and elicits different, sometimes overlapping, immune responses (2Seya T. Shingai M. Tanabe M. Matsumoto M. Rev. Med. Virol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6586) Google Scholar). A variety of immune responses are induced through TLRs in dendritic cells (DCs) (1Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar, 2Seya T. Shingai M. Tanabe M. Matsumoto M. Rev. Med. Virol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), which are major antigen-presenting cells that first encounter foreign material to mount its antigens for presentation to lymphocytes. The activation of DCs is differentially regulated by TLRs and the adaptors that bind the TIR domain of TLRs, selecting appropriate signal pathways and resulting output (2Seya T. Shingai M. Tanabe M.

Tsujita T. Shida K. Matsumoto M. Ikeo K. Seya T. Immunogenetics. 2003; 54: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Three major differences were identified in the family of the Fugu Toll-like receptors (fgTLR) when compared with human TLRs (6Oshiumi H. Tsujita T. Shida K. Matsumoto M. Ikeo K. Seya T. Immunogenetics. 2003; 54: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar): 1) There is a soluble form of the TLR5 ortholog in the fish but not in humans. 2) No TLR4 ortholog has been identified in the fish, and 3) TLRs named TLR21 and TLR22 are novel and specific to fish. fgTLR2, -3, -5, -7, -8, and -9 structurally correspond to those of mammalian TLRs. A possible interpretation is that TLR1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -7, -8, -9, -21, and -22 existed in both fish and mammals, in a common ancestral genome. TLR4 was lost in the fish lineage whereas TLR21 and 22 were lost in the mammalian lineage. Solitary ascidian (Ciona intestinalis) has only three putative Toll-like proteins (7Azumi K. De Santis R.

Drosophila has nine Tolls, and their functional properties were mostly related to body patterning as well as host defense (9Imler J.L. Hoffmann J.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 304-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that the development of TLR genes is earlier than that of fish, but not of the ascidian, separate from mammals. The results of various investigations including ours conclude that the mammalian innate system was established preceding or concomitant with the assembling of the acquired immunity. This reflects selection pressure exerted by pathogens under distinct environments.Rainbow trout has two TLR5 isoforms, membrane (TLR5M) and soluble (TLR5S) forms (10Tsukada H. Oshiumi H. Fukui A. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Jpn. Soc. Mol. Biol. 2001; 16 (abstr.): 102Google Scholar) similar to fgTLR5S (6Oshiumi H. Tsujita T. Shida K. Matsumoto M. Ikeo K. Seya T. Immunogenetics. 2003; 54: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These two forms of TLR5 recognized Vibrio anguillarum flagellin. Here, we studied the TLR5-mediated immune response in the rainbow trout. A possible role for this unique flagellin recognition system of fish is discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Reagents—Cells were cultured in a medium containing 5–10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and antibiotics (100 unit/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). RTH-149 and RTG-2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimal Eagle's medium (MEM, Nissui, Tokyo, Japan), 0.1 mm MEM non-essential amino acid solution, and 1 mm MEM sodium pyruvate solution. Cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells (Japanese Cell Resource Bank, Osaka, Japan) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) (Japanese Cell Resource Bank) cells were cultured in Ham's F12 medium (Nissui). Sf21 cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Sf900 II SFM (Invitrogen).Escherichia coli DH5α was purchased from Invitrogen. V. anguillarum was a gift from Dr. Takaji Iida (National Research Institute of Aquaculture, Fisheries Research Agency, Mie, Japan). LPS was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Poly(I·C) was from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). MALP-2 was synthesized in Biologica (Nagoya, Japan) (11Nishiguchi M. Matsumoto M. Takao T. Hoshino M. Shimonishi Y. Tsuji S. Begum N.A. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Toyoshima K. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2610-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan (PGN) was purified from Staphylococcus aureus. Polymyxin B was obtained from Sigma. All nucleotide primers and oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing CpG motifs (CpG-ODN) were synthesized at Hokkaido System Sciences (Sapporo, Japan).Molecular Cloning of a Soluble Form of rtTLR5 (rtTLR5S)—The EST clone that contains the leucine-rich repeat (AF281346) from rainbow trout exposed to V. anguillarum was cloned in our laboratory (12Bayne C.J. Gerwick L. Fujiki K. Nakao M. Yano T. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2001; 25: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Full-length rtTLR5S cDNA was cloned using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences). For this, PCR was performed with liver cDNA templates and rtTLR5S gene-specific internal primers (for 5′-RACE: S-GSP/F and S-NGSP/F, for 3′-RACE: S-GSP/R) (Table I) paired with either the Primer 1 (P1)- or the P2-specific end primers (BD Biosciences). The PCR products were ligated directly into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and several independent transformants were subjected to DNA sequencing using ABI 3100 sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for assessing sequence accuracy. Full-length rtTLR5S cDNA was obtained from the liver cDNA library by RT-PCR using primers SF and SR (Table I).

Immunogenetics. 2003; 54: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The sequences were aligned using ClustalW (clustalw.genome.ad.jp/) (Fig. 1A). First-strand cDNAs were reverse-transcribed from random-primed RNA templates prepared from rainbow trout liver using H-MLV(–) reverse transcriptase (Promega). Second, an rtTLR5M full-length sequence was obtained using the Marathon RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences). Liver cDNA templates and rtTLR5M gene-specific internal primers (for 5′-RACE: MGSPF and MNGSPF, for 3′-RACE: MNGSPR and MNGSPRF) (Table I) paired with either the adaptor primer 1 (AP1)- or the AP2-specific end primers (BD Biosciences) were used. The PCR products were ligated directly into the pGEM-T Easy Vector, and several independent transformants were subjected to DNA sequencing as described above. Finally, full-length rtTLR5M cDNA was obtained from liver cDNA by RT-PCR using primers MF and MR (Table I). The cDNA encoding rtTLR5M with deleted signal sequences was placed between the SalI-NotI sites of the pFLAG-CMV plasmid.Southern Blotting—10 μg of genomic DNA extracted from rainbow trout liver was digested with various restriction endonucleases and separated on a 1.0% agarose gel by a standard electrophoretic separation method (15Sambrook H. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). DNA was transferred from the agarose gel onto nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR-amplified probes S and M (Fig. 2A) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a MegaPrime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed in ExpressHyb Solution (BD Biosciences) for 1 h. After hybridization, blots were washed three times in 2× SSC containing 0.05% SDS at 24 °C for 20 min followed by two washes in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min. The blots were subjected to an imaging plate and analyzed using the FLA imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).Fig. 2Gene characterization of rtTLR5M and rtTLR5S.

The purified RNA samples were used as templates for reverse transcription reactions. PCR was performed with primers specific for each type of rtTLR5, rtIL-1β, rtTNF-α, and rt-β-actin under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 25∼ 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The primer sequences used for RT-PCR are shown in Table II.

The gene sequences for rainbow trout (rt), IL-1β (AJ004821), TNF-α (AJ277604), and β-actin (AJ438158) were obtained from the NCBI.Recombinant Flagellin Production—Genomic DNA of V. anguillarum was isolated by the method of Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook H. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). To fuse flaA (AAB06995) and flaC (U52119) in-frame with GST, we amplified the coding region from genomic DNA. Primers were used to clone flaA (5′-CCGGATCCATGACCATTACAGTAAATACTAACGTCTCAGCAATG-3′/5′-ATCCCGGGTTACTGCAATAGTGACATTGCAGAATTTGGCAACTG-3′), and flaC (5′-CCGGATCCATGGCGGTTAATGTAAACACTAACGTTTCAGC-3′/5′-CCGAATTCTTAACCAAGCAAACCAAGAGCAGCATTAGG-3′). Resultant PCR products were first cloned into the PCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) and secondly cloned to the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) at the BamHI and SmaI sites (flaA) and BamHI and EcoRI sites (flaC), and designated pGEX2T/FlaA and pGEX2T/FlaC. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE cells were transformed with pGEX2T/FlaA or pGEX2T/FlaC, and GST-tagged flagellin A (GST-FlaA) and flagellin C (GST-FlaC) were purified from the solubilized cells using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified GST-FlaA and GST-FlaC were digested with thrombin according to the manufacturer's recommendation and designated as recombinant flagellin A (rFlaA) and flagellin C (rFlaC). Purity of the products was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar).Stimulation of RTH-149 and RTG-2 Cells by Flagellin or Dead Bacteria—RTH-149 and RTG-2 cells were plated in a 6-cm dish plate, and the medium was changed every 2 days. Cells (1 × 107 cell) were stimulated with freeze-thaw V. anguillarum (10 colony-forming units) or rFlaA (1 μg/ml). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCR was performed as mentioned above. The PCR products were separated in a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Quantitative PCR was performed with iQ SYBER Green Supermix, and amplified PCR products were measured by iCycler iQ real-time PCR analyzing system (Bio-Rad).Constructs for Reporter Assay—The S-chimera was constructed by fusing cDNAs encoding the FLAG-tagged extracellular domain of rtTLR5S (amino acids 29–597) to the C-terminal flanking region, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of huTLR5 (amino acids 574–858). The construct was cloned into the pEFBOS expression vector (17Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). The M-chimera was constructed to fuse the FLAG-tagged extracellular domain of rtTLR5M (amino acids 21–596) to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of huTLR5 (amino acids 574–858). Full-length huTLR5 was obtained from human monocyte cDNA by RT-PCR using primers hu5F and hu5R (Table I). The cDNA of huTLR5 was placed in the pEFBOS plasmid. The promoter region of human E-selectin (ELAM) (–241 to –54) was ligated between KpnI-HindIII sites of pGV-E2 (Toyo Inc., Tokyo, Japan). This plasmid (designated pELAM-luc) was used as a reporter for NF-κB activation. phRL-TK vector (Promega) was used as an internal control.Reporter Gene Assay for NF-κB Promoter—HeLa or CHO cells were plated in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cell per well), and incubated for 12 h. Then they were transiently transfected with pEFBOS for expression of S-chimera, M-chimera, huTLR5 (100 ng), or vector alone (control), together with a pELAM-luc reporter gene (100 ng) (10Tsukada H. Oshiumi H. Fukui A. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Jpn. Soc. Mol. Biol. 2001; 16 (abstr.): 102Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The total amount of transfected DNA (400 ng) was adjusted by adding empty vector. 0.1 ng of phRL-TK was used as an internal control. The cells were cultured for 36 h after transfection. Where indicated, the effect of exogenously added rtTLR5S on NF-κB promoter activity in the M-chimera-expressing cells was determined. That is, 24 h after transfection with M-chimera, culture media in the M-chimera-expressing cells were replaced with the medium from CHO or HeLa cells, which were transiently transfected with pEFBOS/rtTLR5S cDNA (1, 10, 100 ng) and cultured for 12 h. Then the cells were treated with rFlaA (0.01, 0.1, 1 μg/ml), LPS (0.1 μg/ml), PGN (10 μg/ml), poly(I·C) (2 μg/ml), or CpG-ODN (2 μm) at 37 °C for 5 h. In some experiments, recombinant rtTLR5S (1, 10, 100 ng/ml) were directly added to the medium of M-chimera-expressing cells 12 h before rFlaA stimulation. The cells were stimulated with rFlaA for 5 h. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured with the reagents and protocols from the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Promega) using a luminometer (BLR-201, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Specific activity was calculated from light intensity measurements with a Renilla luciferase internal control. Values were expressed as mean relative stimulation with S.D. from triplicate values from a minimum of three separate experiments.Recombinant rtTLR5S by Baculovirus—Recombinant rtTLR5S was produced with Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). In brief, the full-length rtTLR5S with the His6 tag at the C-terminal end was constructed using PCR. The cDNA was placed between the SalI and NotI sites of the pFastBac1 plasmid, which was designated pFast-Bac1/rtTLR5S. To generate the Bacmid DNA encoding rtTLR5S with the His6 tag, E. coli DH10Bac cells were transformed with pFastBac1/rtTLR5S using transposition activity in the cell. The bacmid DNA was obtained by the standard method from cells and transferred to Sf21 cells by UniFECTOR (B-Bridge International, San Jose, CA) to generate the recombinant viruses. The recombinant viruses were used to infect a monolayer of Sf21 cells in serum-free medium at a multiplicity of 5. After a 3-day culture, the rtTLR5S protein was purified from the medium using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) and Mono Q ion exchange columns (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were identified by immunoblotting using anti-His6 tag antibody. With this procedure, 5 μg of rtTLR5S were obtained from 500 ml of culture medium.Evaluation of Flagellin-rtTLR5S Association—The binding efficacy of His6-labeled rtTLR5S to GST-FlaA was determined by GST pull-down assay. Briefly, 20 ng of rtTLR5S and indicated amounts (0–5 μg) of GST or GST-FlaA in 300 μl of PBS (pH 8.0) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 2 h with gentle shaking. Glutathione-Sepharose was harvested by centrifugation and washed four times with PBS. The protein was eluted from Sepharose with 10 mm glutathione in PBS. The eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by immunoblotting using anti-His6 antibody (0.2 μg/ml). Proteins were developed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG second antibody (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) and an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSIdentification of TLR5-like Sequences from the Rainbow Trout—Based on an EST sequence obtained from rainbow trout infected with V. anguillarum (AF281346), we cloned a cDNA by 3′- and 5′-RACE that predicted the existence of LRR-containing proteins. A motif search, Kyte and Doolittle plot, and ClustalW comparison suggested that the amino acid sequence corresponds to the extracellular LRR domains of human TLR5 and surprisingly contained no transmembrane region or TIR domain (Fig. 1B). SMART analysis defined ten LRRs in this protein (Fig. 1C). Based on these results, we designated this putative protein of rainbow trout soluble TLR5 (rtTLR5S).To identify the membrane form of TLR5 in rainbow trout, degenerate primers were designed according to the conserved sequences among the TIR domains of human, mouse, and fgTLR5 (Fig. 1A). PCR using degenerate primers (Fig. 1A) followed by the RACE method allowed us to clone additional TLR5-like cDNA. Homology search analysis suggested that this is an ortholog of human TLR5, which contained putative signal peptides, 11 LRRs (including the LRR C-terminal flanking region), and the TIR domain (Fig. 1, B and C). The complete sequences of these two rainbow trout (rt) TLR5 are shown in Fig. 1B.We have cloned seven independent RT-PCR products of rtTLR5S using mRNA and SF and SR primers (Table I). The collective sequence consisted of a 1,992-bp open reading frame (ORF) and a 1,168-bp 3′-UTR. Three polyadenylation signals were found in the 3′-UTR, the last of which was followed by the poly(A) tail. The predicted amino acid sequence of this cDNA is 664 amino acids (Fig. 1). rtTLR5S was 35.6 and 37.1% homologous to the extracellular domains of human and mouse TLR5, respectively (10Tsukada H. Oshiumi H. Fukui A. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Jpn. Soc. Mol. Biol. 2001; 16 (abstr.): 102Google Scholar). rtTLR5S showed <25% homology to that of other human or mouse TLRs. Nine of the eleven cysteines in the extracellular domains of mo/huTLR5 were conserved in rtTLR5S (Fig. 1B).We have cloned four independent RT-PCR products for rtTLR5M using MF and MR primers (Table I). The collective deduced sequence consisted of a 2,637-bp ORF and 544-bp 3′-UTR. The polyadenylation site in the 3′-UTR was followed by the poly(A) tail. The predicted amino acid sequence of this cDNA is 879 amino acids (Fig. 1B). rtTLR5M was 40.1, 40.5, and 48.5% homologous to hu/mo/fgTLR5, respectively. rtTLR5M is <25% homologous to that of other hu/mo/fgTLRs. Ten cysteines found in the extracellular domains of mouse and human TLR5 were conserved in rtTLR5M (Fig. 1B).The LRR regions of rtTLR5M and rtTLR5S exhibited 81.0% homology. Several tissues were tested for rtTLR5M- and rtTLR5S-specific messages using the specific primer sets shown in Table I (Fig. 1D). rtTLR5M was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues whereas rtTLR5S was predominantly present in liver. The presence of the soluble form of TLR5 is surprising since no such TLR5 has been reported either in human and mouse.Gene and Southern Analysis of rtTLR5s—Sequence analysis of the rtTL"

It is now recognized that reperfusion per se contributes to myocardial damage, and there is a great interest in identifying the molecular basis of this damage. We recently showed that inhibiting protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) protects the heart from ischemia and reperfusion-induced damage. Here, we demonstrate that PKCδ activity and mitochondrial translocation at the onset of reperfusion mediates apoptosis by facilitating the accumulation and dephosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic BAD (Bcl-2-associated death promoter), dephosphorylation of Akt, cytochrome c release, PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) cleavage, and DNA laddering. Our data suggest that PKCδ activation has a critical proapoptotic role in cardiac responses following ischemia and reperfusion.

Our data suggest that PKCδ activation has a critical proapoptotic role in cardiac responses following ischemia and reperfusion. Reperfusion after coronary occlusion is one of the leading causes of cardiac injury and cell death (1Yellon D.M. Baxter G.F. Heart. 2000; 83: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A variety of signaling pathways participate in myocardial responses to ischemia and reperfusion and the damage that occurs involves both necrotic and apoptotic cell death (2Anversa P. Cheng W. Liu Y.

However, how these receptors, kinases, and other enzymes influence apoptosis caused by ischemia and reperfusion injury is still under investigation. One family of proteins that has been shown to mediate ischemia and reperfusion damage is PKC. Since PKC was first identified in 1977 (25Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Inoue M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7603-7609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKC activity has been shown to affect numerous signal transduction processes including differentiation, tumor progression, proliferation, secretion, as well as apoptosis (3Clerk A.

Recent evidence indicates that PKCδ, but not PKCϵ, also participates in reperfusion injury. Delivery of the PKCδ-selective inhibitor peptide, δV1-1, to hearts ex vivo or in vivo (30Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Inagaki K. Chen L. Ikeno F. Lee F.H. Imahashi K. Bouley D.M. Rezaee M. Yock P.G. Murphy E. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2304-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) during the onset of reperfusion was cardioprotective. In contrast, delivery of ψϵRACK peptide to activate PKCϵ translocation during reperfusion had no cardioprotective effect (30Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that activation of PKCδ during reperfusion mediates cardiac damage. However, questions remain regarding the molecular basis of the damage that occurs to the heart in response to PKCδ activity. Many studies suggest a role for PKCδ in apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 34Brodie C. Blumberg P.M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In both LNCaP prostate cancer cells and CaCo-2 human colon-cancer cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced translocation of overexpressed PKCδ results in apoptosis (35Cerda S.R. Bissonnette M.

In addition, PKCδ-induced apoptosis occurs in response both to UV as well as etoposide-induced damage (37Chen N. Ma W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol.

PKCδ translocates to the mitochondria, resulting in the release of cytochrome c, in response to various pro-apoptotic stimuli (39Matassa A.A. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Humphries M.J. Reyland M.E. J.

Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 465-470PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the pro-apoptotic activity of PKCδ may mediate mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we provide evidence that PKCδ translocation to the mitochondria during reperfusion plays a key role in the regulation of the mitochondrial involvement in the signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and cell death. Male Wistar rats (250–300 g) were heparinized (2000 units/kg intraperitoneally) and then anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The hearts were rapidly excised and then perfused with an oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing (in mmol/liter) NaCl 120, KCl 5.8, NaHCO3 25, NaH2PO4 1.2, MgSO4 1.2, CaCl2 1.0, and dextrose 10, pH 7.4, at 37 °C in a Langendorff coronary perfusion system as previously described (30Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The hearts were perfused with a constant coronary flow rate of 10 ml/min throughout the experiment. After a 10-min equilibration, perfusion was stopped for 30 min to induce global ischemia, during which time the hearts were immersed into a 37 °C heated bath of Krebs-Henseleit buffer. After the ischemic period, the flow was restored; and reperfusion commenced for 15, 30, 60, or 120 min with or without 500 nm δV1-1 (29Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11114-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), conjugated to the cell permeable peptide, Tat (amino acids 47–57, Tat-δV1-1 for short) (42Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), for the first 15 min of reperfusion. In studies reported in Fig. 5B, reperfusion was studied for up to 240 min. Following reperfusion, the hearts were removed from the apparatus and homogenized for mitochondria isolation, sliced into sections, or snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen, stored at –70 °C, and subsequently used for protein analysis. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Stanford University and the Case Western Reserve University. Immediately following each experimental protocol, the hearts were immersed and rinsed in ice-cold homogenization buffer A (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 5.0 mm MOPS at pH 7.4). Hearts (0.9–1.2 g) were minced and homogenized in 20 ml of homogenization buffer/g of tissue using a polytron homogenizer (low setting, 2 s, three times) as previously described (43Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 44Lucas D.T. Szweda L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6689-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min (5 °C). The resulting supernatant was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min (5 °C) to obtain the mitochondrial pellet and the cytosolic extract (supernatant). The mitochondrial pellet was rinsed and resuspended in buffer A at a final concentration of ∼20 mg/ml. Protein determinations were carried out using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mitochondria and cytosolic extracts were stored at –70 °C. Detection of PKCδ and cytochrome c—PKCδ levels were assessed using 30 μg of mitochondrial protein/lane resolved by 4–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Proteins from cytosolic extracts were resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, the membranes were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). The membranes were then blocked for 30 min in PBST with 5.0% milk and probed with polyclonal anti-PKCδ (Cell Signaling Technology), cytochrome c, adenine nucleotide translocase (obtained from Dr. Schmidt, Hormel Institute), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon International) antibodies, followed by secondary anti-IgG rabbit antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase (Tropix). Protein bands were visualized using the CSPD system (Tropix). Densitometry was performed using the NIH ImageJ software program (available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) to assess the relative mitochondrial and cytosolic content of PKCδ and cytochrome c, respectively. Tissue fractionation—Frozen heart tissues were thawed on ice in homogenization buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose). The tissues were then minced and ground by pestle in the presence of molecular grinding resin (Geno Technology) to produce homogenates. The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min (4 °C) to separate the cytosolic soluble fraction from membranous proteins. After the soluble fractions were isolated, the pellets were then rehomogenized in buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 30 min, and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min (4 °C). The Triton-soluble particulate fraction was isolated, and the protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. For PKCδ translocation, ∼5 μg of soluble and particulate fractions were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, the blots were blocked with a 5% milk solution in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and probed with polyclonal anti-PKCδ (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-PKCα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies followed by secondary anti-IgG rabbit antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized using ECL and quantitated using NIH ImageJ software. To produce total cell lysates, frozen heart tissues were thawed on ice in homogenization buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100. The tissues were then minced and ground by pestle in the presence of molecular grinding resin (Geno Technology), and the homogenates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min (4 °C) to pellet detergent-insoluble debris. Approximately 30 μg of protein was resolved by 8–12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, the nitrocellulose blots were blocked with a 5% milk solution in TBST. The blots were then probed with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against BAD, phospho-BAD (Ser136), Bax, Bcl-xL proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), caspase 3, and PARP proteins (Cell Signaling Biotechnology) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against Bcl-2 (Stressgen Biotechnologies). Primary antibodies were followed by corresponding secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase. The protein bands were visualized and quantitated as previously described. To assess PKCδ and mitochondria co-localization, rat heart sections were immediately frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek), and 5-micron-thick sections were then cut on a cryostat (Stanford Histology Research Core Laboratory) and mounted on glass slides. The sections were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min. Following fixation, the heart sections were incubated with 150 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 15 min in PBS, washed with PBS, and incubated with blocking buffer C (1% normal donkey serum in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h. The sections were then incubated with polyclonal anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in buffer C for 3 h at room temperature and subsequently with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary (Molecular Probes) in buffer C for 1 h at room temperature. The slices were then washed with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and dried for 15 min at room temperature, and the coverslips (Corning) were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence images of mitochondria (MitoTracker) and PKCδ (fluorescein isothiocyanate) were obtained using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Pascal, Zeiss) with a 63× water objective (1.2 numerical aperture). The slides were imaged on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100 m) using the 568-nm laser line for the red label and the 488-nm line for green. Emission was collected through a 585-nm-long pass filter for the red label, and a 505–550-nm band pass filter for the green. Image analysis was performed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). TUNEL Staining—To observe the incidence of apoptosis in damaged tissue, we subjected isolated perfused rat hearts to 30-min of ischemia and then 60 min of reperfusion. Tat-δV1-1 was perfused during the first 15 min of reperfusion. The rat hearts were immediately frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek) after ischemia/reperfusion, and 5-μm-thick sections were then cut on a cryostat. The sections were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and blocked with 1% normal donkey serum. The sections were first incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-α-actinin antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with goat anti-mouse conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate for distinction between cardiomyocytes and other cells in the myocardium. Thereafter, terminal deoxynucleotidyl TUNEL staining was performed for detection of apoptotic cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science) and counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Tissues samples from normoxic control hearts were used as negative control. The tissues were imaged using fluorescent microscopy. TUNEL-positive nuclei were counted in a total of 1,500 myocytes over several random fields and expressed as percentages of the total number of nuclei. DNA Laddering—To observe the appearance of DNA laddering, ∼100 mg of ex vivo rat heart tissue following ischemia and reperfusion was lysed and DNA extracted as described (45Pozzi S. Malferrari G. Biunno I. Samaja M. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 12: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 20 μg of DNA was resolved on a 1.8% agose gel subsequently stained with SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain per the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes) and visualized by UV transillumination using the ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). The gel shown represents two independent experiments. The results represent the means ± standard deviation of four to five independent experiments (unless otherwise noted). The values are from a two-tailed t test where p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. δV1-1 Inhibits PKCδ Translocation during Reperfusion—We reported that inhibiting PKCδ activity during reperfusion after ischemia, using Tat-δV1-1 (δV1-1), improved myocardial cell survival both ex vivo as well as in vivo (30Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Inagaki K. Chen L. Ikeno F. Lee F.H. Imahashi K. Bouley D.M. Rezaee M. Yock P.G. Murphy E. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2304-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To identify the molecular events affected by inhibiting PKCδ activation during ischemia and reperfusion, we first confirmed previous observations (28Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30945-30951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 29Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11114-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) that PKCδ translocates from the cell soluble to the cell particulate fraction in response to ischemia (Fig. 1B, I30versus N). However, we observed that significant increases in PKCδ translocation occur during reperfusion (Fig. 1B, I30versus I30/R60). Delivering 500 nm of δV1-1 at the onset of reperfusion resulted in a significant decrease in PKCδ translocation, whereas delivering the Tat carrier alone had no effect (data not shown). The δV1-1 effect was specific for PKCδ, because treatment with δV1-1 did not affect αPKC (Fig. 1C). Therefore, reperfusion-induced PKCδ translocation in this rat Langendorff preparation is inhibited with δV1-1 administration during the initiation of reperfusion. δV1-1 Inhibits Reperfusion-induced PKCδ Translocation to Mitochondria and Cytochrome c Release—In cultured myeloid leukemia, muscle, and liver cells, PKCδ was shown to translocate to mitochondria upon insulin, H2O2, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment (40Majumder P.K.

Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45088-45097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether our observed increased translocation of PKCδ to the particulate fraction is due, at least in part, to its translocation to the mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 2A, ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion induced a 2-fold increase in the level of PKCδ in the mitochondrial fraction over values observed for perfused normoxic controls. No significant alteration in the level of PKCδ in the mitochondrial fraction was observed during ischemia alone. Although PKCδ was observed in the mitochondrial fraction from perfused control hearts, the level was not dependent on the duration of the perfusion period (data not shown). Importantly, when hearts were treated during the first 15 min of reperfusion with δV1-1, no reperfusion-induced increase in mitochondrial PKCδ levels was observed. In addition, the Tat carrier peptide alone did not inhibit PKCδ translocation to the mitochondria (not shown). The purity of the mitochondrial fraction and equal protein loading were confirmed by probing both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions for the mitochondrial protein adenine nucleotide translocase and the cytosolic marker glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Therefore, PKCδ translocation to the mitochondria during reperfusion appears to be specific. To further establish whether PKCδ and mitochondria colocalized in tissue, we labeled fixed heart tissue sections from each condition with the mitochondrial-selective dye Mito-Tracker CMXRos (red) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody against primary anti-PKCδ (green) (Fig. 3). Using confocal laser fluorescence microscopy, we observed a dramatic increase in the distribution of co-localized PKCδ and mitochondria (yellow) in hearts reperfused after global ischemia (Fig. 3C), whereas very little co-localization was evident in normoxic (Fig. 3A) and ischemic hearts (Fig. 3B). Importantly, and correlating with our fractionation studies studies (Fig. 2), when we inhibited PKCδ translocation at the beginning of reperfusion using δV1-1, the co-localization of PKCδ with mitochondria was greatly inhibited (Fig. 3D). Western blot analysis also revealed a significant increase in the cytosolic content of cytochrome c during reperfusion (Fig. 2B), concurrent with PKCδ translocation to mitochondria (Fig. 2A). This increase in cytosolic cytochrome c was blocked by the addition of δV1-1 at the onset of reperfusion (Fig. 2B), whereas the Tat carrier alone had no effect (not shown). Probably because of mechanic disruption of the mitochondria during isolation, a significant level of cytochrome c is present in cytosolic extracts prepared from perfused normoxic control hearts (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, the increase during reperfusion appears specific, given that it is dependent on PKCδ translocation, and the mitochondrial protein adenine nucleotide translocase does not appear in the cytosolic fraction under any of the experimental conditions (Fig. 2C). δPKC Inhibition during Reperfusion Decreases Caspase 3 and PARP Cleavage and DNA Fragmentation—Release of cytochrome c from the mitochondri"
https://openalex.org/W1966104725,"It is widely believed that synaptic modifications underlie learning and memory. However, few studies have examined what can be deduced about the learning process from the distribution of synaptic weights. We analyze the perceptron, a prototypical feedforward neural network, and obtain the optimal synaptic weight distribution for a perceptron with excitatory synapses. It contains more than 50% silent synapses, and this fraction increases with storage reliability: silent synapses are therefore a necessary byproduct of optimizing learning and reliability. Exploiting the classical analogy between the perceptron and the cerebellar Purkinje cell, we fitted the optimal weight distribution to that measured for granule cell-Purkinje cell synapses. The two distributions agreed well, suggesting that the Purkinje cell can learn up to 5 kilobytes of information, in the form of 40,000 input-output associations."
https://openalex.org/W1999786030,"The Rab5 GTPase, an essential regulator of endocytosis and endosome biogenesis, is activated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that contain a Vps9 domain. Here, we show that the catalytic core of the Rab GEF Rabex-5 has a tandem architecture consisting of a Vps9 domain stabilized by an indispensable helical bundle. A family-wide analysis of Rab specificity demonstrates high selectivity for Rab5 subfamily GTPases. Conserved exchange determinants map to a common surface of the Vps9 domain, which recognizes invariant aromatic residues in the switch regions of Rab GTPases and selects for the Rab5 subfamily by requiring a small nonacidic residue preceding a critical phenylalanine in the switch I region. These and other observations reveal unexpected similarity with the Arf exchange site in the Sec7 domain."
https://openalex.org/W2026593005,"The last biosynthetic step for 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyl-adenosine (ms2i6A), present at position 37 in some tRNAs, consists of the methylthiolation of the isopentenyl-adenosine (i6A) precursor.

We show that a synthetic i6A-containing RNA corresponding to the anticodon stem loop of tRNAPhe is also a substrate. This study demonstrates that MiaB protein is a bifunctional system, involved in both thiolation and methylation of i6A. In this process, one molecule of AdoMet is converted to 5′-deoxyadenosine, probably through reductive cleavage and intermediate formation ofa5′-deoxyadenosyl radical as observed in other “Radical-AdoMet” enzymes, and a second molecule of AdoMet is used as a methyl donor as shown by labeling experiments.

The origin of the sulfur atom is discussed. In all organisms, the nucleosides of transfer RNA (tRNA) undergo different post-transcriptional modifications that are important for their biological activity (1Agris P.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 79-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These modifications are part of the complex process of tRNA maturation and are introduced through the action of many different enzymes on the polynucleotide transcripts (2Björk G.R. Söll D. Rajbhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 165-205Google Scholar). Although modified bases are found at different positions in tRNA, the anticodon loop is the most heavily modified region of the molecule and contains the greatest variety of modified nucleosides. To date, a total of 86 structurally distinguishable modified nucleosides in tRNA from many diverse organisms of the three major phylogenetic domains of life have been identified (medstat.med.utah.edu/RNAmods/). Among these modified nucleosides, the so-called thionucleosides containing a sulfur atom have been the subject of particular attention in the recent years. In Escherichia coli four different thiolated nucleosides have been characterized; these are 4-thiouridine (s4U), 1The abbreviations used are: s4U, 4-thiouridine; s2C, 2-thiocytidine; mnm5s2U, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine; i6A-37, the modified nucleoside N6-isopentenyl adenosine at position 37; i6A-37-tRNA, tRNA purified from E. coli miaB– strain overexpressing tRNAPhe; ms2i6A-37, the modified nucleoside 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyl adenosine at position 37; mse2i6A-37, the modified nucleoside 2-methylseleno-N6-isopentenyl adenosine at position 37; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; Fe-S iron-sulfur cluster; AdoH, 5′-deoxyadenosine; Fe-Se iron-selenium cluster; DTT dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 2-thiocytidine (s2C), 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U), and 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyl-adenosine (ms2i6A). If the synthesis of thiopyrimidines involves a non-redox substitution reaction of an oxygen atom by sulfur, the reaction leading to the synthesis of 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyl-adenosine (ms2i6A) consists of a chemically highly challenging aromatic C-H to C-S bond conversion. This is an oxidation reaction whose mechanism has yet to be investigated. The modified nucleoside ms2i6A is found at position 37, next to the anticodon on the 3′-position in almost all eukaryotic and bacterial tRNAs that read codons beginning with U except tRNAI,V Ser (3Grosjean H. Nicoghosian K. Haumont E. Soll D. Cedergren R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5697-5706Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Initial studies on ms2i6A biosynthesis in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium established a requirement for at least two enzymes (4Esberg B. Leung H.C. Tsui H.C. Bjork G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first step consists in the addition of the isopentenyl group to the N6 nitrogen of adenosine. This reaction is catalyzed by the well characterized tRNA-isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase enzyme, encoded by the miaA gene (5Moore J.A. Poulter C.D.

The second step, which has been shown by in vivo studies to be dependent on iron, cysteine, and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), corresponds to the sulfur insertion and the methylation at position 2 of the base moiety (7Gefter M.L.

Recently MiaB was shown to be involved at least in the thiolation step on the basis that tRNA from mutant strains lacking a functional miaB gene contain only i6A-37, the product of MiaA activity (4Esberg B. Leung H.C. Tsui H.C. Bjork G.R. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7256-7265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning the methylation of the sulfur atom, it was postulated that it could require an additional gene named miaC, which has never been identified. Nothing is known about the mechanism by which MiaB catalyzes the reaction. However, the presence of a strictly conserved canonical cysteine triad Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys (Xaa, any amino acid) in the sequence has led to the identification of MiaB as a member of the recently characterized “Radical-AdoMet” family (10Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) such as the anaerobic ribo-nucleotide reductase-activating enzyme (ARR-AE), pyruvate formate lyase-AE (PFL-AE), lysine aminomutase (LAM), biotin synthase (BioB), and lipoate synthase (LipA) (11Fontecave M.

In the case of BioB enzyme, which also catalyzes C-H to C-S bond conversion reactions, this motif was shown to provide cysteine ligands for a catalytically essential [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster (16Berkovitch F. Nicolet Y. Wan J.T. Jarrett J.T. Drennan C.L. Science. 2004; 303: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Such a cluster is present also in MiaB protein (17Pierrel F. Bjork G.R. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Pierrel F. Hernandez H.L. Johnson M.K. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29515-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it is thus very likely that MiaB and BioB employ similar radical mechanisms for activation of sulfur and its insertion into their respective substrates. Recently, we cloned, expressed, and characterized by biochemical and spectroscopic methods the MiaB protein from Thermotoga maritima called MiaBTm (18Pierrel F. Hernandez H.L. Johnson M.K. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29515-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein is able to assemble an O2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster, which can enjoy both 2+ (oxidized) and 1+ (reduced) redox states. We also showed that a plasmid encoding MiaBTm was able to restore, in vivo, the ms2i6A biosynthesis in an E. coli miaB– strain. Here we report for the first time an in vitro assay for MiaBTm-dependent introduction of a methylthio group and formation of ms2i6A into an i6A-tRNA substrate. Labeling experiments show that AdoMet is the source of the methyl group and evidence is also presented for reductive cleavage of AdoMet into 5′-deoxyadenosine (AdoH). MiaB is thus a complex bifunctional enzyme responsible for both sulfur and methyl insertion, and it uses AdoMet both for substrate radical activation and as a methyl donor. Strains—E. coli DH5α was used for routine DNA manipulations. E. coli BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL™ (Stratagene), which contains extra copies of genes encoding tRNA with codons rarely used in E. coli (argU, ileY, leuW tRNA genes) was used to produce the recombinant protein MiaBTm. E. coli strain TX3346 miaB- was a gift of Professor Malcolm E. Winkler, University of Texas, Houston. The pTrc99-B plasmid was a gift of Dr. G. Eriani, Strasbourg. General Procedures—All DNA manipulations were as described previously (19Tabor S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Enzymes, oligonucleotides, and culture media were purchased from Invitrogen Cergy-Pontoise, France. T4 DNA ligase was from MBI Fermentas Inc. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase and plasmid DNA purification kit, Flexiprep™, were from Amersham Biosciences. DNA fragments were extracted from agarose gel and purified with High Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche Applied Science), DNA sequencing was performed by Genome Express company (Grenoble, France). Expression and Purification Methods—The MiaBTm protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL™ and purified as previously described, apo and reconstituted forms were obtained as previously described (18Pierrel F.

Atta M. Alcouffe C. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3730-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase was overexpressed and purified as described in Ref. 23Peterson E.T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10380-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar. Analytical Methods—Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and also checked using the bicinchonic acid protein kit assay (Sigma) with the same standard. Iron was determined by the method of Fish (25Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and inorganic sulfide was quantified as described by Beinert (26Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Construction of the Synthetic Gene Coding for E. coli tRNAPhe—We constructed a 100-bp long fragment corresponding to mature E. coli tRNAPhe from three complementary pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides. The sequence of these oligonucleotides is: Phe1: 5′-AATTCGCCCGTTGCCCGGATAGCTCAGTCGG-3′; Phe2: 5′-TAGAGCAGGGGATTGAAAATCCCCGTGTCCTT-3′; Phe3: 5′-GGTTCGATTCCGAGTCCGGGCACCAAATTACGCGGGG-3′; Phe4: 5′-GATCCCCCGCGTAATTTGGTGCCCGG-3′; Phe5: 5′-ACTCGGAATCGAACCAAGGACACGGGGATTT-3′; Phe6: 5′-TCAATCCCCTGCTCTACCGACTGAGCTATCCGGGCAACGGGCG-3′. Internal oligonucleotides Phe2, Phe3, Phe5, and Phe6 (100 pmol each) were phosphorylated in 50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase for 1 h at 37 °C. A mixture of 25 pmol of each oligonucleotide was heated to 95 °C for 5 min, then cooled slowly to room temperature. Ligation of hybridized oligonucleotides was carried out with 2.5 units of T4 DNA ligase at 18 °C for 15–18 h. Electrophoresis on a 15% non-denaturing TAE-buffered polyacrylamide gel showed that the major ligation product corresponded to that expected for the tRNA gene coding fragment and was also used to purify this fragment. The pTrc99-B plasmid was cleaved by EcoR1 and BamH1 and was combined with the insert. Ligation was carried out under the conditions described above. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli DH5a. The plasmid DNA of the clone with an insert of the correct size was then sequenced and named pTrc99-B-tRNAPhe. Overproduction of tRNAPhe and Preparation of tRNAPhe-enriched tRNAs—Overproduction of tRNAPhe was performed using the E. coli TX3346 miaB– strain lacking a functional miaB gene. The transformed cells with pTrc99-B-tRNAPhe were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. This overnight culture was used to inoculate 5 liters of LB medium. When the culture reached 0.8 OD600, tRNAPhe expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm followed by incubation for 15 h at 37 °C. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 200 mm Tris-Cl pH 8, and then extracted by an equal volume of phenol saturated with 200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. After 30 min of vigorous shaking at room temperature, the aqueous phase was collected by low speed centrifugation and extracted again under the same conditions. The small RNAs were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 50 ml of 500 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in order to deacylate the extracted tRNAs. The solution was then neutralized by addition of 10 ml of 1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.1 and RNAs were precipitated with 3 volumes of cold ethanol. The total RNAs pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-H3PO4, pH 6.3 containing 15% ethanol and 400 mm KCl, and the solution was applied to a Nucleobond column AX10000 (Clontech) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was then washed extensively with the same buffer and tRNAs were eluted by increasing the concentration of KCl to 650 mm. tRNAs were precipitated with 0.7 volume of cold isopropyl alcohol for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried. tRNAs were dissolved in water and stored at –20 °C in 250 mm NaCl and 3 volumes of ethanol. The [14C]Phe acceptor activity of the total tRNAs preparation, obtained from these cells has been assayed by using the E. coli phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme (23Peterson E.T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10380-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The obtained activity was up to 430 pmol per A260 unit to be compared with 90 pmol for total tRNAs isolated from E. coli TX3346 cells not transformed with the overproducing plasmid. Total tRNAs obtained from the tRNAPhe overexpressing E. coli miaB– cells were named i6A-37-tRNAs and were used as a substrate for MiaB protein. Aminoacylation Assay—The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, 50 μm [14C]phenylalanine (25 μCi/μmol), and 20 μg of purified tRNAs. Incubation was 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of the reaction mixture to a Whatman GF/A filter prewetted with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were washed three times during 5 min in 5% trichloroacetic acid, then two times for 2 min in 95% ethanol, and finally dried at 50 °C during 10 min. The radioactivity was then counted. Analysis of tRNA Nucleoside Composition by HPLC—i6A-37-tRNAs and the in vitro assay solutions were digested to nucleosides by the method of Gehrke and Kuo (27Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Chromatography and Modification of Nucleosides. Part A. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1990: A3-A71Google Scholar) by using nuclease P1 and bacterial alkaline phosphatase. 50–100 μg of tRNAs was loaded onto Zorbax SB-C-18 column connected to a HP-1100 HPLC system. The short gradient profile developed by Gehrke and Kuo (27Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. Chromatography and Modification of Nucleosides. Part A. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1990: A3-A71Google Scholar) was used to separate the different nucleosides. The ms2i6A was quantified by converting the area of the corresponding HPLC peak by using the response factor of 808 units of area of the ms2i6A peak detected at 254 nm/nmol of ms2i6A. In Vitro Enzyme Assay—The assay mixture (20 μl) contained, in 100 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mm AdoMet (or 100 μm [3H3C]AdoMet for labeling experiments), 2 mm dithionite, 150 μm i6A-37-tRNAs, and 70 μm reconstituted MiaB protein. After 90 min of reaction at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions, 80 μl of water was added to the assay mixture, and tRNAs were extracted by phenol treatment and then ethanol-precipitated. tRNAs were digested and analyzed by HPLC for ms2i6A as described above. Analysis of 5′-Deoxyadenosine (AdoH) by HPLC—The in vitro reaction (30 μl) was stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 1 m HCl in the assay. After 30 min, the volume was completed to 110 μl with water, and the solution was centrifuged 10 min at 14,000 rpm at room temperature. The supernatant was injected onto an HPLC Zorbax SB-C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A linear gradient from 0 to 28% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was performed at 1 ml/min over 15 min. AdoH, detected from its absorption at 260 nm, eluted after 9.5 min. A standard curve established with pure AdoH enabled us to quantify the AdoH produced in our assay directly from the area of the corresponding HPLC peak. In Vitro Reconstitution of MiaB with Fe/Se—ApoMiaB was obtained as described previously (18Pierrel F. Hernandez H.L. Johnson M.K. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29515-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Typically apoMiaB (200 μm) was incubated with 2 mm DTT for 10 min. Then, 2 mm FeCl3, previously reduced anaerobically with DTT, was added to the protein solution, followed by addition of 3 mm selenocystine. Cluster assembly was initiated by addition of 2.5 μm SufS protein, and the Fe-Se cluster incorporation into apoMiaB was monitored by UV-visible light absorption. The solution was then treated with 600 μm EDTA in order to get rid of the excess of iron and finally the reconstituted protein was desalted by chomatography on a Sephadex G-25 column. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry analyses were performed with a 1100 Agilent chromatographic system coupled with an API 3000 triple quadripolar apparatus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a turbo ionspray electrospray source used in the positive mode. HPLC separation was carried out with a 2 × 150 mm octadecylsilyl silica gel (3-mm particle size) column (Uptisphere, Interchim Montluçon, France) and a gradient of acetonitrile in 5 mm ammonium formate as the mobile phase. The proportion of acetonitrile rose from 0 to 40% over the first 20 min, and the latter composition was maintained for 40 min. The settings of the tandem mass spectrometer were optimized by injection of a pure solution of i6A in order to favor loss of the ribose unit upon collision-induced fragmentation. Mass spectrometry detection was carried out in neutral loss mode in order to obtain a high specificity. In this configuration, pseudo-molecular ions ([M+H]+) and fragments ([M-132+H]+) obtained by collision in the second quadrupole (collision cell) were analyzed in the first and third quadrupoles, respectively. Using this approach, only nucleosides losing their ribose unit were detected. The pseudo-molecular ion of the latter compounds was monitored in a 300–450 mass range. Light Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer connected to the anaerobic glove box by optical fibers. Activity of MiaB Protein in the Conversion of i6Atoms2i6A— Our previous work had shown that complementation of the E. coli TX3346 miaB– strain with the miaB gene (TM0653) from T. maritima restored the production of ms2i6A in these cells in vivo (18Pierrel F. Hernandez H.L. Johnson M.K. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29515-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the enzymatic conversion of i6A to ms2i6A in vitro, we established standard reaction conditions for the purified MiaB protein from T. maritima, MiaBTm. Typically the reaction mixture contained MiaBTm, total tRNA enriched with the tRNAPhe substrate, AdoMet, dithionite as a reductant, in a final volume of 20 μl of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8. The reaction was done at 37 °C or 50 °C for 90 min, within an anaerobic glove box. In all standard experiments reported here the purified MiaBTm was the preparation containing a [4Fe-4S] cluster. This protein was obtained after reconstitution of its iron-sulfur center by treatment of apoMiaB under anearobic conditions with an excess of iron and sulfide followed by desalting on Sephadex G-25 as previously described (18Pierrel F. Hernandez H.L. Johnson M.K. Fontecave M. Atta M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29515-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The tRNA substrate was the total tRNAs obtained from the E. coli TX3346 miaB– strain transformed with the expression plasmid pTrc-99B-tRNAPhe for overproduction of tRNAPhe. Thus, this preparation had two characteristics: first, it was enriched with tRNAPhe (about 27% pure based on the acceptor activity value of 1600 pmol of phenylalanine/A260 for pure tRNAPhe, Ref. 28Junemann R. Wadzack J. Triana-Alonso F.J. Bittner J.U. Caillet J. Meinnel T. Vanatalu K. Nierhaus K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); second, it contained an isopentenyl group at position 6 of adenosine 37 but no methylthio group at position 2 of the same nucleoside. These tRNAs were named i6A-37-tRNAs. After the 90-min incubation, tRNAs were recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and then completely hydrolyzed by nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase. The resulting hydrolysate was analyzed by HPLC, and the chromatogram presented in Fig. 1A showed the presence of a peak at 57 min (retention time) corresponding to the ms2i6A nucleoside. No ms2i6A could be detected when the MiaB protein, AdoMet, or dithionite was omitted from the reaction mixture. In that case, only the peak at 47 min corresponding to i6A was detected (Fig. 1B). The identity of i6A and ms2i6A was confirmed by their UV-visible spectra and by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Production of ms2i6A under these conditions was monitored as a function of reaction time and of MiaB protein concentration. In Fig. 2A it is shown that there is a linear formation of ms2i6A with time to reach a plateau after about 100 min, when the reaction stops for unknown reasons so far. Fig. 2B demonstrates the MiaB dependence of the reaction with the linear formation of ms2i6A as a function of MiaB concentration. These data also show that the reaction is slow and stops after production of about 0.18 ms2i6A per MiaBTm polypeptide. Two other reducing systems have been used in place of dithionite and proved to be functional: light-activated 5-deazaflavin and reduced flavodoxin using flavodoxin reductase and NADPH. However the production of ms2i6A with these reducing systems was about two times lower than with dithionite. These results show for the first time that MiaB is able to catalyze the transformation of i6A to ms2i6A in a tRNA and that this tRNA methythiolation occurs with no need for an additional protein. The Anticodon Stem Loop Is a Substrate for MiaBTm—A seventeen-base RNA oligonucleotide (Scheme 1A) corresponding to the anticodon stem loop of wild-type tRNAPhe was synthesized. This RNA was found to be a substrate of MiaA enzyme, even though it contained only unmodified nucleosides (data not shown), but MiaBTm-dependent formation of ms2i6A absolutely required the presence of the MiaA protein and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) in the reaction mixture. In the absence of MiaBTm only i6A could be detected, whereas in the absence of MiaA enzyme or DMAPP neither i6A nor ms2i6A were observed in the HPLC chromatogram. This proves that no methylthiolation can occur in the absence of the isopentenyl group at position 6 of adenosine. The Origin of the Methyl Group—In the standard assay mixture for in vitro synthesis of ms2i6A the most likely methyl donor is AdoMet. In order to determine whether the MiaB protein displays tRNA-methyltransferase activity the assay was run as described above but in the presence of [3H3C]AdoMet. After 90 min of incubation, tRNAs were recovered and hydrolyzed as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the resulting hydrolysate was analyzed by HPLC. Seven fractions were collected (two of them corresponding to the peaks of i6A and ms2i6A), and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. As shown in Fig. 3 the only labeled peak was that corresponding to ms2i6A. No peak and no radioactivity could be detected at the same position of the chromatogram when MiaB protein was omitted from the reaction mixture. We can safely conclude that AdoMet serves as the methyl donor for the synthesis of ms2i6A and that the methyltransferase activity resides in the MiaB protein. Based on this experiment, we established a linear correlation between the area of the HPLC peak of ms2i6A and its radioactivity. With this correlation, we calculated a molar response factor of 808 units of area of the ms2i6A peak detected at 254 nm/nmol of ms2i6A. In all experiments, this response factor was used to quantify the ms2i6A produced. Reductive Cleavage of AdoMet during the Assay—Radical-AdoMet enzymes proceed by reductive cleavage of AdoMet resulting in formation of methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is transformed in AdoH after abstraction of an H atom on the substrate (12Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 29Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Frey P.A. Magnusson O.T. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2129-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus formation of AdoH from AdoMet is a signature for this class of enzymes. During the in vitro ms2i6A synthesis assay described above, formation of AdoH was also monitored by HPLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” In Fig. 4, curves depicting the ms2i6A (closed circles) and AdoH (open circles) productions are shown as a function of time. The ratio of AdoH with respect to ms2i6A at each time point was constant and equal to 1.5 approximately. This ratio can be rationalized with a model in which only 1 equivalent of AdoMet is required for formation of one molecule of ms2i6A. The observed excess production of AdoH (0.5 equivalent) is likely to be due to an abortive process. No production of AdoH could be detected when i6A-37-tRNAs or MiaB protein were omitted from the reaction mixture. This result strongly suggests that during the conversion of i6A to ms2i6A the MiaB protein uses a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is produced by reductive cleavage of AdoMet. This supports the hypothesis that MiaB belongs to the Radical-AdoMet family. The Source of the Sulfur Atom—The source of the sulfur atom present in thionucleosides has been previously investigated using whole cells (31Lauhon C.T. J.

Cells growing in the presence of [35S]cysteine generate 35S-labeled ms2i6A demonstrating that the primary source of the sulfur atom in ms2i6A is cysteine (36Peterkofsky A. Lipsett M.N. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2085492709,"Gα13, the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G13, has been shown to stimulate cell migration in addition to inducing oncogenic transformation. Cta, a Drosophila ortholog of G13, has been shown to be critical for cell migration leading to the ventral furrow formation in Drosophila embryos. Loss of Gα13 has been shown to disrupt cell migration associated with angiogenesis in developing mouse embryos. Whereas these observations point to the vital role of G13-orthologs in regulating cell migration, widely across the species barrier, the mechanism by which Gα13 couples to cytoskeleton and cell migration is largely unknown. Here we show that Gα13 physically interacts with Hax-1, a cytoskeleton-associated, cortactin-interacting intracellular protein, and this interaction is required for Gα13-stimulated cell migration. Hax-1 interaction is specific to Gα13, and this interaction is more pronounced with the mutationally or functionally activated form of Gα13 as compared with the wild-type Gα13. Expression of Hax-1 reduces the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes in Gα13-expressing NIH3T3 cells. Coexpression of Hax-1 also attenuates Gα13-stimulated activity of Rho while potentiating Gα13-stimulated activity of Rac. The presence of a quadnary complex consisting of Gα13, Hax-1, Rac, and cortactin indicates the role of Hax-1 in tethering Gα13 to the cytoskeletal component(s) involved in cell movement. Whereas the expression of Hax-1 potentiates Gα13-mediated cell movement, silencing of endogenous Hax-1 with Hax-1-specific small interfering RNAs drastically reduces Gα13-mediated cell migration. These findings, along with the observation that Hax-1 is overexpressed in metastatic tumors and tumor cell lines, suggest a novel role for the association of oncogenic Gα13 and Hax-1 in tumor metastasis. Gα13, the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G13, has been shown to stimulate cell migration in addition to inducing oncogenic transformation.

Here we show that Gα13 physically interacts with Hax-1, a cytoskeleton-associated, cortactin-interacting intracellular protein, and this interaction is required for Gα13-stimulated cell migration. Hax-1 interaction is specific to Gα13, and this interaction is more pronounced with the mutationally or functionally activated form of Gα13 as compared with the wild-type Gα13. Expression of Hax-1 reduces the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes in Gα13-expressing NIH3T3 cells. Coexpression of Hax-1 also attenuates Gα13-stimulated activity of Rho while potentiating Gα13-stimulated activity of Rac. The presence of a quadnary complex consisting of Gα13, Hax-1, Rac, and cortactin indicates the role of Hax-1 in tethering Gα13 to the cytoskeletal component(s) involved in cell movement. Whereas the expression of Hax-1 potentiates Gα13-mediated cell movement, silencing of endogenous Hax-1 with Hax-1-specific small interfering RNAs drastically reduces Gα13-mediated cell migration. These findings, along with the observation that Hax-1 is overexpressed in metastatic tumors and tumor cell lines, suggest a novel role for the association of oncogenic Gα13 and Hax-1 in tumor metastasis. Cell migration plays a vital role in different biological processes ranging from embryogenesis to immune response (1Franz C.M. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 153-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Vicente-Manzanres M. Sancho D. Yanez-Mo M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 216: 233-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, an aberrant activation of cell migration in neoplastic cells results in tumor metastasis. Cells migrate in response to different cues through the coordinated interactions of actin- and/or microtubule-associated cytoskeletal proteins (3Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 4Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptors and their cognate G proteins play a major role in regulating cell migration and chemokinesis (5Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). The G12 family of G proteins, defined by α-subunits Gα12 and Gα13, has been shown to activate novel signaling pathways involved in cell growth and neoplastic transformation (6Radhika V. Dhanasekaran N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence indicate that the α-subunit of G13, Gα13, is primarily involved in the regulation of cell migration (7Parks S. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1991; 64: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 8Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Gu J.L. Muller S. Mancino V. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9352-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The first is the observation that Cta, an ortholog of Gα13, is critically required for cell movement during Drosophila embryogenesis (7Parks S. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1991; 64: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The second is the finding that Gα13-null (Gα13-/-) fibroblasts show the loss of chemokinetic response to thrombin or lysophosphatidic acid receptor-mediated cell movement (8Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Gu J.L. Muller S. Mancino V. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9352-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Existing models of cell movement suggest that the initial movements in cell migration involve polymerization of filamentous actin at the leading edge forming membrane extensions (3Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 4Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Subsequent adhesion at the leading edge is followed by the translocation of the cell body by the forward flow of the cytosol. Finally, whereas the leading edge of the cell is still attached to the substratum, the rear-end is detached and retracted into the cell body thereby effecting cell movement. All of these distinct phases of cell movement, with the exception of cytosolic translocation, involve temporal and spatial regulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization. Although, many different proteins control actin polymerization, several lines of evidence indicate that the interaction between cortactin and actin-related proteins 2/3 plays a critical role in actin polymerization leading to cell movement (10Patel A.S. Schechter G.L. Wasilenko W.J. Somers K.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y-X. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cortactin is a major substrate for tyrosine kinases such as Src, Fer, and Syk, and is usually present in the cytosol. Upon growth factor stimulation, it is translocated by activated Rac-1 to cell periphery where it interacts with F-actin and stimulates actin-related protein 2/3-mediated actin polymerization (13Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, tyrosine kinases as well as small GTPases converge on cortactin to stimulate actin polymerization and consequent cell movement. Although Gα13 has been known to be involved in the regulation of thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid-receptor-stimulated cell migration of fibroblasts (8Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Gu J.L. Muller S. Mancino V. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9352-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which Gα13 stimulates cell movement or the identity of the signaling components involved in Gα13-mediated cytokinesis is largely unknown. Therefore, we sought to identify the signaling components involved in Gα13-mediated cell movement. Here we demonstrate that Gα13 physically associates with intracellular protein Hax-1, which has been previously identified as a cortactin-interacting protein (14Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Daisuke K. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar) and that Hax-1 promotes Gα13-mediated cell migration. Furthermore, we show that Gα13 and Hax-1 exists in a complex consisting of Rac and cortactin. We also demonstrate that the coexpression of Hax-1 enhances Gα13-mediated Rac activity while inhibiting Rho activity, both of which can promote cell movement. These results describe for the first time a critical role for Hax-1 in cell movement mediated by Gα13. Plasmids, Strains, and Cells—The yeast expression vector pLexA-Gα13ED was constructed by ligating the PCR-derived cDNA insert encoding amino acids 221–347 of Gα13 into pBTM116 vector. Expression vector pcDNA3-Hax-1 was constructed by ligating the EcoRI-SpeI-excised Hax-1 insert from pME18S-Hax-1 into the EcoRI and XbaI site of pcDNA3 vector. C-terminal S-protein-tagged Hax-1 was constructed by replacing the stop codon of Hax-1 with the coding sequence for the S-tag (KETAAAKFERQHMDS) followed by a stop codon. The resultant Hax-1-S-tag was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Cell lines Gα13QL- and Gα13WT-NIH3T3 have been previously described (31Dermott J.M. Ha J.H. Lee C.H. Dhanasekaran N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All the constructs were verified by sequencing. Transfection of NIH3T3 cells was carried out using the calcium phosphate method as previously described (32Dermott J.M. Dhanasekaran N. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 298-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected using FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed in yeast strain L40 transformed with pLexA-Gα13ED and plasmid pGAD-GH containing an oligo(dT)-primed HeLa cell cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Of the 4 × 106 transformants screened, 550 clones were found to grow in the absence of His. The His+ colonies were restreaked on SD-His/-Leu/-Trp plates and subjected to β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay. The resultant 454 His+Lacz+ colonies were grown in SD-Leu medium to enable the segregation of pLexA-Gα13ED. The Trp-Leu+ segregates were mated to yeast strain AMR70 that had been pre-transformed with the plasmid pLex-Lamin or pLexA-Gα13ED. The leu+ trp+ diploids were then assayed for transactivation of the lacZ reporter by a filter assay. The positive clones totaling 115 that showed β-galactosidase activity only in the presence of pLexA-Gα13ED were isolated and the library plasmids were recovered. The cDNA inserts of the library plasmids were amplified by PCR and 10 representative clones were further sequenced. The sequence analysis of the cDNA inserts revealed that they are five independent fusions of human Hax-1. Co-precipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Co-precipitation studies were carried out with COS-7 cells using S-protein-agarose (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI) or antibodies specific to the protein of interest. At 24 h following transfection, cells were lysed and cell lysate protein (1 μg each) was incubated with 35 μl of S-protein-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. After repeated washes with lysis buffer, the S-proteinagarose-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses were carried out by incubating cell lysate protein (1 μg each) with 1–5 μg of the respective antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 30 μl of 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies to cortactin (05-180) and Rac (05-389) were from Upstate Signaling Solutions (Charlottesville, VA), whereas antibodies to the hemagglutinin epitope (2362) and Hax-1 (H65220) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA) respectively. Antibodies to S-epitope (SC-802), Gαs (sc-823), Gαq (sc-393), and Gα12 (sc-409) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to Gαi (1521) were a kind gift from Dr. David Manning, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. For immunoblot and immunoprecipitation studies for Gα13WT and Gα13QL, rabbit polyclonal antibodies (AS1-89-2) raised against the C terminus of Gα13 were used. After washing the immunoprecipitates twice with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblot analyses with specific antibodies were carried out following the previously published procedures (31Dermott J.M. Ha J.H. Lee C.H. Dhanasekaran N. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Co-localization of Hax-1 and Gα13—Cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, short interfering RNA; WT, wild-type. for 10 min, permeablized by 0.05% Triton X-100 (10 min), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (30 min), and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to Hax-1 or rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Gα13 (1:200) for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing, samples were incubated with 1:100 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at 25 °C to obtain immunofluorescent imaging of Hax-1 and Gα13, respectively. The coverslips containing the cells were washed with PBS, which were mounted on glass slides with 10 μl of Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The images were recorded and analyzed using an Olympus confocal microscope with a ×60/NA 1.4 plan-apochromat objective. Actin Staining—Actin staining was carried out using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) following previously published methods (33Radhika V. Naik N.R. Advani S.H. Bhisey A.N. Cytometry. 2000; 42: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells/transfectants of interest were fixed on coverslips with 3% formaldehyde. After washing with PBS the cells were incubated at 37 °C in PBS containing 1 μm fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin, 0.01% lysolecithin, and 0.05% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and examined under a fluorescent microscope. Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration assay was carried out in cell culture inserts (PET membrane with 8-μm pores, BD Biosciences). The cell culture inserts containing 3 × 104 cells in 200 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was placed in the well of the companion plate containing 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% serum per well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Non-migrating cells on the inner side of the inserts were removed with a cotton swab and the migrated cells on the underside of the insert were fixed and stained with Hemacolor (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ). Photomicrographs of three random fields were taken and enumerated to calculate the average number of cells that had migrated. Silencing Hax-1 with Short Interfering RNAs (siRNA)—siRNA targeting mouse Hax-1, coding regions 188–208 bases (5′-AATTCGGTTTCAGCTTCAGCC-3′), was synthesized and purified (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). An equimolar pool containing four different nonspecific control siRNA duplexes (number D-0011206-13-05, Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO) were used as control. Cells were transfected with 20 μm siRNA at 24-h intervals using TransMessenger reagent (Qiagen Inc.) for 96 h. Rac/Rho Activation Assay—NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Gα13WT or Gα13QL were transiently transfected with pCDNA3-Hax-1. At 48 h following transfection, cells were lysed and the Rho or Rac pull-down assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA). Activated GTP-bound Rho was pulled-down from 1 mg of lysate protein using 20 μg of Rhotekin-RBD-(7–89)-agarose beads. The pulled-down Rho was identified by immunoblot analysis using anti-Rho (-A, -B, and -C). Active GTP-bound Rac was assayed by pulling down active Rac using 10 μg of PAK-PBD-(67–150)-agarose beads from 1 mg of lysates. The pulled-down Rac-GTP was identified by immunoblot analysis using anti-Rac antibody. Interaction of Gα13 with Hax-1—To identify novel signaling proteins that interact with Gα13, a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out in which the effector interacting domain of Gα13 spanning amino acids 221–347, deduced from the crystal structures of the Gαt and GαI (15Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), was used as bait in a human HeLa cell cDNA library. Analyses of a set of transformants that were positive for Gα13 interaction identified Hax-1 (HS-1 associated protein X-1) as a Gα13-interacting protein. Previous studies have identified Hax-1 as an intracellular, 35-kDa HS-1 or cortactin-interacting protein (14Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Daisuke K. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gallagher A.R. Cedzich A. Gretz N. Somlo S. Witzgall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4017-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses of Hax-1 inserts rescued from these transformants revealed that Hax-1 coding sequences of varying lengths interact with Gα13 (Fig. 1A). The interactions between these Hax-1 inserts and Gα13 were also verified using β-galactosidase activity of the LacZ reporter gene (Fig. 1B). Sequence alignment of the different Gα13-interacting Hax-1 fragments indicated that amino acids 176–247 of Hax-1 was sufficient for its interaction with Gα13 (Fig. 1C). To examine the in vivo interaction between Gα13 and Hax-1, co-immunoprecipitation studies were carried out in COS-7 cells that were cotransfected with an expression vector containing a cDNA insert encoding S-epitope-tagged Hax-1 and a vector containing an insert encoding wild-type Gα13 (Gα13WT) or its activated mutant (Gα13QL). Examination of Gα13 immunoprecipitates for the presence of Hax-1 indicated that Hax-1 was coimmunoprecipitated with Gα13 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, examination of Hax-1 immunoprecipitates by immunoblot analysis showed that Gα13 was coimmunoprecipitated with Hax-1, thereby confirming the physical interaction between these two proteins. Although both Gα13WT and its activated mutant Gα13QL could be seen to interact with Hax-1, the interaction between Gα13QL and Hax-1 is more pronounced than that of the wild-type (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, pretreatment of Gα13WT transfectants with aluminum fluoride for 15 min, which is known to convert the unstimulated wild-type α-subunit to an active conformation (17Plonk S.G. Park S-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4823-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Yuan J. Slice L.W. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38619-38627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), drastically enhanced the interaction of Hax-1 with Gα13WT, demonstrating that the active configuration of Gα13 more avidly interacts with Hax-1 (Fig. 2B). Co-immunoprecipitation analyses to investigate whether Hax-1 interacts with the α-subunits of other G proteins subfamilies represented by Gαs, Gαi, and Gαq, indicated that Hax-1 failed to interact with any of these α-subunits (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, a similar analysis to determine the interaction between Hax-1 and Gα12, the α-subunit closely related to Gα13, indicated that Hax-1 does not interact with Gα12 thereby indicating the specificity of Gα13-Hax-1 interaction (Fig. 2C). These results are significant in light of the observations that only Gα13, but not Gα12, is involved in the cell migratory response (9Gu J.L. Muller S. Mancino V. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9352-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The interaction between Gα13 and Hax-1 can also be observed in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Gα13QL in which Hax-1 is transiently expressed. Double immunofluorescent labeling of Gα13 and Hax-1 followed by image-merging analysis indicated the colocalization of Gα13 and Hax-1 in NIH3T3 cells, further confirming their interaction in a cell-type independent manner (Fig. 2D). These findings, taken together with the previous observations, that Gα13 regulates cell migratory response (8Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Gu J.L. Muller S. Mancino V. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9352-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Hax-1 interacts with cortactin (16Gallagher A.R. Cedzich A. Gretz N. Somlo S. Witzgall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4017-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which promotes cell migration (10Patel A.S. Schechter G.L. Wasilenko W.J. Somers K.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y-X. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar), suggested to us the interesting possibility that Hax-1 is involved in linking Gα13 to cell migration-associated actin cytoskeletal motor. Cytoskeletal Changes in Gα13-Hax-1 Co-transfectants—Previous studies from others, as well as us, have also shown that Gα13 stimulates the formation of focal adhesion complexes through the small GTPase Rho (19Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 20Hooley R. Yu C-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that Gα13 stimulates signaling pathways regulated by the small GTPase Rac (17Plonk S.G. Park S-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4823-4826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Whereas Rho-stimulated stress fiber and focal adhesion complex formations are often associated with cell adhesion, Rac-stimulated membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation are associated with cell protrusion during cell movement (21Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar, 22Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these two responses seem to contradict each other, cell migration often involves a sequential as well as spatio-temporal regulation of adhesion, de-adhesion, and protrusion mechanisms involving both of these GTPases (3Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 4Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Gα13 can transmit adhesion and protrusion signals to the actin cytoskeleton by recruiting different signaling components in a context-specific manner. If such a differential signaling for cell movement is promoted by Gα13-Hax-1 interaction, a decrease in stress fiber formation with a concomitant increase in actin-rich structures at the leading edges of the cell, a characteristic feature of cell migration, should be observed. This was investigated by analyzing the actin organization in cells expressing Gα13QL and Hax-1 (Fig. 3). Consistent with previous findings (19Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 20Hooley R. Yu C-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), actin staining showed that NIH3T3 cells expressing Gα13QL as well as the control group showed extensive stress fiber formations. However, upon expression of Hax-1, cells expressing Gα13QL showed a drastic reduction in the number of stress fibers along with the formation of actin-rich structures within the periphery of the membrane ruffles. It should be noted here that the observed actin reorganization is analogous to the one stimulated by Ras during cell migration, wherein Ras promotes Rac-mediated lamellipodia formation with a reduction in actin stress fibers so that the cells can repetitively adhere, de-adhere, and move (23Vial E. Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 6779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Differential Effects of Hax-1 on Gα13-mediated Activation of Rho-GTPases—Because stress fiber formation has been shown to be directly correlated with Rho activity (19Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 20Hooley R. Yu C-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and the co-expression of Gα13QL and Hax1 showed a reduction in stress fiber formation (Fig. 3), we sought to investigate whether the co-expression of Hax-1 would suppress Gα13QL-mediated Rho activation. Whereas the expression of Gα13QL stimulated Rho activity confirming previous results (19Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 20Hooley R. Yu C-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12463-12473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), co-expression of Hax-1 drastically attenuated the Rho activity stimulated by Gα13QL (Fig. 4A). Although, the mechanism(s) through which Hax-1 inhibits Rho activity remains to be resolved, it is possible that Hax-1 sequesters Gα13 thereby preventing it from interacting with the Rho-guanine-nucleotide exchange factor in stimulating Rho. Based on the formation of actin-rich structures in these cells, often associated with Rac (26Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it can be deduced that the co-expression of Hax-1 would potentiate Gα13QL-mediated Rac activation. To test this postulate, we investigated whether the coexpression of Hax-1 modulated any changes in Gα13QL-stimulated Rac activity. In contrast to its effect on Rho activity, Hax-1 potentiated Gα13QL-stimulated Rac activity in these cells. An analysis of Rac activity indicated that while Rac is stimulated by the expression of Gα13QL in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4B), coexpression of Hax further enhanced such Gα13QL-stimulated Rac activity. Thus, the co-expression of Hax-1 appears to differentially modulate the ability of Gα13 to stimulate Rho and Rac. Although the mechanism(s) through which Hax-1 potentiates Gα13-mediated Rac activation remains unknown, the finding that Hax-1 enhances Gα13 stimulation of Rac is of great physiological significance in the context of cell movement regulated by Gα13. Because it has been shown that activated Rac is involved in translocating cortactin to membrane ruffles where cortactin stimulates actin-related protein 2/3-mediated actin polymerization (10Patel A.S. Schechter G.L. Wasilenko W.J. Somers K.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y-X. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that Gα13-Hax-1 interaction plays a critical role in Rac-mediated translocation of cortactin and subsequent membrane ruffling. Because the actin-rich membrane ruffling precedes the formation of cell protrusion en route to cell migration, these findings suggest that Gα13 and Hax-1 promote the critical actin cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for cell migration. Role of Hax-1 in Gα13-mediated Cell Movement—To investigate the role of Hax-1 in Gα13-mediated cell migration, Hax-1 was transiently expressed in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing Gα13QL. When these cells were analyzed for migration, the results indicated that Hax-1 increased the migration of Gα13QL-NIH3T3 cells by 3-fold (Fig. 5, A and B). Because lysophosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid-like agonists in the serum can activate wild-type Gα13 (Gα13WT) through their cognate receptors (26Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we tested whether Hax-1 promotes receptor-stimulated migration of NIH3T3-Gα13WT toward 5% serum. The results clearly demonstrated that Hax-1 increased the migration of these cells over the vector controls by 2.5-fold (Fig. 5, A and B). Expression of Hax-1 in migrated cells was verified by monitoring the fluorescence of the co-transfected pCEFL-GFP in NIH3T3-Gα13WT and NIH3T3-Gα13QL cells (Fig. 5C). Further analysis was carried out to test the effects of inhibiting Hax-1 on Gα13-mediated cell migration. siRNAs specific to Hax-1 or nonspecific control siRNAs were transfected into NIH3T3-Gα13WT cells and the migrations of these transfectants toward 5% serum were analyzed. Silencing of the endogenous Hax-1 by Hax-1-siRNA reduced the migration of NIH3T3-Gα13WT cells (Fig. 6A), whereas there was no effect with control siRNA. Similar results were obtained with NIH3T3-Gα13QL cells in which Hax-1 was silenced by siRNA (Fig. 6A). Quantification of these results indicated that Hax-1 siRNA reduced migration of NIH3T3-Gα13WT as well as NIH3T3-Gα13QL cells by 60% (Fig. 6B). The extent of reduction in cell migration upon silencing Hax-1 can be correlated with the siRNA-mediated reduction in the Hax-1 expression levels (Fig. 6B, lower panel). Quantification of the immunoblots showed that Hax-1 protein expression was reduced to 50–65% by 96 h after transfection. These results strongly indicate that Hax-1 plays a critical role in Gα13-mediated cell migration. Quadnary Complex Consisting of Gα13, Hax-1, Cortactin, and Rac—In this context, it should be noted that cortactin, the previously known binding partner of Hax-1 is critically involved in actin polymerization and cell movement (10Patel A.S. Schechter G.L. Wasilenko W.J. Somers K.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y-X. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas it has been shown that the cortactin/HS1 interacting site of Hax-1 is located around amino acid 114 (14Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Daisuke K. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar), the core domain of Hax-1 involved in Gα13 interaction spans a region encompassing amino acids 176–247 (Fig. 1). As the Hax-1 domains involved in cortactin interaction and Gα13 interactions are non-overlapping, it can be envisioned that Hax-1 interacts with both Gα13 and cortactin in promoting cell movement. Thus, Hax-1, through its interaction with cortactin on the one hand and Gα13 with the other, is likely to be involved in tethering Gα13 to the membrane-ruffling site, which is involved in the formation of cell protrusion. In such an event, Hax-1 would form a physical complex involving both Gα13 and cortactin. To investigate the presence of such complex, COS-7 cells were transfected with either S-epitope-tagged Hax-1 and Gα13QL (Fig. 7A). Examination of S-tagged Hax-1 precipitates for the presence of Gα13 and cortactin indicated that Gα13 and cortactin were coimmunoprecipitated with Hax-1 (Fig. 7B). Likewise, the analyses of Gα13 immunoprecipitates for the presence of Hax-1 and cortactin indicated that Hax-1 and cortactin were coimmunoprecipitated along with Gα13 (Fig. 7C). Because Rac, unlike Rho, is involved in the translocation of cortactin (13Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar) and Rac activity is enhanced in Gα13-Hax-1 cotransfectants, we also examined the presence of Rac in these immunoprecipitates. Results indicated that Rac was coimmunoprecipitated along with Gα13 as well as Hax-1 (Fig. 7, B and C). Together these results indicate the presence of a quadnary complex involving Gα13, Hax-1, cortactin, and Rac. In light of the critical roles played by Rac and cortactin in cell protrusion and migration, it can be inferred that Hax-1 association with Gα13 brings them closer to the active site of cell protrusion, where the stimulation of Rac activity by Gα13 would have a more pronounced effect on cell movement. Considering the observations that 1) Gα13 stimulates the activation of Rac, which is potentiated by Hax-1 (Fig. 4); 2) Rac stimulates the translocation of cortactin (10Patel A.S. Schechter G.L. Wasilenko W.J. Somers K.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar); 3) cortactin stimulates actin polymerization leading to lamellipodia formation (11Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y-X. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 12Uruno T. Zhang P. Liu J. Hao J.J. Zhan X. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443PubMed Google Scholar); 4) Hax-1 promotes Gα13-mediated cell motility (Figs. 5 and 6); and 5) Gα13 is in complex with Hax-1, cortactin, and Rac (Fig. 7), it is reasonable to conclude that both Gα13 and Hax-1 are part of a signaling complex involved in cell motility. It is likely that such proximal positioning of Gα13, Rac, Hax-1, and cortactin stimulates cell migration by countering Gα13-Rho-mediated cell adhesion (Fig. 8). The studies presented here demonstrate for the first time a novel interaction between Gα13 and the cytoskeleton-associated protein Hax-1, thereby identifying a cytoskeletal signaling locus for Gα13 in cell movement. Based on the results, it can be envisioned that Hax-1 plays a central role in Gα13-mediated cell motility by affecting three distinct, but closely related, signaling loci. First, by associating with Gα13, Hax-1 sequesters Gα13 from activating Rho and associated cell adhesion pathways. Second, through the potentiation of Gα13-stimulated Rac activity, Hax-1 promotes Rac-mediated translocation of cortactin to the periphery where cortactin along with actin-related proteins induces cell protrusion and migration. Finally, by tethering Gα13 to cortactin in a complex containing Rac, Hax-1 provides a signaling nexus that facilitates the dynamic and uninterrupted transmission of signals from Gα13 to cortactin through Rac to promote cell protrusion and migration. Our present study does not address the mechanism(s) through which Hax-1 potentiates Gα13-mediated Rac activation. However, it is interesting to note that Hax-1 contains the characteristic PXXXP motif (amino acids 198–202, PXXXP motif flanked by PXXP motifs on either side), which is known to be the binding motif for the PIX family of Rac/CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (27Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Hax-1 potentiates Rac activation by bringing Gα13 closer to a specific Rac-guanine-nucleotide exchange factor. Although our initial studies did not identify such interaction between PIX-β and Hax-1, 2J. H. Ha and N. Dhanasekaran, unpublished data. it is possible that a closely related guanine-nucleotide exchange factor may interact with Hax-1 through this site or other PXXP sites that are present in Hax-1. Further studies should define the mechanisms through which Hax-1 potentiates Gα13-stimulated activation of Rac. Previous studies have shown that Gα13 is critically required for the development of mouse embryos as Gα13-/- embryos are resorbed by day 10.5 (8Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The lethality of the Gα13-/- genotype is ascribed to the loss of Gα13-mediated cell motility associated with embryonic angiogenesis. It is intriguing to note that Gα12, although it shares 67% amino acid identity with Gα13 (6Radhika V. Dhanasekaran N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), failed to compensate for the loss of Gα13 in these embryos. Because both Gα12 and Gα13 can be stimulated by the same receptors to activate similar cellular responses, the molecular basis for the differential effect on cell motility remained elusive. In this context, the results presented here demonstrate that Hax-1 specifically interacts with Gα13 but not Gα12, and that such interaction is critical for Gα13-mediated cell motility that provides a molecular basis for such unique and differential signaling by Gα13. Further studies should define the role of Gα13-Hax-1 complexes in physiological responses that require cell movement or cytoskeletal changes mediated by Gα13. In light of the recent findings that Hax-1 is differentially expressed in hypoxic tumor progression (28Jiang Y. Zhang W. Keichii K. Klco J.M. Martin St T.B. Dufault M.R. Madden S.L. Kaelin W.G. Nacht M. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 453-462PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpressed in many different metastatic tumors as indicated by SAGE analysis (28Jiang Y. Zhang W. Keichii K. Klco J.M.

Glucose activation of cAMP synthesis is thought to be mediated by Gpa2 and its G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr1. Using a sensitive GTP-loading assay for Ras2 we demonstrate that glucose addition also triggers a fast increase in the GTP loading state of Ras2 concomitant with the glucose-induced increase in cAMP. This increase is severely delayed in a strain lacking Cdc25, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras proteins. Deletion of the Ras-GAPs IRA2 (alone or with IRA1) or the presence of RAS2Val19 allele causes constitutively high Ras GTP loading that no longer increases upon glucose addition. The glucose-induced increase in Ras2 GTP-loading is not dependent on Gpr1 or Gpa2. Deletion of these proteins causes higher GTP loading indicating that the two G-protein systems might directly or indirectly interact. Because deletion of GPR1 or GPA2 reduces the glucose-induced cAMP increase the observed enhancement of Ras2 GTP loading is not sufficient for full stimulation of cAMP synthesis. Glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase or the hexokinases is required for glucose-induced Ras2 GTP loading. These results indicate that glucose phosphorylation might sustain activation of cAMP synthesis by enhancing Ras2 GTP loading likely through inhibition of the Ira proteins.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the addition of glucose or other rapidly fermentable sugars to derepressed cells (carbon-starved or growing on a non-fermentable carbon source) triggers a remarkable variety of regulatory phenomena, including many rapid changes at the post-translational and transcriptional level. Several signaling pathways are activated by glucose. One of the best studied pathways is the cAMP/PKA 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; RBD, Ras-binding domain; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor. pathway. The main component of this signaling transduction pathway is adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cAMP. In S. cerevisiae adenylate cyclase activity is controlled by the Ras proteins. These proteins are members of the small GTPase superfamily, which are active in the GTP-bound form and inactive in the GDP-bound form. Recently it has been demonstrated that in S. cerevisiae adenylate cyclase activity is also controlled by a heterotrimeric Gα-protein, Gpa2 (1Nakafuku M. Obara T. Kaibuchi K. Miyajima I. Miyajima A. Itoh H. Nakamura S. Arai K. Matsumoto K. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A G-protein-coupled receptor, Gpr1, has been identified to be responsible for activation of the Gpa2 protein (2Kraakman L. Lemaire K. Ma P. Teunissen A.W. Donaton M.C. Van Dijck P.

Two triggers are known to activate the cAMP/PKA pathway: the addition of glucose to derepressed cells and intracellular acidification. The Gpr1/Gpa2 G-protein-coupled receptor system is only required for glucose activation of cAMP synthesis (2Kraakman L. Lemaire K. Ma P. Teunissen A.W. Donaton M.C. Van Dijck P.

The results reported in the literature about the role played by the Ras proteins in activation of cAMP synthesis are in part contradictory. Colombo et al. (5Colombo S. Ma P. Cauwenberg L. Winderickx J. Crauwels M. Teunissen A. Nauwelaers D. de Winde J.H. Gorwa M.F. Colavizza D. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3326-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) showed that intracellular acidification (but not glucose) caused an increase in the GTP/GDP ratio on the Ras proteins, suggesting that only intracellular acidification would stimulate cAMP synthesis through activation of the Ras proteins. Other data reported by Rudoni et al. (6Rudoni S. Colombo S. Coccetti P. Martegani E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using another assay show that the addition of glucose to glucose-starved cells also causes a fast increase of the Ras2-GTP level. Two different assays have been used to analyze quantitatively the guanine nucleotides bound to the Ras proteins in vivo. The first assay was developed by Gibbs et al. (7Gibbs J.B. Schaber M.D. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10426-10429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used by Colombo et al. (5Colombo S. Ma P. Cauwenberg L. Winderickx J. Crauwels M. Teunissen A. Nauwelaers D. de Winde J.H. Gorwa M.F. Colavizza D. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3326-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). After labeling the cells in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, the Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the human Ras protein (v-H-ras 259). Guanine nucleotides were extracted, separated by TLC, and quantitated by phosphorimager technology. With this assay, the GTP/GDP ratio on the yeast Ras proteins could be measured only after overexpression of Ras2 protein indicating that the sensitivity of this assay is probably not very high. A more recent assay to analyze quantitatively the guanine nucleotides bound to the Ras proteins in vivo was described by Taylor and Shalloway (8Taylor S. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and exploits the known specificity of the interaction between Ras-GTP and the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 to detect activated Ras. Because there is a high degree of homology between yeast and mammalian Ras proteins, the yeast Ras proteins are able to interact with the RBD of Raf-1. As a result the assay could be used successfully by Rudoni et al. (6Rudoni S. Colombo S. Coccetti P. Martegani E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to measure the GTP loading on yeast Ras2 without overexpression of this protein. In this work we have used the highly sensitive non-radioisotopic pull-down assay for Ras2 GTP loading to study the requirements for the rapid glucose enhancement of GTP loading. We show that it is dependent on Cdc25 and that deletion of the Ira proteins causes constitutively high GTP loading. Remarkably, also deletion of GPR1 or GPA2 enhances basal and induced Ras2 GTP loading. It is known that glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase or the hexokinases is required for glucose-induced cAMP signaling (9Beullens M. Mbonyi K. Geerts L. Gladines D. Detremerie K. Jans A.W.H.

This glucose phosphorylation requirement can also be fulfilled in a glucose transport deficient strain by provision of intracellular maltose (11Rolland F. Wanke V. Cauwenberg L. Ma P. Boles E. Vanoni M. de Winde J.H. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2001; 1403: 1-13Google Scholar). We show that glucose-induced Ras2 GTP loading is dependent on precisely the same requirements indicating that glucose phosphorylation probably acts through Ras to sustain cAMP signaling. Finally we provide evidence that the Ras proteins might be a target for the stringent feedback inhibition of PKA on cAMP synthesis.

Deletions in HXK1, HXK2, GLK1, and IRA2 genes were checked by PCR. Strains W303–1A (YCpRAS2) and W303–1A (YCpRAS2Val19) were obtained by transforming strain W303–1A with plasmids YCpRAS2 and YCpRAS2Val19 (12Robinson L.A. Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Sigal I.S.

Determination of the Ras2-GTP/Total Ras2 Ratio in Vivo—Determination of the ratio Ras2-GTP/total Ras2 was performed essentially as described by Taylor and Shalloway (8Taylor S. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) with some modification (6Rudoni S. Colombo S. Coccetti P. Martegani E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This assay exploits the known specificity of the interaction between Ras-GTP and the RBD of Raf-1 to detect activated Ras. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6, (108 cells/ml) for about 20 min. At time 0 glucose or DNP was added, and samples were collected by filtration on nitrocellulose filters. After the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, one tablet of Protease Inhibitor Mixture from Roche Applied Science in 50 ml of extraction medium), cells were disrupted with glass beads in a Fastprep instrument. Cleared supernatant (containing 200 μg of total protein) was incubated with 20 μl of bed volume of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RBD fusion protein pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The GST·RBD fusion protein was prepared using the expression vector pGEX2T-RBD, which encodes amino acids 1–149 of Raf-1 fused to GST. This plasmid was kindly provided by A. Wittinghofer (Max-Planck Institute, Dortmund, Germany). The expression of GST·RBD fusion protein in Escherichia coli was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4–5 h at 30 °C, and the fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA and subsequently with complex phosphate-buffered saline buffer (phosphate-buffered saline 1×, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, one tablet of Protease Inhibitor Mixture from Roche Applied Science in 50 ml of this solution). Bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS-sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v β-mercaptoethanol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (w/v) glycerol), separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, immunodecorated with anti-Ras2 polyclonal antibodies (SC-6759, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and revealed with an ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Total Ras2 protein was detected in cleared lysate by Western blotting using the same anti-Ras2 antibodies. The ratios of Ras2-GTP/total Ras2 were determined by densitometric analysis (Scion-Image software). All experiments were done in triplicate, and error bars are reported in the figures. In our experimental conditions anti-Ras2 antibodies recognize in a specific way yeast Ras2 protein as shown in Fig. 1A because no signal was detected in strains bearing a RAS2 deletion. For evaluation of the reliability of the assay we set up conditions to load purified Ras2 protein specifically either with GTP or with GDP. For this purpose 1 μg of purified Ras2 protein (13Jacquet E. Parrini M.C. Bernardi E. Martegani E. Parmeggiani A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline 1× (containing one tablet of Protease Inhibitor Mixture in 50 ml of buffer) in the presence of 5 mm EDTA and either 1 mm GTP or 1 mm GDP. The removal of Mg2+ by EDTA partially unfolds the protein and induces an open conformation enhancing the binding of either GTP or GDP. Immediately after incubation, an excess amount of MgCl2 (20 mm) was added to refold the Ras2 protein so that the nucleotide was locked in the protein. Both these fractions were incubated with GST·RBD fusion protein pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS-sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, immunodecorated with anti-Ras2 polyclonal antibodies (SC-6759, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and revealed with the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Total Ras2 protein (bound either to GTP or to GDP) was detected by Western blotting using the same anti-Ras2 antibodies. Only the activated form of Ras2 was able to bind to the resin (Fig. 1B) indicating that the assay is specific for Ras2-GTP. Overexpression of Ras2 Abolishes Glucose-induced GTP Loading on Ras2—We previously reported an increase in the GTP-loading state of Ras after intracellular acidification with the protonophore 2,4 dinitrophenol using a method based on in vivo labeling of strains overexpressing Ras2. This method, however, did not revealed a glucose-induced increase in Ras GTP loading (5Colombo S. Ma P. Cauwenberg L. Winderickx J. Crauwels M. Teunissen A. Nauwelaers D. de Winde J.H. Gorwa M.F. Colavizza D. Thevelein J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3326-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). More recently, we adopted the more sensitive Ras-GTP/Raf interaction assay, and this allowed us to demonstrate a rapid activation of Ras2 upon the addition of glucose to glucose-starved cells (6Rudoni S. Colombo S. Coccetti P. Martegani E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We now show, using the more sensitive assay, that the overexpression of Ras2 abolished the glucose-induced increase in Ras2-GTP and delays the increase triggered by intracellular acidification (Fig. 2B), whereas a fast increase was obtained in a wild-type W303–1A strain after the addition of glucose (Fig. 2, A, C, and D) or 2,4 dinitrophenol (Fig. 2A). This provides an explanation for the discrepancy between the results of our two previous studies and confirms the results reported by Rudoni et al. (6Rudoni S. Colombo S. Coccetti P. Martegani E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) performed with a different wild type strain. The inset of Fig. 2B shows a Western blot giving a rough evaluation of the Ras2 overexpression in W303 (YepRAS2); from this data a 15-fold increase was calculated in comparison with the wild type W303–1A. Addition of Glucose Enhances the Ras2-GTP Level and the Rapid Increase Is Dependent on Cdc25—Because the addition of glucose triggered a rapid increase in the Ras2-GTP level we have evaluated whether this increase was dependent on Cdc25, the main GDP/GTP exchange factor for Ras in yeast. The addition of 100 mm glucose to derepressed cells of a strain deleted for CDC25 and rescued by overexpression of TPK1 did not show the rapid increase in the Ras2-GTP/total Ras2 ratio (Fig. 3). The Ras2 GTP loading state increased slowly to a level similar to that of the wild type strain. Hence, Cdc25 is required for the rapid increase. It is also evident that TPK1 overexpression has a negative effect on Ras2 GTP loading. This could be due to a feedback caused by high PKA activity and suggests (as reported later) that Ras2 is a possible target of the feedback inhibition. Ira1 and Ira2 Negatively Regulate the Ras2 Protein Activation State and Are Required for the Glucose-induced Increase in Ras2 GTP Loading—Tanaka et al. (14Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Matsumoto K. Kaziro Y. Toh-e A. Cell. 1990; 60: 803-807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) reported that in ira mutants the Ras2 proteins accumulate in the GTP-bound form, whereas in the wild type strain these proteins were found mostly in the GDP-bound form, indicating that Ira1 and Ira2 negatively regulate the level of Ras-GTP. Our results with the new assay confirm these conclusions. In a strain containing only the wild type IRA2 gene (ira1Δ) the initial Ras2-GTP/total Ras2 ratio was about 3 times higher compared with wild type cells. However, the ratio still increased after the addition of glucose (Fig. 4A). In a strain containing only the IRA1 gene (ira2Δ) the initial ratio was about 6 times higher than in the wild type strain indicating that Ira2 plays a prominent role in controlling the basal Ras2 GTP loading state. In addition, this strain did not show any further glucose-induced increase in Ras2 GTP loading (Fig. 4A). A similar result was obtained for the ira1Δ ira2Δ strain indicating that the Ira proteins (and mainly Ira2) are essential to obtain a normal glucose-induced increase in Ras2 GTP loading probably because the inhibition or deletion of these GTPases already triggers a maximal GTP loading before the addition of the sugar. To confirm the importance of Ras-GTPase activating capacity and/or guanine nucleotide exchange capacity for the glucose-induced increase in Ras-GTP loading we used a strain expressing the RAS2Val19 dominant allele. This allele has strongly reduced GTPase activity, is insensitive to the Ira proteins, and is also independent of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors Cdc25 and Sdc25. The results obtained were similar to those for the ira1Δ ira2Δ strain. The basal level of Ras2 GTP loading was high, and there was no further glucose-induced increase (Fig. 4B). This effect was specific for RAS2Val19 because a similar experiment with a strain bearing the normal RAS2 gene in the same centromeric vector (YCpRAS2) gave a response practically identical to a wild type (Fig. 4B); however in this case the level of Ras2 overexpression was about 2-fold as shown also in Fig. 1A, lane 2). Role of the Gpr1-Gpa2 G-protein-coupled Receptor (GPCR) System in Regulation of the Ras2 Protein Activation State— Because the G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr1 and its Gα protein Gpa2 are required for the stimulation of cAMP synthesis by high glucose levels (2Kraakman L. Lemaire K. Ma P. Teunissen A.W. Donaton M.C. Van Dijck P. Winderickx J. de Winde J.H. Thevelein J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32 (A. W.): 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 3Xue Y.

Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2001; 1403: 1-13Google Scholar), we have investigated whether they are also required for the glucose-induced increase in Ras2 GTP loading. Both in a gpr1Δ and in a gpa2Δ strain the glucose-induced increase was still present (Fig. 5A). Remarkably however, the GTP loading state of Ras2 was enhanced in both strains. This indicates that the GPCR system in some way negatively interferes with the activation of Ras2. It has been demonstrated that the glucose-induced increase in cAMP is dependent on two mechanisms: a glucose-phosphorylation dependent mechanism, which is already stimulated by low glucose levels of a few millimolars, and the GPCR-dependent mechanism, which is only triggered by high glucose levels (20–100 mm) (11Rolland F. Wanke V. Cauwenberg L. Ma P. Boles E. Vanoni M. de Winde J.H. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. FEMS Yeast Res. 2001; 1403: 1-13Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the glucose concentration on Ras2 GTP loading, we have measured the Ras2 activation state during sequential addition of a low (5 mm) glucose concentration followed 3.5 min later by a high (100 mm) glucose concentration. Fig. 5B shows that addition of 5 mm glucose did not trigger a detectable increase in Ras2-GTP in the wild type strain. However, in the gpr1Δ and gpa2Δ strains an increase was observed (Fig. 5B), consistent with the previous observation that the absence of Gpr1 or Gpa2 facilitates Ras activation. Subsequent addition of 100 mm glucose triggered in all strains a further increase in Ras2 GTP; this increase was again more pronounced in gpr1Δ and gpa2Δ strains. Glucose Activation of Ras2 Is Dependent on Active Sugar Kinases—In S. cerevisiae glucose phosphorylation is mediated by three isoenzymes. The hexokinases Hxk1 and Hxk2 phosphorylate glucose as well as fructose (15Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. Genetics. 1977; 86: 727-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the glucokinase Glk1 can only phosphorylate glucose (16Maitra P.K. Lobo Z. Genetics. 1983; 105: 501-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any one of the three isoenzymes can sustain glucose-induced cAMP signaling, whereas specifically one of the two hexokinases is required for fructose-induced cAMP signaling (9Beullens M. Mbonyi K. Geerts L. Gladines D. Detremerie K. Jans A.W.H. Thevelein J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Rolland F. de Winde J.H. Lemaire K. Boles E. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have investigated the requirement for glucose phosphorylation using a strain lacking the three sugar kinases (hxk1Δ hxk2Δ glk1Δ) or the two hexokinases (hxk1Δ hxk2Δ). In the latter strain only the glucokinase Glk1 is active. In the hxk1Δ hxk2Δ glk1Δ strain the glucose-induced increase in Ras2-GTP was absent, whereas in the hxk1Δ hxk2Δ strain the glucose-induced increase in Ras2-GTP was present but somewhat lower than in the wild type strain (Fig. 6). These results indicate that glucose phosphorylation is required for the glucose-induced increase in Ras2-GTP and that glucokinase alone can sustain the increase. Moreover when we tested the Ras2-GTP increase in a hxk1Δ, hxk2Δ, glk1Δ, ira2Δ strain we obtained a result comparable with that observed for ira2Δ strain (see Fig. 4A), a high basal level of Ras2-GTP that did not increase after glucose addition. This result suggests that glucose induced Ras2-GTP loading operates likely through an inhibition of the Ira2 protein. Glucose-induced Activation of Ras2 in a Glucose Transport-deficient Strain—Recent data have shown that the two essential requirements for glucose-induced activation of cAMP synthesis can be fulfilled separately: the extracellular glucose detection by the GPCR system and the intracellular sugarsensing process requiring the hexose kinases (10Rolland F. de Winde J.H.

https://openalex.org/W1975597142,"For successful generation of different cell types by asymmetric cell division, cell differentiation should be initiated only after completion of division. Here, we describe a control mechanism by which Caulobacter couples the initiation of a developmental program to the completion of cytokinesis. Genetic evidence indicates that localization of the signaling protein DivK at the flagellated pole prevents premature initiation of development. Photobleaching and FRET experiments show that polar localization of DivK is dynamic with rapid pole-to-pole shuttling of diffusible DivK generated by the localized activities of PleC phosphatase and DivJ kinase at opposite poles. This shuttling is interrupted upon completion of cytokinesis by the segregation of PleC and DivJ to different daughter cells, resulting in disruption of DivK localization at the flagellated pole and subsequent initiation of development in the flagellated progeny. Thus, dynamic polar localization of a diffusible protein provides a control mechanism that monitors cytokinesis to regulate development."

Lipid A without phosphate groups might provide selective advantages for F. tularensis during infections, since a strong innate immune response via TLR-4 would not be induced.We now describe an inner membrane phosphatase from Francisella novicida, a nonvirulent strain isolated from ground water (18Kieffer T.L. Cowley S. Nano F.E. Elkins K.L. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), that selectively removes the 1-phosphate group of lipid A. The Francisella enzyme is distantly related to the R. leguminosarum lipid A 1-phosphatase LpxE (10Karbarz M.J. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The FnlpxE gene was cloned based on its ability to confer low level polymyxin resistance in E. coli. Approximately 90% of the E. coli lipid A molecules are dephosphorylated at the 1-position in constructs expressing FnlpxE, converting most of the E. coli lipid A from the endotoxin to the adjuvant structure (15Persing D.H.

Typically, 100-ml cultures were grown to an A600 of 1.0. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. The cell pellets were washed with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer. The cells were disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i., and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, washed once by suspension in 10 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and then resuspended in the same buffer at a protein concentration of about 10 mg/ml. The protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (20Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

The reaction was terminated by spotting 5-μl samples onto a silica TLC plate, which was dried under a cold air stream for 30 min and then developed in the solvent chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:4, v/v/v/v). After drying and overnight exposure of the plate to a PhosphorImager screen, product formation was detected and quantified with an Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software.Expression Cloning of the F. novicida 1-Phosphatase Gene FnlpxE— Recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard protocols (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar, 22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from F. novicida U112 using the Easy DNA kit. Typically, 50 μg of genomic DNA was partially digested with 4 units of SauIIIAI in 200 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was then incubated at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate the enzyme. The products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel, and the 2–6-kb DNA fragments were excised and purified using the Gel Extraction kit. Plasmid pACYC184 was opened with BamHI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The 2–6-kb DNA fragments were then ligated into pACYC184 at 16 °C overnight in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 200 ng of genomic DNA fragments, 200 ng of pACYC184 vector, and 2 units of T4 DNA ligase. E. coli XL1-Blue cells were transformed by electroporation with the ligation mixture, and chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were selected on LB plates. About 15,000 colonies were pooled using a cell scraper and transferred into 250 ml of fresh LB broth, containing 30 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. Cells were grown to saturation, and 10 2-ml 16% glycerol stocks were made and stored at -80 °C.To select for the 1-phosphatase gene, a glycerol stock of the library was diluted to obtain about 500 colonies per LB plate, containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 1 μg/ml polymyxin. This amount of polymyxin causes several logs of killing of wild-type E. coli, although much less than the 10 μg/ml polymyxin used to select classical polymyxin-resistant mutants (2Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 3Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). The plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The colonies from 15 plates were scraped into 15 separate tubes containing 5 ml of LB broth, 1-ml portions of which were stored as glycerol stocks. Membranes were then prepared from the remaining 4 ml and assayed for 1-phosphatase activity. All of the pools were active, but the level was variable. The glycerol stock from the pool with the highest activity was used to repurify eight polymyxin-resistant colonies by streaking on LB plates, supplemented with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 1 μg/ml polymyxin. Cultures of the repurified colonies were then grown to late log phase and centrifuged. Only two of eight colonies grew under selective conditions in liquid medium. The cell pellets of these two strains were resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and disrupted with a French pressure cell. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The cell-free extracts of these cultures were assayed for 1-phosphatase activity. Both colonies tested in this manner were positive for 1-phosphatase activity. A representative strain expressing the 1-phosphatase activity was designated XW-1.The hybrid plasmid pXYW-1 was isolated from XW-1 using the Qiagen Spin Miniprep kit. The DNA insert was sequenced by using the Terminator Cycle system and the ABI Prism 377 instrument at the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility. According to the program ORF Finder (23Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Federhen S. Lash A.E. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U. Schuler G.D. Schriml L.M. Sequeira E. Tatusova T.A. Wagner L.

Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We assumed that this 717-bp DNA fragment would be the FnlpxE gene, encoding the 1-phosphatase in F. novicida.FnlpxE was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET28b vector behind the T7lac promoter. The forward PCR primer (5′-CGGATCCATGGTCAAACAGACATTACAAACAAACTTT-3′) was designed with a clamp region, a NcoI restriction site (underlined), and a match to the coding strand starting at the translation initiation site. The reverse primer (5′-CGGATCCTCGAGCTAAATAATCTCTCTATTTCTCATCC-3′) was designed with a clamp region, an XhoI restriction site (underlined), and a match to the anti-coding strand that included the stop codon. The PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase and plasmid pXYW-1 as the template. Amplification was carried out in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 100 ng of template, 250 ng of primers, and 2 units of Pfu polymerase. The reaction was started at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 55 °C), and extension (45 s at 72 °C). After the 25th cycle, a 10-min extension time was used. The reaction product was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. The desired band was excised and gel-purified. The PCR product was then digested using NcoI and XhoI and ligated into the expression vector pET28b that had been similarly digested and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The ligation mixture was transformed into XL1-Blue cells and screened for positive inserts on LB plates containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Plasmid pET28b-FnLpxE was isolated from the positive transformants, and the FnlpxE insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid pET28b-FnLpxE was then transformed into the E. coli expression strain Novablue (DE3). To construct pWSK29-FnLpxE, pET28b-FnLpxE was digested using XbaI and XhoI and ligated into the vector pWSK29 that had been similarly digested and treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The ligation mixture was transformed into XL1-Blue cells, and ampicillin-resistant transformants were selected on LB plates. The plasmid pWSK29-Fn-LpxE was isolated from the positive clones and then transformed into WBB06 to obtain WBB06/pWSK29-FnLpxE.

Briefly, the cells were grown, harvested by centrifugation, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were extracted for 1 h at room temperature with a single phase Bligh-Dyer mixture consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8, v/v/v). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant, containing the Kdo2-lipid A, was converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system by the addition of chloroform and dilute HCl to give the mixture chloroform, methanol, 0.1 m HCl (2:2:1.8, v/v/v). A few drops of pyridine were added to neutralize residual HCl in the lower phase, which was dried with a rotary evaporator. The lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v/v) and applied to a 2-ml DEAE-cellulose column, prepared as the acetate form in the same solvent (32Raetz C.R.H. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1098-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Raetz C.R.H. Purcell S. Meyer M.V. Qureshi N. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16080-16088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Kdo2-lipid A was eluted in steps with increasing amounts of ammonium acetate. The fractions containing the purified Kdo2-lipid A were pooled and converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system (34Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). The lower phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen. The final yield of purified Kdo2-lipid A was about 5 mg from 2 liters of late log phase cells. The Kdo2-lipid A was greater than 95% pure as judged by TLC analysis, followed by sulfuric acid charring and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (data not shown). The Kdo2-lipid A carrier (Fig. 1A) is acylated with a secondary myristate chain at position 3′, where the Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid A probe (Fig. 1C) is substituted with laurate. This has no effect on the activity of the 1-phosphatase (data not shown).To obtain 1-mg quantities of 1-dephospho-Kdo2-lipid A from cells, pWSK29-FnLpxE was transformed into WBB06 (35Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). WBB06/pWSK29-FnLpxE was grown to late log phase, and the 1-dephospho-Kdo2-lipid A was isolated by the same procedure used for Kdo2-lipid A. To further purify the material eluted from DEAE cellulose, the relevant fractions were pooled, dried, and dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of 50% aqueous acetonitrile (solvent A) and 85% aqueous isopropyl alcohol (solvent B), both of which also contained 1 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate. An octadecyl (C18) reverse phase column (2 ml) was prepared, and the sample was applied. The column was then eluted with 5 column volumes of each of the following A:B mixtures: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:6, each containing 1 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate. The 1-dephospho-Kdo2-lipid A eluted in the 1:2 fraction. The peak fractions were pooled, diluted 3-fold into chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v/v), and applied to a fresh 2-ml DEAE-cellulose column. The column was washed with 5 volumes of chloroform/methanol/water (2:3:1, v/v/v) and eluted with 10 column volumes of chloroform, methanol, 500 mm aqueous ammonium acetate (2:3:1, v/v/v). The relevant fractions were pooled and converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system. The lower phase was dried to obtain the purified 1-dephospho-Kdo2-lipid A. The final yield was about 2.5 mg from 1 liter of cells. The purity was confirmed by TLC, followed by sulfuric acid charring, and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown).Isolation of Lipid A Species from 32P-Labeled Cells—Typically, 20 ml of LB broth cultures were labeled with 5 μCi/ml 32Pi, starting at an initial A600 of 0.02. The 32P-labeled cells were grown, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of a single-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture, incubated at room temperature for 60 min, and centrifuged to remove insoluble debris. For WBB06 and related heptose-deficient strains, the supernatant contains the Kdo2-lipid A and glycerophospholipids. This was converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system by the addition of appropriate amounts of chloroform and water (34Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). For wild-type strains with a complete core domain, the lipid A is covalently attached to the LPS in the insoluble pellet. To recover the lipid A, the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 12.5 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) with 1% SDS and heated at 100 °C for 30 min (36Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The suspension was converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system by the addition of chloroform and methanol. After thorough mixing, the two phases were separated by centrifugation, and the upper phase was washed once with a fresh pre-equilibrated lower phase. The lower phases were pooled and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The dried lipids were redissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v). The 32P-labeled lipid A species were spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (10,000 cpm/lane), which was developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid/water (50:50:16:5, v/v/v/v) or chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:4, v/v/v/v), as indicated. After drying, the plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager Screen overnight.MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired using an AXIMA-CFR instrument from Kratos Analytical (Manchester, UK) with a nitrogen laser (337 nm), 20-kV extraction voltage, and time-delayed extraction. The samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF analysis by depositing 0.3 μl of the lipid sample dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v), followed by 0.3 μl of a saturated solution of 6-aza-2-thiothymine in 50% acetonitrile and 10% tribasic ammonium citrate (9:1, v/v) as the matrix. The samples were left to dry at room temperature before the spectra were acquired in both the positive and negative ion linear modes. Each spectrum was the average of 100 laser shots.RESULTSLipid A 1- and 4′-Phosphatase Activities in F. novicida Membranes—Although the lipid A of F. tularensis lacks phosphate groups, and its LPS contains only one Kdo residue (Fig. 1B) (4Vinogradov E.

https://openalex.org/W2029855429,"During meiosis, homologous chromosomes are sorted into pairs and are then intimately aligned, or synapsed, along their lengths while a proteinaceous structure, the synaptonemal complex, is assembled between them. However, little is known about how chromosomes first recognise each other1. Here we show, by comparing the behaviour of wild-type wheat and wheat mutant for Ph1 (a suppressor of homologous chromosome pairing), that when chromosomes recognise a partner to pair with, a conformational change to the chromatin is triggered in both partners that is followed by their intimate alignment. Thus, a conformational change in the chromosomes at the onset of meiosis can be correlated directly with recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2099837423,"Previously we reported that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), a key regulator in many intracellular signaling pathways, enhances the survival and migration of vascular endothelial cells. Here we investigated the effect of inhibition of GSK3β activity on the angiogenic function of endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) and demonstrated a new therapeutic angiogenesis strategy using genetically modified EPC. As we previously reported, two biologically distinct types of EPC, spindle-shaped “early EPC” and cobblestone-shaped “late EPC” could be cultivated from human peripheral blood. Catalytically inactive GSK3β gene was transduced into both EPC. Inhibition of GSK3β signaling pathway led to increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin and increased secretion of angiogenic cytokines (vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8). It enhanced the survival and proliferation of early EPC, whereas it promoted the survival and differentiation of late EPC. Transplantation of either of these genetically modified EPC into the ischemic hind limb model of athymic nude mouse significantly improved blood flow, limb salvage, and tissue capillary density compared with nontransduced EPC. Inhibition of GSK3β signaling of either of these genetically modified EPC augmented the in vitro and in vivo angiogenic potency of these cell populations. These data provide evidence that GSK3β has a key role in the angiogenic properties of EPC. Furthermore, the genetic modification of EPC to alter this signaling step can improve the efficacy of cell-based therapeutic vasculogenesis.

Inhibition of GSK3β signaling of either of these genetically modified EPC augmented the in vitro and in vivo angiogenic potency of these cell populations. These data provide evidence that GSK3β has a key role in the angiogenic properties of EPC. Furthermore, the genetic modification of EPC to alter this signaling step can improve the efficacy of cell-based therapeutic vasculogenesis. Previous studies have identified that normal adults have a small amount of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) 1The abbreviations used are: EPC, endothelial progenitor cell(s); GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; AdGSK-KM, adenoviral vector expressing kinase mutant GSK3β; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AdGFP, adenoviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein; EC, endothelial cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; T-PBS, PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; IL-8, interleukin-8; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. in peripheral blood (1Asahara T.

In response to cytokine stimulation, these cells are mobilized from bone marrow and home to the ischemic tissue and contribute to new vessel formation (3Takahashi T. Kalka C. Masuda H. Chen D.

According to these characteristics, EPC have been investigated as an agent for therapeutic angiogenesis (5Kalka C. Masuda H. Takahashi T. Kalka-Moll W.M. Silver M. Kearney M. Li T. Isner J.M.

These studies have shown that administration of EPC to animals with limb or myocardial ischemia can enhance neovascularization, salvage tissue, and improve myocardial function. Human clinical trials using autologous progenitor cells also showed improved myocardial viability and blood flow (8Assmus B. Schachinger V. Teupe C. Britten M. Lehmann R. Dobert N. Grunwald F. Aicher A. Urbich C. Martin H. Hoelzer D. Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Circulation. 2002; 106: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). However, there are several limitations in the therapeutic application of EPC. First, the amount of available EPC required for therapeutic angiogenesis is limited, so large amounts of peripheral blood are required (4Murohara T. Ikeda H. Duan J. Shintani S. Sasaki K. Eguchi H.

Furthermore, the isolated circulating cell population that contributes to postnatal neovascularization is heterogeneous and displays variable morphological growth characteristics. In this regard, EPC have been described either as spindle-shaped cells with limited proliferation capacity (1Asahara T. Murohara T. Sullivan A. Silver M. van der Zee R. Li T. Witzenbichler B.

Therefore, the genetic modification of EPC might overcome some of these limitations by altering the cell phenotype to promote the efficiency of cell-based therapeutic angiogenesis. Recently, efforts have been made to dissect the regulatory pathways that control the phenotypes of stem cell populations. Many of these studies have focused on the role of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. For example, it has been shown that Wnt signaling promotes the self-renewal of hematopoietic side population cells, neuronal precursor cells, and embryonic stem cells (18Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L.

For example, it has been shown that elevated Akt signaling can improve the survival of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (22Mangi A.A. Noiseux N. Kong D. He H. Rezvani M. Ingwall J.S. Dzau V.J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) and that phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt-signaling is a determinant of side population cell phenotype through regulation of the Bcrp1 transporter expression (23Mogi M.

GSK3β has also been shown to be involved in the regulation of angiogenesis through its ability to modulate vascular endothelial cell migration and survival (36Kim H.S. Skurk C. Thomas S.R. Bialik A.

Therefore, we reasoned that it might be possible to genetically manipulate GSK3β activity in EPC with viral vectors to alter their vasculogenic properties in vivo. Isolation and Culture of EPC from Human Peripheral Blood—All human projects in this study were approved by the institutional review board of the Seoul National University Hospital. Two kinds of EPC with different biological characteristics, spindle-shaped “early EPC” and cobblestone-shaped “late EPC,” were cultured as previously described (16Hur J. Yoon C.H. Kim H.S. Choi J.H. Kang H.J. Hwang K.K. Oh B.H. Lee M.M. Park Y.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from human volunteers and resuspended in the EGM-2 BulletKit system (Clonetics) consisting of endothelial basal medium, 5% fetal bovine serum, human epidermal growth factor, VEGF, human basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, ascorbic acid, and heparin. 1 × 107 mononuclear cells/well were seeded on a 2% gelatin (Sigma)-coated 6-well plate and incubated in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Under daily observation, the first medium change was done about 6 days after plating. Thereafter, media were changed every 3 days. Gene Transfer to Cell—Replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing catalytically inactive GSK3β (GSK3β-KM), where lysine residues at positions 85 and 86 were mutated to methionine and alanine, respectively, and control adenoviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used for gene delivery (36Kim H.S. Skurk C. Thomas S.R. Bialik A. Suhara T. Kureishi Y. Birnbaum M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Walsh K. J. Biol.

EPC cultured for 10 days were transduced with multiplicity of infection 50 of adenovirus-GSK3β-KM (AdGSK-KM) and control adenovirus-GFP (AdGFP) in EGM-2 medium with 2% fetal bovine serum for 12 h. Effective gene transfer was confirmed by more than 90% of green fluorescence-positive control EPC transduced with AdGFP, and cells were assayed or harvested. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed to confirm that the transduction of AdGSK-KM into EPC could lead to the sufficient expression of inactive phosphorylated GSK3β (36Kim H.S. Skurk C. Thomas S.R. Bialik A. Suhara T. Kureishi Y. Birnbaum M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Walsh K. J. Biol.

Early EPC and late EPC were transduced with multiplicity of infection 50 of AdGFP or AdGSK-KM for 12 h and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested by scraping in lysis buffer. After determination of concentration with a protein assay kit (Pierce), 30 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20 (T-PBS) and 3% dry milk and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Then membrane was washed three times with T-PBS and reblocked and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. To reprobe the membrane, it was treated with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce). The primary antibodies used with anti-phospho-GSK3β antibody (1:750 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-total GSK3 antibody (1:750 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:4000 dilution; Oncogene), and anti-phospho-β-catenin (1: 500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology). The secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2500 dilution; Promega). Densitometric quantitative analysis of the immunoblot result was performed using TINA 2.01 (Raytest). Analysis of β-Catenin Nuclear Translocation—The effect of GSK3β inhibition in canonical Wnt pathway was investigated by examining the subcellular localization of β-catenin. Early EPC and late EPC were washed in PBS, fixed with methanol for 30 min at -20 °C, and washed three times with ice-chilled T-PBS. Anti-β-catenin antibody and antimouse IgG/phycoerythrin were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively (1:1000, 1:2500 dilution; BD Biosciences). Nuclei were considered β-catenin-positive if staining intensity was equal to or greater than that seen in the cytoplasm (38Eberhart C.G. Argani P. Pediatr. Dev. Pathol. 2001; 4: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cytokine Secreted from Cells—For 3 days, 1 × 106 cells were incubated with growth factor-free EBM-2 medium, and then the supernatant was harvested. Cytokine concentration was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (VEGF, Quantikine; IL-8, R & D Systems) (16Hur J. Yoon C.H. Kim H.S. Choi J.H. Kang H.J. Hwang K.K. Oh B.H. Lee M.M. Park Y.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation and Survival Assay—Effect of GSK3β-KM gene transfer to EPC survival and proliferation was assessed by WST-1 assay. Briefly, 1 × 104 cells were seeded to each well of 96-well plates and incubated for 48 h. For evaluation of cell survival and cell proliferation, 200 μl of serum-free EBM-2 culture medium and EGM-2 with 5% fetal bovine serum were used, respectively. Then 20 μl of cell proliferation assay reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Absorbance of 440 nm was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Matrigel Network Formation Assay—A Matrigel network formation assay was performed to assess the effect of the GSK3β-KM gene on the ability of EPC to integrate into vascular structures. Both early EPC and late EPC were transduced with AdGFP or AdGSK-KM. Four-chamber slides (Nalgene) were coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson Labware), and 2 × 104 cells in 500 μl of EGM-2 medium were added to each chamber. After 24 h, the endothelial cell network formed by EPC was evaluated from images of four representative fields per chamber by computer-assisted analysis using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). Hind Limb Ischemia Model and Transplantation of Genetically Modified EPC—All procedures were approved by the Experimental Animal Committee of Clinical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital. Female athymic nude mice (n = 61; Jackson Laboratory), 7–8 weeks old and weighing 17–20 g, were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of a combination of anesthetics (ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg); Bayer Korea), and an ipsilateral femoral artery was surgically removed as previously described (5Kalka C. Masuda H. Takahashi T. Kalka-Moll W.M. Silver M. Kearney M. Li T. Isner J.M. Asahara T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pathol. 1998; 152: 1667-1679PubMed Google Scholar). EPC transduced with AdGFP or AdGSK-KM were washed gently five times with PBS, harvested by brief trypsinization and forceful pipetting, and resuspended with growth factor-free EBM-2 medium. Because a too high dose of EPC may salvage most limbs and conceal the effect of AdGSK-KM on the angiogenic potential of EPC (5Kalka C. Masuda H. Takahashi T. Kalka-Moll W.M. Silver M. Kearney M.

Silver M. Li T. Isner J.M. Asahara T. Circulation. 2002; 105: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), the dose of injected cells was empirically determined to be 2 × 105 cells/mouse through pilot experiments. As an administrative route for EPC, we chose direct cell injection into systemic arterial circulation to maximize delivery into ischemic skeletal muscle and reduce potential retainment by lung, liver, or spleen. One day after surgery, 2 × 105 of EPC in 100 μl of EBM-2 medium were injected into the left ventricular cavity of mice (5Kalka C. Masuda H. Takahashi T. Kalka-Moll W.M. Silver M. Kearney M. Li T. Isner J.M. Asahara T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3422-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). A syringe needle of 30 gauge was advanced via percutaneous subxyphoid access, and brief blood regurgitation was confirmed before and after cell injection to ensure intracardiac space injection. Mice received 1) AdGFP-early EPC (n = 17), 2) AdGSK-KM-early EPC (n = 16), or 3) AdGFP-late EPC (n = 18), or 4) AdGSK-KM-late EPC (n = 10). Evaluation of in Vivo Angiogenesis Effect of EPC—A laser Doppler perfusion imager (Moor Instruments), which maps tissue blood flow by the shift in the laser light frequency, was used for serial noninvasive physiological evaluation of neovascularization (5Kalka C. Masuda H. Takahashi T. Kalka-Moll W.M. Silver M. Kearney M. Li T. Isner J.M. Asahara T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3422-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). Each mouse was followed by serial recording of surface blood flow of hind limb on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21. After laser Doppler perfusion imager scanning, the digital color-coded images were analyzed to quantify blood flow of the area from the knee joint to toe, and mean values of perfusion were calculated. To avoid data variations due to ambient light and temperature, hind limb perfusion was expressed as the ratio of ischemic to nonischemic limb. Photographs of the limb were also recorded and visually analyzed as “limb salvage” (completely normal status without a sign of ischemia), “foot necrosis” (necrosis of toe or below knee), or “limb loss” (necrosis or loss of tissue above knee). Tissue capillary density was determined as a histological evaluation of neovascularization. At day 21, mice were euthanized by an overdose of anesthetics, and the lower calf muscles of the ischemic limb were harvested and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen-chilled isopentane. Tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek), and multiple slices were prepared in 10-μm thickness. Slices were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed briefly with PBS, and stained with TRITC-conjugated murine EC-specific Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin 1 (Sigma) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated human EC-specific Ulex europaeus lectin 1 (Sigma), each diluted 10 μg/ml in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Five random fields were selected from each slice, and fluorescent vascular ECs were counted to assess density of capillary composed of murine and/or human cell. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by means of Student's t test or analysis of variance. The incidence of limb salvage was evaluated by χ2. Provability values of two-tailed p < 0.05 were considered to denote statistical significance. Modulation of GSK3β Signaling Pathway by Dominant Negative GSK3β Transduction into EPC—Early and late EPC cultures were transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing GFP (AdGFP) or a catalytically inactive form of GSK3β (AdGSK-KM). Under the culture conditions, greater than 90% of the cells expressed GFP reporter gene (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis revealed that the transduction of AdGSK-KM into EPC could lead to increased expression of inactive phosphorylated GSK3β. Both early EPC and late EPC transduced with AdGSK-KM showed a marked increase of total GSK protein (early EPC, 2.5-fold; late EPC, 2.6-fold) and phosphorylated GSK3β (early EPC, 2.2-fold; late EPC, 7.5-fold) compared with control AdGFP-transduced EPC. Inactivated GSK3β signaling pathway in EPC transduced with AdGSK-KM was identified by the decrease of phosphorylated β-catenin (early EPC, 0.4-fold; late EPC, 0.7-fold) (Fig. 1, B and C). To investigate further the modulation of GSK3β signaling pathway by AdGSK-KM from biochemical perspective, nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a marker for Wnt pathway activation, was investigated at the subcellular level by direct β-catenin immunofluorescence staining. EPC transduced with AdGSK-KM showed profound nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and it was more significant in early EPC than late EPC (89.5 ± 5.2 versus 61.3 ± 9.1%, p < 0.05). EPC transduced with control AdGFP showed no nuclear β-catenin (Fig. 2A). The effect of GSK3β inactivation on the secretion of angiogenic cytokines from EPC, which is regarded as one of the major angiogenic mechanisms of EPC, was also investigated (10Rehman J. Li J. Orschell C.M. March K.L. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1164-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 16Hur J. Yoon C.H. Kim H.S. Choi J.H. Kang H.J. Hwang K.K. Oh B.H. Lee M.M. Park Y.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The concentrations of VEGF and IL-8, which is under the regulation of the GSK3β signaling pathway (41Sodhi A. Montaner S. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In early EPC, transduction of AdGSK-KM led to significantly increased secretion of VEGF and IL-8 (VEGF, 132.3 ± 9.3 versus 247.5 ± 26.1 pg/105 cells, p = 0.002; IL-8, 401.7 ± 21.6 versus 516.7 ± 11.7 pg/106 cells, p = 0.001). In late EPC also, transduction of AdGSK-KM led to a significant increase of IL-8 secretion (265.7 ± 23.4 versus 334.4 ± 10.1 pg/106 cells, p = 0.01), although it did not affect the amount of VEGF that was barely secreted from late EPC (Fig. 2B). Effect of AdGSK-KM on the in Vitro Angiogenesis Model—A Matrigel network formation assay was performed to investigate the ability of EPC to form endothelial cell networks reminiscent of tubules. Both AdGFP- and AdGSK-KM-transduced early EPC in Matrigel showed little evidence of endothelial network formation. In contrast, late EPC formed an endothelial network reminiscent of tubules, and the network formation was more evident when late EPC was transduced with AdGSK-KM than with control AdGFP (network length: 2.04 ± 0.15 versus 1.11 ± 0.72 mm, respectively, p < 0.05; network circle number: 7.3 ± 3.1 versus 2.4 ± 1.6/mm2, respectively, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). Effect of AdGSK-KM on EPC Proliferation and Survival— Transduction of GSK3β-KM significantly increased survival of both early and late EPC exposed to serum-free condition (early EPC, 1.8-fold; late EPC, 1.7-fold). Transduction of GSK3β-KM also increased proliferation of early EPC (1.4-fold) cultured in medium with growth factors but did not affect the proliferation of late EPC cultures in the same condition (Fig. 3B). Effect of AdGSK-KM on the in Vivo Angiogenesis Model—The in vivo angiogenic effect of GSK3β-KM-transduced EPC in a murine model of hind limb ischemia was evaluated. Serial evaluation of hind limb blood perfusion by laser Doppler perfusion imager revealed significant improvement in vascular perfusion at 21 days using either early or late EPC transduced with GSK3β-KM compared with control EPC transduced with GFP or media (Fig. 4, A and B). Capillary densities were also evaluated in tissue sections retrieved at day 21 from lower calf muscle of ischemic hind limb. We confirmed that the endothelial morphology of histological murine skeletal muscle specimen is appropriate, by various staining methods including the classic histological method (hematoxylin-eosin), using biochemical characteristics (alkaline phosphatase), and the immunologic method using surface marker (CD31) (Fig. 5A). Higher capillary densities were observed in mice that received either early or late EPC transduced with GSK3β-KM, corroborating the vascular perfusion measured by laser Doppler perfusion imager (early EPC, 2.0-fold increase; late EPC, 1.6-fold increase) (Fig. 5B). The incorporation of human EPC into the skeletal capillary system was assessed using immunofluorescence staining with human-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-co"
https://openalex.org/W2044820175,"The human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is exposed to wide temperature fluctuations during its life cycle, ranging from 25 °C in the mosquito vector and 37 °C in humans to 41 °C during febrile episodes in the patient. The repeated occurrence of fever at regular intervals is a characteristic of human malaria. We have examined the influence of repeated exposure to elevated temperatures encountered during fever on the intraerythrocytic development of the parasite. Using flow cytometry, we show that repeated exposure to temperatures mimicking febrile episodes promotes parasite development in human erythrocytes. Heat shock-mediated cytoprotection and growth promotion is dependent on the heat shock protein 90 (PfHsp90) multi-chaperone complex. Inhibition of PfHsp90 function using geldanamycin attenuates temperature-dependent progression from the ring to the trophozoite stage. Geldanamycin inhibits parasite development by disrupting the PfHsp90 complex consisting of PfHsp70, PfPP5, and tubulin, among other proteins. While explaining the contribution of febrile episodes to the pathogenesis of malaria, our results implicate temperature as an important environmental cue used by the parasite to coordinate its development in humans.

While explaining the contribution of febrile episodes to the pathogenesis of malaria, our results implicate temperature as an important environmental cue used by the parasite to coordinate its development in humans. The pathogenesis of human malaria is caused by intra-erythrocytic growth of the parasite. Entry of the parasite into an erythrocyte triggers its metamorphosis to a complex cell, rich in endomembrane system and capable of complex trafficking events (1Bannister L.H. Hopkins J.M. Fowler R.E. Krishna S. Mitchell G.H. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The transformation is evident during the progression of the parasite from the early stage of establishment, namely rings, to the biosynthetically active stage called the trophozoite. Trophozoites finally convert to schizonts and undergo nuclear division to form multiple merozoites. Molecular signals and components orchestrating the asexual cycle of the parasite remain poorly understood. Coordination of stage transitions is likely to depend on environmental cues available to the parasite.The occurrence of febrile episodes, resulting in body temperatures as high as 41 °C, is a common manifestation of malaria (2Bruce-Chwatt L.J. Black R.H. Canfield C.J. Clyde D.F. Peters W. Wernsdorfer W.H. Chemotherapy of Malaria. 2nd Ed. World Health Organization, Geneva1986: 120Google Scholar). The release of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is believed to be responsible for the appearance of fever in malaria patients (3Karnumaweera N.D. Grau G.E. Gamage P. Carter R. Mendis K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3200-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and fever is known to augment the pathogenesis of malaria (4Udomsangpetch R. Pipitaporn B.

There are a number of reports in the literature addressing the influence of elevated temperature encountered during malarial fever on the host (5Brandts C.H. Ndjave M. Graninger W. Kremsner P.G. Lancet. 1997; 350: 704-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) as well as the parasite (6Kwiatkowski D. J. Exp.

Keeping in view the augmentative effects of fever on the severity of malaria, antipyretics have been suggested to have beneficial effects on the patient (5Brandts C.H. Ndjave M. Graninger W. Kremsner P.G. Lancet. 1997; 350: 704-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Details about the influence of repeated occurrences of fever on the growth of the malarial parasite are only partly explored.In addition to the periodic appearance of fever, which is a characteristic of tertian malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, subtertian fever is commonly seen in patients infected with P. falciparum (2Bruce-Chwatt L.J. Black R.H. Canfield C.J. Clyde D.F. Peters W. Wernsdorfer W.H. Chemotherapy of Malaria. 2nd Ed. World Health Organization, Geneva1986: 120Google Scholar, 5Brandts C.H. Ndjave M. Graninger W. Kremsner P.G. Lancet. 1997; 350: 704-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Body temperatures of these patients reach as high as 41 °C, extending irregularly over a period of >24 h (3Karnumaweera N.D. Grau G.E. Gamage P. Carter R. Mendis K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3200-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To mimic the repeated appearance of fever, we have examined the influence of two heat shocks separated by an interval of 10 h on the growth of the malarial parasite in culture. Using flow cytometry to examine parasite stage transitions, we find that the exposure of parasites to a prior heat shock accelerates their development from the ring stage to the trophozoite stage during the subsequent heat shock. In the absence of the prior heat shock, exposure to second heat shock alone results in significant death of the parasite. Acceleration of the critical stage switch resulting from the exposure to prior heat shock also translates into a robust increase in the productivity of the infection cycle. Using geldanamycin (GA), 1The abbreviations used are: GA, geldanamycin; PHS, prior heat shock; non-HS, non-heat shock; Pf, Plasmodium falciparum; PP5, protein phosphatase 5; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: GA, geldanamycin; PHS, prior heat shock; non-HS, non-heat shock; Pf, Plasmodium falciparum; PP5, protein phosphatase 5; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a specific inhibitor of Hsp90 function, we show that the growth-promoting effects of prior heat shock depend on the PfHsp90 multi-chaperone complex. Exposure to GA following exposure to prior heat shock (PHS) interfered with parasite stage conversion. The accelerative effect of PHS was only attenuated and not blocked by GA, indicating the dominant potentiating influence of PHS on parasite development. GA brings about the inhibition of PfHsp90 function by disrupting its complex consisting of PfHsp70, PfPP5, and tubulin, among other proteins. Our results provide an additional basis for the augmentative effects of fever on the pathogenesis of malaria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFlow Cytometry—P. falciparum strain 3D7 was cultured using standard protocols (8Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W. Carlton J.M. Pain A. Nelson K.E. Bowman S. Paulsen I.T. James K. Eisen J.A. Rutherford K. Salzberg S.L. Craig A. Kyes S. Chan M.S. Nene V. Shallom S.J.

Subramanian G.M. Mungall C. Venter J.C. Carucci D.J. Hoffman S.L. Newbold C. Davis R.W. Fraser C.M. Barrell B. Nature. 2002; 419: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was carried out essentially as described earlier but with a few modifications (9Saito-Ito A. Akai Y. He S. Kimura M. Kawabata M. Parasitol. Int. 2001; 50: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, parasites were purified on 75% Percoll. Parasite cultures were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and layered on 75% Percoll prepared in PBS. Following centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 25 min, uninfected erythrocytes form pellets at the bottom, whereas the infected erythrocytes appear at the interface between Percoll and PBS. Percoll purification of infected erythrocytes was carried out thrice to remove uninfected red blood cells from the samples. We obtained a purity of infected cells of >98% using this protocol, and this result was confirmed by Giemsa staining and microscopic examination.30 μl of a suspension of purified parasites was added to 600 μl of staining solution (8 mg/liter acridine orange, 1 g/liter dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, 10 mm tricine, and 120 mm NaH2PO4, pH 9.2) and injected into a flow cytometer (FACScan; BD Biosciences) equipped with an argon ion laser set at 488 nm at a power output of 15 milliwatts. Green fluorescence was detected at 560 nm. 10,000 cells were counted for each sample and plotted in a (side scatter) scattergram (cell granularity, linear scale) against green fluorescence (DNA content, logarithmic scale). For identification of scattergrams corresponding to rings (0–24 h post-synchronization) and trophozoites (24–36 h post-synchronization), parasites were synchronized by two sorbitol treatments for two successive generations to obtain a highly synchronous population (>90% synchronous), and aliquots of culture were analyzed as described above. Regions corresponding to rings and trophozoites were highlighted using the gating function in WinList software. An aliquot of each stage was also stained with Giemsa stain and examined under a Carl Zeiss Axiocam microscope. All samples used for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis were also tested by the conventional method of Giemsa staining and microscopic examination.Temperature Shifts in P. falciparum Cultures—Highly synchronous ring stage parasites (synchronized ∼2–4 h post-invasion) purified on Percoll were subjected to a PHS at 40 °C (phase A) for 2 h followed by incubation at 37 °C (phase B) for 10 h. Cultures were then shifted to 40 °C (phase C) for 12 h with or without 10 μm GA treatment. Samples kept at 37 °C during phase A were used as control. Cultures that were kept at 37 °C during all phases (Phase A, B, and C) were used as non-heat shock (non-HS) control. 30 μl of parasite culture was withdrawn at hours 0 and 12 of phase C and suspended in 600 μl of the staining solution described above. The number of parasites in 100 μl of this suspension was then counted using the flow cytometer. Parasitemia was also measured using the conventional method of Giemsa staining and microscopic examination. Parasite stages at hours 0, 6, and 12 of phase C were analyzed by flow cytometry as well as Giemsa staining. For analysis of the effect of prior heat shock on overall asexual development, parasite cultures in the ring stage that were not purified on Percoll were subjected to the 40 °C (phase A, 2 h), 37 °C (phase B, 10 h), and 40 °C (phase C, 24 h) phases and then shifted to 37 °C (phase D) for an additional 12 h to allow an invasion of fresh erythrocytes to occur. As control, we used parasites that were kept at 37 °C during the entire intra-erythrocytic cycle. At the end of phase D, parasites were purified on Percoll and suspended in 100 μl of PBS. 30 μl of this suspension was then diluted into 600 μl of the staining solution described above, and the number of parasites in 100 μl was counted using the flow cytometer. Parasite stages for control and PHS cultures were examined at the end of phase C by flow cytometry.Solid Phase GA Binding Assay—GA was coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (10Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Trophozoite stage parasites were lysed in 10 volumes of TNESV buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm orthovanadate) and lysate incubated with either GA-coupled beads or control beads. Bound and unbound fractions of the lysate were probed for PfHsp90 by immunoblotting (11Banumathy G. Singh V. Pavithra S.R. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18336-18345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Co-immunoprecipitation—Ring stage parasites were labeled with [35S]Cys and [35S]Met for 24 h. Saponin-released parasites were sonicated briefly in NETT buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and lysate-immunoprecipitated using α-PfHsp90 antibody. Following five washes with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl in PBS), the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography.Analysis of PfHsp90 Complex—For analysis of the PfHsp90 complex under mild lysis conditions, trophozoite stage parasites were released with saponin and lysed by brief sonication in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). After clarification, the supernatant was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and fractions 17–28 were analyzed for PfHsp90 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To look at the effect of GA on the PfHsp90 complex, saponin-released trophozoites were sonicated briefly in hypotonic lysis buffer. Clarified supernatant was loaded on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with hypotonic lysis buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions 20 and 21 were collected. Fractions from five such runs were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon (Millipore). The concentrate was divided into two and treated with either Me2SO or 100 μm GA for 2 h at room temperature and rerun through the Superdex 200 column. Fractions 17–28 were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and probed for PfHsp90 by immunoblotting.RESULTSExposure to Prior Heat Shock Confers Protection against Subsequent Heat Shock—To examine the influence of recurrent febrile episodes on the growth of the parasite, we exposed parasite cultures to 40 °C and analyzed their development during the subsequent exposure to 40 °C using flow cytometry. The increase in DNA content seen during ring to trophozoite transition allowed us to differentiate between these two stages through flow cytometry by measuring green fluorescence due to the acridine orange staining of parasites. To define scattergrams corresponding to the ring (0–24 h post-synchronization) and trophozoite (24–36 h post-synchronization) stages, we purified highly synchronous populations of these stages on 75% Percoll and analyzed their scattergrams by flow cytometry. Fig. 1A shows scattergrams corresponding to rings (left) and trophozoites (middle). The insets show the corresponding Giemsastained stage. The superimposition of these scattergrams as shown at the right in Fig. 1A clearly indicated that it was possible to differentiate between rings and trophozoites by this approach.Ring-infected erythrocytes were exposed to 40 °C for 2 h (PHS, phase A) and, after an interval of 10 h at 37 °C (phase B), were exposed to 40 °C (phase C) again. The effect of heat shock on overall parasitemia and the conversion to trophozoite stage was monitored by examining scattergrams at 0-, 6-, and 12-h time intervals during the second heat shock (phase C) by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As control, a sample was maintained at 37 °C without prior exposure to heat shock (control, phase A), and stages were monitored during the second heat shock (phase C) at equivalent time points. Cultures kept at 37 °C during all three phases (phases A, B, and C) were also used as control (non-HS control). The scheme of temperature shifts is depicted in Fig. 1B (right). As shown in Fig. 1B (left), control cultures incubated at 37 °C without a prior heat shock showed a significant drop in parasite count during the second heat shock. Parasites exposed to a prior heat shock, on the other hand, did not show any growth inhibition during the second heat shock. As expected, the non-HS control cultures did not show any drop in parasite number. Estimation of parasitemia by Giemsa staining and microscopic examination produced the same results (not shown). Furthermore, comparison of scattergrams (Fig. 1C, left) showed that whereas control cultures exposed to the second heat shock alone persisted in the ring stage at the 6-h time interval, parasites exposed to a prior heat shock had already progressed to the trophozoite stage at 6 h. The pattern of stage progression in cultures exposed to the second heat shock alone was similar to that of the non-HS control cultures, indicating that the second heat shock alone did not cause any retardation of parasite stage transition. These results were also corroborated by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained smears at each time interval as shown in the inset (Fig. 1C) of each scattergram. The results showed that exposure to the first febrile episode may exert a protective effect against the febrile temperatures encountered subsequently. Growth-promoting effects of heat shock were also observed upon the exposure of parasites to 40 °C phases separated by an interval of 48 h to mimic conditions of tertian malaria (not shown).Exposure to Prior Heat Shock Results in a Greater Productivity of the Infection Cycle—We examined whether the enhanced progression from ring to trophozoite seen in response to elevated temperature results in greater efficiency of the infection cycle. Ring stage parasites were subjected to a prior heat shock at 40 °C for 2 h (phase A) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 h (phase B). Parasites were then given a second heat shock at 40 °C for 24 h (phase C) and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 12 h (phase D) to monitor new rings formed following an invasion of fresh erythrocytes (see bottom of Fig. 2A). Cultures kept at 37 °C throughout the intra-erythrocytic cycle were used as control. We found an almost 2-fold increase in the number of rings formed in cultures exposed to prior heat shock (Fig. 2A, top). The result indicated that exposure to heat shock brought about an overall increase in the productivity of the infection cycle. To rule out the possibility that this increase was due to a delay in stage progression of the control cultures, we examined the scattergrams of the control and PHS-treated cultures at the end of phase C. As shown in Fig. 2B, top, the control cultures had also progressed to trophozoites at the end of phase C.Fig. 2Exposure to prior heat shock causes greater productivity of the infection cycle. A, ring stage cultures subjected to temperature shifts from 40 (phase A) to 37 (phase B) to 40 °C (phase C) were treated further at 37 °C (phase D) to allow an invasion of fresh erythrocytes to occur. As control, cells were treated at 37 °C throughout the intra-erythrocytic cycle. The number of newly formed rings was counted by flow cytometry (top) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At the bottom is shown a schematic representation of the experiment. B, parasite stages were examined at the end of phase C for control and PHS cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)GA Blocks Protection Due to Prior Heat Shock—To examine the involvement of heat shock proteins in growth protection, we made use of GA, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90 function (10Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 12Schneider C. Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl U.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We included 10 μm GA in cultures during the shift from 37 °C (phase B) to 40 °C (phase C). Fig. 3A, right, shows a schematic representation of the experiment. There was significant conversion from ring to trophozoite in PHS cultures treated with the Me2SO carrier at 6 h (Fig. 3A, left, top row), but cultures exposed to GA remained blocked in the ring stage until 6 h (Fig. 3A, left, second row from top). At 12 h, however, a significant population of parasites exposed to PHS had progressed to the trophozoite stage despite the presence of GA. This was in contrast to cells that did not experience a heat shock, remaining blocked as rings even at 12 h of development (Fig. 3A, left, bottom two rows) as reported previously (11Banumathy G. Singh V. Pavithra S.R. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18336-18345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The result showed that exposure to PHS was able to overcome GA-mediated growth inhibition. This was also evident from an examination of the Giemsa-stained smears for these samples as shown in the inset of each scattergram (Fig. 3A, left). This result suggested that PfHsp90 function was important to trigger parasite transformation from ring to trophozoite in response to heat shock. The quantitation of parasite number by flow cytometry at 0 and 12 h showed that there was a drop in parasite number at 12 h for GA-treated cultures but not for the control cultures (Fig. 3B). This finding was also confirmed by estimating parasitemia from the Giemsa-stained smears of these samples (not shown). Similar results were observed upon GA exposure of parasites to two heat shock episodes separated by an interval of 48 h to mimic conditions of tertian malaria (not shown). The stimulatory effect of heat shock and the inhibitory effect of PfHsp90-interference by GA together suggested a central role for PfHsp90 in triggering stage development in the malarial parasite.Fig. 3GA blocks heat shock-mediated stage transition. A, highly synchronous, Percoll-purified rings were subjected to temperature shifts from 40 (phase A) to 37 (phase B) to 40 °C (phase C). At the time of the shift to 40 °C (phase C), the culture was split into two and treated with GA or Me2SO (DMSO). Cultures maintained at 37 °C during all the phases (non-HS control) were also treated with GA. Parasite stages were examined by flow cytometry at 0, 6, and 12 h of phase C (left). The protocol for the experiment is shown at the right. B, in the above experiment, parasite numbers in Me2SO and GA-treated samples were counted by flow cytometry at 0 and 12 h. C, a parasite lysate was incubated with either GA-coupled beads or control beads. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with α-PfHsp90 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The binding of GA to mammalian Hsp90 has been studied extensively (10Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 13Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl U.F. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). To confirm directly the interaction of GA with PfHsp90, parasite lysate was incubated with GA-coupled beads, and the bound proteins were analyzed for the presence of PfHsp90 by Western blotting. Control beads did not show any signal, whereas GA-coupled beads showed a clear band for PfHsp90 (Fig. 3C, top). This result supported our previous modeling studies showing the presence of a GA-binding pocket in PfHsp90 (11Banumathy G. Singh V. Pavithra S.R. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18336-18345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and confirmed that GA was capable of binding to PfHsp90.GA Disrupts PfHsp90 Complex—We have previously shown PfHsp90 to be associated with PfHsp70 in a ∼300 kDa complex (11Banumathy G. Singh V. Pavithra S.R. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18336-18345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To examine if, similar to mammalian Hsp90, PfHsp90 is also organized in a multi-chaperone complex, we analyzed its size under conditions that would preserve protein-protein interactions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using mild lysis conditions followed by gel filtration chromatography, we found the PfHsp90 complex to be ∼450 kDa in size (Fig. 4A). The size of the complex suggested that, in addition to dimeric PfHsp90 (∼180 kDa) and PfHsp70 (∼70 kDa), it contained other proteins. To examine the identities of the proteins associated with PfHsp90, we used an approach of co-immunoprecipitation. Trophozoites were metabolically labeled for 24 h, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PfHsp90. Protein A beads alone were used as control. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 4B, in addition to PfHsp90, three other proteins could be co-precipitated using antibodies to PfHsp90. Among these proteins, spot number 2 (Fig. 4B) corresponded to PfHsp70 (11Banumathy G. Singh V. Pavithra S.R. Tatu U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18336-18345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To examine the identities of the proteins, we excised spot numbers 3 and 4 (Fig. 4B) from a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that was run in parallel and subjected the protein spots to in-gel trypsin digestion and MALDI-TOF analysis using the Ettan Pro system (Amersham Biosciences). Peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF showed that spot numbers 3 and 4 (Fig. 4B) correspond to Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5 (PfPP5) (gene identifier 23619476) and α-tubulin (gene identifier 23510202), respectively (not shown). Previously, co-immunoprecipitation of PfHsp90 using antibodies to PfPP5 has been demonstrated (14Dobson S. Kar B. Kumar R. Adams B. Barik S. BMC Microbiol. 2001; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/1/31)PubMed Google Scholar). Both PP5 and tubulin have been shown to interact with Hsp90 in mammalian cells (15Silverstein A.M.

Whereas PP5 is known to be a bona fide co-chaperone component of the mammalian Hsp90 multichaperone complex, tubulin is its known client protein (17Shao J. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6770-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Garnier C. Barbier P. Gilli R. Lopez C. Peyrot V. Briand C. Biochem. Biophys Res. Comm. 1998; 250: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Overall, the results showed PfHsp90 to be organized in a multichaperone complex consisting of PfHsp70, PfPP5, tubulin, and an additional protein that needs to be identified. The complex was akin to that found in higher eukaryotes both in terms of its size as well as composition.Fig. 4GA disrupts PfHsp90 complex. A, trophozoite lysate was fractionated on a Superdex 200 column, and the fractions were analyzed for the presence of PfHsp90 by Western blotting. B, a parasite lysate from metabolically labeled cells was immunoprecipitated using an α-PfHsp90 antibody and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography.

C, the trophozoite lysate was passed through a Superdex 200 column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions 20 and 21 were collected. Fractions from five such runs were pooled and concentrated. Following treatment with Me SO (DMSO) or GA, the concentrate was rerun through the Superdex-200 column, and fractions 17–28 were analyzed for the presence of PfHsp90 2by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the effect of GA on the PfHsp90 complex, parasite lysate was fractionated using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Fractions corresponding to PfHsp90 were pooled, concentrated, and divided into two aliquots (see “Experimental Procedures”). Following treatment with Me2SO or GA (100 μm), the concentrate was rerun through the Superdex 200 column, and the fractions were analyzed for the presence of PfHsp90 by immunoblotting. Although the Me2SO-treated sample showed PfHsp90 to be in a complex of ∼450 kDa (Fig. 4C, top), the aliquots exposed to GA showed that ∼50% of PfHsp90 appears in fractions corresponding to ∼160 kDa in size (Fig. 4C, bottom). The result indicated that the binding of GA to PfHsp90 resulted in dissociation of the PfHsp90 complex. We also examined the effect of GA on the PfHsp90 complex in vivo using much lesser concentrations of GA (10 μm). By metabolic labeling and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that co-precipitation of PfHsp90 with antibodies to PfHsp70 was reduced in GA-treated cells (not shown). The results"
https://openalex.org/W2019983585,"p53 and its homologues p73 and p63 are transcription factors that play an essential role in modulating cell cycle arrest and cell death in response to several environmental stresses. The type and intensity of these responses, which can be different depending on the inducing stimulus and on the overall cellular context, are believed to rely on the activation of defined subsets of target genes. The proper activation of p53 family members requires the coordinated action of post-translational modifications and interaction with several cofactors. In this study, we demonstrate that the multifunctional protein hDaxx interacts with p53 and its homologues, both in vitro and in vivo, and modulates their transcriptional activity. Moreover, we show that hDaxx, which has been implicated in several apoptotic pathways, increases the sensitivity to DNA damage-induced cell death and that this effect requires the presence of p53. Although hDaxx represses p53-dependent transcription of the p21 gene, it does not affect the activation of proapoptotic genes, and therefore acts by influencing the balance between cell cycle arrest and proapoptotic p53 targets. Our results therefore underline the central role of hDaxx in modulating the apoptotic threshold upon several stimuli and identify it as a possible integrating factor that coordinates the response of p53 family members."
https://openalex.org/W2058480027,"ApoE is expressed in multiple mammalian cell types in which it supports cellular differentiated function. In this report we demonstrate that apoE expression in adipocytes is regulated by factors involved in modulating systemic insulin sensitivity. Systemic treatment with pioglitazone increased systemic insulin sensitivity and increased apoE mRNA levels in adipose tissue by 2–3-fold. Treatment of cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes with ciglitazone increased apoE mRNA levels by 2–4-fold in a dose-dependent manner and increased apoE secretion from cells. Conversely, treatment of adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α reduced apoE mRNA levels and apoE secretion by 60%. Neither insulin nor a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α agonist regulated adipocyte apoE gene expression. In addition, treatment of human monocyte-derived macrophages with ciglitazone did not regulate expression of apoE. Additional analyses using reporter genes indicated that the effect of TNFα and PPARγ agonists on the apoE gene was mediated via distinct gene control elements. The TNFα effect was mediated by elements within the proximal promoter, whereas the PPARγ effect was mediated by elements within a downstream enhancer. However, the addition of TNFα substantially reduced the absolute levels of apoE reporter gene response even in the presence of ciglitazone. These results indicate for the first time that adipose tissue expression of apoE is modulated by physiologic regulators of insulin sensitivity.

Apolipoprotein E is a 35-kDa glycoprotein that circulates as a surface component of plasma lipoproteins and is expressed in multiple mammalian cell types (1Mahley R.W.

Reports over many years have demonstrated that apoE is involved in maintaining important aspects of organismal and cellular homeostasis. For example, disordered apoE function/expression has a well established role in the pathophysiology of important human diseases such as atherosclerosis and dementia (1Mahley R.W.

ApoE has also been implicated in regulating the expansion of the renal mesangial matrix, in regulating the differentiated function of steroidogenic tissues, and protecting cells from oxidant stress (7Chen G.

In line with its diverse roles in normal mammalian physiology, apoE is expressed in multiple cell types, including vessel wall macrophages and cells of the central nervous system, in steroidogenic tissue, and in the kidney (1Mahley R.W.

As a surface component of lipoproteins, apoE is involved in regulating organismal lipoprotein metabolism (1Mahley R.W.

Hepatocytes are the predominant source of circulating apoE; however, peripheral tissues can also contribute importantly to plasma apoE levels (10Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Swift L.L. Fazio S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1529-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Thorngate F.E. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Williams D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that circulating apoE derived from peripheral cells can play an important role in modulating systemic lipoprotein metabolism and cholesterol levels (10Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Swift L.L. Fazio S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1529-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Thorngate F.E. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Williams D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb.

For example, in apoE knockout mice, the synthesis and secretion of transgenic apoE in adrenal glands to produce <2% of wild-type circulating apoE levels reduced atherosclerosis by 80–95% even though there was no effect on hypercholesterolemia (11Thorngate F.E. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Williams D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, circulating apoE has been postulated to play a role in suppressing systemic oxidant stress (13Tangirala R.K. Pratico D. FitzGerald A. Chun S. Tsukamoto K. Maugeais C. Usher D.C. Pure E. Rader D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ApoE expression has also been demonstrated in adipocytes. Zechner et al. (14Zechner R. Moser R. Newman T.C. Fried S.K. Breslow J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10583-10588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated apoE mRNA and protein expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in adipose tissue biopsies collected from the gluteal region of human subjects. In these studies, the expression of apoE was found to increase as a function of 3T3-L1 differentiation; almost no apoE was detected in preadipocytes. In addition, inhibition of adipocyte lipid accumulation by biotin deprivation reduced apoE expression. Conversely, cholesterol loading of adipocytes enhanced apoE expression. Multiple potential control elements for apoE gene expression have been described in its 5′ proximal promoter (15Smith J.D. Melian A. Leff T. Breslow J.L. J. Biol.

In addition, downstream control elements have been described that are required to direct specific expression of apoE in various tissues. Two downstream duplicated enhancers have been reported that specify expression of the apoE gene in macrophages and adipocytes of transgenic animals (20Shih S-J. Allan C. Grehan S. Tse E. Moran C.

Furthermore, an LXR 1The abbreviations used are: LXR, liver x receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RT, reverse transcription. response element embedded within these enhancer elements has been shown to transduce the stimulatory effect of sterol/oxysterol on apoE gene expression in macrophages and adipocytes (21Mazzone T.

Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Adipocytes are a major cell target for PPARγ agonists (23Lowell B.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This class of compounds includes two drugs, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, that are widely used to treat patients with diabetes. In view of the widespread use of these drugs in human patients, the important role for PPARγ in modulating adipocyte function, the observation that apoE is made in adipocytes, and the important and diverse roles that have been ascribed to apoE in organismal homeostasis, we evaluated a role for PPARγ agonists in regulating adipocyte apoE expression. We demonstrate that ciglitazone and pioglitazone increase adipocyte apoE expression. Furthermore, we show that TNFα markedly suppresses apoE expression in adipocytes. Materials—Cell culture media, supplements, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. Ciglitazone, insulin, dexamethasone, methylisobutylxanthine were from Sigma. Wy-14643 was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories. TNFα was from R & D systems. All other materials were from previously identified sources (24Zhao Y. Yue L. Gu D. Mazzone T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3949-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Murine 3T3-L1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA; passage 3–10) were grown to confluence and differentiated to adipocytes as described (28Dalen K.T. Ulven S.M. Bamberg K. Gustafsson J-A. Nebb H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48283-48291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Green A. Bumberger J.M. Stuart C.A. Ruboff M.S. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, pre-adipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. Two days after reaching confluence, cells were differentiated by treatment with 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, and 1 μm dexamethasone in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 days. Cells were then maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin. All experiments were performed on post-differentiation day 8 to day 10. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated and cultured as previously described (24Zhao Y. Yue L. Gu D. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29477-29483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and RT-PCR—Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from fully differentiated adipocytes grown on six-well plates using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed using 200 ng of RNA and the one-step Calypso RT-PCR kit from DNAmp Ltd. The apoE and β-actin primer pairs were described previously (24Zhao Y. Yue L. Gu D. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29477-29483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min and then terminated at 94 °C for 2 min. Amplifications were pre-titrated to be within a linear range by varying template levels and number of cycles. The PCR products were resolved on agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The apoE primer pair produced a 503-bp product, and the β-actin primer pair produced a 924-bp product. The images were captured using a Bio-DOC-IT system (UVP, Upland, CA) and quantitated using ImageQuant. The base-line relationship between apoE and β-actin mRNA abundance varied among experiments. However, the regulatory effects of TNFα and ciglitazone were consistent regardless of this base-line relationship. For real-time RT-PCR, one step SYBR Green RT-PCR amplification was performed using the Mx3000 quantitative PCR system (Stratagene). After optimization of each of the primer pairs, samples were assayed in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 500 ng (for apoE) or 200 ng (for β-actin) of sample RNA and 300 nm each of the primers using Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR Master Mix kit (Stratagene #600552) with 1 m betaine and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. Relative quantitation for the apoE gene, expressed as fold increase over control, was calculated after normalization to β-actin RNA. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Immunoblot—3T3-L1 adipocytes were solubilized by scraping in lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 4% SDS, protease inhibitors), incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and boiled for 10 min. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 20 min. The protein concentration was then determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Twenty μg of cell lysate or 25 μl of medium were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, and apoE was detected by ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (24Zhao Y. Yue L. Gu D. Mazzone T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29477-29483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 25Zhao Y. Mazzone T. J. Biol.

Plasmids—The pGL623 plasmid was constructed by cloning a –623 to +86 SmaI-XbaI fragment (30Paik Y-K. Chang D.J. Reardon C.A. Davies G.E. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A 54-bp double-stranded oligo containing a previously defined PPARγ apoE gene response element (located ∼2 kilobases downstream of the apoE gene) in the apoE/apoC1 intergenic region (31Galetto R. Albajar M. Polanco J.I. Zakin M.M. Rodrigues-Rey J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was synthesized and cloned into pGL623 to generate pGL623PPAR. As a control for transfection efficacy a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (pSVβ-galactosidase) under the control of the SV40 promoter was used. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Analysis—Differentiated adipocytes were electroporated using the Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad) with a setting at 180 V and 940 microfarads. Briefly, the cells were trypsinized and washed three times in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without CaCl2 and MgCl2. The cells were then suspended at 107/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.5 ml of cell suspension was transferred to a 0.4-cm gap cuvette. Twenty-five μg of apoE reporter plasmid DNA, 2.5 μgofthe β-galactosidase internal control, and 200 μg of carrier DNA (sheared herring sperm DNA, Roche Applied Science) were added. After electroporation, cells were plated on 6-well plates and allowed to recover for 24 h in 10% fetal bovine serum before use in experiments. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was measured in cell extracts using kits available from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity to calculate relative luciferase units. Human Subject Treatment Protocol—Subjects signed consents to a protocol that was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and was conducted on the UAMS General Clinical Research Center. Subjects were recruited who were in good health but with impaired glucose tolerance, with a fasting glucose under 100 mg/dl and a 2-h post-challenge glucose of 140 to 199 mg/dl following a standard oral 75-g glucose challenge. Subjects were weight-stable and were controlled on a 35% fat, eucaloric diet throughout the study. A subcutaneous fat biopsy was performed by incision from the lower abdominal wall, and adipose tissue was immediately placed into liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction, as described previously (32Kern P.A. Di Gregorio G.B. Lu T. Rassouli N. Ranganathan G. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1779-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Insulin sensitivity was measured using the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance study using 11.4 g/m2 glucose and 0.04 units/kg insulin (33Bergman R.N. Finegood D.T. Ader M. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 45-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Insulin was measured using an immunochemiluminescent assay (MLT Assay, Wales, UK), and glucose was measured in duplicate by a glucose oxidase assay. The insulin sensitivity index (SI) was calculated using the MinMod program. SI is an index of insulin sensitivity based on the dynamic relationship between circulating insulin and glucose levels after the intravenous injection of glucose and insulin, with low values indicating insulin resistance. The insulin sensitivity index derived from this test is highly correlated with the insulin sensitivity index derived from the euglycemic clamp (34Bergman R.N. Prager R. Volund A. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 790-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Subjects were treated with pioglitazone for 10 weeks beginning at 30 mg/day for 2 weeks and then 45 mg/day for an additional 8 weeks. Compliance and laboratory tests were monitored three times during the follow-up phase, and then repeat adipose tissue biopsies and insulin sensitivity testing were performed. We measured the effect of the PPARγ agonist, ciglitazone, on apoE expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figs. 1 and 2). As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with ciglitazone increased the abundance of adipocyte apoE mRNA by 2–4-fold in a dose-dependent manner. The results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that treatment of adipocytes with ciglitazone (30 μm) increased cell-associated and secreted apoE protein as detected by immunoblot. In three independent experiments there was a 2.5-fold increase in cell-associated apoE and a 3.6-fold increase in secreted apoE after treatment with ciglitazone, similar to the magnitude of increase in the apoE mRNA level. We next performed experiments to assess the specificity of the apoE gene response to ciglitazone. Insulin is an important regulator of adipocyte gene expression (35Lay S.L. Lefrere I. Trautwein C.

PPARα is poorly expressed in adipocytes; however, PPARα agonists have been reported to modulate adipocyte gene expression (36Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). Neither insulin nor the PPARα agonist, WY14643, influenced adipocyte apoE mRNA abundance (Fig. 3). As an additional evaluation of specificity, we examined the response of the apoE gene in human monocyte-derived macrophages to ciglitazone. When examining time points up to 48 h of treatment over a range of ciglitazone doses, there was no change in human monocyte-derived macrophage apoE expression (not shown).Fig. 2Ciglitazone increases cellular and secreted apoE in adipocytes. Adipocytes were treated with 30 μm ciglitazone in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. At that time 25 μl of medium or 20 μg of cellular protein was used for immunoblotting, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative immunoblot is shown. Results from three independent experiments were pooled to calculate -fold change.

Differentiated adipocytes were treated with insulin or the PPARα ligand, WY14643, at the indicated concentrations in complete medium for 24 h.

Agarose gels representative of results from three independent experiments with similar results are shown. Neither treatment produced a change in apoE mRNA abundance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The study of PPARγ agonist-regulated gene expression is of particular interest due to the widespread use of these agents in humans. Therefore, we next evaluated whether systemic treatment of insulin-resistant, non-diabetic subjects with the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone would influence apoE gene expression in adipose tissue. Three female subjects with impaired glucose tolerance were treated with pioglitazone for 10 weeks using the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the duration of this treatment, the subjects were placed on a weight-maintaining diet containing 35% of calories from fat. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue was collected before and after treatment with pioglitazone. Results obtained from these studies are given in Table I. The glycohemoglobin was in the normal range before and after treatment with pioglitazone, as was the fasting blood glucose, although the fasting blood glucose modestly decreased after treatment in all three subjects. Improved insulin sensitivity, expected with pioglitazone treatment, was demonstrated by the increase in the insulin sensitivity index, SI, measured at 10 weeks in all three subjects. With respect to apoE gene expression, treatment of subjects with pioglitazone produced a 2–3-fold increase in apoE mRNA abundance, as measured using real time RT-PCR. The magnitude of the apoE gene response measured in adipose tissue exposed to a PPARγ agonist in vivo was similar to that produced in isolated 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with ciglitazone.Table ITreatment of IGT subjects with PPARγ agonists increases apoE mRNA in adipose tissueBMIHgbA1CFBGSIApoE mRNAkg/m2%mg/dl×10-4 (min-1 × μg-1 × ml-1)-Fold change (post/pre)Subject 1Pre375.0920.372.2 ± 0.1Post37.65.0900.78Subject 2Pre375.2861.102.6 ± 0.2Post37.95.9711.94Subject 3Pre25.25.3811.211.9 ± 0.1Post25.35.1781.95 Open table in a new tab The above results demonstrated the in vivo effect of a PPARγ agonist on increasing systemic insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue apoE gene expression. TNFα has been implicated in reducing insulin sensitivity and is an important modulator of adipocyte gene expression in vivo and in vitro. We, therefore, next evaluated the effect of TNFα on apoE expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figs. 4 and 5). Treatment of adipocytes with 20 ng/ml TNFα led to an approximate 60% reduction in apoE mRNA abundance (Fig. 4). Furthermore, this reduction was reflected in an approximate 60% decrease in apoE protein secretion into the medium during TNFα treatment at 20 ng/ml (Fig. 5).Fig. 5TNFα reduces apoE secretion from adipocytes. Differentiated adipocytes were treated with TNFα for 24 h in 0.2% bovine serum albumin at the doses indicated.

It has further been shown that suppression of most adipocyte genes by TNFα is mediated via NFκB, and PPARγ agonists can interfere with transcriptional activity of NFκB (40van Wijk J.P.H.

Therefore, the opposing effects of TNFα and ciglitazone on apoE expression in adipocytes could result from regulatory interactions that impinge on a single gene regulatory locus. We addressed this mechanism and obtained additional insight into how PPARγ agonists influence apoE expression in adipocytes by analyzing portions of the apoE gene control elements for their responsiveness to TNFα and ciglitazone. The results of the first series of experiments are shown in Fig. 6. The proximal promoter portion of the apoE gene (pGL623) has been shown to contain numerous potential regulatory elements and binding sites for transcription factors (15Smith J.D. Melian A. Leff T.

Streisinger slippage results in simple deletions by displacement, i.e. the “looping out” of one or more bases as a primer strand slides along a run of reiterated template bases during replication (Fig. 1). Misincorporation misalignment occurs when DNA polymerase initially forms a mismatched base pair at the 3′-primer end that subsequently realigns by pairing with a complementary downstream template base prior to undergoing further extension (Fig. 1). Alternatively, DNA misalignment could occur as the first step followed by the “correct” incorporation of an incoming dNTP opposite a complementary downstream template base, a process referred to as dNTP-stabilized misalignment (Fig. 1), which has been observed in the crystal structure of the pol IV homolog Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 in ternary complex with DNA and an incoming nucleotide (15Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The bottom line is that all three processes can follow different paths to arrive at the same mutational end point, a –1 deletion. Determining precise frameshifting mechanisms for individual DNA polymerases during replication and repair is an essential step toward understanding the basic principles of mutagenesis. In this study we perform pre-steady state fluorescence kinetics analysis with three polymerases known to generate small deletions, using the fluorescent base analog 2-aminopurine (2AP) to visualize frameshift intermediates and nucleotide incorporation products as they are occurring during real time catalysis. We report the first pre-steady state observation of two different slippage mechanisms within the same polymerase, pol μ. The data further reveal that pol μ and pol IV use different deletion mechanisms on identical repetitive sequences to achieve the same mutational end point, whereas pol β performs a mix of deletions and base substitutions in similar repetitive sequences of different lengths. We derive a minimal kinetic model to account for pol μ-catalyzed slippage in both reiterated and non-reiterated DNA to explain how end processing in a κ light chain VJ recombination (16Mahajan K.N.

Expression and Purification of Native Human pol μ and E. coli pol IV—pol μ cDNA was subcloned into vector pET41b (Novagen) and expressed in strain BL21(DE3) R1L Codon Plus (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with kanamycin (5 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) to an A600 of 0.7 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for an additional 3 h. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10% sucrose and lysed with lysozyme (2 mg/ml) while stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. Soluble protein was recovered by centrifugation (12,000 rpm in a GSA rotor at 4 °C) and kept at 4 °C for the remaining purification steps. Ammonium sulfate was added to 40% saturation, and pellets were resuspended in PC buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT) supplemented with 500 mm NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. The sample was diluted in PC buffer to 150 mm NaCl and immediately loaded onto a Whatman P-11 phosphocellulose column, washed with 20 column volumes of PC buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and eluted with a 150–500 mm NaCl gradient (>10 column volumes). pol μ-containing fractions were loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in PC buffer plus 250 mm NaCl. The cleanest fractions were applied to a Heparin Hi-Trap column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with 20 column volumes of PC buffer supplemented with 250 mm NaCl, and eluted with a gradient of 250 mm to1 M NaCl (>15 column volumes). Finally, the cleanest fraction of pol μ was loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in PC buffer plus 250 mm NaCl. The eluted fractions were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until used. DNA Substrates and Reaction Conditions—Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer and purified on denaturing 16% polyacrylamide gels. 2-Aminopurine phosphoramidite and a 5′-C6 amino linker phosphoramidite (used in rhodamine X labeling; described previously) (18Bloom L.

Primers for quenched-flow and gel assay experiments were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (United States Biochemical Corp.). Primers and templates were annealed at a 1:3 primer/template ratio by heating to 95 °C for 3 min and slow cooling to room temperature. Ultra-pure deoxynucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Sigma. Reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and reactions were performed at 37 °C. Steady State and Pre-steady State Rotational Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence steady state rotational anisotropy measurements were made using a QuantaMaster QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International) with a single emission channel. Samples were excited with vertically polarized light at 580 nm (8-nm band pass), and both vertical and horizontal emissions were monitored at 610 nm (8-nm band pass). The G factor was determined and used to calculate anisotropy. To measure the Kd for DNA, the change in the anisotropy of rhodamine-labeled p/t DNA (50 nm) was determined at varying concentrations of pol μ. Anisotropy data was converted to the concentration of bound DNA as shown in Equation 1,fB=r−rFrB−rF×[D0](Eq. 1) where r is the measured anisotropy, rF is the anisotropy without protein, rB is the anisotropy of fully bound DNA, and D0 is the initial concentration of p/t DNA. To determine the Kd for DNA, the concentration of bound DNA was fit to the quadratic equation shown below as Equation 2,DNA fB=Kd+E0+D0−(Kd+E0+D0)2−4E0D02(Eq. 2) where E0 and D0 are initial pol μ and p/t DNA concentrations, respectively. The off rate (koff) for pol μ from rhodamine-labeled p/t DNA was determined using a pre-steady state Π*180 stopped-flow instrument from Applied Photophysics equipped for anisotropy by exciting with vertically polarized light at 580 nm (2-nm slit width) and monitoring emissions using a 620 cutoff filter. pol μ (2 μm) was pre-incubated in reaction buffer with p/t DNA (100 nm) in one syringe. The reaction was initiated by mixing equal volumes with a second syringe filled with trapping agent (either heparin (2 mg/ml) or unlabeled p/t DNA (10 μm)), yielding final concentrations of 50 nm p/t, 1 μm pol μ, and either 1 mg/ml heparin or 5 μm unlabeled p/t trap. The change in anisotropy was monitored as a function of time and fit to an exponential decay. Pre-steady State Rapid Quenched-flow Methodology—A Kintek rapid quenched-flow apparatus was used to determine the chemical step for dNTP incorporation. Primer extension was measured by mixing equal amounts of syringe 1 containing 32P-labeled p/t DNA (100 nm) and pol μ (1.6 μm), with syringe 2 containing either dTTP or dGTP (800 μm). Reactions were quenched with EDTA (0.5 m) at various time points. Reaction products were loaded onto 16% PAGE, analyzed on a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and the data were plotted using Sigmaplot 8.0. Reactions using pol IV contained final concentrations of 200 nm p/t, 2 μm pol IV, and 2 mm dNTP. The Kd of dGTP for pol μ was measured by varying the concentration of dGTP. The rate (kobs) at each dGTP concentration was plotted and fit to a rectangular hyperbola (kobs = kpol[dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP])). Pre-steady State 2AP Real Time Fluorescence Analysis—Real time fluorescence analysis of nucleotide incorporation was performed using the Π*180 stopped-flow instrument from Applied Photophysics. The p/t DNA containing 2AP was excited at 312 nm with a xenon-mercury lamp, and emission was monitored using a 360-nm cutoff filter. Reactions were initiated by combining a syringe filled with 400 nm p/t DNA and 1.6 μm pol μ with a syringe containing either 800 μm dTTP or dGTP. Final concentrations were 200 nm p/t DNA, 800 nm pol μ, and 400 μm dNTP. Reactions using pol IV contained final concentrations of 200 nm p/t DNA, 2 μm pol IV, and 2 mm dNTP. The change in 2AP fluorescence as a function of time was fit to either a single or a double exponential equation to obtain reaction rates. Steady State 2AP Fluorescence Methodology—Experiments using the non-reiterative p/t and DNA pol μ were performed using a Quanta-Master QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International) by exciting 2AP at 310 nm (6-nm band pass) and monitoring the emission at 370 nm (6-nm band pass). A 1-cm path cuvette containing 200 nm p/t DNA and 1 mm pol μ was placed in the fluorometer, and the change in fluorescence as a function of time was monitored following the addition of dGTP (400 μm). The data were fit to a single exponential equation. pol μ Frameshifts Occur by a Streisinger Slippage Mechanism in Reiterative DNA—2AP, the base analog of A, forms Watson-Crick base pairs with T (19Sowers L.C.

When excited at 310 nm, 2AP emits a fluorescent signal at 370 nm, enabling the detection of distortions in local DNA structure by a change in fluorescence intensity (20Hochstrasser R.A. Carver T.E. Sowers L.C. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11971-11979Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Otto M. Bloom L. Goodman M. Beechem J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The changes in 2AP fluorescence intensity accompanying slippage events during replication are a decrease in fluorescence when T is incorporated opposite 2AP directly or when 2AP slips opposite a 3′-primer T and an increase in fluorescence when 2AP “flips” out of the helical plane (Fig. 1). By placing 2AP adjacent to a homopolymer run of A residues in the p/t DNA such that the analog can easily re-align along the primer end, concurrent changes in the amplitude and direction of 2AP fluorescence intensity that occur during slippage can thereby reveal the mechanisms at work in the different polymerases (Fig. 1). To establish a reference fluorescence profile for incorporation by pol μ on a five-base repeat sequence without a frameshift, we monitored the addition of dTTP forming a T·2AP base pair. This resulted in a biphasic quench in fluorescence fitting to a double exponential with rates of 14 ± 2.5 s–1 and 0.7 ± 0.15 s–1 (Fig. 2a, black curve). The second phase of the reaction represents the rate-limiting step for chemistry, which disappears (Fig. 2a, gray curve) when dideoxy-T is placed at the 3′-primer end. Further verification of the chemistry rate was obtained by pre-steady state quenched-flow analysis using single turnover reactions that yielded a rate of 0.68 ± 0.09 s–1 (data not shown), closely matching the rate observed via fluorescence (0.7 ± 0.15 s–1). The kinetics for incorporating the “next correct” nucleotide G opposite C is measured by omitting dTTP from the reaction (Fig. 2b, black curve). A biphasic fluorescence quench is observed with rates of 15 ± 3 s–1 and 1.5 ± 0.35 s–1. The slower rate disappears using the dideoxy-T-terminated primer (Fig. 2b, gray curve) and corresponds to the rate-limiting step for chemistry measured by single turnover experiments using quenched-flow (1.2 ± 0.27 s–1) (Fig. 2c). The direct incorporation of T opposite 2AP or the slipped incorporation of G opposite C occurs at similar rates of ∼1 s–1 under these conditions. The biphasic fluorescence quench during the incorporation of G holds true even when the p/t is modified to contain just a dinucleotide repeat (Fig. 3a, black curve). To confirm that the incorporation of G on these repeat sequences is occurring opposite C on a transiently misaligned template and not directly opposite 2AP, we replaced the template C just downstream of 2AP with T (Fig. 3a, gray trace). If the slower fluorescence quench results from direct misincorporation of G opposite 2AP and not slippage, then the chemistry quench should not be governed by the presence of either C or T downstream but should yield essentially similar profiles when copying 3′APC5′ or 3′APT5′ templates. Fig. 3a shows that this is not the case. When C is replaced with T in the template, incorporation of dGTP fails to occur, as indicated by a lack of a change in the fluorescence signal (Fig. 3a, gray trace) and confirmed by the absence of product formation using quenched flow on the 3′APT5′ template (data not shown). The data suggest the incoming dGTP directly forms a correct base pair with the downstream template C immediately before chemistry and that the 2AP is concurrently “slipping” under the primer end T, possibly forcing a more upstream base out of the helical plane in the duplex region of the primer-template. Frameshift events where the template base has “slipped” under the primer were described by Streisinger (11Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), and this mechanism appears to be at work in pol μ, even in the case of just a dinucleotide repeat. The likelihood of misinserting G opposite 2AP is extremely small because of the gross instability of G·AP mispairs (24Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Mhaskar D. Sowers L.C. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5869-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), thus strongly favoring Streisinger slippage on the 3′APC5′ template. In contrast, nucleotide misincorporation, detected as an increase in fluorescence, is favored over Streisinger slippage when pol μ incorporates A on the 3′APT5′ template, because A·AP forms a relatively stable wobble structure (25Fazakerley G.V. Sowers L.C. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Goodman M.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The pre-chemistry quench could be attributable to either of two causes. One possible explanation is that rapid dNTP binding quenches 2AP through increased template stacking (26Rachofsky E. Osman R.

Supporting this possibility is our observation that the pre-chemistry quench becomes significantly greater as the concentration of dGTP increases (data not shown). Alternatively, the concomitant closure of the pol μ active site upon dNTP/Mg2+ binding might also account for the initial quench. A similar pre-chemistry 2AP quench was observed previously using pol β (29Arndt J.W. Gong W. Zhong X. Showalter A.K. Liu J. Dunlap C.A. Lin Z. Paxson C. Tsai M.D. Chan M.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5368-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Shah A. Li S. Anderson K. Sweasy J. J. Biol.

Prasad R. Wilson S. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). A crystal structure for pol μ will likely be necessary to help distinguish between active site closure and increased 2AP stacking as the cause for the initial pre-chemistry quench, although the two explanations are not mutually exclusive. pol μ Uses dNTP-stabilized Misalignment in Non-reiterative DNA—To verify that 2AP movement under the T at the primer end is the cause of the quench observed during dGTP incorporation (Fig. 2b, five-base repeat; Fig. 3a, dinucleotide repeat), we used a p/t DNA sequence containing an A at the 3′-primer end rather than a T, eliminating the potential for base pairing between the 3′-terminal base of the primer with 2AP in the template (Fig. 3b). If 2AP cannot slip under the primer, then the only means to achieve chemistry with dGTP would be to force 2AP out of the template plane to accommodate the G·C pair in a dNTP-stabilized misalignment mode (Fig. 1), causing the disruption of base stacking and an increase in fluorescence. Using the modified p/t sequence, dGTP no longer triggers a quench but rather an increase in fluorescence (Fig. 3b). 2AP is “skipped” by slow displacement in the active site (0.0025 ± 0.001 s–1; Fig. 3b), yielding the predicted fluorescence increase that matches a reduction in the rate of chemistry to 0.0031 ± 0.001 s–1 as measured by quenched-flow (Fig. 3c). Bond formation thus may not occur until 2AP moves out of the way for proper G·C base pair formation. In the non-reiterative sequence, pol μ is limited to making frameshift mutations via dNTP-stabilized misalignment. We believe that these experiments provide the first “dynamic” (i.e. real time) evidence that a single polymerase (pol μ) can use two kinetically distinct mechanisms to achieve the same mutational (–1 deletion) end point. Direct Observation of dNTP-stabilized Misalignment on Reiterative p/t DNA Using E. coli pol IV—The crystal structure of S. solfataricus Dpo4 suggests that a dinB (pol IV) homolog favors dNTP-stabilized misalignment as a primary means to produce frameshifts (15Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). A steady state fluorescence kinetics analysis (32Kobayashi S. Valentine M. Pham P. O'Donnell M. Goodman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34198-34207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) provides independent support that dNTP-stabilized misalignment is the predominant frameshift mechanism for E. coli pol IV. We have measured the slipped-mispaired intermediates in the pol IV frameshift pathway for direct comparison with pol μ on an identical p/t DNA sequence (Fig. 4). A rapid quench in fluorescence fitting to a double exponential at rates of 6.4 ± 2.2 s–1 and 0.31 ± 0.089 s–1 is observed for a correct T·2AP base pair in a three-base repeat p/t DNA sequence (Fig. 4a). In the non-slippage T·2AP reaction, the faster rate of quench for pol IV (6.4 ± 2.2 s–1) closely matches the rate-limiting step for the chemistry obtained by quenched-flow (6.9 ± 0.55 s–1, Fig. 4c). In contrast, incorporation of dGTP by pol IV causes an increase in fluorescence on p/t DNA of varying degrees of reiteration (Fig. 4b) but in the opposite direction of the fluorescence change seen for Streisinger slippage on the same p/t with pol μ (Fig. 2b). A slow increase in fluorescence is observed for pol IV (Fig. 4b), indicating that 2AP unstacks and is skipped, allowing dGTP to align with the next template base C via dNTP-stabilized misalignment as the Dpo4 crystal structure predicts (15Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The fluorescence increase with pol IV and dGTP is abolished when the downstream template C is replaced with T (data not shown) and also with a dideoxy-T on the primer end (data not shown). The rate of dNTP-stabilized misalignment with pol IV changes as a function of the number of reiterative A residues in the template (Fig. 4b), with a run of five A residues upstream of 2AP causing the fastest rise in signal at 0.065 ± 0.019 s–1, a run of three A residues at 0.036 ± 0.018 s–1, and a single A residue upstream of 2AP causing little change at all. The rate-limiting chemical step measured by quenched-flow is accordingly also reduced in the run of five-A-residue (0.069 ± 0.011 s–1) and the run of three-A-residue (0.033 ± 0.0053 s–1) sequences (Fig. 4d). When G has been incorporated in identical sequences by pol IV (skip equals an increase in fluorescence) and is compared directly to pol μ (slip equals a decrease in fluorescence), it is clear that these two enzymes are using different mechanisms to generate the same frameshifts on repetitive DNA. Terminal Nucleotidyl Transferase Activity Does Not Contribute to the Streisinger Slippage Mechanism—pol μ contains a potent nucleotidyl transferase activity reported to be more active on duplex p/t DNA than on single-stranded DNA (7Dominguez O. Ruiz J. Lain de Lera T. Garcia-Diaz M. Gonzalez M. Kirchhoff T. Martinez A.C. Bernad A. Blanco L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In quenched flow studies, we have found that the apparent rate of transferase activity on a single-stranded primer sequence is ∼10-fold faster at 6.8 ± 0.5 s–1 (data not shown) than the observed rate for single T addition in the polymerase mode on duplex DNA of 0.7 ± 0.15 s–1 (Fig. 2a). Could the robust transferase activity observed on the single-stranded primers be contributing to the Streisinger slippage process? Transient melting of the reiterative primer end could generate a short single-stranded region on which a G could be added in the transferase mode. If this extended primer rapidly anneals to a realigned 5′APC3′ template, it could cause a quench in fluorescence. To test this hypothesis, we performed quenched-flow assays using radiolabeled primer in the absence of template to determine whether the rate of chemistry for the dGTP addition in transferase mode could account for the observed Streisinger slippage rates of 1.5 ± 0.35 s–1 and 1.2 ± 0.27 s–1 seen in Fig. 2, b and c, respectively. Our results show that the transferase-based addition of dGTP onto the primer end in the single-stranded form is considerably slower (0.004 ± 0.002 s–1; data not shown), and does not appear to contribute to Streisinger slippage. In the transferase mode, pol μ strongly favors the addition of T over G on single-stranded DNA with T at the 3′-end. The contribution of pol μ transferase activity to the observed dNTP-stabilized misalignment on non-reiterative p/t DNA cannot, however, be unequivocally excluded, but is not likely considering the presence of a template in the active site of the enzyme. pol μ Makes Frameshifts More Readily in Reiterative Sequences Than Does pol β—Although we were able to elicit Streisinger frameshifts by pol μ using only dGTP in the reactions, it was important to determine whether such slippage events are possible in a less stringent system where discrimination between all four nucleotides is necessary. To accomplish this, we turned to an assay in which we allowed replication by pol μ to proceed from a 32P-labeled version of the p/t DNA for 30 min with all four dNTPs present and followed with restriction digestion using BsrDI (Fig. 5, a–c). The six-base recognition site of BsrDI is located immediately downstream of the first template C, and the enzyme cuts opposite the 5′-side of the template C in the non-realigned template. If the template 2AP slipped under the primer during extension, the BsrDI recognition site would be shifted one base closer to the primer end and thus cut opposite the 5′-side of 2AP. Fig. 5, a–c show the results of this experiment when performed on three different lengths of reiterative p/t DNA. Remarkably, with only a simple dinucleotide (Fig. 5a), pol μ converts at least 25% of cleavable extension products into frameshift mutations as indicated by an increase in the band intensity appearing at the site opposite template 2AP following digestion (Fig. 5a, lane 3). pol β, on the other hand, does not produce frameshift mutations on the same p/t DNA, with the only cut appearing opposite template C, i.e. the non-slipped product (Fig. 5a, lane 6). An increase in the length of repeat sequence to include a run of three A residues on the template enables pol μ to convert >90% of all cleavable replication products into frameshift mutations (Fig. 5b, lane 3), whereas pol β continues to replicate in a non-slipped mode (Fig. 5b, lane 6). However, if we further increase the number of repeats to 5 A residues, pol μ still converts >90% of the products to frameshift mutations (Fig. 5c, lane 3), but now pol β is able to convert 50% of its replication products to –1 frameshifts (Fig. 5c, lane 6). pol μ and pol β thus exhibit very different slippage propensities on the same sequences despite being closely related family X polymerases. Minimum Kinetic Models and Intermediate Steps Depicting pol μ-Catalyzed –1 Deletion Pathways—To complete the characterization of pol μ-catalyzed –1 frameshifts, we performed additional measurements to determine the Kd for DNA, including individual off- and on-rates (koff and kon) of the polymerase, the Kd for dNTPs, and the rate of pyrophosphorolysis (kpyro). Fig. 6a shows the binding of pol μ to p/t DNA (five-base repeat; see sketch in Fig. 2a) as a function of polymerase concentration with the data fit to a quadratic equation yielding a Kd for DNA of 92 ± 14 nm. Fig. 6b shows the results of measuring koff for pol μ from 5′-rhodamine labeled p/t DNA. The same off rate was observed using either an unlabeled p/t trap with a koff of 9.0 ± 1.2 s–1 (Fig. 6b, gray line) or a heparin trap with a koff of 9.5 ± 1.6 s–1 (Fig. 6b, black line). Using the kinetically measured koff and Kd for DNA, an estimated kon was calculated to be 1 × 108m–1 s–1 (koff/Kd). To determine the Kd for dGTP during a Streisinger slippage event, the rate-limiting chemical step for nucleotide incorporation was monitored using pre-steady state quenched-flow measurements at various concentrations of dGTP. Fig. 6c shows the hyperbolic plot of the rates of incorporation using dGTP as a function of nucleotide concentration, revealing a value of 58 ± 7.9 μm for the Kd of dGTP and a maximum polymerization rate (kpol) of 2 ± 0.7 s–1. Because of the propensity of pol μ to use dTTP in both transferase and polymerase modes on duplex DNA, it was not possible to isolate a Kd value for dTTP polymerization alone on the duplex reiterative substrate (data not shown). Pyrophosphorolysis, the reverse reaction of polymerization (shown in Fig. 6d), was measurable using only the highest soluble concentration of pyrophosphate (2 mm) and occurred so slowly (2.3 × 10–3 s–1) that only steady state measurements could be made. A summary of the entire slippage reaction mechanism for pol μ is summarized for both the favored Streisinger and the less efficient dNTP-stabilized misalignment modes (Fig. 7). In this study we have addressed the mechanism by which pol μ and pol IV rearrange p/t DNA to cause –1 frameshifts. Combining fluorescent studies in a stopped-flow instrument with the power of quenched-flow and gel assay experiments using 32P-labeled p/t DNA, we have captured and identified the major steps in the slippage processes of pol μ and pol IV, as well as the minimal mechanism of slippage for pol μ. This study marks the first pre-steady analysis of DNA polymerase frameshift mechanisms. pol μ Nucleotide Incorporation Dynamics Reveal a Putative Conformational Change and Chemical Step—Correct incorporation of both dTTP opposite 2AP and dGTP opposite the downstream C in the reiterative p/t DNA resulted in a biphasic quench. The rapid phase using the normal deoxynucleotide- and dideoxynucleotide-terminated p/t DNA are dependent upon nucleotide binding, and the slower phase of fluorescence quench represents the rate-limiting chemistry step (Fig. 2). The crystal structure of the closest homologue to pol μ, TdT, revealed that it appears to be locked in a conformation equivalent to the closed form of pol β (33Delarue M. Boule J.B. Lescar J. Expert-Bezancon N. Jourdan N. Sukumar N. Rougeon F. Papanicolaou C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is not known if pol μ undergoes large scale conformational shifts between open and closed forms like pol β (31Sawaya M. Prasad R. Wilson S. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) or instead is locked in the closed form like TdT, but our data suggest that pol μ might undergo some form of closure in the active site prior to chemistry. pol μ and pol IV Use Different Slippage Mechanisms in Repetitive DNA—Previous studies suggested that pol μ and pol IV could both misalign p/t DNA, causing frameshifts (5Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34Lenne-Samuel N. Wagner J. Etienne H. Fuchs R.P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A pre-steady state comparison of pol μ and pol IV using 2AP allowed us to visually distinguish the mechanisms at work that produce frameshifts in the active sites of these two enzymes. We demonstrate that, whereas pol μ re-aligns repetitive sequences to “slip” the template under the 3′-primer end to cause a quench in 2AP fluorescence (Fig. 2a), pol IV on the other hand prefers to “skip” the first template base, moving it out of the way in its active site to accommodate the next correct nucleotide pair through dNTP-stabilized misalignment, resulting in 2AP fluorescence increase (Fig. 4b). pol IV is misaligning the incoming nucleotide with the downstream template base in a manner similar to the observed ternary complex for S. solfataricus Dpo4 (15Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). We found that pol μ can also make frameshifts by dNTP-stabilized misalignment on non-reiterative p/t DNA sequences, albeit with dramatically reduced efficiency compared with the Streisinger mode of slippage (Fig. 3). We have also shown that pol β, another member of the family X polymerases, does not slip as readily as its counterpart, pol μ, in the same reiterative sequences (Fig. 5), probably a reflection of their evolution toward distinct cellular purposes. In vivo, pol μ appears to be involved in a rearrangement of light chain immunoglobulin genes (17Bertocci B. De Smet A. Berek C. Weill J.-C. Reynaud C.-A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 35Bertocci B. De Smet A. Flatter E. Dahan A. Bories J.-C. Landreau C. Weill J.-C. Reynaud C-A. J.

Nick McElhinny S.A. Mitchell B.S. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5194-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The ability of pol μ to slip efficiently in a simple dinucleotide run and use microhomologies to insert the next base would be extremely beneficial to such a system, enabling two partially complementary broken ends to come together that might otherwise fail to do so. Perhaps as pol μ assists in VJ recombination (17Bertocci B. De Smet A. Berek C. Weill J.-C. Reynaud C.-A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) a variety of complicated junctions are encountered, requiring it to call upon all of its functions (transferase, polymerase, and microhomology searching) to help process the DNA intermediates properly. It is important that cells limit frameshift-prone polymerases from wreaking havoc throughout their chromosomes. E. coli has evolved a solution to this problem by limiting the access of pol IV to DNA through the SOS regulon, which up-regulates its expression only during times of extreme stress (36Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Human pol μ may be constrained from working on DNA by the requirement of additional cofactors such as the non-homologous end-joining proteins. Through the comparative analysis of polymerases from humans and E. coli, we have attempted to provide a global perspective on deletion mutagenesis, visualizing two unique frameshift mechanisms in real time and proving the old saying that “there is more than one way to skin a cat.”"

These studies have also shown that CT-1 binds the LIFR with affinity equivalent to that of LIF but fails to bind gp130 alone. However, the addition of gp130 enhances its binding to LIFR. From these observations, it has been deduced that CT-1 initially binds LIFR with a low affinity, followed by the recruitment of gp130 into a high affinity binding complex (7Pennica D. Shaw K.J.

The formation of gp130/LIFR complex triggers the activation and auto/trans-phosphorylation of receptor-associated JAK kinases.

Phosphorylated receptor subunits can also recruit the Src homology domain 2 adapter Shc, leading to a complex formation with Grb2 and SOS (10Kumar G. Gupta S. Wang S. Nel A.E. J.

Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). CT-1 has also been shown to reduce the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α in lipopolysaccharide-treated animals (16Benigni F. Sacco S. Pennica D. Ghezzi P. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1847-1850PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated tumor necrosis factor-α levels have been correlated with myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure (17Latini R. Bianchi M.

Pharmacol. 1994; 23: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as well as the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (18Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other IL-6 cytokine family members, CT-1 can induce liver acute phase response (19Peters M. Roeb E. Pennica D. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Rose-John S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In vivo administration of CT-1 has also resulted in hypertrophy of the liver, kidneys, and spleen, atrophy of the thymus, and increasing platelet and red blood cell counts (13Jin H. Yang R. Keller G.A. Ryan A. Ko A. Finkle D. Swanson T.A. Li W. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Paoni N.F. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also, CT-1 supports the long term survival of spinal motor neurons and ciliary ganglion neurons, and the effects of CT-1 on ciliary ganglions mimic those of CNTF (7Pennica D. Shaw K.J. Swanson T.A. Moore M.W. Shelton D.L. Zioncheck K.A. Rosenthal A. Taga T. Paoni N.F. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10915-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that CNTF activates JAK/STAT and MAPK (ERK1 and -2) pathways in adipocytes and has several effects on adipocyte physiology (20Zvonic S. Cornelius P. Stewart W.C. Mynatt R.L. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2228-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to potently activate the JAK/STAT pathway through the gp130/LIFR dimer, we predicted that CT-1 could affect adipocyte physiology and gene expression. Indeed, we have observed that CT-1 activates the JAK/STAT pathway and ERK signaling pathway in fat cells in vitro and in vivo. Although this gp130 cytokine does not attenuate 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, we have observed that CT-1 decreased fatty acid synthase and IRS-1 protein in mature adipocytes and results in a decrease of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, we have shown that CT-1 induces SOCS-3 mRNA and acutely represses PPARγ expression. The CT-1-induced repression of PPARγ correlates with binding of STAT 1 to the PPARγ2 promoter, and mutation of this site indicates that it contributes to the expression of PPARγ2 under basal conditions. We have also observed that these effects of CT-1 are independent of ERK1 and -2. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effects of CT-1 on fat cells. Recently, it has been shown that the circulating levels of CT-1 are increased in the serum of patients with ischemic heart disease and valvular heart disease (21Freed D.H. Moon M.C. Borowiec A.M. Jones S.C. Zahradka P. Dixon I.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2003; 254: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since the onset of cardiovascular disease can be associated with obesity/type 2 diabetes (22Sowers J.R. Frohlich E.D. Med. Clin. North Am. 2004; 88: 63-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Reaven G. Abbasi F. McLaughlin T. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2004; 59: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), the actions of CT-1 in fat may prove to be a relevant link between these two deadly diseases.

An enhanced chemiluminescence kit was purchased from Pierce. Nitrocellulose and Zeta Probe-GT membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Cell Culture—Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated and grown to 2 days postconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine serum. Medium was changed every 48 h. Cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1.7 μm insulin. After 48 h, this medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were maintained in this medium until utilized for experimentation. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts—Monolayers of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes or adipocytes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a nondenaturing buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (Nonidet P-40), 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 trypsin inhibitory milliunits of aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm sodium vanadate. Samples were extracted for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants containing whole cell extracts were analyzed for protein content using a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Extracts—Cell monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a nuclear homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. Igepal CA-630 (Nonidet P-40) was added to a final concentration of 0.15%, and cells were homogenized with 16 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were saved as cytosolic extract, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in half the volume of nuclear homogenization buffer and were centrifuged as before. The pellet of intact nuclei was resuspended again in half of the original volume of nuclear homogenization buffer and centrifuged again. A small portion of the nuclei was used for trypan blue staining to examine the integrity of the nuclei. The majority of the pellet (intact nuclei) was resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol. Nuclei were extracted for 30 min on ice and then placed at room temperature for 10 min. Two hundred units of DNase I was added to each sample, and tubes were inverted and incubated an additional 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the sample was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants containing nuclear extracts were analyzed for protein content, using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated in 5, 7.5, 10, or 12% polyacrylamide (acrylamide from National Diagnostics) gels containing SDS according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked in 4% fat-free milk for 1 h at room temperature. Results were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cell monolayers with Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was denatured in formamide and electrophoresed through a formaldehyde-agarose gel. The RNA was transferred to Zeta Probe-GT, cross-linked, hybridized, and washed as previously described (18Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by random priming using the Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP. Rodent Adipose Tissue Isolation—Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tissues were immediately removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were homogenized in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (Nonidet P-40), 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 trypsin inhibitory milliunits of aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm sodium vanadate. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 rpm to remove any debris and insoluble material and then analyzed for protein content. All C57Bl/6J mice were obtained from a colony at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. All animal studies were carried out with protocols that were reviewed and approved by institutional animal care and use committees. Electromobility Shift Assays—Double-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed by heating single-stranded 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides in a boiling water bath and gradually cooling to room temperature. The 4 μg of double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with 20 μCi of [32P]dCTP (400–800 Ci/mmol) and with 1 ml each of 5 mm dATP, dTTP, and dGTP with Klenow fragment. The end-labeling reaction was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and was stopped by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. End-labeled oligonucleotides were purified using a Princeton CENTRISEP column, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Princeton Separations, Inc.). Specific activity of the oligonucleotides was determined by scintillation counting. Nuclear extracts were incubated with the end-labeled oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm/μl) for 30 min on ice. The samples were loaded into a prerun (1 h, 100 V at 4 °C) 6% acrylamide/bisacrylamide TBE gel containing 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. For supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibody for 1 h at room temperature. For cold competition, the nuclear extracts were incubated with unlabeled oligonucleotide for 15 min on ice prior to incubation with the labeled probe. The gels were run at 20 mA for ∼2 h, dried at 80 °C for 1 h under a vacuum, and then exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MS film with a Kodak BioMax high energy intensifying screen. Constructs—The PPARγ2 promoter (–609 to +52) luciferase construct was a generous gift of Dr. Jeffrey Gimble, (Pennington Biomedical Research Center). The PPARγ2 promoter (–609 to +52) luciferase construct was mutated at positions –217 and –212 within the STAT recognition element using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotide and corresponding antisense oligonucleotide was used to mutate the STAT recognition element (GAC AAT GTA GCA ACG TTC TCC TCG TAA TGT ACC AAG TC). The mutated bases were altered from T to C and are underlined. The resulting reporter plasmid was termed PPARγ2 m217/212 (–609 to +52). The change in sequence was confirmed by sequencing using a Big Dye Terminator Extension Reaction (ABI Prism). The minimum promoter thymidine kinase Renilla promoter was obtained from Promega. Transfections—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to 60% confluence and were transiently transfected with the PPARγ2 promoter (–609 to +52)/luciferase construct or the PPARγ2 m217/212 (–609 to +52)/luciferase construct and with the thymidine kinase/Renilla vector to control for transfection efficiency, using Polyfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). After 48 h of incubation with the Polyfect-DNA solution, cells were treated and then harvested for analysis for firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Relative light units were determined by dividing firefly luciferase activity by Renilla luciferase activity. Results are given ± S.D. Determination of 3H-Labeled 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—The assay of 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglucose uptake was performed as previously described (18Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to the assay, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-deprived for 4 h. Uptake measurements were performed in triplicate under conditions where hexose uptake was linear. The results were corrected for nonspecific uptake, and absorption was determined by 3H-labeled 2-deoxyglcuose uptake in the presence of 5 μm cytochalasin B. Nonspecific uptake and absorption was always less than 10% of the total uptake. In order to examine the sensitivity of 3T3-L1 cells to CT-1 administration, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with CT-1 (0.20 nm) for the times indicated in Fig. 1. Western blot analysis of cell extracts revealed that both undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells responded to CT-1 treatment in a time-dependent manner. Exposure to CT-1 resulted in a time-dependent activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and -3 as well as activation of MAPK (ERK1 and -2). The magnitudes of the responses were undistinguishable in undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was sustained for a longer period of time in preadipocytes. The total levels of MAPK are shown as a control for even loading. The subcellular distribution of STAT proteins following CT-1 treatment was assessed by treating fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with CT-1 (0.20 nm) for various periods of time, followed by isolation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts. Western blot analysis of these extracts, shown in Fig. 2, clearly demonstrated that CT-1 treatment results in the nuclear translocation of STAT1, -3, -5A, and -5B as well as the activation of MAPK. For each STAT protein examined, nuclear translocation occurred within 15 min and returned to basal level within 2 h following the cytokine treatment. This pattern is consistent with STAT activation by CNTF and other gp130 cytokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (20Zvonic S. Cornelius P. Stewart W.C. Mynatt R.L. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2228-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To further examine the ability of CT-1 to activate STATs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in comparison with other gp130 cytokines, we exposed fully differentiated adipocytes to various doses of CT-1, CNTF, and LIF for 15 min. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts, shown in Fig. 3, indicated that the activation of STAT1, -3, and -5 and MAPK (ERK1 and -2) by CT-1 is dose-dependent. Moreover, the STAT3 activation was achieved at much lower doses of CT-1 than those required for activation of STAT1 and STAT5. However, as previously shown, CNTF does not activate STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner (20Zvonic S. Cornelius P. Stewart W.C. Mynatt R.L. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2228-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CNTF treatment also did not result in either STAT1 or STAT5 activation. Treatment with 2.0 nm CNTF resulted in substantially less STAT 3 and MAPK activation when compared with 2.0 nm CT-1. LIF treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent activation of STAT1, -3, and -5 and MAPK in a manner and dose comparable with that of CT-1. The total levels of MAPK are shown as a control for even loading. To determine if CT-1 could affect signaling pathways in adipose tissue in vivo, the effects of this cytokine were examined in 7-week-old C57B1/6J mice given an intraperitoneal injection of CT-1 (0.5 μg/animal) or vehicle (saline) control and sacrificed after 15 min. Western blot analysis of whole tissue extracts isolated from the epididymal fat pads of the animals, shown in Fig. 4, demonstrated that the four mice injected with CT-1 had a significant increase in levels of active MAPK and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and -3. However, there was no detectable STAT activation in the four saline-injected mice, although some active MAPK was observed. Also, the activation of STAT5 proteins by CT-1 was not observed under these conditions. The total levels of MAPK are shown as a control for even loading, whereas an extract from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with growth hormone was used as a positive control for STAT5 activation (25Zvonic S. Story D.J. Stephens J.M. Mynatt R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes is governed by a variety of cell signals. Hence, we examined the ability of CT-1 to modulate adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. Our results clearly demonstrated that neither CT-1 nor CNTF treatment had any profound effects on adipocyte differentiation, as evident by the unaltered expression levels of various adipocyte proteins including PPARγ, IRS-1, STAT5A, and ACC (data not shown). Since CT-1 did not affect the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells, we examined the effects of this cytokine on the expression of genes in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Since this cytokine is a potent STAT activator, both in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 2 and 4), we hypothesized that activated STATs would modulate transcription in fat cells. Serum-deprived, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with CT-1 (0.20 nm) or CNTF (0.45 nm) for various times, indicated in Fig. 5. Total RNA and whole cell extracts were collected following the treatment. As shown in Fig. 5A, both CT-1 and CNTF administration resulted in a rapid induction of SOCS-3 mRNA levels. However, this up-regulation was very transient following CNTF treatment, whereas CT-1 treatment, at a dose lower than that of CNTF, resulted in a more sustained induction of SOCS-3 mRNA. Both cytokines also resulted in a transient down-regulation of PPARγ mRNA, which was more evident following a 2-h CT-1 treatment. The levels of aP2 mRNA were unchanged. The efficacy of the cytokines in this experiment was demonstrated by their ability to induce STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Since CT-1 is a potent activ"

KATP channels consist of regulatory sulfonylurea receptors (SUR) and pore-forming (Kir6.X) subunits. We recently reported (Pasyk, E. A., Kang, Y., Huang, X., Cui, N., Sheu, L., and Gaisano, H. Y. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 4234–4240) that syntaxin-1A (Syn-1A), known to mediate exocytotic fusion, was capable of binding the nucleotide binding folds (NBF1 and C-terminal NBF2) of SUR1 to inhibit the KATP channels in insulin-secreting pancreatic islet beta cells. This prompted us to examine whether Syn-1A might modulate cardiac SUR2A/KATP channels. Here, we show that Syn-1A is present in the plasma membrane of rat cardiac myocytes and binds the SUR2A protein (of rat brain, heart, and human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing SUR2A/Kir6. 2) at its NBF1 and NBF2 domains to decrease KATP channel activation. Unlike islet beta cells, in which Syn-1A inhibition of the channel activity was apparently mediated only via NBF1 and not NBF2 of SUR1, both exogenous recombinant NBF1 and NBF2 of SUR2A were found to abolish the inhibitory actions of Syn-1A on KATP channels in rat cardiac myocytes and HEK293 cells expressing SUR2A/Kir6.2. Together with our recent report, this study suggests that Syn-1A binds both NBFs of SUR1 and SUR2A but appears to exhibit distinct interactions with NBF2 of these SUR proteins in modulating the KATP channels in islet beta cells and cardiac myocytes.

Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), also directly binds to voltage-gated K+ and Ca2+ channels to regulate secretion (14Leung Y.M. Kang Y. Gao X. Xia F. Xie H.

We recently reported that Syn-1A could also bind NBF1 and NBF2 of SUR1 and inhibit pancreatic islet beta cell KATP channels through its actions on NBF1 (16Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In fact, Syn-1A was reported to be present in cardiac myocytes (17Sevilla L. Tomas E. Munoz P. Guma A. Fischer Y. Thomas J. Ruiz-Montasell B. Testar X. Palacin M. Blasi J. Zorzano A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results prompted us to test whether Syn-1A has a similar interaction with cardiac SUR2A. In this study, we found that Syn-1A, present in the plasma membrane of rat cardiac myocyte, inhibited the cardiac KATP channel through its actions on both NBF1 and NBF2 of SUR2A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs and Recombinant GST Fusion Proteins—The plasmids pECE-SUR2A and pECE-Kir6.2 were generous gifts from S. Seino (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan), and pGEX-4T-1-Syn-1A was from W. Trimble (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The constructs pGEX-5X-1-SUR2-NBF1 (amino acids 684–872) and -NBF2 (amino acids 1321–1499) were made using the same method as described previously (16Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. GST fusion protein expression and purification were performed following manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Before elution of the GST fusion protein from glutathione-agarose beads, Syn-1A protein was obtained by cleavage of GST-Syn-1A with thrombin (Sigma). The purity of each eluted recombinant GST protein was confirmed by PAGE as a strong single band, which was identified by Coomassie Blue staining as the molecular weight of the desired protein.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 1 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cansera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada). The HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with green fluorescent protein, pECE-Kir6.2, and pECE-SUR2A using LipofectAMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, cells were trypsinized and placed in 35-mm culture dishes overnight prior to voltage clamp experiments. Transfected cells were identified by visualization of the fluorescence of the co-expressed green fluorescent protein. For binding assay, the HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Syn-1A or pECE-SUR2A and pECE-Kir6.2.Preparation of Rat Cardiac and Brain Membrane—Rat cardiac membrane was prepared according to the method originally described by Mayanil et al. (18Mayanil C.S. Richardson R.M. Hosey M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 900-907PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Barry et al. (19Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 361-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare rat brain membranes, we followed the method reported previously by Huttner et al. (20Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Finally, both membranes were solubilized in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100, 2 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 30 min, and then insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min. The supernatant was used for binding assay.In Vitro Binding Assay—Two days after transfection with pcDNA3-Syn-1A or pECE-SUR2A and pECE-Kir6.2, the HEK293 cells were washed with ice-cold saline-buffered solution (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) and then harvested in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were lysed by sonication, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. For binding assay, the detergent extract (0.3 ml, 1.2–5.1 μg/μl protein) of HEK293 cells, rat brain synaptic membranes, and rat heart membranes or thrombin-cleaved Syn-1A (650 pmol of protein in 250 μl binding buffer) was mixed with GST (as a negative control, 650 pmol of protein), GST-Syn-1A (650 pmol of protein), GST-SUR2-NBF1, or GST-SUR2-NBF2 (650 pmol of protein in 250 μl of binding buffer or at concentrations indicated in Fig. 2F). (All GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads.) The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C with constant agitation for 2 h. The beads were then washed three times with binding buffer. The samples were separated on 15 or 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and identified with mouse anti-Syn-1A monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Sigma) or rabbit anti-SUR2 polyclonal antibody (1:300, catalog no. SC-25684, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-SUR2 antibody was generated against recombinant human SUR2 protein (amino acids 921–1000), which is 97% homologous to rat SUR2A and SUR2B but only 44% homologous to hamster SUR1.Isolation of Rat Cardiac Myocytes—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–225 g) were injected with heparin (3000 units kg-1 intraperitoneally) and sacrificed under anesthesia with phenobarbitol (Somnotol, 75 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally). Hearts were rapidly excised, immersed in Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and gently squeezed to clear the chambers of blood. The aorta was cannulated and perfused in a retrograde fashion on a Langendorff apparatus with Tyrode's solution containing 1 mm CaCl2 for 5 min (10 ml min-1, 37 °C). The heart was perfused for an additional 5 min with Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution followed by a 9-min perfusion period with Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution containing 0.015 mg ml-1 collagenase (500 units mg-1; Yakult Pharmaceutical Ind. Co., Tokyo, Japan) and 0.004 mg ml-1 protease (type XIV, 5.4 units mg-1; Sigma). The hearts were perfused for an additional 5 min with a KB solution containing 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm potassium aspartate, 2.5 mm KCl, 20 mm glucose, 10 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm taurine, 5 mm creatine, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The right free wall of the right ventricle was dissected from the heart, placed in 10 ml of KB medium, and cut into 8–10 pieces. 10 ml of solution was passed through a nylon mesh and stored at room temperature (22–24 °C) until used. Single cardiac myocytes used were calcium-tolerant, quiescent, and had sharp cross-striations without membrane blebs.Confocal Microscopy—The isolated myocytes were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips, rinsed, fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 0.5 h at room temperature, subjected to blocking with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% saponin for 0.5 h at room temperature, and then immunolabeled with mouse anti-Syn-1 antibody (1:50, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing with 0.1% saponin/phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were incubated with appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antiserum for 1 h at room temperature, mounted on slides in a fading retarder (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in glycerol), and examined using a laser-scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Recording KATP Currents from HEK293 Cells Expressing Kir6.2 and SUR2A—KATP channel current from human embryonic kidney 293 cells was recorded in the whole-cell configuration using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany) as we described previously (16Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recording pipettes were pulled from 1.5-mm borosilicate glass capillary tubes (World Precision Instruments, Inc.) using a programmable micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Pipettes were then heat-polished with fire, and tip resistances ranged from 1.5–3 mega-ohms when filled with intracellular solution containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 0.3 mm MgATP (pH 7.25 adjusted with KOH). Fusion proteins of GST, Syn-1A, and/or SUR2A NBFs were also added to the pipette solution. Bath solution contained (mm): 140 NaCl; 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 adjusted with NaOH). After a whole-cell configuration was established, membrane potential was held at -70 mV, and a pulse of -140 mV was given every 10 s to monitor the current magnitude. When the current reached maximum amplitude, voltage pulses from -160 to 40 mV were given at 20-mV increments to yield the I-V relationship. Steady-state outward currents were determined as the mean current in the final 95–99% of the 500-ms pulse. All experiments were performed at room temperature.Recording KATP Currents from Cardiac Myocytes—Standard patch clamp techniques were used to record currents in the inside-out configuration so that the internal face of membrane patches could be exposed directly to test solutions using a multi-input perfusion pipette. The time required for solution change at the tip of the recording pipette was <1 s. The pipette/bath solution for excised patch experiments contained 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. Currents were recorded at a holding potential of -60 mV, amplified using Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Inc.), and then digitized and analyzed using Axoscope version 8.0 and pClamp version 8.0 software. Data were sampled at 2.5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Excised patches were initially held in 1 mm ATP to measure base-line current. An application of 50 μm ATP then produced an increase in current to a level defined as “control” for each patch. The current level was then measured following co-application of Syn-1A with or without pre-incubation with SUR2A NBF1 or SUR2A NBF2, and this measured current was expressed as a percentage of the controlled conditions for each patch. All experiments were performed at room temperature.RESULTSSyntaxin-1A Is Expressed in the Plasma Membrane of Cardiac Myocytes—We examined the expression and cellular location of Syn-1A in rat cardiac myocytes. Fig. 1A is a Western blot showing that Syn-1A (top band) and Syn-1B (bottom band) were present in rat whole heart cell lysate (100 μg of protein). Both Syn-1 isoforms were recognizable by the rabbit anti-Syn-1A antibody. When the cardiac lysate was purified to a plasma membrane fraction (50 μg of protein), the Syn-1 signals increased with Syn-1A being more abundant than Syn-1B. In Fig. 1B (upper panel), we confirmed the cellular location of Syn-1A to the plasma membrane of cardiac myocyte by confocal microscopy. The bottom panel (Fig. 1B) shows a negative control, wherein the myocytes were not labeled with anti-syntaxin antibody but with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody.Fig. 1Syntaxin-1A is expressed in the plasma membrane of cardiac myocytes.

Indeed, Fig. 2, A and B, shows that Syn-1A could bind native SUR2 proteins from both rat tissues, as demonstrated by the ability of GST-Syn-1A bound to agarose beads to pull down rat brain membrane and cardiac membrane SUR2-immunoreactive proteins. Because the antibody we have used recognizes a domain (amino acids 921–1000) conserved between SUR2A and SUR2B, the SUR2-immunoreactive proteins likely include both SUR2 proteins, especially the rat brain membranes (11Isomoto S.

In fact, we observed only a single SUR2 immunoreactive band in Fig. 2, A and B. SUR2A is nonetheless the dominant SUR2 protein in cardiac muscles (1Seino S. J. Diabetes Complicat. 2003; 17: 2-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Yokoshiki H. Sunagawa M. Seki T. Sperelakis N. Am. J.

Physiol. 1999; 61: 337-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2B. We have therefore focused on the cardiac SUR2A protein by overexpressing SUR2A/Kir6.2 in HEK293 (Fig. 2C). Here, GST-Syn-1A bound to agarose beads is able to pull down abundant SUR2A proteins from the HEK293 cell lysate extract. This study also demonstrated (Fig. 2C) that Syn-1A binding to SUR2A is direct and not likely via an intermediary ternary protein contained in the brain or heart. We had previously mentioned that Syn-1A did not bind Kir6.2 cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains (16Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Our previous study with pancreatic islet beta cells shows that Syn-1A specifically binds to NBF1 and NBF2 domains of SUR1 (16Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Syn-1A may likewise bind to the NBF1 (amino acids 684–872) and C-terminal NBF2 (amino acids 1321–1499) of SUR2A. Indeed GST-NBF1 and -NBF2 of SUR2A, bound to agarose beads, were both able to pull down overexpressed Syn-1A from HEK293 cell extract (Fig. 2D) and recombinant Syn-1A (thrombin cleaved) (Fig. 2E), but as a negative control, GST did not (Fig. 2, D and E). Finally, we examined the dose dependence of SUR2A-NBF1 (Fig. 2F, i) and NBF2 (Fig. 2F, ii) binding to Syn-1A at saturating concentrations. We found that NBF1 and NBF2 bound Syn-1A with an ED50 of 0.52 ± 0.07 μm (n = 3) and 0.64 ± 0.13 μm (n = 3), respectively.Syntaxin-1A Inhibits KATP Channels in Cardiac Myocytes through Direct Interactions with NBF1 and NBF2 of SUR2A— To show the functional significance of the interaction between Syn-1A and cardiac SUR2A-NBF-1 and -NBF-2, we examined whether recombinant Syn-1A would directly inhibit KATP currents in rat cardiac myocytes and whether such inhibition is via Syn-1A-NBF(s) interaction. We performed inside-out configuration so that the intracellular face of a cardiac membrane patch containing KATP channels could be exposed to the test solutions. As shown in Fig. 3A,i, the patch had minimum current activities when held in 1 mm ATP but showed bursting activities when ATP was removed, indicative of the opening of multiple KATP channels. Because sustained exposure to ATP-free solution will cause run-down of KATP channels, we applied 50 μm ATP to maintain channel activities, leading to a partial inhibition of KATP currents. The KATP current in the presence of 50 μm ATP is then defined as control for each patch. Application of Syn-1A alone markedly reduced current values to 32.2 ± 6.7% of control values (Fig. 3A, i, and B). The GST control did not affect currents (102.2 ± 20.1%, Fig. 3B). We had previously demonstrated that Syn-1A strongly inhibits pancreatic beta cell KATP currents through binding to the NBF1, but not NBF2, of SUR1 (16Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Huang X. Cui N. Sheu L. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4234-4240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether SUR2A NBF1 or NBF2 would mediate Syn-1A inhibition of cardiac KATP currents. Surprisingly, in contrast to pancreatic beta cells, application of both SUR2A NBF1 and NBF2 abolished Syn-1A effects to 138 ± 17.3% (n = 19) and 129.6 ± 34.5% (n = 9) of control, respectively (Fig. 3A, ii and iii, and B). This result suggests that not only NBF1 but also NBF2 of SUR2A mediates Syn-1A inhibition of cardiac KATP currents. As controls, neither SUR2A NBF1 nor SUR2A NBF2 alone produced any significant effect on current activities, which were 96.2 ± 18.0% and 110.2 ± 11.3% of control, respectively (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Syn-1A inhibition of cardiac myocyte KATP currents is mediated by both SUR2A NBF1 and NBF2. A, original traces showing small patches of membrane excised from cardiac myocytes to form an inside-out configuration so that the internal face of membrane patches could be exposed directly to test solutions. Excised patches were initially held in 1 mm ATP to measure base-line current. Exposure to zero ATP resulted in a surge of channel activities confirming the ATP sensitivity of the channels. Subsequent application of 50 μm ATP prevented channel run-down and also produced a partial inhibition; the current at this level is defined as control for each patch. i–iii, application of Syn-1A (0.3 μm) with or without pre-incubation with SUR2A NBF1 (1 μm) or SUR2A NBF2 (1 μm).

Therefore we co-expressed Kir6.2 and SUR2A in HEK293 cells (which have no detectable endogenous SNARE proteins) to examine the direct inhibition of cardiac KATP channels by Syn-1A. When Kir6.2/SUR2A-transfected cells were dialyzed with a low ATP concentration (0.3 mm) through the recording pipette, KATP currents gradually developed and reached maximum amplitude in 4–8 min. At this time, I-V relationships were obtained by a family of triggering pulses from -160 to 40 mV in 20-mV increments (Fig. 4, A and E). The I-V relationship is almost linear with the expected r"

Using discontinuous sucrose density gradient fractionation of post-nuclear supernatants, prepared from rat tissues and human glioblastoma cell line U373MG, we have identified discrete membrane-bound fractions of αB-crystallin, which co-sediment with the Golgi matrix protein, GM130. Confocal microscopy reveals co-localization of αB-crystallin with BODIPY TR ceramide and the Golgi matrix protein, GM130, in the perinuclear Golgi in human glioblastoma U373MG cells. Examination of synchronized cultures indicated that αB-crystallin follows disassembly of the Golgi at prometaphase and its reassembly at the completion of cytokinesis, suggesting that this small heat shock protein, with its chaperone-like activity, may have an important role in the Golgi reorganization during cell division. αB-Crystallin is a developmentally regulated small heat shock protein known for its binding to a variety of denatured polypeptides and suppression of protein aggregation in vitro.

Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Quite remarkably, the elevated presence of αB-crystallin has been linked with a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alexander and Alzheimer diseases, dementia, and scrapie (1Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar). In multiple sclerosis the presence of αB-crystallin in astrocytes has been directly implicated in the pathological immune response (10Van Noort J.M. van Sechel A.C. van Stipdonk M.J. Bajramovic J.J. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 117: 435-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of the human glioblastoma cell line, U373MG, express appreciable amounts of αB-crystallin (about 2–4 μg/mg soluble protein) (11Kato K. Goto S. Hasegawa K. Shinohara H. Inaguma Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), thus presenting an excellent paradigm for investigating the physiological function of this protein. αB-Crystallin is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein, but it has also been shown to be present in the nucleus (7Bhat S.P. Hale I.L. Matsumoto B. Elghanayan D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9van Rijk A.E. Stege G.J. Bennink E.J. May A. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Considering that its chaperone-like activity has been demonstrated in vitro with a large number of substrates, under a variety of denaturing environments (12Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 13Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), we wanted to ascertain whether αB-crystallin showed any preferential association with, or within, a cellular compartment in vivo. Rat tissues and the human glioblastoma cell line U373MG, not exposed to any specific physical or chemical stress, were used for these studies. Animals and Cell Culture—Experiments with animals were performed as per the guidelines of the Animal Research Committee, UCLA. Rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The human glioblastoma cell line U373MG (American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was maintained in complete MEM 1The abbreviations used are: MEM, minimum essential medium; NEAA, nonessential amino acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; SGF, stacked Golgi fraction; bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. NEAA Earle's salts medium (MEM NEAA) (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) as per the supplier's instructions. The cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block (14Stein G. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Last T.J. Owen T. McCabe L. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 282-287Google Scholar). For brefeldin A treatment the cells were synchronized and then released into MEM NEAA containing 5 μg/ml of brefeldin A (Fluka) for 1 h at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) before immunocytochemistry or cell fractionation. Antibodies—An antiserum (anti-αB) against the conserved C terminus of αB-crystallin (cREEKPAVTAAPKK, the small case “c” in the sequence is for cysteine; it was added for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin; there is no cysteine in this sequence (15Bhat S.P. Horwitz J. Srinivasan A. Ding L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) was raised commercially in rabbits (Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). This antiserum is as specific to αB-crystallin as the one made previously against the same peptide (15Bhat S.P. Horwitz J. Srinivasan A. Ding L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antibody GM130:FITC (anti-GM130) was a monoclonal antibody raised in mouse (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). For immunofluorescence, one of the following two secondary antibodies was used: 1) goat anti-rabbit TRITC or 2) goat anti-rabbit FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For immunoblotting one of the following secondary antibodies was used: goat-anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and goat-anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence—U373MG cells seeded on a microscope coverslip (Fisher Scientific) were fixed with methanol (–20 °C) for 6 min, washed, and incubated with the blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum, 1.0% bovine serum albumin, 0.20% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 35 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:50 dilution) and then with the secondary antibody (1:200) following a standard protocol. The cells were stained in the dark with BODIPY TR ceramide (N-((4-(4, 4-difluoro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-yl)phenoxy)acetyl)sphingosine), a selective stain for Golgi membranes (Molecular Probes Inc.) (16Zhang Y. Lemasters J. Herman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27726-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and then counterstained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and mounted on slides using Prolong anti-fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes Inc.). For GM130 localization studies, instead of BODIPY, a second primary antibody (anti-GM130:FITC at 1:50 dilution) was used followed by DAPI. The pictures were taken using a Leica TCS-SP Multiphoton and Confocal Microscope with 100× oil immersion objective lenses (1.4). Z sections 0.5 μm thick at a 2–3-μm depth were taken and processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Cell Fractionation—The post-nuclear supernatants were fractionated on discontinuous sucrose gradients (17Slusarewicz P. Hui N. Warren G. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 509-516Google Scholar, 18Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The method was marginally modified for use with smaller volumes and tubes for centrifugation in a Sorvall Discovery M150 centrifuge with a swing out rotor (S55S) at 39,000 rpm for 30 min. These gradients were made in a 2.2-ml tube by sequential addition of the following solutions: 400 μl of buffer E (1.3 m sucrose), 700 μl of buffer D (0.86 m sucrose), 700 μl of post-nuclear supernatant (homogenate made in buffer C containing 0.5 m sucrose), and finally the tube was topped with buffer B (0.25 m sucrose). To further characterize the Golgi fraction obtained in this procedure, we followed the procedure described by Taylor et al. (18Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which employs two centrifugations on two similar but non-identical gradients. The first centrifugation, done according to Slusarewicz et al. (17Slusarewicz P. Hui N. Warren G. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 509-516Google Scholar) provides the Golgi fraction, S2 (see Fig. 2). The second discontinuous sucrose gradient was made as follows. The Golgi fraction (S2) was collected, adjusted to 1.15 m with 2 m sucrose (total volume about 500 μl), placed at the bottom of a new tube, and filled successively with 500 μl each of 1.0 m, 0.86 m, and 0.25 m sucrose solutions. After centrifugation at 76,000 × g for 90 min stacked Golgi fractions 1–3 (SGF1–3) (18Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. All buffers contained 10 mm potassium phosphate and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.7. Different membrane fractions were collected by piercing the side of the centrifuge tube with a 22-mm gauge needle connected to a syringe and labeled as S1, S2, S3, and SGF1–3 (18Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To prepare post-nuclear supernatants synchronized U373MG cells were washed and homogenized in buffer “C” containing protease inhibitor mixture, 5 μl per 700 μl (Sigma, Oakville, Canada) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei. The post-nuclear supernatant was used for fractionation as stated above. Following centrifugation, about 100-μl fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient using a 22-mm gauge needle. 17–21 fractions were collected. Same procedure was followed for making the post-nuclear homogenates from post-natal day 10 rat heart; about 300 mg of the rat tissue were used. Protein estimation was done with BCA (Pierce). Immunoblotting—Sucrose gradient fractions were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (4–12% gradient NuPAGE bis-tris) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting was done using the SuperSignal West Dura protocol for chemiluminescence (Pierce). The same blots were used again, sometimes without stripping to immunodetect GM130. Existence of a Membrane-associated Fraction of αB-Crystallin—Post-nuclear homogenates from U373MG cells were fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (shown schematically in Fig. 2, left panel). This gradient produced two easily visible membrane fractions (whitish bands), one near the bottom of the gradient at the interface of 1.3 and 0.86 m sucrose, fraction S3, and the other around the middle of the gradient at the interface of 0.86 and 0.50 m sucrose, fraction S2 (Fig. 1A, top panel). The band around the middle of the gradient (fraction S2, Fig. 1A, top panel) contains the Golgi (17Slusarewicz P. Hui N. Warren G. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 509-516Google Scholar). The fractions from this gradient were collected and immunoblotted for determining the distribution of αB-crystallin. Interestingly, while most of the αB-crystallin is seen in the top fractions of the gradient, a small but significant portion of αB-crystallin is seen associated with the membrane fraction S3 (Fig. 1A, top panel). The Golgi membrane fraction, S2, also contains αB-crystallin, but the pattern of its presence is continuous with the rest of the soluble αB-crystallin in the top of the gradient (Fig. 1A, top panel). To gain insight into the identity of the two membrane fractions, S2 and S3, the same immunoblot was screened with anti-GM130 antibody for GM130, a well known Golgi matrix polypeptide (19Seemann J. Pypaert M. Taguchi T. Malsam J. Warren G. Science. 2002; 295: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, middle panel). These data show that GM130 protein is concentrated in the same fractions (4Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 5Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 6Haynes II, J.I. Duncan M.K. Piatigorsky J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) where αB-crystallin is found. GM130 is also present in fractions 13 and 14 (Fig. 1A, middle panel, asterisks) (although at much reduced levels), which includes the Golgi membrane fraction, S2 (Fig. 1A, top panel). Although αB-crystallin pattern in the S2 fraction does not show a discrete separation from the soluble pool, the distinct pattern of the presence of GM130 (higher concentration of GM130 in fractions 13 and 14 in comparison with surrounding gradient fractions) clearly indicates that they contain the Golgi membranes. By the same token, the S3 fraction that contains a high concentration of GM130 protein must also contain Golgi membranes (see below). The data obtained in Fig. 1A (top panel) is confirmed by the pattern of αB-crystallin and GM130 presence obtained with the fractionation of the post-nuclear supernatants prepared from post-natal day 10 rat heart (Fig. 1B). The pattern in Fig. 1B is very similar to that shown in Fig. 1A; there is however a clear concentration of αB-crystallin in two fractions (Fig. 1B, brackets), one nearer the bottom of the gradient, fraction S3 (similar to that in Fig. 1A), and the other in the middle, fraction S2 (the Golgi fraction). The Golgi fraction (S2) is much higher in concentration in comparison with the lower membrane (S3 fraction) as assessed by the relative presence of αB-crystallin and GM130 (Fig. 1B, compare anti-αB panel with anti-GM130 panel). The difference in the two patterns (between U373MG and rat heart) is probably related to higher lability of Golgi (S2) fraction that degrades to S3 fraction in this preparation of U373MG gradients. This possibility was addressed in another experiment with these cells when different membrane fractions (S1–S3) were collected directly, and the Golgi fraction (fraction S2) was refractionated on a second sucrose gradient (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows that αB-crystallin is mostly in the fraction S2 in post-nuclear homogenates (Fig. 2, left panel). Upon refractionation of S2 (Fig. 2, right panel) most of the αB-crystallin is found in the fraction SGF3, the fraction comparable with S3 in the first gradient and Fig. 1A. Based on these data we conclude that the membrane fraction S3 (Fig. 1A) contains membranes and proteins derived from the Golgi fraction (S2, Fig. 1A). These data also confirm the lability of the Golgi membrane fraction (18Taylor R.S. Jones S.M. Dahl R.H. Nordeen M.H. Howell K.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1911-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Extreme care is needed to keep the integrity of the Golgi fraction intact. The lability of the Golgi fraction isolated from the U373 MG cells (fraction S2) helped us identify Golgi as the origin of what fractionates as a discrete membrane fraction (S3) in heavier sucrose (Figs. 1 and 2). In summary the data presented in Fig. 1 indicate the presence of Golgi membrane-associated αB-crystallin in fractions S2 and S3. αB-Crystallin Localizes to the Perinuclear Golgi—The astrocytoma cell line, U373MG, was synchronized with a double thymidine block (14Stein G. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Last T.J. Owen T. McCabe L. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 282-287Google Scholar), and the G1/S phase cells were immunostained with anti-αB. Prominent labeling of the Golgi apparatus resident in the perinuclear area is seen in these cells (Fig. 3A). The anti-αB staining co-localizes perfectly (Fig. 3A, Control-MeOH panel) with BODIPY TR ceramide (BODIPY), which preferentially stains the Golgi membrane. Fig. 3A (BFA-MeOH panel) shows that brefeldin A (a potent antifungal macrocyclic lactone known to cause disassembly of the Golgi (20Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) disperses the staining of the Golgi by anti-αB and its co-localization with BODIPY TR. When post-nuclear extracts from brefeldin A-treated cultures were analyzed on discontinuous sucrose gradients, no αB-crystallin was found in the S2 membrane (Golgi) fraction (Fig. 3B, arrows) further augmenting the observation of the presence of αB-crystallin in the Golgi. The co-localization of BODIPY and αB-crystallin and its disruption by brefeldin A treatment (Fig. 3A, lower panel), confirms the presence of αB-crystallin in the Golgi. αB-Crystallin Follows Assembly and Disassembly of the Golgi during Cell Cycle—Golgi biogenesis (or inheritance) is closely associated with its disassembly during mitosis and its re-assembly at the completion of cell division, which allows its equitable inheritance between the two daughter cells (21Shorter J. Warren G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 379-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It was of interest, therefore, to follow the presence of αB-crystallin in the Golgi as a function of its assembly and disassembly, as the cells go through the cell cycle. Golgi membrane components as well as the Golgi protein(s) independently (19Seemann J. Pypaert M. Taguchi T. Malsam J. Warren G. Science. 2002; 295: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have been speculated to be the unit of inheritance. We, therefore, used the Golgi protein marker GM130 (Fig. 4A) and the Golgi membrane lipid marker, BODIPY TR (Fig. 4B), to guide us in the localization of αB-crystallin in U373MG cells as a function of the cell cycle. The co-localization of αB-crystallin and GM130 is evident in the perinuclear Golgi at the G1/S phase boundary (Fig. 4A, see Merged panel). It diffuses into the surrounding prometaphase and the metaphase cytoplasm as would be expected of disassembling Golgi components (similar data were obtained when the Golgi-specific stain, BODIPY, was used (data not shown)). The staining gradually reappears, first in the emergent perinuclear area of the two daughter nuclei (Fig. 4A, telophase) and then clearly during cytokinesis (Fig. 4, A and B). The chaperone-like function of αB-crystallin has been very well established in vitro, but the physiological function of this protein remains conjectural (12Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 13Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). This protein is considered to be a cytoplasmic soluble protein, yet it has been known for a very long time that α-crystallins associate with cellular membranes (22Deretic D. Aebersold R.H. Morrison H.D. Papermaster D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16853-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kibbelaar M.A. Selten-Versteegen A.M. Dunia I. Bloemendal H. Benedetti E.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 95: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Cobb B.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6664-6672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that a discrete fraction of αB-crystallin is associated with the Golgi membrane complex (Figs. 1 and 2). An interesting aspect of the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells is that it exists as a stack of flattened membranes positioned in a perinuclear location in the cell. The data obtained by immunostaining and confocal microscopy (Fig. 3) clearly established that αB-crystallin associates with Golgi membranes. Although αB-crystallin is also known to be present in the nucleus (7Bhat S.P. Hale I.L. Matsumoto B. Elghanayan D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9van Rijk A.E. Stege G.J. Bennink E.J. May A. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), this is the first time that this protein has been reported to be associated with a specific cytoplasmic compartment such as the Golgi. The chaperone-like activity of αB-crystallin leads one to consider its role in well established functions of the Golgi complex as a major site of post-translational protein processing and sorting station for secreted proteins (25Jamieson J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this connection the presence of αB-crystallin in the Golgi in astrocytes may be related to its implication in multiple sclerosis (10Van Noort J.M. van Sechel A.C. van Stipdonk M.J. Bajramovic J.J. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 117: 435-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and reactive gliosis and dementia (26Renkawek K. Stege G.J. Bosman G.J. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2273-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A close examination of the mitotic panels in Fig. 4A reveals that staining obtained with either antibody (anti-αB or anti-GM130) is not amorphous but granular. It is particularly interesting that both bright red (αB-crystallin) as well as green granules (GM130) are seen around the newly formed nuclei (Fig. 4A, telophase). The presence of large granular co-localized αB-crystallin and GM130 is however unmistakable in the perinuclear area of the newly formed nuclei during cytokinesis (Fig. 4A, last panel, arrows). The timing of the αB-crystallin appearance in the nascent Golgi, immediately following cytokinesis, is noteworthy and suggestive of a role in the biogenesis of the Golgi in the daughter cells. This speculation is supported by the fact that Golgi reorganization (or Golgi inheritance) is closely interlinked with mitosis checkpoints; inhibition of this process is known to inhibit mitosis (27Sutterlin C. Hsu P. Mallabiabarrena A. Malhotra V. Cell. 2002; 109: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lens epithelial cell cultures derived from αB-crystallin null mice show an increase in the proportion of polyploid cells (8Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Brady J.P. Bassnett S. Fleming T.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Brady J.P. Garland D.L. Green D.E. Tamm E.R. Giblin F.J. Wawrousek E.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2924-2934PubMed Google Scholar); this may be ascribed to the inability of the these cells to proceed unhindered through the cell cycle because of the absence of αB-crystallin. The molecular mechanism of Golgi fragmentation and the molecular basis of its inheritance are a focus of intense and unresolved investigations (21Shorter J. Warren G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 379-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 30Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is tempting to purport a role for αB-crystallin and other small heat shock proteins in Golgi inheritance by suggesting that the chaperone-like function of this protein protects and holds the Golgi components in the mitotic cytoplasm during cell division and then helps deliver these components to the appropriate site(s) in the daughter cells to template the biogenesis of the new Golgi. Future investigations should reveal the substrates for the αB-crystallin chaperone-like activity in the Golgi and during its mitotic transition.

https://openalex.org/W1670121061,"Human high affinity IgE receptors are expressed as two different isoforms: the tetrameric isoform, αβγ2, or the trimeric isoform, αγ2. The α chain is the IgE binding subunit, whereas the FcRβ and FcRγ chains are the signaling modules. Both FcRβ and FcRγ contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM), but the β ITAM differs from canonical ITAMs in two ways; the spacing between the two canonical tyrosines harbors a third tyrosine, and it is one amino acid shorter than in canonical ITAMs, making it unfit to bind the tandem SH2 of Syk. We have shown that FcRβ functions as an amplifier of the FcRγ signaling function. However, the molecular mechanism of this amplification remains unclear. Here we show that mutation of the three tyrosines (Tyr-219, Tyr-225, and Tyr-229) in the β ITAM essentially converts αβγ2into an αγ2 complex in terms of Lyn recruitment, FcRγ phosphorylation, Syk activation, and calcium mobilization. Tyr-219 is the most critical residue in this regard. In addition, a detailed analysis of the dynamics of calcium mobilization suggests a possible inhibitory role for Tyr-225, which becomes apparent when Tyr-219 is mutated. Thus, the signaling amplification function of FcRβ is mainly encoded in Tyr-219 and in its capacity to recruit Lyn. In turn, this Tyr-219-mediated Lyn recruitment enhances γ chain phosphorylation, Syk activation, and calcium mobilization. The two other tyrosines appear to have a modulating function that remains to be fully assessed.

The high affinity receptor for IgE, FcϵRI, forms a high affinity cell surface receptor for the Fc region of antigen-specific IgE molecules. FcϵRI is multimeric and is a member of a family of related antigen/Fc receptors that have conserved structural features and play similar roles in initiating intracellular signaling cascades (1Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). FcϵRI controls the activation of mast cells and basophils, and in humans, participates in IgE-mediated antigen presentation. Multivalent antigens bind and cross-link IgE molecules held at the cell surface by FcϵRI. Receptor aggregation induces multiple signaling pathways that control diverse effector responses, including secretion of allergic mediators and the induction of cytokine gene transcription (such as interleukin-4, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granular macrophage-colony-stimulating factor). FcϵRI, therefore, is central to the induction and maintenance of an allergic response and physiologically may confer protection from parasitic infections (1Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). FcϵRI is a tetrameric structure made of an IgE binding α chain and a signaling module consisting of an FcRβ chain and a dimer of FcRγ chains. In humans, but not in rodents, a trimeric form lacking FcRβ, αγ2, can also be expressed. The β and γ chains contain conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) 1The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs; NP, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl; SA, streptavidin; PE, phycoerythrin; PY, phosphotyrosine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab. in their cytoplasmic tails (Ref. 2Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar and reviewed in Refs. 3Weiss A.

The consensus sequence of these motifs is (D/E)-XXYXXL-(X)7–9YXX-L/I. The tyrosine residues in these motifs are phosphoacceptor sites for the action of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family (5Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Science. 1992; 255: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 6Irving B.A. Chan A.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Phospho-ITAMs link receptor and signal transduction cascades by virtue of the capacity of SH2 domains, present in numerous signaling molecules, to bind phosphorylated tyrosines present in an appropriate amino acid sequence context. ITAMs are present in antigen receptors such as the T- and B-cell receptors and FcγRs. ITAMs have the capacity, when expressed independently of the rest of the receptor, to elicit the full range of activation signals observed with the complete receptor (5Letourneur F. Klausner R.D.

In particular, the γ ITAM is capable of inducing serotonin release when expressed as a chimera with the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the α chain of the interleukin-2 receptor in the mast cell line RBL-2H3 (9Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In contrast, FcRβ lacks autonomous signaling capacity (11Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, it acts as an amplifier of signals transduced by FcRγ (12Lin S. Cicala C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 985-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 13Dombrowicz D. Lin S. Flamand V. Brini A.T. Koller B.H. Kinet J.P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This was an unexpected finding, the molecular basis of which has not been elucidated so far. The β ITAM differs from the canonical ITAM in two ways: 1) it contains a third tyrosine between the canonical tyrosines; and 2) it has a shorter spacing between the canonical tyrosine residues. Whether these features are responsible for the unique functional characteristics of β has not been determined. Three additional features of FcRβ further explain why it has been the focus of many studies since its cloning. Firstly, it possesses the unique capacity of amplifying receptor expression, as evidenced by the higher level of expression of αβγ2 when compared with αγ2 (14Donnadieu E. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Immunity. 2000; 12: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This expression amplification results from the capacity of FcRβ to promote intracellular processing of the α chain. Secondly, genetics studies have identified the gene for FcRβ as a candidate gene for atopy, although the mechanism that underlies this effect is unknown (15Donnadieu E. Cookson W.O. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P. J. immunol. 2000; 165: 3917-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thirdly, the two FcϵRI isoforms, αγ2 and αβγ2, differ in their expression pattern and their functions. Although αβγ2 is expressed on effector cells of the allergic response, mast cells and basophiles, αγ2 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells in humans (rodents do not express αγ2), in which it participates in antigen presentation (16Maurer D. Ebner C. Reininger B. Fiebiger E. Kraft D. Kinet J.P. Stingl G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6285-6290PubMed Google Scholar, 17Maurer D. Fiebiger E. Reininger B. Ebner C. Petzelbauer P. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Stingl G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2731-2739PubMed Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine kinases of the Src family are responsible for phosphorylating the tyrosines in the ITAMs of the antigen receptors. In the case of FcϵRI, this kinase is Lyn (18Eiseman E. Bolen J. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 19Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Lyn is activated upon FcϵRI aggregation. Lyn is bound to β in resting cells by a mechanism that has not been identified. This association increases after FcϵRI aggregation (11Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Lyn is responsible for phosphorylating the β and γ chains (19Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and Lyn activation is the earliest signal detected upon FcϵRI aggregation. These findings highlight the critical role played by FcRβ in cell activation after FcϵRI aggregation. Phosphorylation of the γ ITAM by Lyn creates binding sites for the two SH2 domains of Syk, a protein tyrosine kinase of the Syk/ZAP-70 family (19Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Syk binding to FcRγ leads to Lyn-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the kinase. This step enables the productive interaction of active Syk with its many targets (26El-Hillal O. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. Scharenberg A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1919-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These targets include various adaptors and enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 27Turner H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1999; 402: B24-B30Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar and 28Rivera J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)). One of these is phospholipase Cγ1, which catalyzes the breakdown of membrane phospholipids to generate two second messengers, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. These signaling molecules are responsible for calcium (Ca2+) release from intracellular stores and activation of various protein kinase C isoforms, respectively. To further our understanding of how β acts as a signal amplifier, we investigated the role played by each of the three tyrosines of the β ITAM in controlling early signals after FcϵRI aggregation. We generated mutant human receptors in which each tyrosine individually or in combination was replaced with phenylalanine and then compared the signaling capacities of these mutated receptors to those of αβγ2 and αγ2. We found that the N-terminal tyrosine plays a predominant role in controlling early signals after FcϵRI aggregation. Our data also suggest a possible inhibitory role for the middle tyrosine on Ca2+ release. Cell Culture—The human monocytic cell line U937 and its transfectants were maintained in RPMI 1640 as described in Ref. 11Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.P. J.

Assessment of Surface FcϵRI and Total β Expression by Flow Cytometry—To detect surface FcϵRI expression, cells (106 cells/sample) were stained with 1 μg of biotinylated anti-NP human IgE followed by PE-SA (1:200 dilution) and then analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To assess the level of total β expressed, cells (106 cells/sample) were fixed with 1.8% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA, and then stained with 0.5 μg of anti-V5 Ab or mouse IgG2a (as isotype control) followed by PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab. Untransfected U937 cells were included in all experiments as negative control. Assessment of Surface FcϵRI Subunit Composition—To rule out a possible effect of the mutations in β on receptor assembly, the subunit composition of surface receptors was assessed. The various transfectants were loaded with the anti-α mAb 15-1, washed and lysed in mild conditions (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to maintain subunit association. The lysates were placed on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. 15-1-bound receptors were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed in lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), and blotted with anti-V5 (for β) and anti-γ Abs. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Films were scanned using the Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad) to obtain quantitative data (in arbitrary units) for bands on Western blots. Background counts present in windows of the same size as the ones used for the bands were subtracted to obtain specific counts. Cell Activation by Antigen and Lysis—U937 transfectants (107 cells/ml/sample) were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-NP human IgE for 1 h at 37 °C with rocking. Cells were washed and resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in calcium (Ca2+) buffer (pH 7.5) containing 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.1% BSA and then triggered with 25 ng/ml NP-BSA for 2 min at 37 °C. Near the end of stimulation, cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation and lysed at 3 × 107 cells/ml in the same lysis buffer as above. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, Western Transfer, and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation was performed with the Abs indicated in each case. Samples were processed as described above and blotted with the indicated Abs. In some cases, blots were stripped according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the ECL kit and reprobed with a different Ab. Measurement of Ca2+Mobilization—Transfected U937 cells were incubated with anti-NP IgE (10 μg/107 cells/ml at 37 °C for 1 h) and loaded with 2 μm fura-2 AM and 0.2 mg/ml Pluronic F-127 in Ca2+ buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples (5 × 106 cells in 2 ml of Ca2+ buffer) were analyzed in a cuvette-based Deltascan spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were recorded as the ratio of Fura-2 emission when excited at 340 and 380 nm. Mutation of the N-terminal Tyrosine Mimics the Phenotype of αγ2 Receptors on Aggregation-induced Receptor Phosphorylation—To study the tyrosines of the β chain, we took advantage of a reconstitution system that has been extensively characterized in our laboratory and was used to establish that the β chain is an amplifier (11Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dombrowicz D. Lin S. Flamand V. Brini A.T. Koller B.H. Kinet J.P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Donnadieu E. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Immunity. 2000; 12: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were generated in the U937 monocytoid cell line, which does not express the α and β chains, using the human α and γ cDNAs alone or in conjunction with the WT or mutated β cDNAs (used as V5-tagged) (Fig. 1A). FcϵRI surface expression was measured after staining with biotinylated human IgE and SA-PE. For each mutation, clones expressing similar FcϵRI density at the cell surface were selected for further analysis. The flow cytometric profile of some of these clones is shown in Fig. 1B. Human FcϵRI is expressed as two isoforms, αβγ2 and αγ2, which differ in their expression level and signaling capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to verify that mutations of the tyrosines do not affect either expression of β or subunit association, which could result in the expression of αγ2 trimers along with αβγ2 tetramers at the cell surface and would confer a lower signaling capacity upon these cells independently of a direct effect of the mutations in β. Note that it is unlikely that the receptors expressed at the cell surface on some mutants contain a significant proportion of αγ2 complexes since we selected clones with the same level of FcϵRI surface expression. If a significant proportion of αγ2 complexes was present at the cell surface in certain mutants, the mean expression level of the clones of these mutants would be reduced when compared with that of WT transfectants as a result of the loss of the expression amplification effect of β (14Donnadieu E. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Immunity. 2000; 12: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We did not observe such an effect. We first verified that among the clones selected for analysis, the mutants did not express less β than the αβγ2 clones by staining permeabilized cells with anti-V5 directed against the V5 tag appended to the N terminus intracellular tail of β (Fig. 1C). We then assessed the subunit composition of membrane receptors. Cells were saturated with the anti-α mAb 15-1, washed, and lysed. The membrane receptors were immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose, run on SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-V5 (β) and anti-γ (Fig. 1D). Although there was some clonal variability in the relative amounts of β and γ coprecipitated with α (Fig. 1D, compare clones 1 and 2 of YFY and clones 1 and 2 of FFY), no consistent differences were observed in the capacity of particular β mutants to interact with α and γ in vivo, except possibly for FFF. This indicates that there is no systematic effect of the mutations in β on receptor assembly. FcϵRI aggregation induces phosphorylation of β and γ on the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs. The role played by individual tyrosines in FcRβ has not been defined. In RBL cells strongly stimulated via the tetrameric FcϵRI, the C-terminal tyrosine was found to be significantly more phosphorylated than the N-terminal tyrosine, whereas phosphorylation of the middle tyrosine was the lowest (33Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11185-11192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whether this difference in the phosphorylation intensity of the three tyrosines is relevant for the β amplification function has not been determined. We compared aggregation-induced β and γ tyrosine phosphorylation among αβγ2, αγ2, and β mutant transfectants. Cells were loaded with anti-NP IgE and triggered with NP-BSA for 2 min. They were lysed in conditions (0.5% Triton X-100) that maintain subunit association and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-γ Ab 934 and blotting with the anti-PY Ab 4G10 (Fig. 2A and data not shown from two additional experiments). The intensity of the β and γ bands on the anti-PY and anti-V5 or anti-γ blots was quantified by scanning. Although we observed some clonal variability in the amount of β coprecipitated with γ, this is not due to intrinsic differences in the capacity of specific mutants of β to interact with α and γ in vivo, as we showed in Fig. 1D. To normalize the variable amounts of co-precipitated β, the specific values calculated from the phosphorylated β bands (in arbitrary units) were divided by the ratio of total β to total γ for the same clone calculated from the anti-β (V5) and anti-γ blots. The values were also normalized to the same ratio for the αβγ2 clones. For phosphorylated γ, the values were simply normalized to the value for total γ and then to the same value for the αβγ2 clone (Fig. 2A). As expected given the amplifier role of β, β and γ phosphorylation was strong in the αβγ2 transfectants, and γ phosphorylation was substantially lower in the αγ2 transfectants (12Lin S. Cicala C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 985-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Please note that in the anti-PY blot, FcRβ is represented by the top band in the smear between 36 and 22 kDa, as demonstrated by the absence of this band in the αγ2 lane. FcRβ phosphorylation was substantially diminished in the FYY transfectant (ratio to αβγ2 = 0.21). Furthermore, it was abolished in the double mutants that contain Y219F (FFY and FYF) and in FFF but not in the double mutant that does not contain Y219F, YFF (ratio = 0.14). This showed that in this experimental system, phosphorylation of the N-terminal tyrosine of β appeared to be predominant, in contrast with what had been shown previously (33Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11185-11192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). FcRγ phosphorylation was similarly affected. It was substantially diminished in FYY transfectants (ratio to αβγ2 = 0.08), in the double mutants that contained Y219F (FFY and FYF) (ratio = 0.22 and 0.12, respectively), and in FFF (ratio = 0.19). In fact, in the mutants containing Y219F, FcRγ phosphorylation was reduced to the level of αγ2 (ratio = 0.17). In contrast, in the double mutant that does not contain Y219F, YFF, γ phosphorylation was not decreased, suggesting that the effect of this mutation on β phosphorylation did not extend to downstream events. Similar conclusions about the predominant role of Tyr-219 on β phosphorylation can be drawn when β is directly precipitated with anti-V5 tag Ab (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these results show that the N-terminal tyrosine is the most phosphorylated of the three in intact cells and that its mutation abolishes the β amplifier function on γ phosphorylation. These results suggested that Tyr-219 may play a predominant role in β function. Tyr-225 and Tyr-229 may contribute to this function. The Y219F Mutation Destabilizes the Association of Lyn with β—Lyn of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases has been shown to be the major kinase responsible for FcϵRI tyrosine phosphorylation. Lyn is associated with FcϵRI in resting conditions, and this association increases after FcϵRI triggering. The mode of interaction between β and Lyn has not been elucidated completely. We assessed a possible effect of the β ITAM mutations on Lyn association with β by comparing the amount of Lyn coprecipitated with β in the various transfectants after FcϵRI triggering. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 to precipitate β and blotted with anti-Lyn (Fig. 3 and data not shown from two additional experiments). Although β-associated Lyn was easily detected in αβγ2 transfectants, it was substantially decreased or abolished when Tyr-219 was mutated (FYY, FFY, FYF, FFF), although reblotting with anti-V5 shows that the amount of immunoprecipitated β in these mutants was equivalent to, or higher than, that in the αβγ2 transfectants. The amount of Lyn coprecipitated was normalized to the amount of β precipitated and quantified as a ratio between the densities of the Lyn and β band (Fig. 3). The ratio in the FYY transfectant was 11% of the ratio in the αβγ2 transfectant and"
https://openalex.org/W1992127330,"The PREP, MEIS, and PBX families are mammalian members of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) class of homeodomain-containing transcription factors. These factors have been implicated in cooperative DNA binding with the HOX class of homeoproteins, but PREP and MEIS interact with PBX in apparently non-HOX-dependent cooperative DNA binding as well. PREP, MEIS, and PBX have all been reported to reside in the cytoplasm in one or more tissues of the developing vertebrate embryo. In the case of PBX, cytoplasmic localization is due to the modulation of nuclear localization signals, nuclear export sequences, and interaction with a cytoplasmic anchoring factor, non-muscle myosin heavy chain II B. Here we report that murine PREP2 exists in multiple isoforms distinguished by interaction with affinity-purified antibodies raised to N- and C-terminal epitopes and by nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization. Alternative splicing gives rise to some of these PREP2 isoforms, including a 25-kDa variant lacking the C-terminal half of the protein and homeodomain and having the potential to act as dominant-negative. We further show that cytoplasmic localization is due to the concerted action of nuclear export, as evidenced by sensitivity to leptomycin B, and cytoplasmic retention by the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Cytoplasmic PREP2 colocalizes with both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and coimmunoprecipitates with actin and tubulin. Importantly, disruption of either cytoskeletal system redirects cytoplasmic PREP2 to the nucleus. We suggest that transcriptional regulation by PREP2 is modulated through the subcellular distribution of multiple isoforms and by interaction with two distinct cytoskeletal systems. The PREP, MEIS, and PBX families are mammalian members of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) class of homeodomain-containing transcription factors. These factors have been implicated in cooperative DNA binding with the HOX class of homeoproteins, but PREP and MEIS interact with PBX in apparently non-HOX-dependent cooperative DNA binding as well. PREP, MEIS, and PBX have all been reported to reside in the cytoplasm in one or more tissues of the developing vertebrate embryo. In the case of PBX, cytoplasmic localization is due to the modulation of nuclear localization signals, nuclear export sequences, and interaction with a cytoplasmic anchoring factor, non-muscle myosin heavy chain II B.

Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Members of the TALE class are characterized by sequence relatedness and by a three amino acid loop extension between helices one and two of the homeodomain (2Featherstone M. Lufkin T. Murine Homeobox Gene Control of Embyronic Patterning and Organogenesis. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2003: 1-42Google Scholar). Families within the TALE group include PBC, MEIS, and PREP. Among the PBC family members, the fly extradenticle and vertebrate PBX proteins have been most intensively studied. PBC proteins bind DNA cooperatively with many but not all HOX proteins. Additionally, they form stable DNA-binding heterodimers with MEIS and PREP family members (2Featherstone M. Lufkin T. Murine Homeobox Gene Control of Embyronic Patterning and Organogenesis. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2003: 1-42Google Scholar). The ability of PBC proteins to interact with both HOX and MEIS/PREP partners results in DNA-bound heterotrimeric complexes that have been implicated in gene control in vitro and in vivo (3Jacobs Y.

Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 10Herzig S. Fuzesi L. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27989-27999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), consistent with the presence of these proteins in tissues devoid of Hox gene expression.In addition to the homeodomain, two conserved N-terminal domains, PBC-A and PBC-B, have been defined in PBC family proteins (11Bürglin T.R. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These regions are implicated in numerous processes including nuclear export, transcriptional repression, MEIS/PREP interaction, and binding to non-muscle myosin heavy chain II B (2Featherstone M. Lufkin T. Murine Homeobox Gene Control of Embyronic Patterning and Organogenesis. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2003: 1-42Google Scholar). Vertebrate MEIS proteins and fly homothorax are members of the MEIS family, whereas PREP is represented in vertebrates but not in flies. The related MEIS and PREP families share N-terminal regions termed homology region 1 (HR1) and HR2 (9Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with HR2 implicated in binding to PBC family proteins (12Knoepfler P.S. Calvo K.R. Chen H. Antonarakis S.E. Kamps M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14553-14558Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).Many TALE class homeoproteins have been shown to reside in the cytoplasm at certain times or sites of embryonic development. For example, extradenticle and PBX are cytoplasmic in the distal limb primordia of insects and vertebrates, respectively (13Gonzalez-Crespo S. Abu-Shaar M. Torres M. Martinez A.C. Mann R.S. Morata G. Nature. 1998; 394: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This distribution is critical for normal development, because forced nuclear accumulation of PBC proteins correlates with limb proximalization (13Gonzalez-Crespo S. Abu-Shaar M. Torres M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and by interaction with MEIS family proteins (14Rieckhof G.E. Casares F. Ryoo H.D. Abu-Shaar M. Mann R.S.

Reciprocally, MEIS is dependent on PBX for nuclear localization (21Choe S.K. Vlachakis N. Sagerstrom C.G. Development. 2002; 129: 585-595PubMed Google Scholar, 22Huang H. Paliouras M. Rambaldi I.

Paliouras M. Rambaldi I. Lasko P. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3636-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that subcellular localization of TALE class proteins could be influenced by signaling pathways impinging on the cytoskeleton.The PREP (also known as PKNOX) (25Chen H. Rossier C. Nakamura Y. Lynn A. Chakravarti A. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1997; 41: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) family has two members in mice and humans (9Berthelsen J.

In complexes with PBX, PREP1 regulates the transcription of HOX-dependent (Hoxb2) and HOX-independent (urokinase plasminogen activator, glucagon) target genes (5Ferretti E. Marshall H. Pöpperl H. Maconochie M. Krumlauf R. Blasi F. Development. 2000; 127: 155-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27989-27999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both PREP1 and PREP2 have been shown to accumulate in the cytoplasm of cultured and embryonic cells (19Berthelsen J. Kilstrup-Nielsen C. Blasi F. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 28Fognani C. Kilstrup-Nielsen C. Berthelsen J. Ferretti E. Zappavigna V. Blasi F.

Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When we used an affinity-purified antibody directed against an N-terminal epitope to assess PREP2 distribution in the mouse embryo, we noted widespread but essentially cytoplasmic expression (29Haller K. Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We report here that a second affinity-purified antibody directed against the PREP2 C terminus reveals nuclear staining and that between them the two antibodies recognize at least five distinct PREP2 isoforms. One of these isoforms has a molecular mass of 25 kDa and is the result of alternative splicing. We further show that cytoplasmic PREP2 is associated with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and that this cytoplasmic localization is dependent on CRM-1-mediated nuclear export and the integrity of cytoskeletal networks.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Antibodies—The PREP2 antibodies were raised as previously described (29Haller K. Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The N-terminal PREP2 antibody, PREP2NAB, is targeted against the region encoded by exon 2 (29Haller K. Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal PREP2 antibody (PREP2CAB) is targeted against residues 341–392. Cross-reactivity to PREP1 was removed from PREP2CAB by passing over a column bearing a fusion of glutathione S-transferase to murine PREP1 residues 322–380. The following antibodies were also used: anti-GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) mouse monoclonal antibody clone RK5C1 raised against residues 94–147 (sc-510, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody clone tub 2.1 (T-4026, Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-HA-11 antibody (MMS-101R, BabCO); mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody, clone AC 40 (A470, Sigma); anti-PBX1 (P-20) antibody (sc-889, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-TATA-binding protein antibody (SI 1) (sc 273, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-FLAG-agarose beads (A2220, Sigma); and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (R-415, Molecular Probes).Secondary Antibodies—The secondary antibodies used were as follows: marina blue-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (M-10991, Molecular Probes); rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (115-025-003, Jackson Laboratories); peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (115-035-003, Jackson Laboratories); peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (A0545, Sigma); and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (F-7512, Sigma).Drugs—The drugs used were as follows: cytochalasin D (C8273, Sigma); swinholide A (350-088-C010, Alexis Biochemicals); phalloidin (P2141, Sigma); paclitaxel (T1912, Sigma); nocodazole (M1404, Sigma); leptomycin B (LMB) (L2913, Sigma) kindly provided by Dr. M. Yoshida; and taxol (T1912, Sigma).Constructs—The full-length Prep2 coding region was PCR-amplified with NheI site-containing primers, subcloned into the vector TOPO II (Invitrogen), and sequenced (pPrep2-Topo). The Prep2-containing NheI fragment was then subcloned into the vector pFRED 143, 5′ to the GFP-coding region (construct A). pFRED 143 contains a humanized version of a strong mutant of GFP (Kyoji Horie and George N. Pavlakis, National Cancer Institute-Advanced Bioscience Laboratories.) A DNA fragment encoding the N terminus of PREP2 (residues 1–267) was fused to the GFP-coding region in the same manner (construct 2). Construct A was partially digested with NheI/XbaI, and the resulting full-length Prep2-gfp fusion was introduced into XbaI-digested pRC/CMV plasmid resulting in construct 1. Gal-O45 is a mammalian expression vector for the GAL4 DBD (30Rambaldi I. Nagy Kovács E. Featherstone M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For construct 3, pPrep2-Topo was digested with EcoRI/BamHI subcloned into BamHI-digested and -blunted Gal-045 3′ to the GAL-DBD-coding region. The cloning of PBX1-HA has been reported previously (18Saleh M. Huang H. Green N.C. Featherstone M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The expression vector for the G13R actin mutant was a generous gift from the Treisman laboratory. For constructing the plasmid HA-PREP2-Myc, pPrep2-Topo was digested with NheI and subcloned into pHAv (18Saleh M. Huang H. Green N.C. Featherstone M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This construct was further cleaved with BamHI/ApaI and inserted into pcDNA4/Myc-His A (Invitrogen).Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, NIH3T3, and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Drosophila S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. For immunohistological analysis, cells were grown on 12-mm-diameter round coverslips. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (NIH3T3) or LipofectAMINE 2000 (COS-7) reagents (Invitrogen).Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fractionation of Cell Extracts—NIH3T3 cells were scraped from confluent tissue culture dishes and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and cytoplasmic extracts were obtained by resuspending in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation, and nuclear proteins were extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100). Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (1873580, Roche Diagnostics) were added to each buffer. 40 μg of total protein were separated on a 10% SDS gel and analyzed by Western blotting.RNA Interference—A mixture of two double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides (Qiagen) was transfected into NIH3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus, and transfection efficiency was monitored by nonsilencing fluorescein-labeled control siRNA. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent followed by real-time PCR using SYBR Green Taq ReadyMix™ for quantitative PCR (S1816, Sigma) in a Roche LightCycler as described previously (31Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Nagy Kovacs E. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8090-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Quantification of the LightCycler data was performed using standard curves of serially diluted plasmid DNA of known concentration. Sequences for primers are as follows: GAPDH sense primer 5′-AACGACCCCTTCATTGAC-3′; GAPDH antisense primer 3′-TCCACGACATACTCAGCAC-5′; Prep2 sense primer 5′-CCAGGTCCTGAGGATC-3′ (16 bp); and Prep2 antisense primer (5′-CATGGAATTGGGGGAATTCTGCAGGAGGTC-3′ (30 bp). PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The sequences of siRNA oligonucleotides (one strand only) were as follows: (a) 5′-CCCAGAUCCUGCUCCCAAA-3′; (b) 5′-UGUCUGGAGUCUCCAAUAA-3′; and (c) 5′-CCAAGAUGCACAGUGAUAA-3′. Mixtures of siRNAs a and c or b and c gave comparable results.Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from P19 embryonal carcinoma cells using TRIzol reagent. Poly(A)+ RNA was then purified using the GenElute mRNA kit (Sigma). 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per well were run on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Nytran plus membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were sliced to give one well of fractionated mRNA per membrane strip and prehybridized and hybridized in Express hybridization solution and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 × 106 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled and denatured Prep2 probe were used in the hybridizations. Blots were exposed to x-ray film with screens either overnight (375-nucleotide 5′ probe) or for 7 days (156-nucleotide 3′ probe and 153-nucleotide intron 4 (int) probe). An adult mouse tissue poly(A)+ blot purchased from Clontech was described previously (29Haller K. Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The region used for probe marked int is shown in Fig. 5A, whereas the 3′ probe spanned the sequence coding for PREP2 amino acids 340–391.Coimmunoprecipitation—NIH3T3 cells grown to confluency in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in buffer, pH 7.9, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 mm HEPES. Cell debris was removed by a - min spin in a microcentrifuge, and the lysate was precleared with 100 μl of protein A-agarose (16-156, Upstate Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitation was performed for 1 h at 4 °C using 1.5–2 mg of whole cell extract and 1 μg of antibody/mg protein. Protein A-agarose beads were applied for 2 h in a volume of 100 μl at 4 °C. The complexes were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and eluted with a 1:1 ratio of water and 4× SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated on an 8% SDS gel and analyzed by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. Taxol was used at a concentration of 2 μm overnight.Actin Fractionation—The protocol for actin fractionation was adapted from Posern et al. (32Posern G. Sotiropoulos A. Treisman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4167-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Phalloidin was added for 10 min to the lysis buffer by using 10 μm drug. Cyochalasin D was applied at a concentration of 10 μm for 1 h to cells in culture.Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in methanol for 15 min at -20 °C, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Primary antibodies were applied for 2 h, whereas secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h. Cells were mounted with GelTol water-based mounting medium from Fisher (catalog number 28-607-87). Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 M confocal microscope and a Nikon digital camera DXM 1200 attached to a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 microscope. The protocol for immunohistological analysis of embryonic sections as well as the procedures for fixation and sectioning has been described previously (29Haller K. Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).RESULTSA C-terminal Antibody Detects PREP2 in the Nucleus—We have previously reported that an affinity-purified antibody (PREP2NAB) directed against the murine PREP2 N terminus (amino acids 18–64) gives largely cytoplasmic reactivity in numerous tissues of 8.5–12.5-dpc mouse embryos (29Haller K. Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although this result was consistent with other reports (19Berthelsen J. Kilstrup-Nielsen C. Blasi F. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 28Fognani C. Kilstrup-Nielsen C. Berthelsen J. Ferretti E. Zappavigna V. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2043-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it was surprising for a protein with a transcriptional function. Therefore, we raised and tested a second affinity-purified antibody (PREP2CAB) directed against the murine PREP2 C terminus (amino acids 341–392). In Western analysis, both PREP2NAB and PREP2CAB were highly specific for PREP2, failing to recognize the closely related PREP1, two additional members of the TALE class of homeoproteins, and numerous peptides within rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 1). A signal was not detected with these antibodies in untransfected Drosophila S2 cells or when preimmune sera were used instead of primary antibodies (data not shown). Moreover, preabsorption of the anti-sera with PREP2 peptides abolished reactivity in Western and immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 2, K and L) (data not shown). Thus, PREP2NAB and PREP2CAB are specific for PREP2.Fig. 1Affinity-purified anti-PREP2 antibodies specifically recognize PREP2 but not other PREP2-related proteins of the TALE class.

Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but was in contrast predominantly nuclear. This is shown in the nucleus (arrow) of choroid plexus epithelium (A), in the precartilage mesenchyme (C), by the cartilage in the intervertebral discs (D), in the dermal mesenchyme in the hind brain area (E), and in the mesenchyme between the spinal ganglia (SG) (F).

The tissue distribution of PREP2 protein was consistent with our previous observations (29Haller K. Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in striking contrast to results obtained with PREP2NAB, we now observed predominantly nuclear staining. Tissues with marked nuclear signals included the epithelium of the choroid plexus (Fig. 2A), precartilagenous mesenchyme (Fig. 2C), cartilage of the intervertebral discs (Fig. 2D), dermal mesenchyme in the hindbrain area (Fig. 2E), and mesenchyme between the spinal ganglia (Fig. 2F). As noted previously (29Haller K. Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 225: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), PREP2NAB gave cytoplasmic signals in these same tissues (Fig. 2B). These data suggested that PREP2 isoforms differing at their N and C termini localize to different subcellular compartments.To confirm and extend these results, we used PREP2NAB and PREP2CAB to examine PREP2 distribution in cells in culture (Fig. 2, G–L). In NIH3T3 cells, the PREP2NAB signal was consistently cytoplasmic but with faint and reproducible reactivity in the nucleus (Fig. 2G), whereas that of PREP2CAB was strongly nuclear (Fig. 2H). These observations were confirmed in a number of cell lines including COS-7, transfected S2, HEK293, and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown). Preincubation with fusions of glutathione S-transferase to the PREP2 N or C termini abolished reactivity (Fig. 2, K and L). Thus, PREP2 isoforms distinguished by N- and C-terminal-specific antibodies localize to distinct subcellular compartments in both embryonic and cultured cells.Distinct Isoforms of PREP2 Localize to Different Subcellular Compartments—To understand the basis of this differential localization, we used Western blot analysis to examine PREP2 in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of cultured cells. Confirming the results observed in immunofluorescence studies, PREP2NAB- and PREP2CAB-reactive species were distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of untransfected NIH3T3 (Fig. 3A) and COS-7 (data not shown). Strikingly, five PREP2 isoforms were detected, none of which was recognized by both antibodies and none of which was found in both subcellular compartments. Consistent with data from immunofluorescence, the majority of PREP2NAB-reactive material was found as high molecular mass species in the cytoplasmic fraction but also as a less abundant 25-kDa nuclear isoform.Fig. 3Multiple PREP2 isoforms are partitioned between the nucleus and cytoplasm and are sensitive to RNA interference.

https://openalex.org/W2020678474,"The recently identified human NEIL2 (Nei-like-2) protein, a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase specific for oxidatively damaged bases, shares structural features and reaction mechanism with the Escherichia coli DNA glycosylases, Nei and Fpg. Amino acid sequence analysis of NEIL2 suggested it to have a zinc finger-like Nei/Fpg. However, the Cys-X2-His-X16-Cys-X2-Cys (CHCC) motif present near the C terminus of NEIL2 is distinct from the zinc finger motifs of Nei/Fpg, which are of the C4 type. Here we show the presence of an equimolar amount of zinc in NEIL2 by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Individual mutations of Cys-291, His-295, Cys-315, and Cys-318, candidate residues for coordinating zinc, inactivated the enzyme by abolishing its DNA binding activity. H295A and C318S mutants were also shown to lack bound zinc, and a significant change in their secondary structure was revealed by CD spectra analysis. Molecular modeling revealed Arg-310 of NEIL2 to be a critical residue in its zinc binding pocket, which is highly conserved throughout the Fpg/Nei family. A R310Q mutation significantly reduced the activity of NEIL2. We thereby conclude that the zinc finger motif in NEIL2 is essential for its structural integrity and enzyme activity.

Until recently, only two DNA glycosylases, NTH1 (endonuclease III homolog) and OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase), have been characterized in mammals, which are responsible for repair of oxidized pyrimidine and purine base lesions, respectively. Both OGG1 and NTH1, orthologs of the Escherichia coli glycosylase Nth, utilize an internal Lys residue as the active site nucleophile and carry out β-elimination at the abasic (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, abasic; DTT, dithiothreitol; Fpg, FapyG-DNA glycosylase; Nei, endonuclease VIII; NEIL, Nei-like; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; B11, 11-nt bubble; PDB, Protein Data Bank; 5-OHU·G, 5-hydroxyuracil.1The abbreviations used are: AP, abasic; DTT, dithiothreitol; Fpg, FapyG-DNA glycosylase; Nei, endonuclease VIII; NEIL, Nei-like; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; B11, 11-nt bubble; PDB, Protein Data Bank; 5-OHU·G, 5-hydroxyuracil. site generated after base removal (4Ikeda S.

The recombinant NEILs are active in excising a variety of oxidatively damaged bases but show significant differences in substrate preference. NEIL1 prefers reactive oxygen species-derived pyrimidines lesions and also efficiently removes FapyG and FapyA, the ring-opened oxidation products of purines (9Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I.

NEIL2 removes oxidized pyrimidine substrates from duplex DNA but is more efficient in excising oxidized bases when they are located in a DNA bubble structure (14Dou H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49679-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).NEIL2 shares overall identity of 32 and 27% with Fpg and Nei, respectively, and the key residues of the E. coli enzymes, particularly the N-terminal PE(L/G)P(E/L) motif, are completely conserved in NEIL2 (10Hazra T.K.

In contrast to the Nth family, the Fpg/Nei family utilizes two DNA binding motifs, a helix-two-turn-helix (15Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and a zinc finger motif (16Sugahara M. Mikawa T. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Kato R. Fukuyama K. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3857-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Fpg and Nei share significant homology with each other including the sequence of the zinc finger motif, which is of the C4 type (17Zharkov D.O. Shoham G. Grollman A.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 839-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, several proteins associated with DNA repair, such as Xeroderma Pigmentosum complementation group A, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and replication-associated protein A (RPA), have been shown to contain zinc finger domains (22Tanaka K.

In E. coli, the UvrA protein, which is involved in DNA damage recognition during nucleotide excision repair, also possesses zinc finger domain (26Navaratnam S. Myles G.M. Strange R.W. Sancar A. J.

Nature. 1986; 323: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Identification of zinc finger motifs in the ever-growing number of DNA-binding proteins is based primarily on the presence of conserved Cys or His residues and the spacing between them, which may be critical in recognition of specific double-stranded DNA sequences.Here we show that NEIL2 possesses a single unusual CHCC-type zinc finger motif at its C terminus, which is distinct from that of Nei/Fpg, and that this motif is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and activity of NEIL2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of Wild-type (WT) and Mutant NEIL2 Polypeptides—The WT full-length NEIL2 was cloned between the NdeI/XhoI sites of the expression plasmid pRSETB (Invitrogen) (10Hazra T.K.

The NEIL2 mutants (C291S, H295A, C315S, C318S, and R310A) were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and their authenticity was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing.Log-phase cultures of E. coli DE884 mutM nei were transformed with expression plasmids of WT and mutant NEIL2 and then induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C for 16 h. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were suspended in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease inhibitor mixture. After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis or activity assay by trapping analysis (10Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W. Hatahet Z. Imhoff B. Boldogh I. Mokkapati S.K. Mitra S. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).Purification of Anti-NEIL2 Antibody and Western Blot Analysis— Polyclonal anti-NEIL2 antibodies were purified from rabbit antisera produced by Alpha Diagnostics (San Antonio, TX) by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) covalently coupled to NEIL2. NEIL2-specific IgG was eluted with glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris base and stored at -80 °C after concentration (Amicon) and dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Lysates of E. coli (2 μg) expressing WT and mutants of NEIL2 were used for immunoblot analysis using ECL system as per manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences).Analysis of Trapped NEIL2 Complexes—A 32P-labeled duplex oligomer (100 fmol) containing 5-OHU·G was incubated with lysates (1 μg) of E. coli expressing WT or mutant NEIL2 in 15 μl of assay buffer in the presence of 25 mm NaCNBH3 at 37 °C for 30 min. The trapped complexes were then separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide) as described previously (10Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W. Hatahet Z. Imhoff B. Boldogh I. Mokkapati S.K. Mitra S. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).Purification of Wild-type and Mutant NEIL2—The recombinant WT NEIL2 polypeptide was purified as before (10Hazra T.K.

Two of the mutant proteins, namely C291S and H295A, were also purified similarly with some protocol modifications. After Polymin P precipitation, the ammonium sulfate-fractionated pellets were dialyzed in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm DTT) containing 100 mm NaCl and passed through 5-ml Q- and SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) columns attached in tandem, which were then washed with 120 mm NaCl. The mutant NEIL2 proteins in the flow-through were concentrated in an Amicon filter and loaded onto a 25-ml Superdex 75 column. The fractions eluted from Superdex were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono Q using NaCl gradient (20–200 mm) in buffer A. The NEIL2 mutants eluted at around 75 mm NaCl. The other two mutant proteins, C291S and C315S, were subcloned into a C-terminal His tag-containing vector, pET22b (Novagen). After induction and sonication as before, the cells were spun down at 13 K and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotrioacetate-agarose column (Qiagen) previously equilibrated with buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 m NaCl). After washing with buffer B, the His-tagged mutant proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient (20–200 mm imidazole in buffer B). After elution, the peak enzyme fractions were dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). The enzymes were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column like the untagged mutants. The arginine mutant R310Q was also His-tagged in the C terminus and purified from the extract of plasmid-bearing E. coli by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotrioacetate-agarose (Qiagen). After elution with 150 mm imidazole, the enzyme was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl and finally purified on a Mono S column. Purified preparations of WT or mutant NEIL2 proteins were never frozen and were stored at -20 °C in PBS containing 50% glycerol.Incision Assay with 5-OHU-containing Bubble Oligomer—DNA strand cleavage at the abasic (AP) site after damaged base excision by NEIL2 occurs because of its intrinsic AP lyase activity. We have shown previously that NEIL2 has higher activity when the lesion is inside a bubble in an otherwise duplex oligomer (14Dou H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49679-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The strand incision by NEIL2 was used for its assay using an oligomer containing 5-OHU in the middle of unpaired 11-nt bubble (B11) as described previously (14Dou H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49679-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The 51-mer oligomer, 32P-labeled at the 5′ terminus of the lesion-containing strand, was incubated with NEIL2 (WT and mutants) at 37 °C for 15 min in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. After the reaction was stopped with 80% formamide and 20 mm NaOH, the cleaved oligomers were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide containing 7 m urea in 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 2 mm EDTA. The radioactivity in the substrate and cleaved product was analyzed by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The wild-type and mutant NEIL2 (C291S, H295A, C315S, C318S, and R310Q) were incubated with a 5′-32P-labeled 5-OHU-containing bubble oligomer (5-OHU·B11) in 10 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 12% glycerol at 20 °C for 15 min followed by electrophoresis in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 55 mm borate, and 0.6 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at room temperature. The radioactivity in the shifted DNA protein complex was analyzed by PhosphorImager.Quantitation of Zinc in NEIL2—The zinc content of wild-type and mutant NEIL2 polypeptides was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The enzymes were dialyzed against PBS prior to analysis of Zn2+ using a calibration curve with known amounts of Zn2+. The Zn content of the enzymes was corrected for contamination in the dialysis buffer.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—All of the CD spectra were collected from proteins after dialysis and filtration in an AVIV 60DS spectrometer at 25 °C. An average of three scans of the spectra (250–200 nm) was used to obtain the final data. The molar ellipticity (θ) was calculated using Equation 1,θ=θobs×10−3×MWC×l×n×10−2deg dmol−1cm2(Eq. 1) where θobs is the observed ellipticity, MW is molecular weight, C is concentration (mg/ml), l is the path length of the cuvette in centimeters, and n refers to the number of residues. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard.Molecular Modeling of 192–319 Residues of NEIL2—The sequence of NEIL2 with the potential DNA binding region (residues 192–319) was used as the seed sequence to search for a suitable template using BIOSERVER (meta server located at bioserv.cbs.cnrs.fr/). BIOSERVER submits to fold-recognition servers like 3D-PSSM (28Bates P.A. Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.

Structurally conserved regions or the fragments defined by excluding gaps in the pairwise alignment were used to extract geometric constraints. Upper and lower distance constraints were defined either by adding or subtracting a threshold of 0.25 Å to the actual distance for matching side-chain and main-chain (backbone) atoms. To position the side chains of Cys-291, His-295, Cys-315, and Cys-318, additional distance constraints among heavy side chain atoms were extracted from a CHCC-type zinc finger found in the DNA-binding domain of RAG1 (PDB code 1rmd, residues Cys-41, His-43, Cys-61, Cys-64). Upper- and lower-bound dihedral angle constraints were defined by adding or subtracting 5°. A total of 30 distance constraints per atom were extracted from the matching regions of the template. Models were generated using the distance geometry program DIAMOD. A few cycles of constrained energy minimization were applied using the program FANTOM, which minimizes constraint energies by successive application of quasi-Newton and Newton-Raphson minimizers (36Schaumann T. Braun W. Wuthrich K. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 679-694Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), using the ECEPP/2 forcefield. The conformational energy of the model after energy minimization was -410 kcal/mol.RESULTSExpression and Activity of WT and Mutant NEIL2 in Crude E. coli Extracts—Sequence alignment of NEIL2 with Fpg and Nei predicted that NEIL2 is a zinc finger protein with a CHCC-type motif near the C terminus. Cys-291, His-295, Cys-315, and Cys-318 are candidate residues for coordinating Zn2+ (Fig. 1). This motif is distinct from the zinc finger motifs of Nei/Fpg, which are of the CCCC type (17Zharkov D.O. Shoham G. Grollman A.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 839-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Single point mutants of NEIL2, C291S, H295A, C315S, and C318S were expressed in E. coli, and their expression was monitored by Western analysis (Fig. 2A). The mutations did not affect the expression of NEIL2 in E. coli as indicated by the presence of a protein band of the predicted size in each induced bacterial lysate. In E. coli expressing the H295A mutant, a protein with slight slower migration was observed, which was not present (lane 2) in the control extract of E. coli, expressing the empty vector. Thus this band should be the H295A mutant of NEIL2. This analysis also underscored the strong specificity of the antibody.Fig. 2Expression and activity of WT and mutant NEIL2 in crude E. coli extracts.

B, analysis of trapped complexes with extracts of E. coli expressing WT and mutant NEIL2. 5′-32P-labeled 5-OHU·G (0.1 pmol) was incubated with no protein, recombinant NEIL2, vector control, and E. coli extracts in the presence of NaCNBH3 before SDS-PAGE.

Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 38Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We have shown earlier that NEIL2, similar to other MutM/Nei type enzymes, is inactivated when the N-terminal Pro, the active site nucleophile, is blocked or eliminated (10Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W.

Fig. 2B shows SDS-PAGE separation of 32P-labeled trapped complexes generated with extracts of mutM nei E. coli harboring WT or mutant NEIL2 expression plasmids after incubation of a 5-OHU·G-containing oligomer. Because the mobility of such complexes reflects the size of the DNA glycosylase when the same oligomer substrate is used, it is evident that, in control E. coli lacking Fpg and Nei, only endogenous Nth formed a major trapped complex (lane 3). Crude bacterial lysates harboring WT NEIL2 formed a trapped complex of the same size as the purified recombinant NEIL2 (lane 2) used as a marker. However, the lack of such trapped complexes with crude lysates expressing various mutant NEIL2 proteins (lanes 5–8) suggests that the mutants are inactive as AP lyases. This loss of activity is probably the result of a loss of the zinc finger motif, critical either for structural integrity or the DNA binding activity of this enzyme.DNA Binding and Incision Activity of Purified WT and Mutant NEIL2—Wild type and NEIL2 mutants (C291S, C315S, C318S, H295A, and R310Q) were purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, the H295A mutant migrated abnormally and ran more slowly than the WT or the other mutants. We have shown earlier that NEIL2 is active in excising several cytosine-derived lesions and has robust activity for 5-OHU in bubble DNA (14Dou H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49679-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Purified WT and mutant NEIL2 polypeptides were tested for DNA incision assays with a 5-OHU-containing bubble oligomer (5 OHU·B11). The expected βδ-elimination product, i.e. cleaved 5-OHU-containing strand with 3′-phosphate termini, was observed with the WT NEIL2 protein (14Dou H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49679-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, neither mutant NEIL2 generated the oligomer fragment to a detectable extent (Fig. 4A). The WT and mutant proteins were also assayed for their DNA binding activity by gel mobility shift assay with 5 OHU containing B11 oligomer. Again the DNA protein complex was observed only with WT NEIL2 (lane 2) but not the mutant proteins (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–6).Fig. 3Purification of WT and mutant NEIL2. WT (lane 1), C291S, H295A, R310Q, C315S, and C318S mutant NEIL2 (lanes 3–7) proteins purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE.

The 410-amino acid β2f subunit is encoded by exons 1A, 2A, 3, 4, 12, 13, and 14 of the human Cavβ2 gene and lacks the protein kinase A phosphorylation site, the β-interaction domain (De Waard, M., Pragnell, M., and Campbell, K. P. (1994) Neuron 13, 495–503), 40% of the β-SH3 domain, and 73% of the guanylate kinase domain of the putative membrane-associated guanylate kinases module (McGee, A. W., Nunziato, D. A., Maltez, J. M., Prehoda, K. E., Pitt, G. S., and Bredt, D. S. (2004) Neuron 42, 89–99), and helix α3 of the α1-subunit binding pocket (Van Petegem F., Clark, K. A., Chatelain, F. C., and Minor, D. L., Jr. (2004) Nature 429, 671–675). The β2g transcript has two potential initiation codons. With the second ATG codon, it generates the 164-amino acid β2Δg subunit encoded essentially by the distal part of exon 14, and thus β2Δg completely lacks any of the above motifs. Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed stable association of β2f and β2Δg with the α1C subunit. The plasma membrane localization of β2f and β2Δg was substantially increased by co-expression of the α1C,77 and α2δ subunits. In COS1 cells, β2f and β2Δg increased plasma membrane targeting of the pore-forming α1C subunit and differentially facilitated (β2f > β2Δg) the voltage gating of otherwise silent Cav1.2 channels. We conclude that it is unlikely that the β-interaction domain, membrane-associated guanylate kinases module, and the α1-subunit binding pocket helix α3 are essential for the interaction of the α1C and β2 subunits and suggest that in addition to the α1-subunit binding pocket helices α5 and α8, a yet unresolved C-terminal β2 region plays a crucial role.

The L-type high voltage-activated Cav1.2 channel is composed of the pore-forming α1C subunit and the auxiliary β and α2δ subunits. The Cavβ subunits (1Ruth P. Rohrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E.

The α1C and β subunits are tightly associated in the channel complex and can be co-immunoprecipitated in mild non-ionic detergents.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The α1-β interaction is believed to chaperon the channel by inhibiting an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal encoded in the α1 subunit I-II linker (5Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Comparative studies showed that β subunits differentially modulate inactivation kinetics (6Lory P. Varadi G. Slish D.F. Varadi M. Schwartz A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and single-channel properties of the Cav1.2 channel (7Hullin R. Khan I.F.Y. Wirtz S. Mohacsi P. Varadi G. Schwartz A. Herzig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21623-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have found that the differential β-subunit modulation predominantly influences the slow inactivation of the channel and is associated with distinct voltage-gated rearrangements between the N-terminal regions of the α1C and β2 subunits (8Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Structural principles underlying the β-subunit modulation of Ca2+ channels were also approached by a search of structural homology with known regulatory proteins. It has been found (9Hanlon M.R. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Wallace B.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that the vast central conservative region of β2 subunits shares distant homology with the Src homology 3 (SH3)-guanylate kinase (GK) module of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs). This hypothesis was further elaborated by studying mutations of the rat (N terminus-palmitoylated) β2a subunit that interfere with interactions between SH3 and GK and affect inactivation of Ba2+ currents (10McGee A.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7193-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Intramolecular interactions between the β-subunit SH3 and GK homologues were supported by the results of the recent high-resolution crystallography studies of the β-subunit “cores” of SH3-GK domains alone or in complex with AID (12Opatowsky Y. Chen C.-C. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L.

Instead, the α-subunit binding pocket (ABP) distal to the SH3 domain was inferred as a structure engaged in the interaction with AID.The first cardiac β2 subunits cloned from rat (15Perez-Reyes E.

A recent comprehensive study revealed that in the human left ventricle there are nine Cavβ2 splice variants, including β2b, β2c, β2d, and β2e; the exon 7C isoforms of β2b, β2c, and β2d; the exon 7B isoform of β2b; as well as the β2b transcript lacking exon 7 and truncated in the exon 8 region (18Foell J.D. Balijepalli R.C. Delisle B.P. Yunker A.M.R. Robia S.L. Walker J.W. McEnery M.W. January C.T. Kamp T.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 17: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we report on two new splice variants of the Ca2+ channel β2 subunit gene cloned from the human normal heart poly(A)(+) mRNA and sequentially named β2f and β2g. The β2f and β2g transcripts lack exons encoding a single protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site, BID, as well as a large part (β2f) or the entire SH3-GK module (β2g). Despite the wide structural differences between β2f/β2g and the rest of the β2 subunits, the new β2 subunits yielded fully functional Cav1.2 channels with different inactivation characteristics when co-expressed in COS1 cells with the α2δ and the human vascular α1C,77 subunits. These data indicate the need to redefine the significance of the previously outlined β subunit functional motifs and implicate the C-terminal region encoded by the distal β2 gene exon in modulation of the channel.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of the Short Human Cardiac Cavβ2 Subunits—The Ca2+ channel β2f and β2g subunits were cloned from the human heart poly(A)(+) mRNA pooled from three Caucasian males (ages 35, 55, and 55; cause of death, trauma) (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA; catalog number 6533-1) using C. therm. Polymerase One-Step reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (Roche Applied Science). The RT reaction was carried out for 30 min at 57 °C with a common RT oligonucleotide primer, 5′-ACATATGATTGCAGTGTAGACC-3′, designed from the β2 subunit 3′-untranslated region (nt 804058–804079 in the Human Genome Contig NT_8705.15 of chromosome 10). In the first round of PCR, a common antisense 5′-GCTGTTAGTTATACAAGACTTC-3′ primer (nt 804014–804035) was used to amplify β2f and β2g with the sense β2d-specific 5′-ATGGTCCAAAGGGACATGTC-3′ (nt 404991–405010) or the β2b-specific 5′-ATGCTTGACAGACGCCTTATA-3′ (nt 605181–605201) primer, respectively. PCR mixtures were denatured for 2 min at 94 °C followed by 30 PCR cycles, each composed of denaturing for 45 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 51 °C, and extension for 2.5 min at 72 °C, with the last step of the last cycle extended to 10 min. For the second round of PCR with “nested primers,” a common antisense 5′-gctctagagTCATTGGCGGATGTAAACATC-3′ primer (nt 803958–803978, attached to an XbaI linker shown in small letters) was used with the sense 5′-gccaccATGGTCCAAAGGGACATGTCCAAG-3′ (β2f) and 5′-gccaccATGCTTGACAGACGCCTTATAGCTC-3′ (β2g) primers (incorporating Kozak sequence, shown in small letters in front of the ATG start codon) and the same PCR conditions except with an increased annealing temperature (58 °C). The RT-PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), ligated into the pCR2.1 TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions. To generate β2Δg, the β2g-coding TA clone was amplified using an antisense primer, as shown above for the second round of PCR, and the sense primer 5′-cgggatccgccaccATGTATCTCTGGAGGAGGACCGGG-3′, which starts at the second ATG codon and has a Kozak sequence preceded by a BamHI linker at the 5′-end. For expression in eukaryotic cells, the β2f- and β2Δg-coding clones were ligated into the pcDNA3 vector at the XbaI (filled)–NotI and BamHI–XhoI sites, respectively. To systematically investigate subcellular localization of the α1C and β subunits in situ, their N termini were genetically fused to EYFP and ECFP, respectively. Experimentally, such labeling did not interfere with the functional expression of the channel in our previous (8Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R.

To generate (ECFP)N-β2f, the β2f coding sequence was supplemented with the 5′-NcoI (Klenow-blunted) and 3′-ApaI linkers and ligated into the 5′-ECFP-pcDNA3 vector at the XhoI (filled) and ApaI sites. To generate (ECFP)N-β2Δg, the β2Δg-coding sequence was supplemented with the 5′-BamHI and 3′-XhoI linkers and ligated into the 5′-ECFP-pcDNA3 vector at the respective sites.Immunoprecipitation Analysis—The (ECFP)N-labeled β2f or β2Δg subunits (replaced by EGFP in the negative control) were expressed in HEK293 cells in the presence or in the absence of α1C,77 and α2δ. The labeled proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with Living Color full-length A.V. polyclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech) as described in detail earlier (8Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The (ECFP)N-labeled β subunits were identified on Western blots by Living Color monoclonal antibody JL-8 (1:8,000 dilution; BD Biosciences Clontech). The co-precipitated α1C subunits were detected with the affinity-purified rabbit anti-α1C calcium channel polyclonal antibody (1:10,000; Chemicon International) using an ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Electrophysiology—Expression in COS1 cells, all electrophysiological measurements, and fluorescence microscopy were carried out under standard conditions described in Kobrinsky et al. (8Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and thus allow for direct comparison with our previous investigations of the β1a and β2 subunits. Briefly, COS1 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (MatTek) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with cDNAs coding for the α1C, β, and α2δ subunits (1:1:1, weight for weight) using the Effectene kit (Qiagen). Membrane currents in transfected COS1 cells were recorded 48–72 h after transfection by the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration from individual single cells. The extracellular (bath) solution contained (in mm) 100 NaCl, 20 BaCl2 or CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES at pH 7.4. The internal (pipette) solution contained (in mm) 110 CsCl, 5 MgATP, 10 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate, 20 tetraethylammonium, 0.2 cAMP, and 20 HEPES at pH 7.4. When filled with the internal solution, pipettes (Kimax-51, Kimble, Vineland, NJ) had resistance ranging between 3 and 6 megohms. Current tracings were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 2.5–5 kHz. Data were acquired using the Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and corrected for leakage using an on-line P/4 subtraction paradigm.Fluorescent Microscopy—All cell images were obtained on an epifluorescent Nikon microscope TE200 equipped with a 10-bit digital Hamamatsu CCD camera C4742–95 (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). Image processing and analysis were performed with the SimplePCI 5.3 software (Compix, Pittsburgh, PA).RESULTSMolecular Cloning and Structural Properties of the Short Human Cardiac β2f and β2g Subunits—Two new short splice variants of the Ca2+ channel β2 subunit gene, named β2f and β2g (Fig. 1A), were cloned by RT-PCR from the poly(A)(+) fraction of the human normal heart mRNA. The RT and PCR primers for the cloning were deduced from the Human Genome Project draft sequence NT_008705.15 of chromosome 10. The β2f subunit has a theoretical molecular mass of 45.8 kDa, is composed of 410 aa, and has the N terminus encoded by exons 1A and 2A analogous to β2d (18Foell J.D. Balijepalli R.C. Delisle B.P. Yunker A.M.R. Robia S.L. Walker J.W. McEnery M.W. January C.T. Kamp T.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 17: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, missing in the β2f transcript are exons 5–11 coding for the 250-aa central region of the β2 protein, including BID, as well as 55 of 136 aa (i.e. 40%) of the C-terminal part of the SH3 domain and 192 of 262 aa (i.e. 73%) of the N-terminal part of GK domain. Overall, the following crystallographically resolved structures (13Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) are absent from the β2f protein: antiparallel β-strands β3–β5 and the second α-helix (α2) of the first conserved domain, the entire variable domain V2, as well as parallel β-sheets β6–β9, two α-helices (α3–α4), and two 310 helices (η2-η3) of the second conserved domain. Thus, the entire linker between SH3 and GK (“HOOK domain”) present in MAGUKs is deleted from the β2f subunit.The even smaller β2g-subunit transcript is composed of exon 2c followed by the 72-nt upstream portion of exon 3 and the 463-nt distal part of exon 14. Although exon 2c encodes the N terminus of the β2b subunit, the reading frame is interrupted just 150 nt downstream of the first initiation codon. The second ATG codon occurs 91 nt downstream from the first one, or 34 nt downstream from the acceptor splice site of exon 3. Its reading frame includes the distal 463-nt sequence of the β2 3′-terminal exon 14. Thus, both exons 3 and 14 are alternatively spliced in β2g, but the respective utilized donor and acceptor splice sites do not conform to the consensus sequences. With the second initiation codon, the β2g-subunit transcript encodes a 164-aa protein with the calculated molecular mass of 19.5 kDa. This splice variant, referred further as β2Δg, has been generated by a PCR deletion of the 91-nt upstream region including the first ATG codon. Both the β2f and β2Δg subunits lack the PKA phosphorylation site (RKST in position 216 of the human β2d) that was shown to be involved in the PKA-mediated stimulation of cardiac L-type Ca2+ currents (20Bünemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33851-33854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, β2f retains only 6 of 12 potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, (S/T)X(R/K), in positions 78, 198, 302, 343, 382, and 441. The last three sites are also present in the β2Δg subunit.Although β2f and β2Δg were cloned from the polyadenylated fraction of mRNA, none of the studied short β2 splice variants has yet been shown to be expressed in the human heart as functional proteins. Because of this and as the usage of initiation codons in β2g remains unknown, β2Δg is considered a putative splice variant of the β2g subunit. Nevertheless, because β2Δg lacks not only BID and the entire SH3-GK domains but also the variable β2-subunit N termini-coding exons, β2Δg is particularly interesting for the study of the functional significance of these genetically deleted motifs. To investigate whether the structural deletions discovered in the new β2 splice variants affect their interaction with the α1C subunits, co-immunoprecipitation of the short β2 subunits with the wild-type α1C,77 was analyzed by Western blot assay (Fig. 1B). ECFP was genetically fused to the N termini of the new β2 splice variants by in-frame ligation of the ECFP and β2f/β2Δg coding sequences, and the (ECFP)N-labeled β2 subunits were co-expressed in HEK293 cells with the α2δ and α1C,77 subunits. Similar to the β1a and the β2(r) subunits (8Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the (ECFP)N labeling did not compromise their functional activity (data not shown). Use of antibody against GFP to co-immunoprecipitate (ECFP)N-β2 variants and α1C,77 from the solubilized membrane particulate fraction of HEK293 cells helped to avoid a contamination with the nonassociated cytosolic (ECFP)N-β2 and the membrane-bound orphan α1C subunits. Both β2f (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and β2Δg (lane 2) pulled down the α1C,77 protein from the solubilized membrane preparations suggesting stable association between the subunits. A similar observation was made with β1a, β2(r) (8Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and other β proteins. In controls, no immunoprecipitation of the α1C subunit by anti-GFP antibody was found in the absence of (ECFP)N-β2 variants in COS1 cell with (Fig. 1B, lane 3) or without (lane 4) EGFP co-expressed. These data indicate that the α2δ and α1C subunits are necessary for the plasma membrane targeting by the β2f and β2Δg subunits.The β2f Subunit Stimulates the Plasma Membrane Targeting and Facilitates the Cav1.2 Channel Voltage Gating—To better characterize the cellular location of the expressed α1C and β subunits, the (ECFP)N-labeled β2f and β2Δg were expressed with α1C,77 and α2δ subunits in COS1 cells lacking the endogenous Ca2+ channels (21Meir A. Bell D.C. Stephens G.J. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 731-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast to the data obtained with Xenopus oocytes (10McGee A.W. Nunziato D.A. Maltez J.M. Prehoda K.E. Pitt G.S. Bredt D.S.

A. 2004; 101: 7193-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), heterologous expression of the α1C and α2δ subunits in COS1 cells did not induce an appreciable Ca2+ channel activity (Fig. 2A) unless a β subunit was co-expressed (Fig. 2B). Thus, selection of the COS1 cells expression system allowed us to avoid ambiguity in the assessment of the β-subunit modulation of the Ca2+ channel typical for the cited studies (10McGee A.W.

Essential prerequisites for a β-subunit modulation of the channel are binding of Cavβ to the α1C subunit and targeting of the oligomeric channel complex to the plasma membrane.Fig. 2Effect of the β2f subunit on functional expression, subcellular distribution, and electrophysiological properties of the Ca2+ channel. A, IBa recorded from a COS1 cell transfected by the (EYFP)N-α1C,77 and α2δ subunits (inset shows the whole-cell EYFP) in response to a 600-ms test pulse to +20 mV from the holding potential of –90 mV. B, panel a, representative traces of IBa in response to the indicated test pulses (Vh = –90 mV) from a COS1 cell transiently transfected with the (EYFP)N-α1C,77, α2δ and β2f subunits.

The expression level of the labeled proteins was approximately the same (compare unadjusted fluorescence scales in the right panels).

Scaling bars, 3 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the absence of Cavβ, the (EYFP)N-labeled α1C,77 is essentially retained in intracellular compartments of the cell (Fig. 2C, a). Similar to β2(r) (Fig. 2E, c) (8Kobrinsky E. Kepplinger K.J.F. Yu A. Harry J.B. Kahr H. Romanin C. Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 844-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), co-expression of the β2f subunit increased surface membrane targeting of (EYFP)N-α1C,77, which is evident from a comparison of the subcellular distribution of fluorescence in the absence (Fig. 2C, a) and in the presence of β2f (Fig. 2C, b). Conversely, α1C increased plasma membrane targeting of the β2f subunit. In the absence of α1C, the (ECFP)N-labeled β2f subunit was diffusely distributed over the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C, c). A similar intracellular localization, typical for cytosolic proteins, was observed with the full-size (ECFP)N-β2(r) (Fig. 2E, a). Co-expression of α1C,77 increased the plasma membrane localization of the (ECFP)N-β2f subunit (Fig. 2C, d) analogously to the effect of α1C,77 on the (ECFP)N-β2(r) in positive control (Fig. 2E, b). These data corroborate the results of immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and provide strong evidence that β2f binds to α1C,77 and facilitates the channel formation and its plasma membrane targeting. Thus, the β2f subunit displayed both the chaperon function and binding to α1C, which are features characteristic for β2(r) and other β subunits (2Dolphin A.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 599-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).Despite the large structural differences between β2f and the other known β2 subunits, when co-expressed in COS1 cells with the human vascular α1C,77 subunit and α2δ, the new β2f subunit yields a fully functional Cav1.2 channel. Fig. 2B (panel c) shows representative traces of the Ba2+ current (IBa) evoked by the 600-ms test pulses to the indicated voltages applied from Vh = –90 mV. The corresponding averaged normalized I-V relationship is presented in Fig. 2B, d. The values for the half-maximal activation (V0.5 = 1.8 ± 1.7 mV) and the slope factor (kI-V = –7.9 ± 0.9; n = 9) were essentially similar to those reported earlier for IBa through the α1C,77/α2δ/β2(r) channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes (22Soldatov N.M. Zühlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Respectively, a replacement of Ba2+ for Ca2+ as the charge carrier (Fig. 2D, a) produced a typical strong acceleration of the current decay characteristic for Ca2+-induced inactivation of the Cav1.2 channel. Contrasting with the rabbit β2(r) subunit, the new short β2f renders notably faster inactivation of IBa. Fig. 2D (b–d) shows maximum IBa elicited by test pulses of different durations to +20 mV. A two-exponential fitting of the 30-s IBa through the (EYFP)N-α1C,77/α2δ/β2f channel (n = 5) showed the inactivation time constants (τ) a"
https://openalex.org/W2085335002,"Using a cDNA microarray screening approach, we have identified seven novel thrombin-responsive genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells that were verifiable by Northern blot analysis. Among them CL-100, a dual-specificity phosphatase also known as MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), showed greatest induction by thrombin. Steady-state levels of CL-100 mRNA induction by thrombin peaked at 1 h and declined rapidly (t½ ∼45 min). Induction by thrombin was protease-activated receptor-1-mediated, protein synthesis-independent, and transcriptionally regulated. Metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation verified that the thrombin-induced CL-100 mRNA was translated into protein. We found that both Src-kinase and p42/p44 ERK activity are critical for thrombin-induced CL-100 expression, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C activity were not required. Antisense-mediated inhibition of CL-100 was shown to prolong thrombin-induced ERK activity in endothelial cells, concomitant with an inhibition in thrombin-induced PDGF-A (platelet-derived growth factor A) and PDGF-B gene expression and an up-regulation in thrombin-induced VCAM-1 and E-selectin gene expression. Inhibition of ERK activation by PD98059 in endothelial cells was shown to potentiate thrombin-induced expression of PDGF-B (∼3-fold) while inhibiting thrombin-induced VCAM-1 and E-selectin gene expression by 60 and 70%, respectively. These results suggested that induced expression of the CL-100 phosphatase and its subsequent regulation of ERK activity play a key regulatory role in the thrombin signaling pathway and in the transcriptional regulation of pathologically important “endothelial cell activation genes.” Using a cDNA microarray screening approach, we have identified seven novel thrombin-responsive genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells that were verifiable by Northern blot analysis.

These results suggested that induced expression of the CL-100 phosphatase and its subsequent regulation of ERK activity play a key regulatory role in the thrombin signaling pathway and in the transcriptional regulation of pathologically important “endothelial cell activation genes.” Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease, plays a critical role in hemostasis, coagulation, and thrombosis. In addition, thrombin can function as an agonist for cellular responses in a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PAR, protease-activated receptor; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule; TRAP, thrombin receptor agonist peptide; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; PKC, protein kinase C; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PAR, protease-activated receptor; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule; TRAP, thrombin receptor agonist peptide; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MKP, MAP kinase phosphatase; PKC, protein kinase C; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. (1Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). Thrombin mediates most of its cellular responses through activation of seven transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors known as PARs (protease-activated receptors). Three thrombin receptors, PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4, have been identified so far in mammalian cells (1Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar, 2Minami T.

Recent studies suggest that PAR-1 is the predominant thrombin receptor expressed in human umbilical vein EC (3O'Brien P.J. Prevost N. Molino M. Hollinger M.K. Woolkalis M.J. Woulfe D.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13502-13509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thrombin activates PAR-1 by proteolytic cleavage at a unique site within the amino terminus of the receptor. Receptor cleavage exposes a new amino terminus that serves as a tethered ligand by binding to sites within the body of the receptor, which results in receptor activation (4Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar, 5Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino terminus of the tethered ligand can function as a thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP) and mimic thrombin activation of receptors (4Vu T.K. Hung D.T.

J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In EC, thrombin receptor activation triggers the induction of a variety of molecules, including PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and cell adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 that are known to play a central role in vascular development and vascular injury (7Shankar R. de la Motte C.A.

Farnarier C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, the signaling pathways mediating the thrombin induction of such EC activation genes are complex and not well delineated. In an attempt to identify novel thrombin-inducible second messengers and their putative target genes, we screened ∼5000 genes using a cDNA microarray technique (Research Genetics, AL). We identified seven novel thrombin-inducible genes that were subsequently confirmed independently by Northern blot analyses to be reproducibly induced by thrombin. We focus in this report on one such gene, CL-100, a dual specificity phosphatase that was the most robustly induced in response to thrombin and that had the greatest potential for mediating expression of downstream thrombin-inducible genes. CL-100 is a human homologue of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). CL-100 belongs to a family of inducible nuclear dual specificity phosphatases that catalyze the dephosphorylation of both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues efficiently (9Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). CL-100 is an immediate early gene induced in various cell types by oxidative stress, heat shock, UV light, and growth factors (10Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 11Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). It is known to dephosphorylate specific threonine and tyrosine residues in kinases of the MAPK pathway, such as ERK, stress-activated protein kinase, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, resulting in their inactivation (12Keyse S.M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the MKP-1 family of phosphatases appears to exhibit cell type specificity in choosing their substrates (9Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 13Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

Recently, involvement of CL-100 in mediating oxidized phospholipid-induced monocyte chemotactic activity in EC has been reported (15Reddy S. Hama S. Grijalva V. Hassan K. Mottahedeh R. Hough G. Wadleigh D.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17030-17035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was postulated that CL-100 was required for oxidized phospholipid-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production, although the mechanism of this regulation was not elucidated. In another study, Potente et al. (14Potente M. Michaelis U.R. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Fleming I. J. Biol.

Thrombin couples to multiple G proteins (Go, Gi, Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq) and activates various MAP kinases, including ERK, through several pathways (1Coughlin S.R.

These signaling pathways ultimately lead to the activation of transcription factors that mediate the induction of a variety of genes important for EC function. However, the specific role of MAPK components in mediating transactivation of these specific EC genes is poorly understood. In this study, we have demonstrated that thrombin activation of EC results in the induction of the CL-100 phosphatase gene. We have further shown that CL-100, through its regulation of the ERK signaling pathway, regulates both positively and negatively thrombin-induced transactivation of specific EC activation genes. Cell Culture—EC were isolated by trypsin digestion of human umbilical veins as described before (20Scarpati E.M. DiCorleto P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3025-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Isolated EC were maintained in MCDB/12 medium (Sigma) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.009% heparin, 0.015% endothelial cell growth supplement and were used between passages three and five. RNA and First Strand cDNA Preparation—Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 106 EC (either untreated or α-thrombin-treated (5 units/ml, 2 h) using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The quantity of total RNA was determined by A260 absorbance, and RNA quality was verified by analysis on a 1% agarose gel using standard techniques. Thrombin activity was verified by determining the increase in level of known thrombin-responsive genes, namely PDGF-B chain mRNA, in the RNA extracted from thrombintreated EC. Uniformly labeled cDNA probes were prepared from 1 μg of total RNA by priming with 2 μg of oligo(dT), followed by elongation with 300 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 100 μCi of [33P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotide and other small molecules using Sephadex G-25 columns (Roche Diagnostics). Gene Array Analysis—Human GeneFilter GF201 (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in Microhyb solution (Research Genetics) with the addition of 1 μg/ml each of poly(A) (Research Genetics) and human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen). The blots were hybridized overnight in the same MicroHyb solution with the addition of 2 × 106 cpm/ml heat-denatured probe. The blots were washed twice at 50 °C with 2× SSC, 1% SDS for 20 min and once at room temperature in 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS with gentle agitation for 15 min. Hybridized filters were exposed to a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) for 3–4 days, imaged using a Storm phosphorimaging system (Amersham Biosciences) at 50-μ resolution, and analyzed using Pathways-II from Research Genetics following the manufacturer's guidelines. Using this program, individual cDNA spots were identified and fit to a grid, and their intensity measurements were recorded as raw intensities. The background for a particular experiment, provided as a reference, was calculated by averaging the measured intensities between two grids of the filter. This background information was used to assign levels of expression of the genes. Data from poor hybridizations, such as those that had high background or non-uniform control spot intensities across the membrane, were not considered for further analysis and were discarded. To compare expression of a cDNA spot between two probes that were sequentially hybridized to the same filter, the intensities were normalized using the algorithm provided by Pathways II software, using either control spots or all data points as reference. Northern Analysis—EC were grown to confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes coated with fibronectin using MCDB/F12 medium (Sigma) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.009 and 0.015% endothelial cell growth supplement. Total RNA from thrombin-treated or untreated EC was isolated using Trizol reagent as described above. Total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel, transferred to Nytran SuPerCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized with random-primed (using a random priming kit from Amersham Biosciences) 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Hybridized filters were washed multiple times and exposed to a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences)) for 24–48 h and imaged using the Storm phosphorimaging system (Amersham Biosciences) at 100-μ resolution. Antisense Assay—EC were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes in MCDB/12 medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.009% heparin, and 0.015% ECGS. Cells were treated with phosphorothiate oligonucleotides at a final concentration of 1 μm. Oligonucleotides were directly added to the cells and incubated for 18 h. The cultures were washed with serum-free medium and replenished with serum-free medium containing 1 μm of the appropriate oligonucleotides. Following a 2-h incubation, cells were stimulated with thrombin receptor activation peptide-1 (TRAP-1; SFLLRNP) at 100-μm concentration for 1–3 h and were subsequently harvested for RNA isolation. The oligonucleotide sequences used were the same as previously described (15Reddy S. Hama S. Grijalva V. Hassan K. Mottahedeh R. Hough G. Wadleigh D.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. J. Biol.

Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—EC grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes were serum starved for 2 h and then metabolically labeled in the presence or absence of thrombin (5 units/ml) for 1–2 h at 37 °C using Tran35S label (100 μCi/ml; ICN) in 1 ml of methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At the end of the incubation, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm sodium-orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Cell lysates were incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-MKP-1 (M-18: sc-1102 AC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was washed three time with lysis buffer, solubilized in 1× Laemmli buffer, resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, and detected using a Storm phosphorimaging system as described above. Nuclear Run-on Assay—Nuclei were isolated by cell lysis in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 from thrombin-treated or untreated EC (2 × 107 cells), washed, and stored at –70 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 40% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3. Thawed nuclear suspensions (200 μl) were incubated with 0.5 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, 30 min, 30 °C). 32P-labeled RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1; v/v/v; pH 5.2) extraction and precipitation and resuspended at equal cpm/ml in hybridization buffer (10 mm TES, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 600 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Denatured probes for CL-100 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5 μg) slot-blotted on nitrocellulose filters were hybridized with labeled nuclear transcripts (65 °C, 36 h). The filters were dried, autoradiographed, and the signals quantified by phosphorimaging. Real-time PCR Assay—First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (2 μg) isolated from agonist-treated or untreated EC using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Volume of the reaction mixture was made up to 50 μl. 2 μl of this reaction mixture was used to perform PCR reaction with specific primer pairs corresponding to a particular gene of interest. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR core reagents (PE Applied Biosystems) and a PerkinElmer ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot—Cell extract from 1 × 105 EC was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS/PAGE gel. The gel was soaked in protein transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris base, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol) for 20 min at room temperature and then transferred to nitrocellulose using a Trans-Blot semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The blot was blocked by TBST (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100) with 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were incubated with monoclonal anti-pERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBST with 5% milk overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBST, and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) at room temperature. Signal was detected using an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences). P42/p44 MAP Kinase Enzyme Assay—Thrombin-treated or untreated EC were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 μm orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. MAP kinase activity was measured using the Biotrak p42/p44 MAP kinase enzyme assay system (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of Seven Novel Thrombin-responsive Genes by Microarray Analysis—In an attempt to identify novel thrombin-inducible genes in human EC, we employed a cDNA microarray approach (GF201; Research Genetics) allowing for the rapid analysis of nearly 5000 genes. Two independent screens reproducibly showed up-regulation of many known genes as well as seven additional genes that were not previously known to be induced by thrombin. The induction of these seven genes was subsequently verified and validated by Northern blot analysis (Table I). The results of both the microarray and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that although the increase in the mRNA levels of the seven genes was modest, with none of the genes showing an induction of more than 2-fold, the induction was consistent (Table I). We did not observe any genes that were consistently down-regulated in response to thrombin in either of the two microarray screens.Table INovel thrombin-inducible genes in EC identified by microarray analysisGene ArrayFold InductionGenBank™ accession numberGene name(Experiment 1/experiment 2)Northern blot analysisAA703141Protein 4.11.71/1.591.30H87536Bullous pemphigoid auto antigen1.80/1.501.20N670483-iodothyronine- deiodinase1.72/1.521.15T62575TIF-1-like protein1.57/2.011.25AA682851ERP-311.80/2.071.25X68277CL-1001.67/1.361.90AA703141Troponin T21.76/1.48ND Open table in a new tab We next examined the kinetics of thrombin induction of these genes by Northern blot analysis. Except for the CL-100 gene, thrombin did not induce the mRNA levels of the other genes greater than 2-fold at any of the time points analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1, a and b, however, thrombin treatment of EC resulted in a robust induction of CL-100 mRNA levels with maximal effects (4-fold) observed at 1 h. Thrombin Induction of CL-100 Is Mediated through PAR-1—EC are known to express two thrombin receptors, PAR-1 and PAR-3. PAR-3 is reported to be incapable of transmembrane signaling; however, it functions as a co-factor for PAR-4 activation by thrombin (21Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.W. Sulciner D.J. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). PAR-4 expression is undetectable in human umbilical vein EC (3O'Brien P.J. Prevost N. Molino M. Hollinger M.K. Woolkalis M.J. Woulfe D.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13502-13509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We used receptor-specific agonistic peptides to identify the receptor(s) responsible for CL-100 induction by thrombin. We identified that PAR-1-specific agonistic peptide (TRAP-1; SFLLRNP) induced CL-100 in human umbilical vein EC (Fig. 2a). CL-100 mRNA levels were induced ∼4-fold in response to 5 units/ml of thrombin or 100 μm of SFLLRNP. CL-100 mRNA levels induced in response to 100 and 200 μm of SFLLRNP were similar to those elicited in response to 1 and 5 units/ml of thrombin (Fig. 2b). PAR-4-specific peptide AYPGKF or peptides SLIGKV or SLIGRL specific to PAR-2, a non-thrombin receptor expressed in EC, failed to induce CL-100 induction (data not shown). CL-100 Induction Is Independent of de Novo Protein Synthesis and Regulated at Transcriptional Level—To test whether the induction of CL-100 by thrombin is dependent on de novo protein synthesis, we treated EC with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) 30 min prior to thrombin stimulation and determined CL-100 mRNA level by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3a, cycloheximide treatment had little effect on thrombin-induced CL-100 gene induction, suggesting that newly synthesized proteins were not required to mediate the thrombin effect. To determine whether thrombin-induced CL-100 mRNA levels were the result of an increase in the transcriptional rate and/or a reduction in mRNA decay, EC were pretreated with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) prior to thrombin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3b, actinomycin D substantially inhibited thrombin-induced CL-100 gene expression, resulting in near basal levels of expression. We also examined, by performing an actinomycin decay curve, the relative stability of CL-100 mRNA isolated from untreated and thrombin-treated EC and did not observe any significant differences. The half-life of the CL-100 in both cases was ∼45 min (data not shown). We further confirmed that thrombin mediated the de novo transcription of the CL-100 gene by performing nuclear run-on transcription assays. As shown in Fig. 4, run-on assays from thrombin-treated EC nuclei revealed a consistent and greater than 2.5-fold increase in the transcription rate of the CL-100 gene in response to thrombin. Induced CL-100 mRNA Is Translated into Protein in EC—To verify that the induced CL-100 mRNA is translated into protein, we determined relative CL-100 protein levels in response to thrombin induction. To accomplish this, we metabolically labeled EC with [35S]methionine and cysteine (Tran35S label (100 μCi/ml)) and stimulated cells with TRAP-1 for the times indicated. Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-MKP-1 antibody (M18). We have verified that M18 antibody efficiently immunoprecipitates the recombinant CL-100 protein (human homologue of MKP-1) expressed in EC. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, TRAP-1 stimulation of EC induces CL-100 protein expression with maximal effect observed at 1 h. Thus, the increased CL-100 mRNA induced by thrombin treatment of EC is translated into protein. We also tried to detect total CL-100 protein level in the presence and absence of thrombin by Western blot analysis. However, multiple commercially available CL-100/MKP-1 antibodies failed to detect endogenous CL-100 in human umbilical vein EC lysates. Because CL-100 is an “immediate early gene” having a short protein half-life (∼45 min) and TRAP-1 treatment of EC resulted in newly synthesized CL-100 protein (Fig. 5), we assumed there is a transient increase in CL-100 protein levels upon TRAP-1 or thrombin treatment. Transcriptional Regulation of CL-100 by Thrombin Is MAPK-dependent and Pertussis Toxin-insensitive—Because MAPK is a downstream component in the regulation of many PAR-1-inducible genes (22Minami T.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we next determined whether MAPK mediates thrombin-induced CL-100 gene expression. Pretreatment of EC with the selective p42/p44 ERK inhibitor PD-98059 inhibited by greater than 90% TRAP-1-induced CL-100 gene expression (Fig. 6), whereas p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 was without effect (data not shown). It is known that upstream of the MAPK pathway the PAR-1 receptor of thrombin is coupled to both pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins (5Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Strukova S.M. Biochemistry (Mosc. 2001; 66: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether thrombin-induced CL-100 is mediated through a Gi pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, we pretreated EC with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin prior to stimulation with TRAP-1 (100 μm). The results presented in Fig. 6 demonstrate that pertussis toxin does not inhibit CL-100 gene expression in response to TRAP-1, thus suggesting that a Gi family member does not couple the PAR-1 receptor to downstream CL-100 gene induction. Thrombin-induced CL-100 Gene Expression Is Src Kinase-dependent and PKC- and PI3-kinase-independent—It is generally accepted that thrombin receptor PAR-1 activation of the MAPK pathway in EC is mediated through two major signaling pathways. One is mediated through βγ-subunits of G proteins that activate non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src, which interacts with and phosphorylates the Grb2-SOS complex and through regulation of p21ras mediates MAPK activation. In the other pathway, PAR-1 activation results in the activation of phospholipase C by G proteins, leading to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, diacylglycerol formation, and PKC activation. PKC phosphorylates Raf kinase, bypassing p21ras, which stimulates MAPK activation (5Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because we have demonstrated that p42/p44 ERK activity is required for thrombin-induced CL-100 gene expression (Fig. 6), we next tested the potential role of the upstream activators of ERK activity in our response. As shown in Fig. 7, pretreatment of EC for 30 min with the specific Src kinase inhibitor PP1 (10 μm) completely inhibited TRAP-1-mediated induction of CL-100 gene expression. A similar pretreatment with PKC inhibitor GF109203 (10 μm) or PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) had no significant effect on TRAP-1-induced CL-100 mRNA levels. Thus, thrombin-induced CL-100 gene expression requires Src kinase activity and is independent of PKC and PI3-kinase acti"

The combination of site-directed mutagenesis of OxdA (mutation of all conserved histidines in the aldoxime dehydratase superfamily), estimation of the heme contents and specific activities of the mutants, and CD and resonance Raman spectroscopic analyses led to the identification of the proximal and distal histidines in this unique enzyme. The heme contents and CD spectra in the far-UV region of all mutants except for the H299A one were almost identical to those of the wild-type OxdA, whereas the H299A mutant lost the ability of binding heme, demonstrating that His299 is the proximal histidine. On the other hand, substitution of alanine for His320 did not affect the overall structure of OxdA but caused loss of its ability of carbon-nitrogen triple bond synthesis and a lower shift of the Fe-C stretching band in the resonance Raman spectrum for the CO-bound form. Furthermore, the pH dependence of the wild-type OxdA closely followed the His protonation curves observed for other proteins. These findings suggest that His320 is located in the distal heme pocket of OxdA and would donate a proton to the substrate in the aldoxime dehydration mechanism.

The nitrile formed through this reaction is subsequently hydrated into an amide by the coupled nitrile hydratase during nitrile metabolism of P. chlororaphis B23.

However, information on the structure and function of aldoxime dehydratase has been quite limited. As we previously reported (33Oinuma K-I. Ohta T. Konishi K. Hashimoto Y. Higashibata H. Kitagawa T. Kobayashi M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), resonance Raman spectroscopic studies on OxdA initially demonstrated that the OxdA heme contains a proximal histidine ligand. In other hemoproteins, histidine residues are known to have an important function in the binding of the heme moiety (34Nagai K. Kitagawa T. Morimoto H. J. Mol.

Here, we have attempted to identify the proximal histidine residue in OxdA by means of site-directed mutagenesis and spectroscopic analyses. Furthermore, another histidine was identified as the distal amino acid residue involved in carbon-nitrogen triple bond synthesis by aldoxime dehydratase. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis (His169, His296, His299, His320, and His338 being converted to Ala, respectively) was carried out on oxdA by means of an overlap extension PCR protocol (38Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 39Pogulis R.J. Yallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Methods Mol.

To construct the H169A mutant, two PCRs, with plasmid pET-oxdA as the template, were performed with primer pairs H169A-S plus T7T and T7P plus H169A-AS (Table I). These reactions produced 3′ and 5′ fragments of oxdA, respectively, whose sequences overlapped by 20 base pairs at the mutation. A second round of PCR was performed by mixing equimolar amounts of the first round products, followed by amplification between primers T7P and T7T to produce the full-length oxdA. The second-round product was digested with NdeI and SalI, ligated into expression vector pET-24a(+), and then sequenced. A clone with the sequence for the desired H169A mutation was chosen and transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL. The recombinant cells were used for the overproduction and purification of the H169A mutant enzyme.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for the preparation of OxdA mutantsNameSequencePositionT7P5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′T7T5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′H169A-S5′-ATCGAGGAGGCCGGTTACTGGGGATCGATG-3′496-525H169A-AS5′-CAGTAACCGGCCTCCTCGATTTCGCCACTG-3′486-515H296A-S5′-GAATCGGCCCCTACCCACCTGCGTATTTTC-3′880-909H296A-AS5′-CAGGTGGGTAGGGGCCGATTCCGCCCAGCG-3′871-900H299A-S5′-CACCCTACCGCCCTGCGTATTTTCGTGACG-3′886-915H299A-AS5′-AATACGCAGGGCGGTAGGGTGCGATTCCGC-3′877-906H320A-S5′-CGGCTGTACGCCGAGGTATCGGTCTCGGAC-3′949-978H320A-AS5′-GATACCTCGGCGTACAGCCGCAACTTTTTC-3′939-968H338A-S5′-ATCAACTGTGCTCCGCACACCGGCATGTTG-3′1003-1032H338A-AS5′-CCGGTGTGCGGAGCACAGTTGATGTACTCG-3′996-1025 Open table in a new tab Each of the H296A, H299A, H320A, and H338A mutations was carried out in the same manner as the H169A mutation, with internal primer pairs H296A-S plus H296A-AS, H299A-S plus H299A-AS, H320A-S plus H320A-AS, and H338A-S plus H338A-AS, respectively (Table I). Expression and Purification of Recombinant OxdA and Its Mutants— Recombinant OxdA and its mutants were overexpressed according to the same procedure described previously (33Oinuma K-I. Ohta T. Konishi K. Hashimoto Y. Higashibata H. Kitagawa T. Kobayashi M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All of the mutants except for H299A were isolated as holoproteins, the H299A mutant being isolated as an apoprotein (see “Results”). The wild-type OxdA and its mutants were purified in the same manner as described previously (33Oinuma K-I. Ohta T. Konishi K. Hashimoto Y. Higashibata H. Kitagawa T. Kobayashi M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with some modifications. All steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used throughout the purification. Centrifugation was carried out for 30 min at 15,000 × g. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 100 mm buffer, and then disrupted by sonication (Insonator model 201M; Kubota, Tokyo, Japan) to prepare a cell-free extract. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate (30–60% saturation), followed by dialysis against 10 mm buffer. The dialyzed solution was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (4 × 20 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm buffer. Protein was eluted from the column with 1.0 liter of 10 mm buffer, the concentration of KCl being increased linearly from 0.1 to 0.5 m. The active fractions were collected, and then ammonium sulfate was added to give 20% saturation. The enzyme solution was placed on a TSK gel Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (4 × 15 cm) (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 10 mm buffer 20% saturated with ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was eluted by lowering the concentration of ammonium sulfate (from 20 to 0%) in 1.0 liter of the same buffer. The active fractions were combined and then precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 70% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 0.1 m buffer, and then dialyzed against three changes of 5 liters of 1 mm buffer (pH 6.8). After centrifugation, the enzyme solution was loaded on a Cellulofine HAp column (4 × 5 cm) (Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 1 mm buffer (pH 6.8). The column was eluted with a linear gradient, 1–100 mm, of the buffer (pH 6.8). The resultant solution was dialyzed against 10 mm buffer and then centrifuged. The active fractions were collected and concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon YM-30 membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and a Vivaspin 30,000 molecular weight cut-off PES membrane (Sartorius K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The enzyme solution was loaded on a Superdex 200 column (1 × 30 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm buffer including 0.15 m KCl. The active fractions were collected. The homogeneity of the purified recombinant OxdA and its mutants was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 12% polyacrylamide slab gel according to Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular mass of the subunit of each mutant was determined from the relative mobilities of marker proteins, phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydratase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). The heme content was estimated by the pyridine ferrohemochrome method as previously reported (29Oinuma K-I. Hashimoto Y. Konishi K. Goda M. Noguchi T. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29600-29608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a Nakalai Tesque Co., Inc. (Kyoto, Japan) protein assay kit, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The reduction of the wild-type OxdA and its mutants was carried out by adding a few grains of sodium dithionite to the purified OxdAs. Spectral Measurements—CD spectra of the isolated wild-type OxdA and its mutants were obtained using a spectrometer (J-720; Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature. Proteins at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were each placed in a cuvette (1-mm cell length). The ellipticity in the CD spectra was normalized as to the protein concentration. The α-helical content can be evaluated from the ellipticity at 222 nm by the following equation (41Chen Y.H.

The excitation light was focused into the cell, the laser power being 3 milliwatts at the cell for the reduced form of OxdAs, but 0.005 milliwatts for CO-bound OxdAs. The sample solutions for the Raman measurements were sealed in quartz cells, which were rotated at 1,500 rpm at room temperature. Typically, 50-μl aliquots of 0.4 mg/ml protein in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were put into the cell. The scattered light at right angle was dispersed with a single polychromator (DG-1000; Ritsu) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device camera. The spectral slit width was 6 cm–1. Raman shifts were calibrated using indene and CCl4 as frequency standards, providing an accuracy of ±1 cm–1 for intense isolated lines. Enzyme Assay—The standard reaction mixture (under anaerobic conditions) comprised 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm butyraldoxime, 5 mm Na2S2O4, and an appropriate amount of enzyme, in a total volume of 400 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of butyraldoxime and carried out for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 10 mm NH2OH·HCl. The reaction product was determined with a gas chromatograph (GC-14BPF; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a glass column (3.2 mm × 2.1 m) packed with Gaskuropack 56 (80/100% mesh; GL-Science, Tokyo, Japan). One unit of aldoxime dehydratase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of butyronitrile/min from butyraldoxime under the standard assay conditions. Specific activity is expressed as units/mg of protein. Amino Acid Sequence Alignment of the Aldoxime Dehydratase Superfamily—In our previous study (29Oinuma K-I. Hashimoto Y. Konishi K. Goda M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29600-29608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we determined the nucleotide sequence of aldoxime dehydratase from P. chlororaphis B23, which consists of 1,056 nucleotides encoding 352 amino acid residues. A search with the BLAST program revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of aldoxime dehydratase from P. chlororaphis B23 exhibits similarity with those from Bacillus sp. OxB-1 (32% identity) (32Kato Y. Nakamura K. Sakiyama H. Mayhew S.G. Asano Y.

These enzymes are considered to comprise a superfamily (aldoxime dehydratase superfamily), and each of the genes forms a gene cluster for aldoxime metabolism with the corresponding nitrile hydratase and amidase genes or the nitrilase gene (29Oinuma K-I.

Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the above four enzymes in the aldoxime dehydratase superfamily (Fig. 1) revealed the existence of five conserved histidines in this superfamily: His169, His296, His299, His320, and His338, where the amino acid residue numbers refer to the sequence of aldoxime dehydratase from P. chlororaphis B23. We prepared point mutants by substituting alanine for each of the five histidines conserved in OxdA, as shown below.

Hashimoto Y. Higashibata H. Kitagawa T. Kobayashi M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we focused on the conserved histidines in the aldoxime dehydratase superfamily, all of the conserved histidines being individually mutated to alanine. The H169A, H296A, H299A, H320A, and H338A mutant enzymes of OxdA were expressed in E. coli and purified by the purification procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of each OxdA mutant was confirmed by migration of the protein as a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼38 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Basic Physicochemical Properties of the Five His → Ala Mutants—In order to determine the effect of mutation of all conserved histidines on heme binding, at first, we estimated the heme contents of the histidine to alanine mutants of OxdA. Table II presents the heme contents of the wild-type OxdA and all of the His mutants of OxdA. All of the histidine to alanine mutants except H299A contained a stoichiometric equivalent of heme like the wild-type OxdA, suggesting that the H299A mutant was unable to bind heme because it had lost His299 from the peptide chain of OxdA.Table IIHeme contents, mean residue molar ellipticities at 222 nm, α-helical contents, and specific activities of the wild-type OxdA and its mutantsEnzymeHeme content-[θ]222 × 10-3α-HelixSpecific activitymol heme / mol subunitdegrees·cm2·dmol-1%units / mgWild type1.068.8821.6468H169A1.069.3323.1576H296A0.989.8824.9647H299A07.8018.0NDaND, activity could not be detected.H320A1.018.7221.1NDH338A1.099.4223.4501a ND, activity could not be detected. Open table in a new tab A CD spectrum in the far-UV region provides us with information on the secondary structure in a protein (51Strickland E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 151: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 depicts CD spectra for the isolated forms of the wild-type OxdA and its mutants. The spectral shape and α-helical contents of the mutants except H299A were similar to those of the wild-type OxdA (Fig. 3 and Table II). These results indicate that all of the mutants except H299A are properly folded like the wild-type OxdA. Since we previously clarified that the ferrous form of OxdA is the active state (29Oinuma K-I. Hashimoto Y. Konishi K. Goda M. Noguchi T. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29600-29608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the enzyme activities of the five histidine mutants of OxdA were measured in an anaerobic reduced environment. As shown in Table II, the alanine substitution of neither His169, His296, nor His338 reduced the enzyme activity. On the other hand, the purified enzymes and cell-free extracts of the H299A and H320A mutants had exhibited no enzyme activity at all. Although the replacement of His320 with alanine did not affect the heme binding or the secondary structure of OxdA, the H320A mutant exhibited no activity. Effects of pH on the Enzyme Activity of the Wild-type OxdA—Fig. 4 illustrates the pH-dependent profile of the enzyme activity of the wild-type OxdA. OxdA allows the study of the ability of carbon-nitrogen triple bond synthesis over a wide pH range (pH 5–9.5). The pH dependence of the enzyme activity of the wild-type OxdA shown in Fig. 4 was slightly different from that we previously reported (29Oinuma K-I. Hashimoto Y. Konishi K. Goda M. Noguchi T. Higashibata H. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29600-29608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) because of the different purification procedure for OxdA (using the buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol), which enabled us to isolate the enzyme containing a significant level of heme (i.e. ∼1 mol/mol of subunit). The enzyme activity of the wild-type OxdA broadly displayed the sigmoidal pH dependence, with a maximum change at about pH 6. This pH dependence of the wild-type OxdA closely followed the His protonation curves observed for other proteins like α-hemolysin, horseradish peroxidase, and so on (52Cortajarena A.L. Goni F.M.

Resonance Raman Spectroscopy of the H320A Mutant and Wild-type OxdA—In order to determine the reason for the loss of enzyme activity upon the mutation of His320 to alanine, we obtained resonance Raman spectra for the ferrous and CO-bound forms of the H320A mutant and the wild-type OxdA (Figs. 5,6,7). It has been established that resonance Raman spectra in the high frequency region contain a few marker bands sensitive to the oxidation state (ν4) and the spin and coordination states (ν2 and ν3) of the heme iron in so far known hemoproteins (54Spiro T.G.

However, the molecular mechanism of membrane fusion is still poorly understood despite extensive studies done in both biological and model systems. Nevertheless, the results of many studies suggest common motifs for the diverse biological and model fusion reactions (13Blumenthal R. Clague M.J. Durell S.R. Epand R.M. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26Chernomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Virus-induced membrane fusion is highly sensitive to single amino acid mutations in the FP domain (27Pereira F.B. Goni F.M. Muga A. Nieva J.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1977-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Pritsker M. Rucker J. Hoffman T.L. Doms R.W. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11359-11371Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This can lead to the conclusion that the structure of FPs is a crucial parameter in the fusion process. Indeed, several studies suggest that the structure of FPs plays a major role in their activities (12Delahunty M.D. Rhee I. Freed E.O. Bonifacino J.S. Virology. 1996; 218: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Sackett K. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4678-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To distinguish between the effects of structure and hydrophobicity, we compared an all-l-amino acid FP with its enantiomer composed entirely of d-amino acids (25Pritsker M. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both had the same activity in liposome fusion assays, although having mirror image structures (25Pritsker M. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the FP of HIV-1 was shown to inhibit cell-cell fusion (30Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 31Kelsey D.R. Flanagan T.D. Young J. Yeagle P.L. J. Biol.

Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cumulative evidence suggests that the mechanism of inhibition is through interaction with the corresponding region in the intact gp41 (23Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25Pritsker M. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This inhibitory activity of the peptide is chirality-independent, eliminating the possibility of interaction at the receptor level since chirality is crucial for recognition of soluble proteins (25Pritsker M. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The chirality independence of membrane-inserted peptide-peptide interaction in vivo has been recently verified by using a glycophorin A transmembrane domain (33Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The non-chiral nature of the FP-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 cell fusion reinforces the need to understand the role of the precise structure of the FP in the fusion process. To alter the structure of the FP while preserving the hydrophobicity (i.e. same amino acid composition), we introduced d-amino acids into the FP of HIV-1. For this purpose, we synthesized two 33-residue peptides, WT, which corresponds to the all-L sequence of the HIV-1 FP, and a diastereomer analogue. In the latter, termed IFFA, 4 highly conserved amino acids, Ile4, Phe8, Phe11, and Ala14, were replaced by their d-enantiomers. The ability of IFFA to inhibit HIV-mediated cell-cell fusion was investigated. The results were correlated with structural studies performed by using ATR-FTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy. The observed functional and structural properties of the peptides shed light on the molecular recognition process within the membrane milieu. Moreover, the ability of the diastereomer to maintain the inhibition properties of the WT FP makes it a promising candidate for designing new anti-HIV inhibitors. Materials—BOC-amino acid phenylacetamidomethyl-resin was purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and BOC-amino acids were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). NBD-fluoride and other reagents for peptide synthesis were obtained from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine from bovine spinal cord (sodium salt, grade I) were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). Cholesterol (CH) was purchased from Merck. N-(Lissamine-rhodamine B-sulfonyl)-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Rho-PE) and N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl)-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). TF228 cells, which constitutively express HIV-1IIIB-gp120-gp41 (34Jonak Z.L. Clark R.K. Matour D. Trulli S. Craig R. Henri E. Lee E.V. Greig R. Debouck C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were from Zdenka L. Jonak (GlaxoSmithKline, King of Prussia, PA), and SupT1 cells were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health from Dr. James Hoxie. Both cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (with 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin G at 100 units/ml, and streptomycin sulfate at 100 mcg/ml). The vaccinia recombinants vCB4R and vTF7–3 were generous gifts from Dr. Ed Berger (NIAID, National Institutes of Health). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescent Labeling—The peptides were synthesized by a solid phase method on phenylacetamidomethyl-amino acid resin (0.15 moles/gram), as described previously (23Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Labeling of the N terminus of the peptides was achieved as described previously (35Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Rapaport D. Hague G.R. Pouny Y. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3291-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptides were purified (>95% homogeneity) by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 column using a linear gradient of 25–80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetyl for 40 min. The peptides were subjected to amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry to confirm their composition. Unless stated otherwise, stock solutions of concentrated peptides in Me2SO were used to avoid aggregation of the peptides prior to their use. The final concentration of Me2SO in each experiment had no effect on the system under investigation. HIV-mediated Cell-Cell Fusion Assay—A β-galactosidase assay (37Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to measure the inhibitory effect of the peptides. TF228 and SupT1 cells were infected overnight at 10 multiplicity of infection with different recombinant vaccinia viruses. TF228 cells were transfected with vCB4R containing the T7 promoter and lacZ gene, which expresses β-galactosidase enzyme from Escherichia coli. SupT1 cells were transfected with vTF7–3, having T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the natural P7.5 early-late vaccinia virus promoter. Fusion was analyzed by detecting β-galactosidase activity. Since the cytoplasm of SupT1 cells contains T7 RNA polymerase and the cytoplasm of TF228 cells contains the β-galactosidase enzyme under the control of the T7 promoter, the enzyme was produced only in cytoplasmically fused cells. Cells were mixed and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of peptides. Then cells were lysed with detergent, and β-galactosidase activity was detected colorimetrically, using the substrate chlorophenol red-β-galactopyranoside. The rate of hydrolysis was measured by reading absorbance at 595 nm. The assay was repeated in the presence of different concentrations of the FP, its IFFA diastereomer, and several other control peptides. Inhibition of the fusion process resulted in a reduction of β-galactosidase activity. There was about 1% fusion (β-galactosidase expression) in the controls: target cells without HIV receptors or cells expressing uncleaved gp160 (37Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Influenza HA-mediated Cell-Cell Fusion Assay—Dye transfer between HA-expressing fibroblasts (GP4F) and R18-labeled erythrocytes was monitored spectrofluorometrically using the R18 dequenching method as described previously (38Morris S.J. Sarkar D.P. White J.M. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3972-3978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion Peptide Localization on T Cells—Activated T cells (39van Eden W. Thole J.E. van der Zee R. Noordzij A. van Embden J.D. Hensen E.J. Cohen I.R. Nature. 1988; 331: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) (104) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with NBD-labeled WT or IFFA FPs (0.5 μm final concentration). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (100 μl) to remove excess unbound peptide. The cells were then observed under a fluorescent confocal microscope. NBD excitation was set at 488 nm with the laser set at 2% power to prevent bleaching of the fluorophore. Fluorescence data were collected from 525 nm and higher. Vesicle Preparation—Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) were prepared as described previously by Moscho et al. (40Moscho A. Orwar O. Chiu D.T. Modi B.P. Zare R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11443-11447Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, a dried film of lipids containing a total of 2 mg of PC:SM:CH:Rho-PE (1:1:1:0.001) was dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform. The lipids were added to a round flask containing 970 μl of chloroform and 150 μl of methanol. Next, we carefully added 7 ml of double-distilled H2O along the flask walls. The mixture was evaporated under nitrogen flow (2 bar) while rotating the flask at 30–50 rpm for 5–10 min. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by sonication from PC:CH (10:1 w/w). The cholesterol was included to reduce the curvature of the small unilamellar vesicles (23Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Fusion Peptide Localization in Model Membranes—GUV labeled with Rho-PE were observed under a confocal microscope with excitation set at 488 and 543 nm; emission was collected from 505 to 525 nm and from 610 nm and higher. Unordered regions were observed with excitation set at 543 nm but not with excitation at 488 nm at 610 nm and up. No signal was detected at 505–525 nm. The NBD-labeled FP and IFFA were added to the GUV, carefully, at a final concentration of 0.5 μm. Binding of the peptides to the GUV was followed until maximal binding was observed after ∼10–15 min for PC:SM:CH and 1 h for PC:CH. To eliminate the possibility of quenching the NBD fluorophore due to FRET with the rhodamine, we bleached the rhodamine using the 543-nm laser at 100% intensity for 30 s. No change in NBD emission at 505–525 nm was observed, whereas the rhodamine emission at 610 nm was abolished. Peptide Binding to SUV—The degree of peptide association with lipid vesicles was measured by adding lipid vesicles to 0.1 μm NBD-labeled peptides at 28 °C, as has been described previously (41Hetru C. Letellier L. Oren Z. Hoffmann J.A. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of the lipid:peptide molar ratio, with excitation set at 467 nm (10-nm slit) and emission set at 530 nm (5-nm slit). Resonance Energy Transfer Measurements—Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was measured using NBD-labeled peptides serving as donors and with Rho-labeled peptides serving as energy acceptors (42Fung B.K. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5241-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 43Gazit E. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12363-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were obtained at room temperature with excitation set at 467 nm using a 10-nm slit width. In a typical experiment, donor peptide (final concentration 0.04 μm) was added to a dispersion of PC:CH. (10:1 w/w) SUV (400 μm) in phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of acceptor peptide in several sequential doses. Fluorescence spectra were obtained before and after the addition of the acceptor. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was determined as described previously by Kliger et al. (23Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR)—Experiments were performed as described previously (44Sackett K. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of lipids mixed with chloroform, WT FP, or IFFA (1:50) was spread on the prism and dried under vacuum for 30 min. The sample was also tested under hydrated conditions by deuteration. A peptide, representing the N-terminal 33-amino-acid segment of gp41 of HIV-1 (LAV1a strain), WT, and its diastereomer analogue IFFA, were synthesized and labeled at their N-terminal amino acid with either NBD or rhodamine fluorescent probes. The sequences of the peptides and their designations are shown in Table I. The secondary structure of the FP at the site of the substitutions is a β-sheet (44Sackett K. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rationale behind the diastereomer is that the d-amino acids will destabilize the structure of the FP (the side chains will switch sides) while maintaining the original sequence. We investigated the peptides for their ability to inhibit HIV-1-mediated cellcell fusion. The results were correlated with structural information.Table IPeptides' sequences and designationsPeptideSequencead-amino acids are marked in bold and underlined lettersWTAVGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQLIFFAAVGIGALFLGFLGAAGSTMGARSMTLTVQARQLa d-amino acids are marked in bold and underlined letters Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Cell-Cell Fusion Induced by WT and IFFA—The peptides were tested for their inhibitory effect on HIV-1-mediated cell fusion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The WT peptide and its diastereomer exhibited marked inhibitory effects at concentrations <10 ng/ml. The data also suggest that IFFA is slightly more active than the WT (Fig. 1A). We used a 13-mer peptide corresponding to the N-terminal region of the FP, as well as the FP of the Sendai virus, as negative controls. We further investigated the inhibitory effect of the peptide when added to the ENV-expressing cells prior to adding target cells. An inhibitory effect was observed, similar to that seen in Fig. 1A, when the peptide was added to the mixture of cells. Thus, we assume that the peptide may associate with the surface of the cells and remain there until the fusion process is initiated. At that point, it inhibits the fusion process. Alternatively, the FP may bind directly to the ENV complex. However, this is less likely since the wild type FP is presumably hidden within the gp120/gp41 complex until receptor binding. The inhibition of HIV ENV-mediated cell fusion by FP was demonstrated to be HIV-specific. We studied the virus specificity of the IFFA diastereomer in inhibiting viral fusion. Although the IFFA is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1, it could not inhibit influenza HA-mediated cell fusion at concentrations up to 3 μm (Fig. 1B). This result confirms that the inhibitory effect of IFFA is specific to HIV, similar to the WT FP. Furthermore, neither the WT FP nor the IFFA could reach complete inhibition of cell-mediated fusion. The inhibition increases fast at the lower nm range, but even up to 1 μm, it cannot pass the 75% inhibition. This observation may be accounted for by the nature of the FP itself. At high concentrations, the FP increases negative curvature and promotes membrane destabilization (23Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that as the concentrations are raised, the FP and IFFA start to promote fusion as well as inhibit it. Binding of WT and IFFA to the Surface of the T Cells—We investigated the binding of the WT FP and IFFA to the surface of T cells. Such binding supports a model in which the inhibition observed can be through direct interaction of the FPs with protein complexes on or within the T cell membranes. NBD-labeled WT and IFFA were incubated for 15 min with activated T cells and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Binding of the peptides to T cells and their localization was investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Both the WT and the IFFA demonstrated high affinity toward T cells (Fig. 2). The peptides were localized at the plasma membrane and formed patches of high intensity. The results suggest that both the WT and the IFFA preferentially bind to certain domains on the surface of T cells (Fig. 3). When sliding across the z axis, the peptides obviously do not penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane, and in fact, no peptide was observed within any other membrane compartment in the cells.Fig. 3Fluorescent intensity mapping of the FP and its analogue on T cells. We mapped the fluorescence intensity of the NBD-labeled fusion peptide on the T cell membrane (panel A) and compared it with the intensity of IFFA (panel B). The random intensity of self-fluorescence is shown for a control cell in panel C. The XY plane represents the longitudinal cross-section of the T cell as shown in Fig. 2, and the Z axis represents the intensity of NBD fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Binding of IFFA to Unordered Regions on GUVs—We prepared sphingomyelin:phosphatidylcholine:cholestrol:phosphatidyl-ethanolamine-rhodamine (SM:PC:CH:Rho-PE) (1:1:1: 0.001) giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) labeled with rhodamine, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and observed them under a confocal microscope (45de Almeida R.F. Fedorov A. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2406-2416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Rho-PE is known to partition into unordered regions. Indeed, the fluorescence of Rho-PE was located in patches, indicating that it segregated out of the more ordered SM/CH regions and into the less ordered PC regions (Fig. 4A). We then added the NBD-labeled IFFA. The peptide partitioned into ordered regions of the GUV, as demonstrated in Fig. 4B by the segregation of the green (NBD-IFFA) and red (Rho-PE) colors, suggesting an intrinsic affinity of the peptides for SM/CH domains. We verified that there was no NBD quenching due to FRET between the fluorophores by bleaching the rhodamine. The fluorescence of the NBD-labeled peptide remained constant, even when the rhodamine signal was completely abolished. Similar results were obtained with the WT FP (data not shown). Thus, we can conclude that the IFFA diastereomer partitions preferentially into ordered regions, similarly to the WT FP. A similar experiment with PC:CH:Rho-PE (10:1:0.001) GUVs, with no microdomains present, demonstrated a uniform binding pattern for the IFFA (Fig. 4C). The absence of ordered regions is demonstrated by the uniform distribution of the Rho-PE over the surface of the GUVs. However, the time to reach maximal intensity was about four times slower than that observed for SM:PC:CH GUVs. Co-assembly of WT Fusion Peptide and Its Diastereomer in the Membrane-bound State—The self-association of the peptides in their membrane-bound state was monitored by measuring resonance energy transfer. A dose-dependent quenching of the emission of the NBD-WT donor, consistent with energy transfer, was observed when Rho-WT or Rho-IFFA acceptor (final concentration of 0.025–0.35 μm) was added to a mixture of NBD-WT (0.05 μm) and SUV (400 μm). The energy transfer was calculated and plotted versus the acceptor:lipid molar ratio (Fig. 5). The acceptor peptide was added only after the donor peptide was already bound to the membrane, thus decreasing association in solution. The free energy of peptide association with SUV was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It was found to be -9.3 kcal/mole for the WT FP and -8.3 kcal/mole for the IFFA. Accordingly, the lipid:peptide molar ratio in these experiments was kept high enough to ensure low surface density of donors and acceptors while reducing the energy transfer between unassociated peptide monomers to a minimum. To confirm that the observed energy transfer is due to peptide oligomerization, the transfer efficiencies observed in the experiments were compared with the energy transfer expected for randomly distributed membrane-bound donors and acceptors (Fig. 5, dashed line). The random distribution was calculated as described earlier (42Fung B.K. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5241-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), using 51 Å as the R0 value for the NBD/Rho donor/acceptor pair (43Gazit E. Shai Y.

This provokes T cells to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. We investigated the roles of B-Raf in TCR-mediated IL-2 production coupled with ERK activation in the Jurkat human T cell line. We found that TCR cross-linking could induce up-regulation of both B-Raf and Raf-1 activities, but Raf-1 activity was decreased rapidly. On the other hand, TCR-stimulated kinase activity of B-Raf was sustained. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of B-Raf abrogated sustained but not transient TCR-mediated MEK/ERK activation. The inhibition of sustained ERK activation by either expression of a dominant-negative B-Raf or treatment with a MEK inhibitor resulted in a decrease of the TCR-stimulated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity and IL-2 production.

Within seconds of MHC-peptide engagement, TCR components initiate phosphorylation cascades that trigger multiple branching signaling pathways. One well studied key switch is the activation signal of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which is mediated by the small GTP-binding proteins, Ras (2Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and Rap1 (4Carey K.D. Dillon T.J. Schmitt J.M. Baird A.M. Holdorf A.D. Straus D.B. Shaw A.S. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell.

Current models suggest that TCR stimulation with the agonistic peptide-MHC complex activates the conversion of Ras from the GDP- to GTP-bound form (2Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6Rincon M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Activated Ras subsequently recruits the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, resulting in its activation. Activated Raf-1 then activates ERK kinase (MEK), which directly phosphorylates tyrosine and threonine residues (TEY motif) on ERK1/2 to activate them (6Rincon M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These signals combine to activate multiple transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), NF-κB, and activating protein-1 (AP-1), all of which contribute toward the production of IL-2 (7Whitehurst C.E.

ERK1/2 are involved in a diverse array of cellular functions including cell growth and apoptosis of T cells (10Marshall C.J.

In ERK1-deficient mice, the thymocyte differentiation from CD4+CD8+ double positive to the CD4+/CD8+ single positive stage is impaired; thus, ERK activation by TCR ligation plays important roles in T cell development (13Pages G.

Experiments using pharmacological inhibitors of MEK and dominant negative MEK also provided evidence that ERK1/2 are critical for thymocyte differentiation (11Bommhardt U. Scheuring Y. Bickel C.

Hence, it is important to understand how the strength and duration of ERK activity is regulated in TCR-mediated activation and fate decisions of T cells. The functions of ERK signaling are regulated by its upstream elements, in particular by members of the Raf family, in various cell types, and three Raf isoforms, Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf, are expressed in mammalian cells (16Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17Magnuson N.S. Beck T. Vahidi H. Hahn H. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 247-253PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Raf-1 is ubiquitously expressed, B-Raf shows a more restricted expression pattern (18Eychene A. Dusanter-Fourt I. Barnier J.V. Papin C. Charon M. Gisselbrecht S. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1159-1165PubMed Google Scholar, 19Barnier J.V. Papin C. Eychene A. Lecoq O. Calothy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in the different Raf isoforms exhibit different developmental defects, suggesting the nonredundant function(s) of each Raf isoform (20Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Beck T.W. Hahn H. Bernal R. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A different phenotype of each Raf-deficient mouse is expected to be due, at least in part, to their distinct expression pattern. It was reported that B-Raf exhibits a much more basal kinase activity and a higher affinity toward MEK than does Raf-1 in vitro (21Papin C. Denouel-Galy A. Laugier D. Calothy G. Eychene A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24939-24947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, the specific function(s) in vivo, if any, of each Raf isoform is poorly understood. B-Raf was reported to be one component of the receptor-mediated MEK/ERK activation pathway in fibroblasts, B cell lines, and PC12 cells (21Papin C. Denouel-Galy A. Laugier D. Calothy G. Eychene A. J.

Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, B-Raf expression in T cells is controversial; in this study, we detected B-Raf protein in Jurkat cells and primary human T cells, whereas others did not (4Carey K.D. Dillon T.J. Schmitt J.M. Baird A.M. Holdorf A.D. Straus D.B. Shaw A.S. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8409-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although Raf-1 is a well characterized effector molecule for ERK activation in the TCR-mediated signaling cascade and IL-2 production in T cells (27Owaki H. Varma R. Gillis B. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Davis L.S. Geppert T.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4367-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), much less attention has been directed to the roles of B-Raf in T cells. We now report that interaction of B-Raf with MEK and B-Raf activity are induced in a TCR stimulation-dependent manner in Jurkat cells. Our data suggest that MEK/ERK activity are selectively regulated through the Ras/B-Raf signaling pathway and that the sustained B-Raf/MEK/ERK activation is indispensable for the translocation of NFAT into the nucleus and for the production of IL-2. Cell Preparations and Reagents—Jurkat cell clone, E6–1 from the American Type Culture Collection, and Jurkat cells expressing simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg-Jurkat) (28Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). Jurkat cells stably expressing a wild-type or a dominant negative form of B-Raf were established and maintained in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum with 2 mg/ml G418. The human CD4+ T cell clone, YN 5–32 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared as described (29Chen Y.Z. Matsushita S. Nishimura Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3783-3790PubMed Google Scholar, 30Irie A. Chen Y.Z. Tsukamoto H. Jotsuka T. Masuda M. Nishimura Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For transient and stable transfection, 2 × 107 Jurkat cells were resuspended in 500 μl of cytomix (31van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) with the appropriate cDNAs. The amount of plasmid DNA was held at 40 μg constant by the addition of the pcDNA3 vector control. Cells were electroporated in 310 V at a capacitance of 960 microfarads. Transfectants were analyzed for CD3 and CD28 expression using flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Anti-CD3 (clone UCHT-1) antibody, anti-CD28 (clone L923) antibody, and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody were purchased from Pharmingen. Anti-mouse IgG (Fab-specific) antibody was from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti-NFAT1 and anti-NFAT2 antibodies and rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to Raf-1, B-Raf, MEK-1, c-Fos, and Lamin B were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies specific to MEK, phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, and phospho-MEK and a MEK inhibitor, U0126, were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-hemaggulutinin (HA) antibody was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit Ig antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-human IL-2 antibodies were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MEK was prepared as reported (32Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3 expression vectors with HA-tagged wild-type and dominant negative mutant B-Raf cDNAs were provided by Dr. K. L. Guan (33Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The RasN17 expression vector was a gift from Dr. T. Kinashi (5Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter construct for IL-2 promoter and AP-1 binding site were kindly provided by Dr. V. A.

Niles R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), respectively. The expression vector for GST-MEK was a gift from Dr. Y. Takai (32Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). NFAT-green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter construct, consisting of three tandem NFAT-binding sites followed by a gene encoding GFP, was provided by Dr. T. Saito (36Ohtsuka M. Arase H. Takeuchi A. Yamasaki S. Shiina R. Suenaga T. Sakurai D. Yokosuka T. Arase N. Iwashima M. Kitamura T. Moriya H. Saito T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8126-8131Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cell Stimulation and Inhibitor Treatment—In experiments for stimulation with soluble anti-CD3 antibody for cross-linking, Jurkat cells were incubated on ice for 20 min and then incubated with anti-CD3 antibody (0.25 μg/ml) for 10 min followed by the addition of anti-mouse IgG antibody (1 μg/ml) for 5 min. After the indicated times of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (see below). For the analysis of promoter activity and IL-2 production, Jurkat cells (1 × 106/well) were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies (5 and 10 μg/ml, respectively). For experiments with inhibitor treatment, cells were preincubated for 30 min with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or Me2SO as a control. In the time course analyses of the effect of ERK activation on IL-2 production by the treatment with U0126, medium containing U0126 or Me2SO was added at the indicated time points. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro Kinase Assay— After the indicated times of stimulation, the Jurkat cells were recovered and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitations from the cell lysates were carried out as described (30Irie A. Chen Y.Z. Tsukamoto H. Jotsuka T. Masuda M. Nishimura Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Raf-1 and B-Raf were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of T cells with the anti-Raf-1 and the anti-B-Raf antibodies, respectively, as described above. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.8 μg of recombinant GST-MEK protein. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 32 °C for 20 min, and then the reactions were terminated by adding 5× SDS sample buffer, separated on 7% SDS-PAGE under the reducing condition, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. Relative amounts of MEK or ERK phosphorylation were calculated based on the ratio of the intensities of phospho-MEK or phospho-ERK bands to those of the whole MEK or ERK bands in whole cell lysates at each time point. Signal intensities of the bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using NIH Image 6.2 software. Nuclear extracts were prepared from B-Raf mutant- or mock-transfected TAg Jurkat cells for nuclear translocation analysis of NFAT using nuclear/cytosol fractionation kits (BioVision). Flow Cytometric Analysis and Cytokine Measurement—For the NFAT-GFP reporter assay, the TAg-Jurkat cells expressing B-Raf AA or mock vector were transfected with NFAT-GFP reporter construct and stimulated for 9 h with immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. The expression of GFP was analyzed with a flow cytometer and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with IntraPrep (Immunotech, Marseille, France) and then stained with appropriate fluorescence-labeled antibodies. IL-2 concentrations in supernatants of T cell culture after 48 h of stimulation were measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-human IL-2 antibodies. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA extraction and first-strand cDNA synthesis from T cells were done as described (37Uemura Y. Senju S. Maenaka K. Iwai L.K. Fujii S. Tabata H. Tsukamoto H. Hirata S. Chen Y.Z. Nishimura Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 947-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification using a set of primers specific for human B-Raf: 5′-ACAACAGTTATTGGAATCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-AAATGCTAAGGTGAAAAACG-3′. Luciferase Assay—Reporter constructs were transfected into the Jurkat cells expressing wild-type or mutant B-Raf. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid was co-transfected to normalize the variations in transfection efficiency. After 12 h of transfection, cells were harvested and stimulated. Luciferase assay was carried out according to the protocol in the Pica Gene kit (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan). β-Galactosidase expression was assessed using the Luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit II (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of B-Raf Proteins in Both Human and Mouse T Cells—We investigated the expression of B-Raf in human and mouse T cells using Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Rat PC12 cells, as a positive control gave a 95-kDa band corresponding to B-Raf (lane 1), whereas B-Raf expression was negligible in NIH3T3 cells, as reported (lane 2) (38Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). B-Raf was detected in a human CD4+ T cell clone, YN5–32 (lane 3) (29Chen Y.Z. Matsushita S. Nishimura Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3783-3790PubMed Google Scholar, 30Irie A. Chen Y.Z. Tsukamoto H. Jotsuka T. Masuda M. Nishimura Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1497-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), a human T cell line, Jurkat (lane 4), and mouse CD4+ T cells isolated from spleens (lanes 5). Furthermore, the expression of human B-Raf mRNA was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR using RNAs isolated from the YN5–32 T cell clone and from Jurkat T cells (data not shown). Intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis also confirmed the B-Raf expression in human CD3-positive peripheral T cells (Fig. 1B) and mouse TCR-β chain-positive splenic T cells (Fig. 1B, b). Taken together, we conclude that B-Raf is expressed in both human and mouse T cells, allowing us to examine B-Raf functions in TCR-mediated T cell activation. TCR Ligation Induces Both Raf-1 and B-Raf Activation— Cross-linking of TCRs with soluble anti-CD3 antibody, which mimics the engagement of TCR with the agonistic peptide-MHC complex, induced ERK and MEK phosphorylation within 1 min, reaching a maximal level at ∼1–3 min in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2A). The ERK/MEK phosphorylations displayed similar kinetics and were prolonged for up to 60 min. Next, we performed in vitro kinase assays for Raf-1 and B-Raf to estimate the strength and kinetics of their kinase activities. Consistent with the previous report (27Owaki H. Varma R. Gillis B. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Davis L.S. Geppert T.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4367-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), Raf-1 was activated at 3 min after TCR ligation and became inactive within 20 min (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the kinetics of Raf-1 activity, there was slight but detectable B-Raf activity even under the basal condition, and B-Raf showed a pronounced increase of its kinase activity at 3 min after TCR stimulation. B-Raf kinase activity was gradually decreased but did last for up to 60 min (Fig. 2B). Raf-1 was inactivated after 20 min of TCR ligation; nevertheless, apparent MEK/ERK activation was still sustained up to 60 min (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, the kinetics of TCR-mediated B-Raf activation rather than that of Raf-1 activation was similar to that of MEK/ERK activation. The addition of co-stimulation with an anti-CD28 antibody treatment slightly enhanced the B-Raf activity over time compared with that stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody alone (Fig. 2C). Physiological association between Raf family kinases and MEK is necessary for MEK/ERK activation (39Xiang X. Zang M. Waelde C.A. Wen R. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44996-45003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); hence, we asked if B-Raf can interact with MEK in T cells in response to TCR stimulation using co-immunoprecipitation methods. For this purpose, wild-type B-Raf tagged with HA was expressed in Jurkat cells and was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. The specific association between HA-B-Raf and MEK was achieved at a maximal level at 3 min after TCR ligation, and this interaction lasted for up to 60 min with a slight decrease (Fig. 2D). The intrinsic interaction between B-Raf and MEK was also evaluated by reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-MEK antibody to detect endogenous B-Raf protein. As shown in Fig. 2E, endogenous B-Raf protein was not detected in immunoprecipitates with the anti-MEK antibody in unstimulated Jurkat cells. Consistent with Fig. 2D, intrinsic B-Raf·MEK complex formation was strongly induced at 3 min after TCR ligation, and then it decreased gradually but remained above the basal level up to 60 min after TCR stimulation in vivo (Fig. 2E). The kinetics of B-Raf/MEK interaction paralleled those of B-Raf activation (Fig. 2B). These results strongly suggested that B-Raf was involved in MEK/ERK activation stimulated with TCR ligation, especially in the late phase after Raf-1 had become inactive (Fig. 2B). TCR-mediated B-Raf Activation Is Partly Dependent on Ras Activity—Previous studies reported that B-Raf activation in fibroblasts was dependent on Ras activation (40Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 41Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4378-4383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In other cases, Ras activity was not essential for B-Raf activation in PC12 cells (23York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 38Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In T cells, to determine whether Ras activity is required for the B-Raf activation, TCR-mediated B-Raf activity was measured in TAg-Jurkat expressing the dominant negative Ras mutant RasN17. The RasN17 interfered with endogenous Ras, Raf-1, and MEK/ERK activation until at least 60 min after TCR stimulation (data not shown) (2Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, TCR engagement resulted in a robust activation of B-Raf after stimulation in mock-transfected Jurkat cells. In contrast, RasN17-transfected cells showed decreased B-Raf activation as compared with that observed in the control cells at 3 min after TCR stimulation (75% reduction). Similar inhibitory effects was observed at any given time points. These results indicated that TCR-mediated B-Raf activation is, at least in part, regulated by Ras activation in vivo. B-Raf Contributes to Sustained MEK/ERK Activation— Within the activation segment of B-Raf, there are two sites, Thr598 and Ser601, that can be phosphorylated in response to Ras activation, and the phosphorylation status of these residues is required for the maximal kinase activity of B-Raf (33Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 40Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hence, we introduced a dominant negative mutant of B-Raf (B-Raf AA), in which Thr598 and Ser601 were substituted to Ala (33Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), into T cells to examine the role of B-Raf in TCR-mediated MEK/ERK activation cascade. As shown in Fig. 4A, a Jurkat clone expressing B-Raf AA showed a similar degree of MEK/ERK activation induced by TCR cross-linking with soluble anti-CD3 antibody at 3 min after stimulation in comparison with that of mock-transfected cells. The MEK/ERK activation was effectively sustained for 60 min in the mock transfectants. On the other hand, in the Jurkat clone expressing B-Raf AA, MEK/ERK activation returned to the basal level within 30 min after TCR stimulation, and then it was no longer detected. Densitometric analyses of MEK/ERK activation revealed that the activation kinetic pattern rather than the relative magnitude of MEK/ERK activation was distinct between the mock-transfected clone and the B-Raf AA-expressing clone (Fig. 4B). Since TAg-Jurkat cells transiently transfected with B-Raf AA showed an essentially similar response, the possibility that these results were specific for one particular clone (AA2) was excluded (Fig. 4C). Moreover, these results were not due to the inhibition of Raf-1 activity by B-Raf AA, because the degree of TCR-mediated Raf-1 activation in B-Raf AA-expressing Jurkat cells was indistinguishable from that of mock-transfected Jurkat cells or cells expressing HA-tagged wild-type B-Raf (Fig. 4D and data not shown). In contrast to MEK/ERK activation, no significant differences in phosphorylation of another mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38, were detectable in both mock- and B-Raf AA-transfected TAg-Jurkat cells, suggesting that B-Raf AA did not influence p38 activation (Fig. 4C). The data indicate that B-Raf physiologically and specifically regulated prolonged MEK/ERK activation induced by TCR stimulation in Jurkat cells. B-Raf Activation and Subsequently Sustained ERK Activation Is Required for Full IL-2 Production—Since IL-2 production is one of the most critical events of ERK-mediated T cell activation, we first utilized the reporter assay controlled by the IL-2 promoter element to investigate the effect of B-Raf activation on IL-2 promoter activity. Whereas TCR stimulation resulted in induction of luciferase, which reflected the IL-2 promoter activity in wild-type B-Raf-transfected clone (WT30), B-Raf AA significantly attenuated the inducible IL-2 promoter activity (Fig. 5A). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5B, TCR stimulation induced a marked increase in IL-2 production in mock-transfected Jurkat cells and in wild-type B-Raf-expressing clones (WT30 and WT34), whereas it was substantially reduced in B-Raf AA-expressing clones (AA2 and AA23). The data described above clearly indicate that T cells expressing B-Raf AA had defects in sustained ERK activation and subsequent full IL-2 production in comparison with the control cells in response to TCR stimulation. However, whether the sustained ERK activation is directly correlated with the full IL-2 production remained to be solved. To clarify this issue, we investigated the requirement of TCR-mediated sustained ERK activation for the IL-2 production using the pharmacological MEK inhibitor U0126. As shown in Fig. 5C, TCR-mediated ERK activation was inhibited by U0126 at the range of 5–10 μm. In addition to ERK activation, IL-2 production provoked by stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies was markedly blocked by U0126 at the same range of concentrations. We also examined the effects of B-Raf AA on the magnitude and period of ERK activation stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies. It must be noted that, as compared with the stimulation by cross-linking of soluble anti-CD3 antibody with the second antibody (Fig. 2A), stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 and -CD28 antibodies resulted in a retardation of ERK activation and extended ERK activation in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5D). Such temporal differences in ERK activation have been repo"
https://openalex.org/W1987150413,"The ∼1.2-kb 5′-noncoding region (5′-NCR) of mRNA species encoding mouse Kv1.4, a member of the Shaker-related subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels, was shown to mediate internal ribosome entry in cells derived from brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, tissues known to express Kv1.4 mRNA species. We also show that the upstream ∼1.0 kb and the downstream ∼0.2 kb of the Kv1.4 5′-NCR independently mediated internal ribosome entry; however, separately, these sequences were less efficient in mediating internal ribosome entry than when together in the complete (and contiguous) 5′-NCR. Using enzymatic structure probing, the 3′-most ∼0.2 kb was predicted to form three distinct stem-loop structures (stem-loops X, Y, and Z) and two defined single-stranded regions (loops Ψ and Ω) in the presence and absence of the upstream ∼1.0 kb. Although the systematic deletion of sequences within the 3′-most ∼0.2 kb resulted in distinct changes in expression, enzymatic structure probing indicated that local RNA folding was not completely altered. Structure probing analysis strongly suggested an interaction between stem-loop X and a downstream polypyrimidine tract; however, opposing changes in activity were observed when sequences within these two regions were independently deleted. Moreover, deletions correlating with positive as well as negative changes in expression altered RNase cleavage within stem-loop X, indicating that this structure may be an integral element. Therefore, these findings indicate that Kv1.4 expression is mediated through a complex interplay between many distinct RNA regions.

Potassium channels are ubiquitously expressed in nature, facilitating diverse cellular processes in response to intra- and extracellular changes (1Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev.

Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) 1The abbreviations used are: Kv, voltage-gated potassium; NCRs, noncoding regions; mKv1.4, mouse Kv1.4; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; PrCM, primary rat cardiac myocytes; CVB3, coxsackievirus B3; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. channels modulate action potentials in electrically excitable cells and facilitate cell proliferation, cell volume regulation, and secretion in non-electrically excitable cells. Kv channel genes encode a single α-subunit that forms potassium-selective pores through the assembly of tetramers. Physiological stimulation during stress regulates transcription through the release of hormones and neurotransmitters (2Levitan E.S. Takimoto K. J.

Post-translational modifications, interactions with auxiliary β-subunits, and heterotetramerization between subfamily members may alter channel properties, promote cell-surface expression, and/or modify channel localization (1Jan L.Y.

The NCRs of many eukaryotic mRNAs have been shown to regulate gene expression by affecting mRNA localization, mRNA stability, and translation. Although the roles of the 5′- and 3′-NCRs in Kv channel expression have yet to be investigated in detail, the presence of unusually long 5′-NCRs in this gene family raised the possibility that such sequences may mediate and perhaps modulate translation. Kv1.4, a member of the Shaker-related subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels, forms rapidly activating and inactivating A-type channels (5Tseng-Crank J.C. Tseng G.N. Schwartz A.

However, atypical features within the 5′-NCR, including extensive length, stable secondary structure, and multiple upstream initiation codons, have been shown to inhibit ribosome scanning (13Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar).

In this work, two different subsets of mKv1.4 5′-NCR sequences are shown to independently mediate internal ribosome entry. These sequences demonstrated cell type-specific activities distinct from those mediated by a viral IRES. RNA structure probing indicated that the 3′-most ∼0.2 kb forms defined structural elements in the presence and absence of the upstream ∼1.0 kb. Deletion of sequences within the 3′ ∼0.2 kb resulted in distinct changes in expression mediated by the 3′-most ∼0.2 kb (referred to as 0.2) and the ∼1.2-kb mKv1.4 5′-NCR (referred to as 1.2), initially indicating that specific RNA elements may positively or negatively affect expression. Secondary structure probing suggested that local RNA folding is partially conserved with the introduction of various deletions within the 3′ ∼0.2 kb. Therefore, these findings suggest that interactions between functionally/structurally distinct RNA elements collectively promote internal ribosome entry.

Human neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-SH and NLF were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics. African green monkey kidney cell lines CV1 and COS and the mouse muscle myoblast cell line C2F3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics/antimycotics.

The 3′ ∼0.2-kb 5′-NCR cDNA sequence within p1209luc and p229luc differs from the original published sequence (4Negulescu D. Leong L.E.-C. Chandy K.G. Semler B.L. Gutman G.A. J. Biol.

Deletions within the 3′-most ∼0.2 kb of the mKv1.4 5′-NCR were created using a PCR-based deletion mutagenesis scheme described previously by Imai et al. (37Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Briefly, divergent non-overlapping oligonucleotides flanking targeted sequences were used to PCR amplify p229luc or p1209luc with a thermophilic DNA polymerase, Deep Vent® or PfuTurbo (Stratagene). The plasmid template was removed by DpnI digestion, leaving PCR-amplified DNA fragments that were gel-purified, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and transformed into competent XL1-Blue bacteria. Deletions were verified by restriction digestion and sequence analysis. The following oligonucleotides were utilized for deletion mutagenesis: 1703N, 5′-ACCACCATGGAAGACGCCAA-3′; 1732N, 5′-ACAACTGGAAGCAGCCATTT-3′; 1740N, 5′-CTTCTCTTACAACTGGAAGC-3′; 1800N, 5′-TAAGGCTTCCAAACTTACCT-3′; 1840N, 5′-GTTGGACTGAAAATATCCCA-3′; 1880N, 5′-GGAGCATAGGCTGTGCTGAT-3′; 1740X, 5′-AAGAAAGAAAAATAGGGCAG-3′; 1758X, 5′-CAGCTTATTTTCTTACCAAA-3′; 1780X, 5′-AAGGTAAGTTTGGAAGCCTT-3′; 1830X, 5′-TTCAGTCCAACTTTGCATTT-3′; 1880X, 5′-CCTCTTCTCAGAGACTCGGC-3′; 1910X, 5′-AGAGCTTGCCTCGTCTAGAG-3′; and 1920X, 5′-TCGTCTAGAGCTTGTCTCCC-3′. Deletions at the 3′-end of 0.2 (3′Δ), 0.2Δ1′, 0.2ΔpY, 0.2Δ1, 0.2Δ2, and 0.2Δ3, were generated using oligonucleotide pairs 1703N/1740X, 1732N/1758X, 1703N/1780X, 1740N/1780X, and 1740N/1830X, respectively. Deletions at the 5′-end of 0.2 (5′Δ), 0.2Δ4, 0.2Δ5, 0.2Δ6, 0.2Δ7, 0.2Δ8, and 0.2Δ9, were generated using oligonucleotide pairs 1800N/1830X, 1800N/1880X, 1840N/1880X, 1840N/1910X, 1880N/1910X, and 1880N/1920X, respectively. 0.2Δ10 and 0.2Δ11 were generated with oligonucleotide pairs 1740N/1880X and 1740N/1910X, respectively. Dual-luciferase Dicistronic Constructs—A dual-luciferase plasmid construct, p2luci (a gift from Dr. R. F. Gesteland, University of Utah) (38Grentzmann G. Ingram J.A. Kelly P.J. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was used to generate dicistronic constructs. Firefly luciferase coding region sequences were excised from pGL3 (Promega) using NcoI and XbaI and ligated with the vector fragment of p2luci, which was digested with BamHI, treated with Klenow fragment, and digested with XbaI, resulting in p2luci-fx. p2luci-fx was linearized with SalI, treated with Klenow fragment, and religated to generate pR2TAAF, which encodes two tandem stop codons in-frame with the Renilla luciferase coding region. pRstF was subsequently generated by inserting an inverted repeat between the Renilla and firefly luciferase coding region sequences in pR2TAAF at the BglII restriction site using two ∼50-bp fragments excised from the multiple cloning site of pGEM-4z with BamHI-SphI (Promega). Plasmids were examined by restriction digestion. The full-length ∼1.2-kb mKv1.4 5′-NCR was excised from p1209luc with HindIII and NcoI, whereas the 3′∼0.2 kb and the 5′∼1.0 kb were excised with XbaI and NcoI and with HindIII and XbaI, respectively, and treated with Klenow fragment. Similarly, 3′ ∼0.2-kb fragments containing deletions (0.2Δ) were excised from the appropriate p229Δluc or p1209Δluc constructs using XbaI and NcoI. Fragments were treated with Klenow fragment or T4 DNA polymerase and inserted into Eco47III- or AfeI-linearized pRstF plasmid, which had been treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. 1.2-kb 5′-NCR deletion sequences (1.2Δ) were similarly inserted into pRstF using a three-fragment ligation. The 5′ ∼1.0 kb was excised from p1209luc with HindIII and XbaI, whereas 3′ ∼0.2-kb fragments containing deletions were excised from the appropriate p229Δluc constructs using XbaI and NcoI. Only the HindIII and NcoI overhangs were filled in with T4 DNA polymerase, allowing cohesive XbaI ends to preferentially ligate. Plasmids were verified by restriction digestion and sequence analysis. pRstCVB3F was generated by inserting the 5′-NCR of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) into p2luci-fxnk1, a dicistronic construct containing a hairpin and additional intercistronic sequences. p2luci-fx was linearized with NotI, treated with Klenow fragment, and subsequently religated with T4 DNA ligase to generate p2luci-fxnk. p2luci-fxnk1 was generated by inserting a 148-bp fragment, excised from pTrap+1 2L. E.-C. Leong and B. L. Semler, unpublished data. with StuI and ApaI, between the blunted SalI and ApaI sites of p2luci-fxnk, introducing a hairpin described previously by Vagner et al. (39Vagner S.

The 5′-NCR of CVB3 was PCR-amplified from pCVB3-0 (40Chapman N.M. Tu Z. Tracy S. Gauntt C.J. Arch. Virol. 1994; 135: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with CVB3 PacI(+) (5′-CCTTAATTAATTAAAACAGCCTGTGGGTTGA-3′) and CVB3 NotI(–) (5′-ATAAGATATGCGGCCGCTCCCATTTTGCTGTATTCAACTTA-3′). CVB3 5′-NCR sequences were removed from pT7CVB+1 using PacI and NotI and inserted into p2lucifxnk to generate p2luci-fxnkC1. Finally, p2luci-fxnkC1 was linearized with BamHI, treated with Klenow fragment, and religated to generate pRstCVB3F. Dicistronic constructs lacking the SV40 promoter, the chimeric intron, and the T7 promoter were generated by two- or three-fragment ligations. The vector backbone of pRstF was isolated by digesting the plasmid with NcoI and NotI to remove sequences encompassing the SV40 promoter to the end of firefly luciferase. The vector was ligated with the NheI-NotI fragment isolated from pRstF, pRst1.2F, pRst0.2F, or pRst1.0F or with two fragments from pRstCVB3F, generated by digestion with NheI, PacI, and XbaI. Additionally, following restriction digestion with NcoI and NheI, reactions were incubated with T4 DNA polymerase to fill-in 3′-overhangs. Unless otherwise noted, enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. In Vitro Transcription—Dicistronic constructs were digested with NotI or XbaI, and p229luc and p229Δluc constructs were digested with BstBI. Linearized plasmids were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. In vitro transcription reactions were performed using 1.0 μg of linearized template (Ambion Inc.) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Reactions were subsequently treated with DNase I at 37 °C for 30 min, subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction, and isolated using RNeasy columns (QIAGEN Inc.). Transient Transfection—Cells were seeded 24–48 h before transfection, generating monolayers with 50–80% confluency. 35- or 22-mm well plates and 100-mm dishes were used for luciferase assays and total RNA isolation, respectively. Neonatal PrCM, seeded onto 35- or 22-mm well plates, were allowed to grow for 3 days before transfection. A 1:3 ratio of plasmid (micrograms) to FuGENE 6 (microliters) (Roche Applied Science) was complexed in Opti-MEMI (Invitrogen) at room temperature for ≥15 min. Monolayers were initially incubated with transfection complexes for 5 h, rinsed with medium, and incubated for an additional 19 h after the addition of fresh medium. The cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase reporter construct used in experiments presented in Fig. 2A was generously provided by Judy Jimenez and Dr. Marian L. Waterman (University of California, Irvine, CA). For transient RNA transfections, cells were seeded onto 35-mm well plates ≥24 h prior to transfection, generating monolayers with 80–90% confluency. 2 μg of uncapped, in vitro transcribed RNA was transfected per well. A 6:1 ratio of Transmessenger transfection reagent (microliters) (QIAGEN Inc.) to RNA (micrograms) was added, and transfection complexes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and combined with Opti-MEMI. Monolayers were rinsed twice with 2.0 ml of Opti-MEMI prior to the addition of transfection complexes and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with serum-containing medium for an additional 14 h. Dual-luciferase Assays—Monolayers were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) ∼24 h post-transfection. Cell lysates were subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles at –70 and 30 °C, respectively, and assayed for luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were sequentially assessed by initially adding lysate to 100 μl of firefly luciferase substrate, measuring luminescence for 10 s, adding 100 μl of Renilla luciferase substrate to the same sample, and measuring luminescence for an additional 10 s. Assays were performed using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) or a SIRIUS luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). Transfections were performed in triplicate. Firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase/β-galactosidase ratios were calculated for each sample, and the average value is represented as -fold above background levels, with expression measured in the absence of insert. Dicistronic assays were independently performed at least twice in all cells and cell lines used. Isolation of Total RNA and Oligo(dT) Selection—Total RNA was isolated with TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) and subjected to oligo(dT) selection using the Micro-FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) and DNase I digestion (Worthington). Following DNase I digestion, oligo(dT)-selected RNAs were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and subsequently resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. Northern Blot Analysis—2 μg of oligo(dT)-selected RNA was denatured with glyoxal/Me2SO (1 m deionized glyoxal, 50% (v/v) deionized Me2SO, and 25 mm sodium phosphate) at 50 °C for 60 min and separated on a 10 mm sodium phosphate-containing 1.0% agarose gel with continuous buffer circulation at 5 V/cm (∼100 V). RNA was transferred to a GeneScreen Plus hybridization transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by upward capillary transfer with 20× SSC for 20–24 h. Membranes were briefly rinsed with 2× SSC; UV light-irradiated; incubated in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) for ∼30 min at room temperature; prehybridized with 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 0.3 m NaCl, and 1% SDS at 65 °C for 3 h; and hybridized overnight with random hexamer-primed 32P-labeled probes against firefly luciferase coding region sequences in the prehybridization buffer at 55 °C. Following hybridization, membranes were initially washed with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at ambient temperature; subsequently washed with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at ambient temperature, 37 °C, and 42 °C; and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. The membranes were subsequently reprobed for β-actin to determine relative RNA loading. Images were quantified using Quantity One Version 4.3.0 (Bio-Rad). Random Primer Labeling of DNA Fragments and 5′-End Labeling of Oligonucleotides—Random hexamer priming reactions were performed based on methods described previously (41Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar, 42Todd S. Towner J.S. Semler B.L. Virology. 1997; 229: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An ∼1.7-kb fragment encoding the firefly luciferase coding region was excised from pRstF using NcoI and NotI, and an ∼1.8-kb fragment was excised from a plasmid containing human β-actin cDNA sequences (43Guttridge D.C. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18966-18974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel-purified DNA fragments were denatured and incubated with random hexamer primer (New England Biolabs Inc.), [α-32P]dATP, and Klenow fragment at 37 °C for 30 min. Unincorporated [α-32P]dATP was removed using Chroma Spin-30 diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O columns (Clontech). 9 pmol (∼60 ng) of oligonucleotide (Fluc (5′-TCCATCTTCCAGCGGATAGA-3′), 1740X, or 1780X) was incubated in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol with 50 μCi (6000 Ci/mmol) of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in a final volume of 50 μl for 60 min at 37 °C. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed using Chroma Spin-10 TE columns (Clontech). Enzymatic Structure Probing by Primer Extension—RNA structure probing was carried out as a modification of methods described previously (44Moazed D. Stern S. Noller H.F. J. Mol.

In vitro transcribed RNA (0.5 μg) was combined with 40 μg of yeast tRNA in 0.7× buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 270 mm KCl under reducing conditions (18 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) in a final volume of 40 μl. RNAs were sequentially incubated at 68 and 37 °C for 5 min each and then at room temperature for 5–10 min before the addition of RNase V1 (Pierce) or RNase T1, PhyM, or CL3 (Industrial Research Ltd.) at room temperature for 5–20 min (as described in the figure legends). Reactions were halted by the addition of 160 μl of stop solution (final concentrations of 0.3 m NaOAc, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.3% SDS), subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol-precipitated in the presence of glycogen. RNA pellets were initially resuspended in a final volume of 15.5 μl with 106 cpm 32P-5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide and sequentially incubated at 70 °C and on ice for 10 min each. RNAs were incubated at 42 °C for 40–60 min with 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm each dNTP, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega).

They are synthesized in the lumen of the Golgi complex and appear unable to translocate from the lumenal toward the cytosolic surface of Golgi membrane to access the monomeric lipid transport. As a consequence, they can only leave the Golgi complex via the lumenal surface of transport vesicles. In this work we analyzed the exocytic transport of the disialo ganglioside GD3 from trans-Golgi network (TGN) to plasma membrane in CHO-K1 cells by immunodetection of endogenously synthesized GD3. We found that ganglioside GD3, unlike another luminal membrane-bounded lipid (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein), did not partition into GEM domains in the Golgi complex and trafficked from TGN to plasma membrane by a brefeldin A-insensitive exocytic pathway. Moreover, a dominant negative form of Rab11, which prevents exit of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein from the Golgi complex, did not influence the capacity of GD3 to reach the cell surface. Our results strongly support the notion that most ganglioside GD3 traffics from the TGN to the plasma membrane by a non-conventional vesicular pathway where lateral membrane segregation of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (non-GEM resident) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GEM resident) from GD3 is required before exiting TGN.

Lipids are continuously transported between membranes by a non-random process since each membrane-bounded compartment along the exocytic and endocytic pathways has a unique molecular composition of lipids. Lipids can either exchange between membranes as single molecules (monomeric lipid transport) or they can be incorporated into transport vesicles destined to the plasma membrane or different organelles (vesicular transport) (1Ait Slimane T. Hoekstra D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Maier O. Hoekstra D. J. Biol.

Gangliosides appear unable to translocate from the lumenal toward the cytosolic surface of Golgi membrane to access the monomeric lipid transport. As a consequence they can only leave the Golgi complex via the lumenal surface of transport vesicles (7van Meer G. Lisman Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25855-25858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). During vesicular transport, vesicles bud from a donor compartment by a process that allows selective incorporation of cargo into the forming vesicles while retaining resident proteins in the donor compartment. The vesicles are subsequently targeted at specific acceptor compartments into which they unload their cargo upon fusion of their limiting membranes (8Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells membrane transport between compartments requires proteins that allow the budding and cleavage of nascent cargo vesicles from the donor membrane and their latter targeting and fusion with an acceptor compartment (9Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). The regulatory machinery includes several cytosolic proteins such as the AP adaptor complexes and the monomeric Golgi-localized, γ-adaptin ear-containing, ARF-binding (GGAs) proteins (10Folsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and membrane-bound GTP-binding proteins (or GTPases), such as Rabs and ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF), which are proteins that function as molecular switches cycling between their GTP- and GDP-bound states. Members of the Rab GTPase family have been implicated in the control of various steps along the vesicular transport, including cargo selection and budding, movement, docking, and fusion (11Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among Rabs, Rab11 has been shown to be operating distally in subapical compartments in HepG2 cells (1Ait Slimane T. Hoekstra D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and to regulate the delivery of proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane in both polarized cells and fibroblasts (11Somsel Rodman J. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 183-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chen W. Feng Y. Chen D. Wandinger-Ness A. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). On the other hand the endocytic transport of glycosphingolipids to the Golgi complex is dependent upon Rab7 and Rab9, as demonstrated by inhibition of Golgi targeting in normal cells by dominant-negative Rab7 and Rab9 constructs (16Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 605-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition to the Rab GTPases, ARF GTPases are required for intracellular transport and maintaining the integrity of organelle structure. Mammalian ARF proteins are grouped into three classes; class I includes ARF1, -2, and -3, class II includes ARF4 and -5, and class III includes ARF6. ARF1 has been the most extensively characterized and is established to be involved in the budding of vesicles from the Golgi complex. On the other hand ARF6 has been implicated in the formation of vesicles from plasma membranes (17Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). ARF activation and inactivation are catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that facilitate GTP binding and GTPase-activating proteins that catalyze GTP hydrolysis. In general ARF6 GEFs are not inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), in contrast with other ARF GEFs (18Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). BFA is a metabolite of the fungus Eupenicillium brefeldianum that acts by a rare uncompetitive mechanism with formation of an abortive ARF·GDP-BFA-GEF complex, which cannot proceed to nucleotide dissociation (18Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Glycolipid transport, particularly ganglioside transport, is very poorly studied. Short chain and analogous fluorescent lipids have been used as useful tools for delineating potential pathways and mechanisms of intracellular transport and sorting (19Pagano R.E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the quantitative and qualitative behavior of the analog lipids is quite different from long chain cellular lipids, since the ability of short fluorescent lipids to diffuse spontaneously between different membranes is not generally shared by their endogenous lipid counterparts (20Wang T.Y. Silvius J.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1478-1489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed the transport of the disialo ganglioside GD3 from TGN to plasma membrane in CHO-K1 cells by immunodetection of endogenously synthesized GD3. Our main approach was to accumulate GD3 at the TGN with temperature block and allow the synchronous release upon warming. GD3 arrival at cell surface was easily monitored by immunodetection since gangliosides from plasma membranes were previously depleted by incubating the cells with a potent inhibitor of complex glycolipid synthesis. We found that GD3 ganglioside, unlike another luminal membrane-bounded lipid (glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein) (21Chatterjee S. Mayor S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1969-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J.

J. 2004; 377: 561-568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not partition into GEM domains in the Golgi complex and trafficked from TGN to plasma membrane via a BFA-insensitive exocytic pathway. Moreover, the dominant negative form of Rab11, which prevents the exit of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) from the Golgi complex, did not influence the capacity of GD3 to reach the cell surface. Taken together our results strongly support the notion that most GD3 ganglioside traffics from TGN to plasma membrane by a non-conventional vesicular pathway where lateral membrane segregation of VSVG (non-GEM resident) and GPI-anchored proteins (GEM resident) from GD3 is required before exiting TGN. Expression Plasmids—Plasmids pEGFP-Rab11a wild type (wt), pEGFP-Rab11a Q70L (a GTPase-deficient mutant), and pEGFP-Rab11a S25N (a GTP binding-deficient mutant) were kindly provided by Dr. Marisa Colombo (Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina). Plasmids pEGFP-Rab11, -Rab11S25N, and -Rab11Q70L were made by subcloning the cDNA fragments in-frame to pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). cDNAs coding for the total sequence of the yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) fused to a GPI attachment signal (GPI-YFP) and the temperature-sensitive variant of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG tsO45) fused to the YFP (VSVG-YFP) were kindly supplied by P. Keller (Max-Plank Institute, Dresden, Germany) (25Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and DNA Transfections—CHO-K1 cells (clone 2), a stable CMP-NeuAc:GM3 sialyltransferase (Sial-T2, tagged at the C terminus with the nanopeptide epitope of the viral hemagglutinin (HA)) transfectant expressing the ganglioside GD3 and GT3 (26Daniotti J.L.

J. 2001; 355: 465-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Cells were grown and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Where indicated cells were transfected with 1 μg/35-mm dish of the plasmids named above using cationic lyposomes (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 14, 24, or 48 h at 37 °C with the transfection reagent and DNA mixture. When VSVG-YFP plasmid was used for transfections, CHO-K1 cells grown in the presence of the inhibitor of glycolipid synthesis were transfected at 41 °C (restrictive temperature) for 14 h. Under these conditions the VSVG protein accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Cells transfected with VSVG-YFP or GPI-YFP were then incubated at 20 °C for 2 h and either processed for immunofluorescence immediately or transferred to 37 °C for 1 or 2 additional hours before fixation. Where indicated, cells were supplemented with BFA from a stock solution 1 mg/ml in methanol at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. BFA was present in the culture medium for the last 15 min of culture at 20 °C and for 1 h at 37 °C. Control cells were supplemented with the same amount of methanol without BFA. Cycloheximide (30 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium for the last 30 min of culture at 20 °C and maintained for the indicated times. d,l-threo-1-Phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol-HCl Treatment of Cells—Inhibition of glycolipid synthesis with d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol-HCl (P4) (Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA) was carried out as follows. Cells from clone 2 in culture were treated for 5 days with 2.4 μm P4 added to the culture medium from a recently prepared 600 μm stock solution. After 3 days of treatment with P4, cells were further incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium without serum growth factors for 34 h to synchronize them. Then, to stimulate cell growth, cells were incubated for 14 h with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 5 days of treatment with P4, culture medium was removed, and cells were washed extensively with PBS to remove P4. Then, cells were incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum-rich medium for 2 h at 20 °C to accumulate GD3 in TGN and immediately incubated at 37 °C to allow GD3 transport. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown in coverslips were washed twice in PBS, fixed in acetone at –20 °C for 7 min, washed in PBS, and incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin, PBS buffer for 1 h at 37 °C to block nonspecific binding sites. Coverslips were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, washed 5 times with 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS buffer, and exposed to secondary antibodies for 90 min at 37 °C. The primary antibodies were: mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GD3 (IgG3), clone R24 (a gift of Dr. K. Lloyd, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Center, New York, NY), diluted 1:200; mouse monoclonal antibody anti-HA diluted 1:200 and rabbit polyclonal anti-mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR, a gift of Dr. Alfredo Cáceres, Instituto Mercedes y Martín Ferreyra, Córdoba, Argentina) diluted 1:150. Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488- or Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:1000 or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson InmunoResearch) diluted 1:1000. After final washes with 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS, cells were mounted in mounting fluid (Light Diagnostics, Temecula, CA). Confocal images were collected using a Carl Zeiss LSM5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon/helium/neon laser and a 63× (numerical aperture = 1.4) oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat). Single confocal sections of 0.7 μm were taken parallel to the coverslip (xy sections). Images were acquired and processed with the Zeiss LSM image software. Images for fluorescence quantification were taken with a Zeiss inverted microscopy equipped with epifluorescence and processed with the MetaMorph 3.0 Imagen System (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Final images were compiled with Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Lipid Labeling, Extraction, and Chromatography—For metabolic labeling ex vivo, cells in culture (3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were labeled with 10 μCi/ml [9,10(n)-3H]palmitic acid (Amersham Biosciences; 53 Ci/mmol) during 12 h in the presence of the inhibitor P4 to block synthesis of GD3. Then, culture medium was removed; cells were washed extensively to remove P4 and incubated with complete medium for 2 h at 20 °C to synthesize and accumulate GD3 in TGN. Following 20 °C treatment, cells were incubated at 37 °C to allow GD3 exit from TGN and the detergent solubility/insolubility of GD3 was analyzed at different times. Cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested by scraping. Samples were treated with 0.5 ml lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Na2CO3, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin and 25 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (TNE buffer) at 4 °C for 1h, and then centrifuged for 1h at 100000 g at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was removed, and the pellet (insoluble fraction) was resuspended in 0.2 ml lysis buffer. Glycolipids from the supernatant (soluble fraction) and from the pellet (insoluble fraction) were subjected to Folch partition (28Folch J. Arsove S. Meath J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 819-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting aqueous phases were freed from Triton X-100 (non-ionic molecule) by passing through DEAE-Sephadex column. Under this condition, neutral lipids as glucosylceramide and LacCer co-eluted with Triton X-100 in the non-retained fraction. The acidic lipid fraction retained in the column (gangliosides) was eluted with 0,1 M sodium acetate and the salt removed by passing through Sep-Pak C18 cartridge column (Waters Corporation Milford, USA). The eluted lipid fraction was supplemented with appropriate amounts of standard gangliosides and chromatographed on high-performance TLC plates (HPTLC, Merck, Germany) using chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (60:36:8 v/v) as solvent. Standard gangliosides were visualized by exposure of the plate to iodine vapors. Routinely 700–1000 cpm were spotted on each lane. Radioactive gangliosides were visualized using a Fuji Photo Film Bio Imagen analyzer or visualized by fluorography after dipping the plate in 0.4% melted 2,5-diphenyloxazole in 2-methylnaphthalene and exposure to a radiographic film at –70 °C, usually for 15 days. For analysis of sphingomyelin and ceramide, cells in culture were labeled with 10μCi/ml of [9,10(n)-3H]palmitic acid for 18 h in the absence or presence of the inhibitor P4 as described (29Li R.

Commun. 2001; 281: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After incubation, the radioactive medium was removed, the cells were washed, and the lipids were extracted by the method of Folch et al. (28Folch J. Arsove S. Meath J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 819-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting aqueous phase (upper phase) was freed from water-soluble contaminants by passing through a Sephadex G-25 column. Lipids from the upper phase were spotted on a HPTLC plate and developed in chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (60:36:8 v/v). The chloroform phase (lower phase) was subjected to mild alkaline methanolysis to remove glycerophospholipids, and lipids were extracted once more by the method of Folch et al. (28Folch J. Arsove S. Meath J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 819-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen, and lipids were separated by HPTLC. For HPTLC analysis of ceramide, samples were spotted on an HPTLC plate and developed in chloroform, acetic acid (9:1 v/v). Ceramide (type III; Sigma) was used as a standard. For HPTLC analysis of sphingomyelin, samples were spotted on an HPTLC plate and developed in chloroform, acetone, acetic acid, methanol, water (50:20:15:10:5 v/v). Bovine sphingomyelin was used as standard. Standards lipids were visualized by exposure of the plate to iodine vapors. Radioactive lipids were visualized by fluorography. GD3 Cell Depletion, de Novo Resynthesis, and TGN Accumulation at 20 °C—To investigate GD3 transport from TGN to plasma membrane, we developed a successful model in GD3-expressing CHO-K1 cell clone, already established in our laboratory (23Crespo P.M. Zurita A.R. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44731-44739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Giraudo C.G. Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We could analyze the transport to plasma membrane of natural GD3, synthesized de novo, in cells where more than 96% of total GD3, mainly present in plasma membrane, was depleted by using P4, a potent inhibitor of complex glycolipid synthesis (23Crespo P.M. Zurita A.R. Daniotti J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44731-44739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (see the scheme in Fig. 2). Cells were grown in the presence of P4 for 5 days, allowing the cells to eliminate GD3 from plasma membrane. Under this condition, the analysis of GD3 expression by immunostaining with monoclonal antibody R24 was under the limit of detection (Fig. 1A). After 5 days of treatment with P4, culture medium was removed; cells were washed extensively to remove P4 and incubated with complete medium for 2 h at 20°C, which causes proteins to accumulate in the TGN (31Matlin K.S. Simons K. Cell. 1983; 34: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). At the end of this period, cells were able to synthesize and accumulate GD3 in TGN (Fig. 1B), since GD3 was found co-localizing to a significant extent with UDP-GalNAc: LacCer/GM3/GD3 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and mannose 6-phosphate receptor, two well characterized TGN markers in CHO-K1 cells (26Daniotti J.L.

J. 1999; 342: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To our knowledge this is the first time in which a natural ganglioside synthesized de novo is accumulated and immunodetected in TGN. After a 20 °C treatment, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 7, 15, 30, and 90 min to allow GD3 exit and transport from TGN to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, C–F). GD3-expressing cells showed this ganglioside at the cell surface as patches, although a minor fraction was also present in late endosomes (24Crespo P.M. Zurita A.R. Giraudo C.G. Maccioni H.J. Daniotti J.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 561-568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a further evaluation of the subcellular distribution of GD3 at different temperatures and times, quantification of GD3 fluorescence intensity was performed (Table I). The results obtained confirmed our qualitative observation and clearly revealed that the pool of GD3 localized in Golgi complex (at 20 °C) was reduced progressively at 37 °C, whereas a noticeable accumulation of the glycolipid was observed in the plasma membrane. Next, we set out to confirm the decrease of GD3 after P4 treatment and its effect on endogenous ceramide and sphingomyelin levels, studying the content of these lipids after metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitic acid. Biochemical results from Fig. 2 clearly shows that exposure of cells to P4 in the culture medium for 5 days led to a noticeable decrease of both GD3 and GT3 (Fig. 2A) and their precursors lactosylceramide (LacCer) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (Fig. 2B). On the other hand the presence of the inhibitor in the culture medium of CHO-K1 cells did not significantly alter the endogenous levels of sphingomyelin (Fig. 2B) and ceramide (Fig. 2C). Thus, we have established the experimental conditions to explore the role of different molecules of the sorting machinery in GD3 traffic to plasma membrane.Fig. 1Accumulation of GD3 in TGN at 20 °C and latter transport to the cell surface of CHO-K1 cells. Cells were grown in the presence of P4 for 5 days, allowing the cells to mainly eliminate GD3 from plasma membrane (A). Then culture medium was removed, and cells were washed extensively to remove P4 and incubated with complete medium for 2 h at 20 °C to accumulate GD3 in the TGN (B). At the end of this period cells were incubated at 37 °C for during 7 (C), 15 (D), 30 (E), and 90 (F) min to allow GD3 exit and transport from TGN to plasma membrane. GD3 expression was analyzed by confocal microscopy immunofluorescence in acetone-fixed cells using a monoclonal antibody R24 as the primary antibody and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody.

Wandinger-Ness A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Before evaluating the role of Rab11 on GD3 transport from TGN to plasma membrane, we investigated in CHO-K1 cells the effect of these GTPases on the sorting to plasma membrane of the temperature-sensitive VSVG protein, a useful transport marker. GD3-expressing CHO-K1 cells were grown in the presence of P4 for 5 days, and VSVG was expressed by transient DNA transfection 14 h before removing the inhibitor at 41 °C to accumulate VSVG in the ER. Then cells were incubated at 20 °C for 2 h to allow the accumulation of VSVG in the TGN in media containing cycloheximide to prevent further synthesis of VSVG (Fig. 3A, 20 °C). VSVG transport to the cell surface was initiated by changing the temperature to a permissive condition (Fig. 3A, 37 °C). Co-expression of the dominant negative Rab11S25N protein (Rab11S25N-GFP) was found to prevent the exit of VSVG protein from the Golgi complex, whereas wild type Rab11 (Rab11wt-GFP) protein expression allowed normal delivery of the protein marker to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A, 37 °C). The expression of the constitutively activated Rab11 protein (Rab11Q70L) had no appreciable effect on VSVG delivery to the plasma membrane (data not shown). As also shown in Fig. 3, Rab11wt and Rab11S25N proteins were expressed both in the perinuclear region of the cells and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The perinuclear expression of Rab11wt-GFP was observed to be mainly associated with recycling endosomes,"
https://openalex.org/W2048447102,"We have used site-specific spin-labeling of single cysteine mutations within a water-soluble mutant of subunit b of the ATP synthase and employed electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to obtain information about the binding interactions of the b dimer with F1-ATPase. Interaction of b2 with a δ-depleted F1 (F1-δ) was also studied. The cysteine mutations used for spin-labeling were distributed throughout the cytosolic domain of the b subunit. In addition, each position between residues 101 and 114 of b was individually mutated to cysteine. All mutants were modified with a cysteine-reactive spin label. The room temperature ESR spectra of spin-labeled b2 in the presence of F1 or F1-δ when compared with the spectra of free b2 indicate a tight binding interaction between b2 and F1. The data suggest that b2 packs tightly to F1 between residues 80 and the C terminus but that there are segments of b2 within that region where packing interactions are quite loose. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis confirmed binding of the modified b mutants to F1-ATPase as well as to F1-δ. Subsequent addition of δ to F1-δ·b2 complex resulted in changes in the ESR spectra, indicating different binding interactions of b to F1 in the presence or absence of δ. The data also suggest that the reconstitution of the ATP synthase is not ordered with respect to these subunits. Additional spectral components observed in b preparations that were spin-labeled between amino acid position 101 and 114 are indicative of either two populations of b subunits with different packing interactions or to helical bending within this region.

The FoF1-ATP synthase, an enzyme found in similar forms in all organisms, catalyzes the formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate, Pi. It uses the energy inherent in a proton gradient across energy-coupling membranes in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria to drive this endergonic chemical reaction. Like all related ATP synthases, the enzyme from Escherichia coli is highly asymmetric and can be divided into two sections. The membrane-associated F1-part contains the nucleotide binding sites and has a subunit stoichiometry α3β3γδϵ. The membrane-integral Fo part contains the proton-translocating unit and consists of subunits ab2c10–12. Proton translocation appears to be catalyzed by a concerted action of subunits a and c and results in a rotary motion of subunits c. Rotary movement of subunits c then drives rotation of the internal stalk of F1, which consists of subunits γ and ϵ. This in turn drives the conformational transitions within the catalytic sites to enable product release from the binding sites (for reviews, see Refs. 1Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 3Yoshida M. Muneyuki E.

Movement of the internal stalk of F1 together with subunits c of Fo relative to the ring formed of subunits α and β implies the necessity of a second, external stalk that functions as a stator to stabilize the FoF1 structure. Convincing evidence has been provided that supports a second stalk consisting of the dimer of subunit b of Fo and the δ subunit of F1 (4Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M.

Subunit a is positioned externally to the ring of c subunits, interacting with c and the dimer of subunits b (9Stalz W.D. Greie J.C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. J. Biol.

It has been discussed that rotation of subunits c, γ, and ϵ generates elastic torque within the two stalks that needs to either be stored or dissipated into conformational energy (13Cherepanov D.A.

The knowledge of the structure of the stator subunits and their protein-protein interaction is, therefore, of great importance to the understanding of the mechanism of energy transduction within the F1Fo-ATP synthase.

Subunit b forms a dimeric structure and contains a highly hydrophobic N-terminal region of 33 amino acids that functions as a membrane anchor (25Walker J.E. Saraste M. Gay J.E. Biochim. Biophys.

The relative length of the b dimer does not seem to be very crucial for function as was shown by mutational deletions and insertions into b (30Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol.

An x-ray crystallographic model of a monomeric version of a 60-residue part of subunit b was recently published (36Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Clearly one of the main functions of the subunit b dimer is to tether the α3β3 subunit ring to the Fo part of the synthase. Recent results from Senior and co-workers (37Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13409-13416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) show that the binding affinity of subunit δ to δ-depleted F1 increases about 500-fold in the presence of the soluble portion of b2, providing additional binding energy of more than 15 kJ/mol. Previous work from our laboratory further showed that connecting F1 to Fo is not the only function of the b dimer. In studies where we specifically spin-labeled the catalytic sites of F1, we demonstrated that binding of subunits b to the modified F1 strongly influenced the conformation of the catalytic sites, rendering a larger population of catalytic nucleotide sites in a more open conformation (38Kersten M.V.

The use of these probes allows the observation of conformational transitions upon protein-protein interactions during catalytic turnover as well as of protein-dynamic events. In the work described here we have introduced single cysteines along the amino acid chain of subunit b of the ATP synthase and chemically modified them with a cysteine-reactive spin-label. In addition to introducing spin labels throughout most of the b chain, we also inserted radicals at every position between residues 101 and 114. Observing the ESR spectra at room temperature in the presence and absence of F1, dependent on the presence and absence of subunit δ, gave further information about protein-protein interactions between F1 and the b2.

Struct. 1975; 3: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with Some Modifications)—10 mg of E. coli F1-ATPase were precipitated using 67% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in 100–150 μl of a buffer consisting of 50 mm glycine (NaOH), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm ATP, and 10% glycerol, pH 9.4. The protein solution was applied to a Sephacryl S-300R column (1.5 × 95 cm) and was eluted with the same buffer. The main fraction eluted after 80 ml and was detected by its UV absorption at 277 nm. The main peak contained δ-depleted F1 (F1-δ) and was concentrated in a Centricon 30 to about 50 μl. 2 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, were added, and the sample was again concentrated to about 60 μl and stored at –80 °C. Mutagenesis and Expression of Subunit b—The single cysteine mutations of subunit b were obtained by standard molecular biology techniques and as described (33McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cysteine mutants of the truncated subunit b dimer were expressed from E. coli strain JM 109. Purification and Chemical Modification of Subunit b—Truncated single cysteine mutations of b2 were purified as described (33McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The protein-containing fractions were assayed for protein content using the Bradford technique (56Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) and were pooled and concentrated to 3–5 ml using Amicon ultraconcentrators equipped with PM-10 membranes. The protein was then aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. For chemical modification the proteins were transferred into a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgSO4, and 300 mm KCl, pH 7.5, by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 2–3 ml using Centricon-10 microconcentrators. The samples were then incubated for 30–60 min at 20 °C with IAAT (4-(2-iodoacetamido)-TEMPO) spin label (100 mm in acetonitrile or Me2SO) at a 10-fold molar excess of IAAT over b dimer. Excess spin label was removed with the same column system as in the previous step. The modified b2 was concentrated by Centricon-10 microconcentrators and stored at –80 °C. Protein purity was verified using SDS gel electrophoresis (57Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). IAAT spin label was purchased from Sigma. The degree of spin-labeling was usually between 25 and 75% depending on the position of the amino acids and the time of incubation. ESR Spectroscopy—ESR spectra were acquired at a Bruker ESP-300 E equipped with a dielectric cavity TE001 or a Bruker EMX 6/1, also equipped with a dielectric cavity TE001. All spectra were acquired in the X-band mode with a peak-to-peak modulation amplitude of 1 G. The receiver gain was adjusted to the protein concentrations and the labeling degrees of the samples. The microwave power was 12.5 milliwatts, and the spectra were acquired at 293 K. The buffer used for ESR spectroscopy was 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgSO4, and 300 mm KCl, pH 7.5. The rotational correlation times were calculated directly from the spectra using the line width of the middle field signal and the signal amplitudes of the low, middle, and high field signals according to Xü et al. (58Xü Y.H. Gietzen K. Galla H.-J. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1983; 5: 154-158Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The formula used was, τR=0.6×19−9ΔB0((ho/h+1)1/2+(ho/h−1)1/2−2) where ΔB0 is the reciprocal line width (1/T2) of the middle field signal. Routine Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (56Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using defatted bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science) as standard. ATP hydrolysis was assayed at 30 °C and pH 8.0 with 2–3 μg of enzyme as described by Wise et al. (59Wise J.G. Duncan T.M. Latchney L.R. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The production of inorganic phosphate was detected by the method of Taussky and Shorr (60Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was routinely assayed using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (57Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was accomplished by running a non-denaturing PAGE according to Cox et al. (61Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Fayle D.R.H. Gibson F. Radik J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 287-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) upon incubation of the spin-labeled b mutants with F1 in the presence or absence of subunit δ. The corresponding lanes were cut out and loaded onto a 10% SDS gel and fixed with melted agarose (1%) or SDS gel, sample buffer was added, and the gel was run according to Laemmli (57Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Site-specific Spin-labeling of b2—We have investigated the interactions of 33 single cysteine mutations of a truncated, water-soluble version of the subunit b, b24–156, of the FoF1-ATP synthase with respect to their interaction with the soluble F1-ATPase. 20 of the single cysteine mutations in subunits b were more or less evenly distributed between the N-terminal end of b24–156 (oriented close to the membrane in the ATP synthase) and the C terminus (at the top of the F1 structure). The engineered cysteine residues in b were modified with a cysteine reactive spin label, iodoacetamide-TEMPO (IAAT). The labeling efficiencies we obtained were between 25 and 75% and depended on the relative position of the modified amino acid. We were, however, always able to obtain sufficient labeling to perform the ESR experiments. The ESR spectra of 20 of the spin-labeled b subunits are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, left panel. All of the spectra show a significant decrease in the high field signal amplitude, indicative of lower mobility of the radical when compared with unreacted IAAT (data not shown). The relatively sharp overall signals, however, suggest that the radical was attached to a macromolecule in a manner that retained a rather high degree of rotational mobility. The high field to middle field ratios of the spectra were between 0.6 and about 0.2, where the larger ratio indicates higher mobility of the spin probe (the high field to middle field ratio of unreacted IAAT is almost equal to 1). Because of the high concentrations of b subunits employed in the ESR experiments (usually between 10 and 100 μm), it can be assumed that the b subunits were present as dimers in our experimental set-up. The KD for b dimerization was determined to be about 2 μm (62Diez M. Börsch M. Zimmermann B. Turina P. Dunn S.D. Gräber P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1054-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interaction of Spin-labeled Subunit b with δ-Depleted F1— The addition of the spin-labeled b dimer to F1-ATPase that had been depleted of its δ subunit did not result in significant differences in the overall shape of the spectra or in variations in the high field to middle field ratio; see Fig. 1, A and B, middle panel. We initially interpreted these results as supportive of earlier publications that presented evidence that binding of b to F1 (or F1 to Fo) was conferred by and dependent on the presence of subunit δ (4Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 63Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4020-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test this potential interpretation, we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, where the first dimension consisted of a non-denaturing PAGE (61Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Fayle D.R.H. Gibson F. Radik J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 287-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the second dimension was a denaturing SDS-PAGE (57Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the second dimension gels (denaturing conditions) of spin-labeled mutants bA107C and bI126C in complex with F1-δ (lanes 1 and 3). The traces are compared with the spin-labeled mutants bA107C and bI126C in complex with the whole five-subunit F1 (lanes 2 and 4, Fig. 2). The legends on the side of the gels identify the corresponding subunits. The fact that the water-soluble, truncated subunit b co-migrated with δ-depleted F1 under non-denaturing conditions strongly suggests that complex formation between F1-δ and b2 had occurred. In control experiments we showed that b2 migrated differently from the b-F1 complex on the non-denaturing gel in the absence of F1 or when b2 was added in super-stoichiometric amounts over F1; see also lane 4 of Fig. 2. The presence of subunits b was further confirmed by Western blot analysis of the second dimension gel (data not shown). Interaction of b2 with F1-ATPase—When the spin-labeled b dimers were incubated with the whole F1-ATPase, differences in the ESR spectra of the labeled b2 in the absence and presence of F1 became obvious at amino acid positions 62 and 84 and especially toward the C-terminal region (compare Fig. 1, A and B, right panel to left panel). The spectra in presence of F1 are considerably broader, which is especially noticeable in the pronounced decrease of the high field signal amplitude (right panel) when compared with the spectra of b2 in the absence of F1 (left panel). The data clearly localize tighter packing interactions between F1 and b2 in the upper, C-terminal half of the b-subunit. The results become clearer when the rotational correlation times of the radicals in the presence or absence of F1 and F1-δ are compared with the b dimer alone. In Fig. 3A the rotational correlation times calculated from the corresponding ESR spectra are compared for b2 (front), b2 in complex with δ-depleted F1 (middle), and b2 in complex with F1 (back). Although no significant difference between b2 alone and in complex with δ-depleted F1 was observed, a significant increase in the rotational correlation times was prominent for b2 in complex with whole F1 from about amino acid position 84 and higher (toward the C terminus), indicative of a tight protein-protein binding interaction occurring in this region. The addition of isolated subunit δ to δ-depleted F1-ATPase in complex with spin-labeled b24–156 resulted in ESR spectra identical to those obtained when labeled b24–156 was added to the whole δ-containing F1. Fig. 4 shows a corresponding ESR experiment where isolated subunit δ was added (spectrum B) to spin-labeled bA130C in complex with δ-depleted F1 (spectrum A). Spectrum C results when this same spin-labeled bA130C is incubated with whole, δ-containing F1. The differences in the spectral shape of the ESR spectra of spin-labeled bA130C bound to δ-depleted and δ-replete F1 suggest that the binding interactions between b and δ-depleted F1 differ from those in the whole complex. The results also suggest that b2 and δ do not bind in a strictly ordered process. Alternatively, they may suggest that the interaction of b2 and δ with F1 is rather dynamic. Site-specific Spin-labeling of b Positions 101–114 —The spectra that result from a spin-labeled cysteine at amino acid position 109 indicated further interesting characteristics. In addition to the three typical, rather sharp signals that we observed for most of the amino acid positions and that are shown in Fig. 1 A and B, a second set of much broader signals can be seen in the ESR spectra for spin-labeled residue 109. These signals indicate at least one further spectral component that likely stems from a population of spin labels that is significantly more motion-restricted than the population of spin labels that give rise to the three sharp lines observed for the other mutations. The primary sequence of the amino acid stretch between position 100 and about 120 shows an unusually high content of charged amino acids. To further investigate this specific region of subunit b, we mutated every amino acid between residue 101 a"

In maintaining homeostasis, endothelial cells respond and adapt to changes in oxidative stress that prevail in the circulation. Endothelial cells are also the target of many oxidative stress-based vascular therapies. The objectives of this study were to determine whether endothelial cells adapt to oxidative stress induced upon the photosensitization of WST11 (a water-soluble Pd-bacteriochlorophyll derivative being developed as a photodynamic agent) and to study possible cellular mechanisms involved. The hallmark of WST11-based photodynamic therapy is the in situ generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species causing vascular shutdown, hypoxia, and tumor eradication. Here we demonstrated that photodynamic therapy also induces adaptive responses and tolerance following a sublethal preconditioning of endothelial cells with the same (homologous) or different (heterologous) stressor. A link among p38 MAPK activity, expression of hsp70 and hsp27, and homologous adaptation to reactive oxygen species induced by photosensitized WST11 was established. In addition to characterization of some key proteins involved, our observations provide a beneficial new working tool for the studies of mechanisms involved in oxidative stress and adaptation using light-controlled photosensitization."

Ung family UDGs remove uracil residues from DNA that arise from misincorporation of dUMP in place of dTMP during DNA replication or from deamination of existing cytosine residues in DNA, and are active on singleas well as double-stranded DNA (1Lindahl T.

The temporal sequence of events associated with uracil excision was postulated to be: 1) UDG binds, kinks, and compresses the duplex DNA backbone via the action of the 4 Pro-Ser loop and the Gly-Ser loop while scanning the minor groove for a uracil residue; 2) upon locating the uracil target in DNA, UDG extracts the uracil base from the DNA helix and displaces the helical space of the flipped-out uracil residue by the insertion of a conserved leucine side chain into the minor groove of the DNA; and 3) the flipped-out uracil base is captured and stabilized by the UDG active center, where the glycosylic bond is cleaved (7Wong I.

As illustrated in Fig. 1B, the ϵN of Arg276 participates in water-bridged hydrogen bonds with the N3 of adenine and the carbonyl group of Leu272. Also, the ηN of the Arg276 guanidinium side chain is shown as interacting with the dCMP 5′ phosphate, as stated by Slupphaug et al. (17Slupphaug G. Mol C.D. Kavli B. Arvai A.S. Krokan H.E.

However, the precise role of the Arg276 residue in DNA binding and uracil recognition has not been studied, nor has the role of Arg276 in the UNG* processive search mechanism been investigated.In this study, PCR-based codon-specific random mutagenesis was performed on the UNG* gene and 18 R276X mutants were isolated. The mutant proteins were overproduced, purified, and characterized with respect to inhibition by Ugi, catalytic efficiency, DNA binding/base flipping, UV cross-linking to single-stranded DNA, and enzyme processivity using a polymeric uracil-containing [32P]DNA substrate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chloramphenicol and kanamycin were purchased from Sigma, and ampicillin was from Fisher.

Weiss (Emory University) and E. coli JM105 and phage P1vira were provided by W. Ream (Oregon State University). E. coli JM109 was purchased from Stratagene, and E. coli BLR from Novagen. Using E. coli BW1067 as the donor strain and JM105 as recipient, JM105 (ung::kan), renamed as CY10, was created using standard phage P1 transduction methods as described by Miller (24Miller J.H.

E. coli CY10rec and CY11 were transformed with pRP (Cmr) that contained the arginine AGA/AGG tRNA and proline CCC tRNA genes (Stratagene).Preparation of Competent Cells—Terrific Broth (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) (50 ml) containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) was inoculated with an E. coli CY10rec/pRP colony and incubated with shaking (250 rpm) overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested in early log phase (A600 nm = 0.4), incubated on ice for 10 min, harvested by centrifugation, and processed according to the standard protocol of the Z-Competent Transformation Kit (Zymo Research). Aliquots (100 μl) of the competent cell preparation were stored at -80 °C.Construction of Plasmids for Overproduction of Human UNG* and UNG—The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the core catalytic domain of human uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG*) was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (100 μl) containing pUNG15 as template (0.5 μg), primers (1 μm each) RI: 5′-GCGAATTCTTTGGAGAGAGCTGGAAG-3′, and H3: 5′-GCAAGCTTTCACAGCTCCTTCCAGTC-3′, as forward and reverse primers, respectively, 1× ThermoPol (New England Biolabs) buffer, 200 μm each dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, and 2 units of Deep Vent DNA polymerase. Following digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, the UNG* fragment (700 bp) was gel-purified and ligated to pTrc99A DNA that was similarly digested and purified. E. coli CY10rec/pRP was then transformed with the ligation mixture and plated on medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A His6-tagged UNG* construct (named UNG in this report) was generated by PCR using UNG*/pTrc99A as a template, the forward primer 5′-GCGAATTCCATCACCATCACCATCACTTTGGAGAGAGCTGGAAG-3′, and the H3 reverse primer as described above. The UNG gene construct was ligated into pTrc99A as described for UNG*, and subsequently subcloned into pET-22b at NdeI and HindIII sites. DNA sequence analysis verified that the nucleotide sequence of the UNG* and UNG constructs was identical to that reported by Slupphaug et al. (16Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Codon-specific Oligonucleotide-directed Random Mutagenesis— Codon-specific PCR-based random mutagenesis of the UNG Arg276 (AGA) codon was carried out following the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene). Primers, 5′-CTTTGTCAGTGTATNNNGGGTTCTTTGGATG-3′ (FP-31-mer) and 5′-CATCCAAAGAACCCNNNATACACTGACAAAGG-3′ (RP-32-mer), were synthesized that contained an equal mixture of the four phosphoramidite nucleoside monomers (NNN) at the AGA codon corresponding to Arg276. PCR mixtures (50 μl) contained 50 ng of UNG/pET-22b DNA template, 14 pmol each of the forward (FP-31-mer) and reverse (RP-32-mer) primers, 250 μm each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, and 1× Pfu reaction buffer (Stratagene). PCR was carried out in a Hybaid PCR Express thermocycler according to the following parameters: 1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 18 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (1 min), 68 °C (12 min), and 72 °C (12 min). The PCR-DNA product was then digested with DpnI (25 units) for 2 h at 37 °C. E. coli CY10rec/pRP Z-competent cells (1–2 × 1010 cells) were thawed on ice, gently mixed with 5 μl of DpnI-digested DNA, incubated on ice for 1 h, spread on pre-warmed 2× YT plates containing 1% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and incubated overnight at 37 °C.Site-specific Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—Site-specific PCR-based mutagenesis of the Arg276 codon of UNG was carried out for five amino acid substitutions as described above except that the forward primers (31-mers) were 5′-CTTTGTCAGTGTATXXXGGGTTCTTTGGATG-3′, where XXX was TGC for cysteine, CAC for histidine, ATG for methionine, GTA for valine, and TGG for tryptophan amino acid substitutions. The corresponding reverse primers (31-mers) were 5′-CATCCAAAGAACCCYYYATACACTGACAAAG-3′, where YYY was GCA, GTG, CAT, TAC, and CCA for the cysteine, histidine, methionine, valine, and tryptophan amino acid substitutions, respectively.Preparation of Cell Extracts for Uracil-DNA Glycosylase Activity Assay—Overnight cultures of ampicillin-resistant E. coli CY10rec/pRP/UNG-pET-22b were used to inoculate (1/25 dilution) flasks containing Terrific Broth (30 ml) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and incubation was continued for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold sonification buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), placed on ice, and subjected to a 2-min sonic pulse (Branson Sonifier 450, microtip, 30% duty cycle, power setting 3). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the supernatant fraction was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Extracts were diluted 1/10 and 1/100 in UDB buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin) and uracil-DNA glycosylase activity was measured as described below. Growth of cultures whose cell extract exhibited lower than average uracil-DNA glycosylase specific activity (<10 units/mg of protein) was continued, and the UNG/pET-22b plasmids were isolated using a Qiagen miniprep kit for DNA sequence analysis.Overproduction and Purification of UNG*—E. coli CY11/pRP/UNG*-pTrc99A was grown at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm) in 1.5 liters of 2× YT medium containing 1% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Upon reaching mid-log phase growth (A600 nm = ∼0.6), the culture temperature was reduced to 30 °C and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm final concentration. Following incubation for 5 h at 30 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 ml of buffer SB (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and 10% (w/v) glycerol), and adjusted to 500 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) prior to storage at -80 °C. The cell suspension was thawed and sonification was conducted as described above. All operations were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant fraction was reserved, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer SB. Both the sonification and centrifugation steps were repeated and the supernatant fractions were combined to produce the cell-free extract (Fraction I). An equal volume of 1.6% streptomycin sulfate was slowly added to the crude extract while mixing on ice for 1 h. Precipitates were then removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant fraction (∼90 ml) was designated Fraction II.Fraction II was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (4.9 cm2 × 20 cm) equilibrated in buffer SB and the column was washed with 150 ml of the equilibration buffer. Fractions containing uracil-DNA glycosylase activity were pooled (Fraction III) and applied to a CM-Sephadex column (4.9 cm2 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer SB. After washing the column with 500 ml of equilibration buffer, a 150-ml linear gradient of 10–400 mm NaCl in buffer SB was applied. The peak of UNG* activity eluted at ∼150 mm NaCl; active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer SB, and designated Fraction IV. Fraction IV was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column (4.9 cm2 × 10 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer SB and eluted with a 150-ml linear gradient of 10–400 mm NaCl in buffer SB. The enzyme activity peak that eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl was pooled and dialyzed against buffer SB (Fraction V). Fraction V was loaded onto a single-stranded DNA-agarose column (19.6 cm2 × 5 cm) equilibrated in buffer SB. The column was washed with 500 ml of equilibration buffer, and a 500-ml linear gradient of 10–800 mm NaCl in buffer SB was applied. Eluted fractions were assayed for UNG* activity, and a single peak of activity was detected at ∼175 mm NaCl. The enzyme was pooled as Fraction VI, dialyzed against buffer SB containing 40 mm NaCl, and applied to a poly(U) column (1.8 cm2 × 3 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing the column with 50 ml of equilibration buffer, the enzyme was eluted using a 50-ml linear gradient of 40–600 mm NaCl in buffer SB. Fractions containing UNG* activity were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and pooled, constituting fraction VII (peak activity eluted at ∼275 mm NaCl). After dialyzing fraction VII against buffer KDP (10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 50 mm KCl, the sample was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (1.6 cm2 × 2 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 50 ml of equilibration buffer and proteins were eluted using a 30 ml of linear gradient of KCl (50–600 mm) in buffer KDP. Uracil-DNA glycosylase activity was eluted as a single symmetrical peak (∼450 mm KCl), pooled, and stored at -80 °C as Fraction VIII.Overproduction and Purification of UNG—E. coli CY10rec/pRP/UNG-pET-22b was grown in 1.0 liter of 2× YT medium containing 1% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C with shaking. When the A600 of the culture reached 0.5, the temperature was reduced to 25 °C and incubation was continued for 20 min before the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm. After incubation for 6 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, 5% (w/v) glycerol) and lysozyme was added to 500 μg/ml prior to storage at -80 °C. The cell suspension was thawed on ice, supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mm, and subjected to sonification as described above. The cell lysate was similarly processed except using buffer A. Following the sonification, the cell lysate (Fraction I) was diluted to a protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml with buffer A and applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (0.8 cm2 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 20 ml of equilibration buffer and step eluted with buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing UNG activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol) constituting Fraction II. Fraction II was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (1.8 cm2 × 1.1 cm) equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer B containing 200 mm NaCl and step eluted with 20 ml of buffer B containing 300 mm NaCl. Fractions containing uracil-DNA glycosylase activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol), and designated Fraction III. Fraction III was applied to a poly(U) column (1.8 cm2 × 1.2 cm) equilibrated in buffer C. After washing the column with 4 ml of buffer C and then with 20 ml of buffer C containing 150 mm NaCl, the enzyme was eluted with 20 ml of buffer C containing 500 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (Fraction IV), and stored at -80 °C. The Arg276 mutant protein preparations were purified using the same procedure.Uracil-DNA Glycosylase Activity Assay—Uracil-DNA glycosylase activity was measured in standard reaction mixtures as previously described by Bennett and Mosbaugh (26Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme preparations were diluted in 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. One unit of uracil-DNA glycosylase is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 nmol of uracil per hour under standard conditions.Nuclease Assay—Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 8–200 ng of wild-type or mutant UNG (Fraction IV), 100 μg/ml acet"
https://openalex.org/W1991583186,"Sequence alignment of cytochrome b of the cytochrome bc1 complex from various sources reveals that bacterial cytochrome b contain an extra fragment at the C terminus. To study the role of this fragment in bacterial cytochrome bc1 complex, Rhodobacter sphaeroides mutants expressing His-tagged cytochrome bc1 complexes with progressive deletion from this fragment (residues 421–445) were generated and characterized. The cytbΔ-(433–445) bc1 complex, in which 13 residues from the C-terminal end of this fragment are deleted, has electron transfer activity, subunit composition, and physical properties similar to those of the complement complex, indicating that this region of the extra fragment is not essential. In contrast, the electron transfer activity, binding of cytochrome b, ISP, and subunit IV to cytochrome c1, redox potentials of cytochromes b and c1 in the cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) mutant complexes, in which 19, 21, or all residues of this fragment are deleted, decrease progressively. EPR spectra of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and the cytochromes b in these three deletion mutant bc1 complexes are also altered; the extent of spectral alteration increases as this extra fragment is shortened. These results indicate that the first 12 residues (residues 421–432) from the N-terminal end of the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b are essential for maintaining structural integrity of the bc1 complex. Sequence alignment of cytochrome b of the cytochrome bc1 complex from various sources reveals that bacterial cytochrome b contain an extra fragment at the C terminus. To study the role of this fragment in bacterial cytochrome bc1 complex, Rhodobacter sphaeroides mutants expressing His-tagged cytochrome bc1 complexes with progressive deletion from this fragment (residues 421–445) were generated and characterized.

EPR spectra of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and the cytochromes b in these three deletion mutant bc1 complexes are also altered; the extent of spectral alteration increases as this extra fragment is shortened. These results indicate that the first 12 residues (residues 421–432) from the N-terminal end of the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b are essential for maintaining structural integrity of the bc1 complex. The cytochrome bc1 complex is an essential energy transduction electron transfer complex in mitochondria and many aerobic and photosynthetic bacteria (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c1 with concomitant translocation of protons across the membrane to generate a membrane potential and proton gradient for ATP synthesis. All the cytochrome bc1 complexes contain three core subunits, cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP), 1The abbreviations used are: ISP, Rieske iron-sulfur protein; cyt, cytochrome; Q0C10BrH2, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinol; [2Fe-2S], Rieske iron-sulfur cluster; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DM, dodecyl-β-d-maltostide; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. which house two b-type hemes (bL and bH), one c-type heme (heme c1), and a high potential [2Fe-2S] cluster, respectively. In addition to these three core subunits, the cytochrome bc1 complex also contains varying numbers (one to eight) of non-redox containing subunits, known as supernumerary subunits (2Yang X.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11962-11970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because the bacterial complexes contain no (or one) supernumerary subunit, it is unlikely that the structures of the core subunits in these complexes are, as suggested for the mitochondrial complex (4Phillips J.D. Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11727-11736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stabilized through interactions between core subunits and their neighboring supernumerary subunits. Perhaps interactions between a part of a core subunit and another part of the same subunit or another core subunit contribute to the stability of a core subunit in the bacterial complex. This speculation finds some support from the fact that core subunits in bacterial complexes are generally bigger than their counterparts in the mitochondrial complex. Sequence alignment of cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and ISP in bacterial complexes with their counterparts in mitochondrial complexes reveals four extra fragments in bacterial cytochrome b and one each in bacterial cytochrome c1 and ISP (5Yu L. Tso S.C. Shenoy S.K. Quinn B.N. Xia D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These extra fragments are modeled into the structure of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides bc1 complex by using coordinates of mitochondrial supernumerary subunits (5Yu L. Tso S.C. Shenoy S.K. Quinn B.N. Xia D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings encouraged us to suggest that these extra fragments may possess mitochondrial supernumerary subunit function in stabilizing the structure of the core subunits in the bacterial complex. This suggestion is further supported by the recent finding that ISP is lost from the R. sphaeroides bc1 complex if the extra fragment of ISP is deleted or substituted with alanine (6Xiao K. Liu X. Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Of course, confirmation of this suggestion will have to wait until the function of extra fragments in cytochrome b and c1 are established. Cytochrome b holds a central role in the cytochrome bc1 complex because it houses two ubiquinone binding sites, Qo and Qi, and two redox centers, heme bL and heme bH. According to the Q-cycle mechanism (7Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), electrons from ubiquinol are bifurcated at the Qo site. The first electron of ubiquinol is transferred through the so-called “high potential” chain consisting of [2Fe-2S] and heme c1. The second electron of ubiquinol is passed through the “low potential” chain consisting of hemes bL and bH. Thus, maintaining the structural stability of cytochrome b in the bc1 complex is crucial for the electron and proton transfer functions of this complex. In the structure model of R. sphaeroides cytochrome bc1 complex (5Yu L. Tso S.C. Shenoy S.K. Quinn B.N. Xia D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the four extra fragments of cytochrome b are located at the N terminus (residues 2 to 12), the connecting loop between helices D and E (residues 232 to 239), the connecting loop between helices E and F (residues 309 to 326), and the C terminus (residues 421–445) (see Fig. 1). We started functional studies of these cytochrome b extra fragments with the one at the C terminus because this extra fragment is in close proximity to subunit IV and ISP. Herein we report generation of R. sphaeroides mutants expressing His-tagged cytochrome bc1 complexes with progressive deletion of the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b. The photosynthetic growth behavior, the bc1 activity, and the amount of cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, ISP, and subunit IV, in the chromatophore membrane and the purified state, of the complement and mutants, were determined and compared. The lability of mutant bc1 complex, in the chromatophore membranes, toward dodecylmaltoside treatment, was investigated. The effect of mutations on EPR spectra of the cytochromes b and ISP and on redox potentials of the cytochromes b and c1, in complement and mutant complexes, is also reported. Materials—Cytochrome c (horse heart, Type III) was from Sigma. N-Dodecyl-β-d-maltostide and N-dodecyl-β-d-glucoside were from Anatrace. Ni-NTA gel and Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit were from Qiagen. Pyocyanine was purchased from Color Your Enzyme, Canada. 2,3-Dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinol (Q0C10BrH2) was prepared in our laboratory as previously reported (8Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4096-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Growth of Bacteria—Escherichia coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. Photosynthetic growth conditions for Rhodobacter sphaeroides were essentially as described previously (9Tian H. Yu L.

The concentrations and antibiotics used were: ampicillin, 125 μg/ml; kanamycin sulfate, 30 μg/ml; tetracycline (10 μg/ml for E. coli, and 1 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides); and trimethoprim (100 μg/ml for E. coli and 30 μg/ml for R. sphaeroides). Generation of R. sphaeroides Strains Expressing the His6-tagged bc1 Complexes with Progressive Deletion of the C-terminal Extra Fragment of Cytochrome b (Residues 421–445)—Mutations were constructed by placing the stop codon (TAA) at various positions of the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b. The QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was used for mutagenesis. A double-stranded plasmid pGEM7Zf(+)-fbcFB was used as a template and forward and reverse primers were used for PCR amplification. The pGEM7Zf(+)-fbcFB plasmid was constructed by ligating the EcoRI-X-baI fragment from pRKDfbcFBCHQ (10Mather M.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) into EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pGEM7Zf(+) plasmid. The primers used were as follows: cytbΔ-(421–445): forward primer, CGAGAAGCCGGTGGCTCCGTAAGCGACCATCGAAGAAG and reverse primer, CTTCTTCGATGGTCGCTTACGGAGCCACCGGCTTCTCG; cytbΔ-(425–445): forward primer, CCGCCCGCGACCATCTAAGAAGACTTCAAC and reverse primer, GTTGAAGTCTTCTTAGATGGTCGCGGGCGG; cytbΔ-(427–445), forward primer, CCCGCGACCATCGAAGAATAATTCAACGCCCACTACTCG and reverse primer, CGAGTAGTGGGCGTTGAATTATTCTTCGATGGTCGCGGG; cytbΔ-(433–445): forward primer, CAACGCCCACTACTAACCGGCGACCGGCGG and reverse primer, CCGCCGGTCGCCGGTTAGTAGTGGGCGTTG. After mutagenesis, a 962-base pair BstEII-XbaI fragment from the pGEM7Zf(+)-fbcFBm plasmid was ligated into BstEII and XbaI sites of the pRKD418/fbcFBKmBXCHQ. plasmid (10Mather M.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Loss of kanamycin resistance was then used to screen for recombinant plasmids containing the mutant cytochrome b gene. The pRKD418/fbcFBmCHQ plasmid in E. coli S17-1 cells was mobilized into R. sphaeroides BC-17 cells by a plate-mating procedure (10Mather M.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of engineered mutations was confirmed twice by DNA sequencing of the 962-base pair BstEII-XbaI fragment before and after photosynthetic growth as previously reported (10Mather M.W. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28668-28675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing and primer synthesis were performed by the Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility at Oklahoma State University. Enzyme Preparations and Activity Assay—Chromatophores were prepared from frozen cell paste, and cytochrome bc1 complexes with a His6 tag placed at the C terminus of cytochrome c1 were purified from chromatophores as previously reported (11Tian H. Yu L. Mather M.W. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To assay the cytochrome bc1 complex activity, chromatophores or purified cytochrome bc1 complexes were diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.01% N-dodecyl-β-d-maltostide (DM) to a final concentration for cytochrome b of 3 μm, unless otherwise specified. Appropriate amounts of the diluted samples were added to 1 ml of assay mixture containing 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm cytochrome c, and 25 μm Q0C10BrH2. Activity was determined by measuring the reduction of cytochrome c (the increase of absorbance at 550 nm) in a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC spectrophotometer at 23 °C, using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 for calculation. The nonenzymatic oxidation of Q0C10BrH2, determined under the same conditions, in the absence of enzyme, was subtracted. Although the chemical properties of Q0C10BrH2 are comparable with those of Q0C10H2, it is a better substrate for the cytochrome bc1 complex (8Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4096-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Specific activity is defined in the legend to Fig. 3. Potentiometric Titrations of the Cytochromes b and c1 in Complement and Mutant Cytochrome bc1 Complexes—Redox titrations of cytochromes b and c1 in complement and mutant bc1 complexes were essentially according to the previously published method (12Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 13Guner S. Robertson D.E. Yu L. Qiu Z.H. Yu C.A. Knaff D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 3-ml aliquots of the bc1 complex (2 μm cytochrome b or 2 μm cytochrome c1) in 0.1 m Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 μm phenazine methosulfate (midpoint redox potential (Em) +80 mV), 20 μm phenazine ethosulfate (Em +55 mV), 20 μm phenazine (Em -120 mV), 20 μm pyocyanine (Em -34 mV), 25 μm 1,4-benzoquinone (Em +293 mV), 25 μm 1,2-naphthoquinone (Em +143 mV), 25 μm 1,4-naphthoquinone (Em +36 mV), 50 μm duroquineone (Em +5 mV), 70 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (Em +260 mV), and 15 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Em -145 mV), were used. Reductive titrations were carried out by addition of sodium dithionite solution to the ferricyanide-oxidized sample; oxidative titrations were carried out by addition of ferricyanide solution to the dithionite-reduced sample. At indicated Eh values during the redox titration absorption spectra, from 600 to 500 nm were taken with a Shimadzu model UV-2100 spectrophotometer. The optical density at 562 nm, minus that at 575 nm, is used for cytochrome b and that at 552 minus 540 nm for cytochrome c1. The midpoint potentials of cytochrome bL and bH were calculated by fitting the redox titration data, obtained for cytochrome b, the Nernst equation for a one-electron carrier (n = 1) with two components using Kaleidagraph, and that of cytochrome c1 was fitted for a one-electron carrier with one component. Other Biochemical and Biophysical Techniques—The contents of cytochrome b (14Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and cytochrome c1 (15Yu L. Dong J.H. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were determined according to published methods. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean® 3 Cell. Western blotting used rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against R. sphaeroides ISP and subunit IV. The polypeptides separated in the SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. Protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as the second antibody. EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker EMX spectrometer, equipped with a liquid helium flow cryostat, at 7 K. Instrument settings are detailed in the legends of relevant figures. The mass spectrometry determination of molecular weights of cytochrome b in the complement and mutant bc1 complexes was performed with an Applied Biosystems DE-PRO MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer operated in delayed-extraction positive-ion liner mode according to the method of Ghaim et al. (17Ghaim J.B. Tsatsos P.H. Katsonouri A. Mitchell D.M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with modifications. Samples (∼30 μl) were mixed with 6 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid, chilled for 5 min on ice, centrifuged, and the precipitate was rinsed briefly with 95% ethanol to remove salts. The resulting pellet was redissolved in 30 μl of 99% formic acid and a 1:1 dilution with 99% formic acid to a final volume of 60 μl, which gave the best crystals and signal. As matrix for MALDI-TOF analyses, 1% of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 1% 5-methoxysalicilic acid in 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were mixed 9:1 (v/v). This matrix solution was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with protein samples. Matrix and sample were spotted onto the sample plate, and were co-crystallized by evaporation in a covered Petri dish under ambient temperature and pressure (17Ghaim J.B. Tsatsos P.H. Katsonouri A. Mitchell D.M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Comparison of Electron Transfer Activity, Subunit Composition, and Detergent Lability of Cytochrome bc1 Complexes in Chromatophore Membranes from Complement and C-terminal Truncated Cytochrome b Mutants—The C-terminal extra fragment of R. sphaeroides cytochrome b corresponds to residues 421–445 with a sequence of PATIEEDFNAHYSPATGGTKTVVAE (see Fig. 2). To probe the role of this fragment, R. sphaeroides mutants with progressive deletion of amino acid residues from the C terminus of cytochrome b were generated and characterized. These are: cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) with deletion of 13, 19, 21, and all residues from this C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b, respectively. When these four C-terminal-truncated cytochrome b mutants were subjected to anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions, all of them grew at a rate comparable with that of the complement cells. Chromatophores prepared from these mutant cells have the content and absorption spectral properties of cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 + c2 similar to those in the complement chromatophores (data not shown). The amounts of ISP and subunit IV in these mutant chromatophores, determined by Western blotting using antibodies against R. sphaeroides ISP and subunit IV, respectively, are also comparable with those in complement chromatophores. These results indicate that the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b is not required for assembly of the cytochrome bc1 complex protein subunits (cytochromes b and c1, ISP, and subunit IV) into the chromatophore membrane. Fig. 3A shows the effect of DM concentration on bc1 activity in the complement and four mutant chromatophores. When chromatophores from the complement and four mutants, at a cytochrome b concentration of 25 μm, were treated with varying concentrations of DM (up to 0.64 mg of DM per nmol of cytochrome b), bc1 activities in all preparations increase at lower and decrease at higher detergent concentrations. However, the detergent concentrations required for maximum activity increasing and decreasing differ significantly. Also, the activity increase or decrease in a given detergent concentration varies greatly among these chromatophores. Mutant chromatophores of cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445) and cytbΔ-(421–445), without DM treatment, have, respectively, 100, 82, 70, and 62% of the bc1 activity found in untreated complement chromatophores. Maximum bc1 activities are obtained for mutant chromatophores of cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) at DM concentrations of 0.35, 0.25, 0.15, and 0.08 mg/nmol of cytochrome b, respectively. These correspond, respectively, to 95, 83, 77, and 56% of maximum bc1 activity of the complement chromatophores treated with 0.35 mg of DM per nmol of cytochrome b (see Fig. 3A). Thus the bc1 complexes with decreasing lengths of the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b require decreasing amounts of DM to obtain maximum activity. Furthermore, maximum bc1 activity in the chromatophore membrane decreases as the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b shortens. Whereas the complement chromatophores treated with 0.35 mg of DM/nmol of cytochrome b shows maximum bc1 activity, mutant chromatophores of cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) treated with the same concentration of DM lost, respectively, 0, 22, 35, and 81% of their maximum bc1 activity, indicating that the lability of the bc1 complex toward detergent treatment increases as the size of the C-terminal extra fragment decreases. The increase in lability of the bc1 complex to detergent treatment should be indicative of a decrease in structural stability of the complex. Thus, the structural stability of the bc1 complex decreases as the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b decreases. Residues 433–445 make little contribution to the structural stability of the bc1 complex, as the electron transfer activity and detergent lability of the cytbΔ-(433–445) bc1 are similar to those of the complement complex. It should be noted that the effectiveness of DM in solubilizing the bc1 complex from these deletion mutant chromatophores is comparable with that for the complement chromatophores (Fig. 3B). When complement and mutant chromatophores of cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) treated with various concentrations of DM were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min, the contents of cytochrome b, determined spectrophotometrically (see Fig. 3B), ISP, and subunit IV determined by Western blotting (data not shown), in the supernatant fractions, at a given DM concentration, are about the same. This suggests that the loss of bc1 activity in the cytbΔ-(421–445) mutant chromatophores treated with 0.35 mg of DM/nmol of cytochrome b is not because of a decrease of binding affinity of the bc1 complex to the membrane, but to a lesser structural integrity of the mutant complex. Effect of the C-terminal Extra Fragment of Cytochrome b on the Binding of Cytochrome b, ISP, and Subunit IV to Cytochrome c1—To further confirm that the structural integrity of the bc1 complex decreases as the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b decreases, binding affinities of protein subunits in mutant complexes of cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) were determined and compared with those of the complement complex. Because the expressed R. sphaeroides bc1 complex has a His6 tag at the C terminus of cytochrome c1, one can determine binding affinities of cytochrome b, ISP, and subunit IV to cytochrome c1 in complement and mutant complexes using a Ni-NTA column. When various chromatophores were treated with 1.2% DM and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 90 min, about 80% of cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, ISP, and subunit IV in the complement and mutant chromatophores was recovered in the supernatant fractions. When these supernatant fractions were applied to Ni-NTA columns, most of cytochrome c1 in all of these supernatant fractions were absorbed on the Ni-NTA gel, and were recovered in column eluates using an eluting buffer containing 200 mm histidine. This is as expected because the His6 tag is placed at the C terminus of cytochrome c1. The b/c1 ratios in column eluates of the complement and mutants cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) are 1.51, 1.45, 0.81, 0.72, and 0.29, respectively (see Table I), indicating that the binding affinity of cytochrome b to cytochrome c1 decreases as the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b shortens. The amount of mutant cytochrome b of cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) associated with cytochrome c1, as compared with the amount of wild-type cytochrome b associated with cytochrome c1, decreases by 4, 46, 52, and 80%, respectively.Table ICharacterization of mutants having deletions on the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome bStrainsPsaPs, photosynthetic growthCytochrome bc1 complexChromatophorePurified complexSpecific activitybEnzyme activity is expressed as micromole of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol of cytochrome bCyt b/cyt c1 + c2Subunit compositionSpecific activitybEnzyme activity is expressed as micromole of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol of cytochrome bCyt b/cyt c1Subunit compositionComplement+++c+++ indicates the cells can grow photosynthetically and the growth rate was essentially the same as that of the complement cells2.241.26FBCQdFBCQ indicates gene products of the fbcF (ISP) (F), fbcB(cytochrome b) (B), fbcC (cytochrome c1) (C), and fbcQ (subunit IV) (Q), respectively3.201.51FBCQcytbΔ–(433–45)+++2.231.30FBCQ2.911.45FBCQcytbΔ–(427–45)+++1.871.39FBCQ2.880.81FBCQcytbΔ–(425–45)+++1.521.35FBCQ1.690.72FBCQcytbΔ–(421–45)+++1.321.23FBCQ00.29FBa Ps, photosynthetic growthb Enzyme activity is expressed as micromole of cytochrome c reduced/min/nmol of cytochrome bc +++ indicates the cells can grow photosynthetically and the growth rate was essentially the same as that of the complement cellsd FBCQ indicates gene products of the fbcF (ISP) (F), fbcB(cytochrome b) (B), fbcC (cytochrome c1) (C), and fbcQ (subunit IV) (Q), respectively Open table in a new tab Fig. 4 shows Western blot analysis of ISP and subunit IV recovered in the Ni-NTA column eluate (purified bc1 complex) and effluent fractions from DM-solubilized complement and mutant chromatophores. The purified cytbΔ-(421–445) mutant complex contains no detectable ISP or subunit IV, however, purified mutant complexes of cytbΔ-(425–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), and cytbΔ-(433–445) have 50, 80, and 100%, respectively, of the amount of ISP or subunit IV found in the complement complex (see Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with the presence of increasing amounts of ISP and subunit IV in the Ni-NTA column effluents of cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) (see Fig. 4B). It should be noted that subunit IV of the bc1 complex produced by R. sphaeroides BC-17 cells carrying the pRKD418/fbcFBCQ plasmid includes chromosomal and plasmid copies, whereas cytochrome b, c1, and ISP have only the plasmid copy. These results indicate that the binding affinities of ISP and subunit IV to the complex are affected by the first 12 residues (residues 421–432) at the N-terminal end of the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b; binding affinity decreases as the fragment size decreases. The finding that the binding of ISP and subunit IV to cytochrome c1 are affected by the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b is rather surprising, because they are not in the same subunit as cytochrome b. Perhaps interactions between the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b and the N-terminal portion of ISP or subunit IV, located on the cytoplasmic side of the chromatophore membrane, are required for maintaining the structures of ISP and subunit IV for binding to cytochrome c1. Thus, the mutations on the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b induce conformational changes on ISP and subunit IV that weaken their binding affinities for cytochrome c1. Alternatively, the binding of ISP or subunit IV to cytochrome c1 is through cytochrome b and mutation of the extra fragment not only decreases the binding affinity of cytochrome b to cytochrome c1, but also to ISP and subunit IV. The Abnormality of Electrophoretic Mobilities of C-terminal Truncated Cytochrome b Mutants—Fig. 5 shows electrophoretic mobility of wild-type and C-terminal-truncated cytochrome b in separation gels containing two concentrations of acrylamide (T) and bisacrylamide (C). In a separating gel having T = 12.5% and C = 3%, a system used routinely for SDS-PAGE analysis of the R. sphaeroides bc1 complex, wild-type and mutant bc1 complexes of cytochrome b of cytbΔ-(433–445), cytbΔ-(427–445), cytbΔ-(425–445), and cytbΔ-(421–445) have Rf values of 16.2, 17.5, 18.5, 19, and 19 mm, respectively (see Fig. 5A). As expected, the RF values of cytochrome c1, ISP, and subunit IV in mutant bc1 complexes are the same as those in the wild-type complex, because shortening the C-terminal extra fragment of cytochrome b should not affect the molecular masses of other subunits in the complex. The Rf values of cytochrome b obtained in these mutant complexes are larger than the calculated values, as the molecular mass of cytochrome b is decreased by 1200, 1947, 2206, 2588, respectively, from that of wild-type cytochrome b. It should be noted that the larger than calculated Rf values observed are not because of reduction of the molecular mass of mutant b proteins by proteolytic enzyme digestion, because the molecular mass of cytochrome b in the cytbΔ-(421–445) mutant complex, determined by MALDI-TOF mass analysis, is 47,264, which corresponds to the calculated value. To further confirm that C-terminal-truncated cytochrome b have abnormal electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE, purified wild-type and mutant cytochrome bc1 complexes were subjected to"
