https://openalex.org/W2016146035,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates macrophages to release inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). LPS-induced TNF suppresses scavenger receptor functions in macrophages (van Lenten, B. J., and Fogelman, A. M. (1992) J. Immunol. 148, 112–116), which is regulated by TNF-mediated protein kinases (Hsu, H. Y., and Twu, Y. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 41035–41048). To examine the molecular mechanism for LPS induction of IL-1 in macrophages, we demonstrated that LPS quickly stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and 3 h later induced prointerleukin-1β (pro-IL-1, precursor of IL-1) production and IL-1 secretion. LPS stimulated pro-IL-1 message/protein between 3 and 10 h; however, there was a 40% reduction of pro-IL-1 in preincubation of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Moreover, NAC moderated LPS-induced IL-1 secretion partially via interleukin 1-converting enzyme. The maximal activity of LPS-induced ERK, JNK, and p38 was 12- (30 min), 5- (30 min), and 16-fold (15 min), respectively. In contrast, NAC reduced ERK activity to 60% and decreased p38 activity to the basal level, but JNK activity was induced 2-fold. Furthermore, the pharmacological antagonists LY294002, SB203580, curcumin, calphostin C, and PD98059 revealed the diverse roles of LPS-mediated protein kinases in pro-IL-1. On the other hand, NAC and diphenyleneiodonium chloride partially inhibited LPS-induced Rac activity and protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), indicating that LPS-mediated ROS and NADPH oxidase correspond to Rac activation and IL-1 expression. Our findings establish for the first time that LPS-mediated PTK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Rac/p38 pathways play a more important role than pathways of PTK/PKC/MEK/ERK and of PTK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Rac/JNK in the regulation of pro-IL-1/IL-1. The findings also further elucidate the critical role of LPS-mediated ROS in signal transduction pathways. Our results suggest that understanding LPS-transduced signals in IL-1 induction upon the antibacterial action of macrophages should provide a therapeutic strategy for aberrant inflammatory responses leading to severe cellular injury or concurrent multiorgan septic damage."

Although Wnts act to stabilize β-catenin levels in the cytosol and nucleus, a multiprotein complex containing adenomatous polyposis coli, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and Axin1 or its homolog Axin2/Axil/conductin promotes β-catenin phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. We found that the rat Axil gene was strongly induced upon neoplastic transformation of RK3E cells by mutant β-catenin or γ-catenin or after ligand-induced activation of a β-catenin-estrogen receptor fusion protein. Expression of Wnt1 in murine breast epithelial cells activated the conductin gene, and human cancers with defective β-catenin regulation had elevated AXIN2 gene and protein expression. Expression ofAXIN2/Axil was strongly repressed in cancer cells by restoration of wild type adenomatous polyposis coli function or expression of a dominant negative form of T cell factor (TCF)-4. TCF binding sites in the AXIN2 promoter played a key role in the ability of β-catenin to activate AXIN2 transcription. In contrast to AXIN2/Axil, expression of human or rat Axin1 homologs was nominally affected by β-catenin-TCF. Because Axin2 can inhibit β-catenin abundance and function, the data implicate AXIN2 in a negative feedback pathway regulating Wnt signaling. Additionally, although Axin1 and Axin2 have been thought to have comparable functions, the observation that Wnt pathway activation elevates AXIN2 but not AXIN1 expression suggests that there may be potentially significant functional differences between the two proteins.

In brief, Wnts activate transmembrane frizzled receptors and the disheveled protein, leading to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)1 activity. Typically, GSK3β, when active and present in a multiprotein complex containing the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor and Axin1 and/or Axin2 (also known as Axil or conductin), can phosphorylate specific serine and/or threonine residues near the β-catenin N terminus (6Polakis P.

Wnt pathway activation inhibits GSK3β activity, causing β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it can bind to members of the TCF (T cell factor)/LEF (lymphoid enhancer family) transcription factor family (referred to hereafter collectively as TCFs) (1Cadigan K.M.

In the nucleus, TCFs mediate sequence-specific DNA binding, and β-catenin, via its interaction with TCFs, affects transcription of genes with TCF binding sites in their regulatory regions. Thus far, it appears that β-catenin generally activates TCF-regulated genes and that β-catenin-TCF target genes include c-myc, cyclin D1 (CCND1), matrilysin/MMP-7, Tcf-1, PPARδ, PEA3, ENC1, c-ETS2, c-myb, and c-kit (15He T.C.

Defects that interfere with β-catenin regulation have been reported in various human cancers. In a subset of many different cancer types, mutations at or near the serine and threonine residues in the β-catenin N-terminal domain alter its ability to be phosphorylated by GSK3β. In other cancers, particularly colorectal cancers, inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor gene appears to be the predominant mechanism leading to β-catenin deregulation (4Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 5Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

In yet other cancers, mutations in the genes encoding one of the two Axin proteins have been reported, including the AXIN1gene in hepatocellular carcinomas and medulloblastomas (25Satoh S. Daigo Y.

Krisnadath K.K. Halling K.C. Cunningham J.M. Boardman L.A. Qian C. Christensen E. Schmidt S.S. Roche P.C. Smith D.I. Thibodeau S.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 146-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). A prime consequence of the mutational defects in β-catenin regulation is constitutive activation of downstream β-catenin-TCF-regulated target genes, particularly genes with major effects on cell growth regulation and tumorigenesis, such as c-myc, CCND1, and MMP-7 (4Bienz M. Clevers H. Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar,5Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to understand better the effects of Wnt-β-catenin-TCF pathway activation in cancer cells, we undertook studies to identify novel β-catenin-TCF-regulated target genes. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify transcripts with elevated expression after neoplastic transformation of the rat E1A-immortalized RK3E cell line by mutant β-catenin or γ-catenin or after ligand-induced activation of a β-catenin-estrogen receptor (ER) fusion protein. We found that expression of the rat Axil gene was strongly induced in the RK3E cell line in all three of these settings. Further studies established that the mouse and human homologs of Axil, known as conductin and AXIN2, respectively, were consistently induced by Wnt pathway activation. TCF proteins played a key role in AXIN2 induction. Unlike AXIN2, AXIN1 was not found to be a β-catenin-TCF-regulated gene. Prior studies have shown that the Axin1 and Axin2 proteins have roughly 45% amino acid identity and essentially identical functions in regulating β-catenin levels (7Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W.

In addition to showing thatAXIN2 functions in a feedback repressor pathway regulating Wnt signaling, our findings on the differential effects of Wnt pathway activation on AXIN2 versus AXIN1expression suggest that potentially significant functional differences may exist between their protein products. Expression vectors for wild type and mutant (codon 33 substitution of tyrosine for serine, S33Y) forms of β-catenin and dominant negative Tcf-4 (Tcf-4ΔN31) have been described previously (29Kolligs F.T., Hu, G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pBabe-S33Y-ER-puro expression vector encoding a chimeric β-catenin-ER protein, in which full-length S33Y β-catenin sequences are fused in-frame to a mutated ER ligand binding domain, was generated by cloning the S33Y β-catenin cDNA into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the retroviral plasmid pBabe-puro (30Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The reporter constructs pTOPFLASH, which contains three copies of an optimal TCF binding motif (CCTTTGATC), and pFOPFLASH, which contains three copies of a mutant motif (CCTTTGGCC), have been described previously (31Korinek V.

Plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences) contains a functional lacZ gene cloned downstream from a cytomegalovirus early region promoter-enhancer element. The Axin2pcDNA3.1mycHis(−)B expression vector was a kind gift from Wanguo Liu (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) (27Liu W. Dong X. Mai M. Seelan R.S. Taniguchi K. Krisnadath K.K. Halling K.C.

DNA fragments containing human AXIN2 promoter sequences cloned upstream from a luciferase reporter gene were obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA, using primers generated from AXIN2 sequences in GenBank (accession no. AC00485). AXIN2 genomic DNA fragments were subcloned upstream from the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3Basic reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI), using the KpnI and NheI sites. The reporter gene vector AX2(1078WT)/Luc contains AXIN2 sequences from −1078 to +5 relative to the presumed transcription start site, and the vector AX2(181WT)/Luc contains AXIN2 sequences from −181 to +5. The forward primer for generating the AX(1078WT)/Luc vector was 5′-CCCGTTCAGCCCCTACCCTTCTTAG-3′, and the forward primer for the AX(181WT)/Luc vector was 5′-CAGCGCCTGATACTTAGATGAGC-3′; the reverse primer for generating both vectors was 5′-CAAGTCAGCAGGGGCTCATCTG-3′. Mutations in a presumptive TCF DNA binding site at bp −108 to −102 were obtained in vitro via a standard PCR-based mutagenesis strategy, generating the reporter gene vectors AX2(1078Mut)/Luc and AX2/(181Mut)/Luc. All plasmid sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing of double-stranded DNA templates. All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), with the exception of the following: the amphotropic Phoenix packaging cell line, which was obtained from G. Nolan (Stanford University School of Medicine); the RAC311, RAC311/Wnt-1, RAC311/Wnt-1 9, C57/Vect, and C57/Wnt-1 lines (32Howe L. Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1572-1577PubMed Google Scholar), all of which were obtained from L. Howe (Weill Medical College of Cornell University); Gli-transformed RK3E cells (33Luoro I.D. McKie-Bell P. Gosnell H. Brindley B.C. Bucy R.P. Ruppert J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 503-516PubMed Google Scholar), which were obtained from J. M.

All cells were grown in 5% CO2 with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin, unless otherwise stated. HEK293, Phoenix, parental RK3E cells, RK3E cells neoplastically transformed by K-ras, Gli, β-catenin, and γ-catenin (29Kolligs F.T., Hu, G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1319-1331PubMed Google Scholar), RAC311 lines, C57 lines, and all human colon cancer lines, except for HT29, LS174T, RKO, and SW48 cells, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). LS174T cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium α (Invitrogen), and SW48 cells were grown in L15 medium (Invitrogen) in the absence of CO2. RKO, HT29, HT29/β-Gal, and HT29/APC cells were cultured in McCoy's medium (Invitrogen). Hygromycin B (Sigma) was included at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml for the HT29/β-Gal and HT29/APC cells. Insulin (10 μg/ml; Sigma) was added to the media for the C57 lines. A clonal RK3E cell line expressing the β-catenin S33Y-ER fusion protein was obtained after retroviral transduction of RK3E cells with supernatants from amphotrophic Phoenix cells transfected with pBabe-S33Y-ER-puro. Drug selection on the pBabe-S33Y-ER-puro-transduced RK3E cells was carried out in puromycin (Sigma) at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml. A single resistant colony was isolated by ring cloning and expanded into a stable cell line, termed RK3E/S33Y-ER. The RK3E/S33Y-ER line was maintained subsequently in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. To activate the S33Y-ER fusion protein, the RK3E/S33Y-ER cells were treated with medium supplemented with 0.5 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH-T) (Sigma), made from a stock concentration of 100 μm 4-OH-T in 100% ethanol. To inhibit new protein synthesis in RK3E/S33Y-ER cells, the medium was supplemented with cycloheximide (Sigma) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. To assess the effects of dominant negative TCF-4 on AXIN1 and AXIN2 gene expression, a retroviral TCF-4ΔN31 expression construct (29Kolligs F.T., Hu, G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to transduce two RK3E lines that had been transformed neoplastically by mutant β-catenin (RK3E/ΔN47-B and RK3E/ΔN132-A) (29Kolligs F.T., Hu, G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the SW480 and DLD1 colon cancer lines. Empty vector (pPGS-Neo) control transductions of the two RK3E and two colon lines were carried out in parallel. The TCF4ΔN31- and empty vector-transduced cells were subsequently selected for 7–10 days in 1.0–1.5 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). To assess the effects of wild typeAPC gene function on AXIN1 and AXIN2gene expression, HT29/β-Gal and HT29/APC cells were treated with 150 μm ZnCl2 for induction of the controllacZ and wild type APC genes, respectively. Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction and purification with the RNeasy Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) was used to prepare total RNA from five samples: parental RK3E cells; RK3E/S33Y-ER cells either mock (ethanol)-treated or 4-OH-T-treated for 24 h; a pool of equal masses of RNA from seven clonal RK3E lines transformed neoplastically by mutant β-catenin (29Kolligs F.T., Hu, G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and a pool of equal masses of RNA from five clonal RK3E lines transformed neoplastically by γ-catenin (35Kolligs F.T. Kolligs B. Hajra K.M., Hu, G. Tani M. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1319-1331PubMed Google Scholar). Gene expression analyses on the five samples were carried out with commercial high density oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), using protocols and methods developed by the supplier. Arrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix), and image analysis was performed with GeneChip 4.0 software (Affymetrix), which stores the results for each feature in .CEL files. Each RG_U34A chip consists of 534 × 534 probes (24 × 24 μm each) that are 25-base long single-stranded DNA sequences. There are typically 16 pairs of features (probe pairs) for each of the transcripts (probe sets) and a total of 8,799 probe sets. Half of the features are complementary to a specific sequence (perfect match = PM features), the other half have an identical match except a central base has been altered (mismatch = MM features). We have developed software to read .CEL files and perform some processing of the data, available at dot.ped.med.umich.edu:2000/ourimage/pub/shared/Affymethods.html. The chip for the parental RK3E sample was selected as a standard. Probe pairs for which PM-MM < −100 on the standard were excluded from the analysis. One-sided signed rank tests of the PM-MM values for each probe set on each chip were obtained to help judge whether transcripts were detectable. The average intensity for each probe set was computed as the mean of the PM-MM differences, after trimming away the 25% highest and lowest differences. A set of 3,692 reference probe sets was selected for use in normalization, these being the probe sets that gave p < 0.05 for all five chips for the test of detectability. A normalization factor for each chip was obtained using the reference probe sets by computing the antilogarithm of the mean log ratios of the average intensities for the selected chip divided by the standard. The average intensities were divided by this factor to obtain the normalized intensities for the probe sets. When computing fold change indices, we replaced intensities less than 10 by 10 before forming ratios to avoid negative or spuriously large fold change numbers. Total RNA was extracted from cells with Trizol, and Northern blot analysis was performed. Approximately 15–20 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad) by capillary action. cDNA probes to detect rat Axil, mouseconductin, rat Axin1, and human AXIN1expression were generated by RT-PCR, using primers derived from sequences in GenBank. The probe to detect AXIN2 was generated by PCR using the Axin2pcDNA3myc3.1 plasmid (provided by W. Liu; Mayo Clinic). The sequences of all PCR products probes were confirmed by automated sequencing. All probes were random labeled with [α32P]dCTP using Rediprime (Invitrogen) and hybridized to the membrane with RapidHyb Buffer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All Northern blots were stripped and hybridized to a rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe to control for RNA loading and transfer efficiency. Whole cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biochemicals), and 50 μg of total protein from each sample was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semidry electroblotting. Immunoblot analyses were carried out with the anti-conductin (S-19) or anti-conductin (M-20) goat polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:500 dilution in 1× TBS with 5% dry milk and 0.5% Tween followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (Pierce Biochemicals) at a 1:10,000 dilution. To verify equal loading of the samples, membranes were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Pierce Biochemicals). Antibody complexes were detected with the ECL Western blot kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to X-Omat-AR film (Eastman Kodak). Total RNA was isolated with Trizol from 42 snap frozen, primary ovarian endometrioid type adenocarcinomas (OEAs) that had been analyzed in detail previously for β-catenin nuclear localization and mutational defects in the β-catenin, APC, AXIN1, and AXIN2 genes (36Wu R. Zhai Y. Fearon E.R. Cho K.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8247-8255PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA was used for real time RT-PCR studies of AXIN2 and HPRT gene expression. In brief, first strand cDNA was synthesized from DNase I-treated mRNA samples using random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). For PCR with a Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 5 ng of cDNA from each tumor sample was used in each reaction. For AXIN2, PCR was performed in 96-well plates in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.2 μmAXIN2 forward primer (5′-CAAGGGCCAGGTCACCAA-3′), 0.2 μmAXIN2reverse primer (5′-CCCCCAACCCATCTTCGT-3′), and 0.2 μmdye-labeled AXIN2 probe (5′-CCCATGTCTGTCTCTTCCAACACCAGG-3′) (Synthetic Genetics, San Diego). For HPRT, the 25-μl reaction contained 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 0.2 μm forward HPRT primer (5′-TTCCTCGAGATGTGATGAAGGA-3′), 0.2 μm reverseHPRT primer (5′-CCAGCAGGTCAGCAAAGAATT-3′), and 0.2 μm dye-labeled HPRT probe (5′-CCATCACATTGTAGCCCTCTGTGTGCTC-3′) (Applied Biosystems). TheAXIN2 probe had a carboxyfluorescein label at its 5′-end, and the HPRT probe had a VICTM label at its 5′-end. Both probes had carboxytetramethyl rhodamine labels at their 3′-ends. The AXIN2 and HPRT PCRs were performed in duplicate for each tumor sample, and AXIN2 and HPRT reactions were performed in adjacent wells. The following PCR conditions were used: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Using the software accompanying the Prism 7700 detector, theHPRT signals were used for normalization. Student'st test was used to determine the significance of differences in AXIN2 expression between the 12 OEAs with strong nuclear staining for β-catenin and mutations in the β-catenin, APC, AXIN1, or AXIN2 genes and the 30 OEAs lacking strong nuclear β-catenin staining and pathway mutations. Immunohistochemcial analysis of AXIN2 expression in OEAs was performed as described previously (36Wu R. Zhai Y. Fearon E.R. Cho K.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8247-8255PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 5-μm sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were mounted on Probe-On slides (Fisher Scientific), deparaffinized in xylene, and then rehydrated into distilled water through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was enhanced by microwaving the slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0; Biogenex, San Ramon, CA) for 15 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol, and the slides were blocked with 1.5% normal horse serum for 1 h. Sections were then incubated with the anti-conductin (M-20) goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:500 dilution overnight at 4 °C followed by a biotinylated horse anti-goat secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with the avidin-biotin peroxidase method using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogenic substrate (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunostained sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and then examined by light microscopy. For all luciferase reporter assays, cells were plated in 35-mm six-well plates 12–24 h before transfection. Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 24–36 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lysates were collected in 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). TCF transcriptional activity was measured as the ratio of luciferase activity from the pTOPFLASH vector to the pFOPFLASH vector. All luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfection with pCH110 and measurement of β-galactosidase activity. To assess the effects of AXIN2 on wild type and mutant β-catenin-induced TCF activity, 293 cells were cotransfected with 0.25 μg of pTOP- or pFOPFLASH, 0.5 μg of a pcDNA3 vector encoding wild type or S33Y mutant β-catenin (29Kolligs F.T., Hu, G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1 μg of Axin2pcDNA3.1mycHis(−)B, and 0.25 μg of pCH110. To confirm stable expression of TCF-4ΔN31in β-catenin-transformed RK3E cells as well as SW480 and DLD1 cells, cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of pTOPFLASH or pFOPFLASH and 1 μg of PCH110. For reporter gene assays with AXIN2 promoter constructs, DLD1 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of AX2(1078WT)/Luc or AX2(1078Mut)/"

We have successfully overexpressed both ESAT-6 and CFP-10 in Escherichia coli and developed efficient purification schemes. Under in vivo-like conditions, a combination of fluorescence, circular dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have shown that ESAT-6 contains up to 75% helical secondary structure, but little if any stable tertiary structure, and exists in a molten globule-like state. In contrast, CFP-10 was found to form an unstructured, random coil polypeptide. An exciting discovery was that ESAT-6 and CFP-10 form a tight, 1:1 complex, in which both proteins adopt a fully folded structure, with about two-thirds of the backbone in a regular helical conformation. This clearly suggests that ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are active as the complex and raises the interesting question of whether other ESAT-6/CFP-10 family proteins (22 paired genes in M. tuberculosis) also form tight, 1:1 complexes, and if so, is this limited to their genome partner, or is there scope for wider interactions within the protein family, which could provide greater functional flexibility?

Microbiol. 1999; 2: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and remains one of the most significant bacterial diseases of humans, with about one-third of the world's population infected resulting in ∼3 million deaths annually (3Elhers S.

The bacteria responsible for tuberculosis belong to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which is a group of highly related mycobacteria. The complex includes M. tuberculosis, which is responsible for the majority of human tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium bovis, which causes tuberculosis in a range of domesticated and wild animals. The complete sequence of the M. tuberculosis genome was reported about 3 years ago (7Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. et al.Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar) and is believed to contain genes for 3,959 proteins (8Cole S.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R. Honore N. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Mungall K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). However, we still have relatively little information about which proteins are essential for pathogenesis and even less knowledge of their structures, functions, and mechanisms of action. The only currently effective vaccine for tuberculosis is a live attenuated strain of M. bovis known as Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG);1however, despite being one of the most widely used vaccines in the world the molecular basis for the attenuation of M. bovisBCG remains unclear. Recently, genomic hybridization techniques have identified a number of deletions in the genomes of BCG daughter strains; however, only one of these, termed RD1, is deleted consistently from BCG strains but present in all virulent isolates ofM. bovis and M. tuberculosis (10Mahairas G.G. Sabo P.J. Hickey M.J. Sing D.C. Stover C.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1274-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 11Behr M.A. Wilson M.A. Gill W.P. Salamon H. Schoolnik G.K. Rane S. Small P.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1520-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The RD1 deletion contains the genes for nine proteins (Rv3871-Rv3879c), which are clearly implicated in pathogenesis. The genes Rv3874 and Rv3875 code for two sequence-related (25% homology) proteins known as CFP-10 (100 residues) and ESAT-6 (95 residues), respectively. Expression of these two genes has been shown to be coordinately regulated, and both ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are found at low levels in M. tuberculosisand M. bovis culture supernatants (12Berthet F.-X. Ramussen P.B. Rosenkrands I. Andersen P. Gicquel B. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3195-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In addition, the two proteins are potent T-cell antigens recognized by over 70% of tuberculosis patients (13Skjøt R.L.V. Oettinger T. Rosenkrands I. Ravn P. Brock I. Jacobsen S. Andersen P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which has led to their proposed use as diagnostic reagents for tuberculosis in both humans and animals (14van Pinxteren L.A. Ravn P. Agger E.M. Pollock J. Andersen P. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2000; 7: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar,15Vordermeier H.M. Whelan A. Cockle P.J. Farrant L. Palmer N. Hewinson R.G. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2001; 8: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Preliminary data from a dual knockout of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 inM. bovis appears to indicate that the loss of at least one of these genes results in a significant reduction in the virulence of the engineered M. bovis, which further emphasizes the potential importance of both proteins in tuberculosis pathogenesis and virulence (16Wards B.J. de Lisle G.W. Collins D.M. Tuber. Lung Dis. 2000; 80: 185-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Neither CFP-10 nor ESAT-6 shows any significant sequence similarity with any proteins of known tertiary structure or function. However, they are both members of a large family of mycobacterial proteins found in the M. tuberculosis complex (12Berthet F.-X. Ramussen P.B. Rosenkrands I. Andersen P. Gicquel B. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3195-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 17Tekaia F. Gordon S.V. Garnler T. Brosch R. Barrell B.G. Cole S.T. Tuber. Lung Dis. 1999; 79: 329-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), which, in common with CFP-10 and ESAT-6, are found in pairs within the genome, often preceded by members of the PE and PPE gene family (7Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D.

We have produced successfully both CFP-10 and ESAT-6 inEscherichia coli, and in this communication we report the results of detailed structural characterization of both proteins using a combination of fluorescence, circular dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A pET21a-based expression vector containing the full coding sequence for ESAT-6 was generated by a PCR-based approach and maintained in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The ESAT-6 coding sequence was amplified from M. bovis AN5 DNA using appropriate primers and cloned into theNdeI and SalI sites of pET21a. The CFP-10 and CFP-10/ESAT-6 expression vectors were produced similarly by a PCR-based approach, with an artificial bacterial chromosome (Rv414; see Ref. 18Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Billault A. Garnier T. Eiglmeier K. Soravito C. Barrell B.G. Cole S.T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2221-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the full coding regions for both CFP-10 and ESAT-6 used as a template. The PCR primers used to amplify the CFP-10 coding region were designed to include NcoI and BamH1 restriction sites to allow insertion into pET28a. The larger PCR product containing the coding region for both CFP-10 and ESAT-6 included anNdeI site in place of the NcoI site and was designed to allow the expression of an N-terminal, His6-tagged variant of CFP-10 following ligation into pET28a. After construction, the integrity of both expression vectors was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coliBL21(DE3) transformed with the pET21a-based expression vector for ESAT-6 were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The expression of ESAT-6 was induced in mid-log phase (corresponding to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6–0.7) by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.45 mm, and the cells were then harvested after 4 h by centrifugation at 7800 × g for 15 min (4 °C). The cell pellets obtained were resuspended and lysed with Bugbuster HT (Novagen) to which was added 0.5 mm EDTA and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inhibit protease activity. The insoluble fraction of the cell lysate, containing the ESAT-6 as inclusion bodies, was recovered by centrifugation (12100 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the inclusion bodies were then washed three times in a 50 mm Tris, 10 mmEDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 buffer adjusted to pH 8.0. After the final wash, the ESAT-6 inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6m guanidine hydrochloride containing 1 mm EDTA and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to give a final ESAT-6 concentration of 0.5 to 1 mg/ml. This solution was dialyzed initially against a 25 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA refolding buffer at pH 6.5 and then into the Q-Sepharose column running buffer consisting of 20 mm Bis-Tris and 1 mm EDTA at pH 6.5. The final purification of ESAT-6 was carried out using a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column to which was applied a stepwise gradient of increasing NaCl concentration. The ESAT-6 was eluted at 150 mm NaCl and was judged to be greater than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel system) and electrospray mass spectrometry. E. colicells transformed with the pET28a-based expression vector for CFP-10 were grown in LB medium containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin and were harvested 4 h after induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in mid-log phase. The cell pellets were lysed with Bugbuster HT, as described previously, and the soluble fraction containing CFP-10 was then dialyzed into a 20 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA column running buffer at pH 8.0. Initial purification of CFP-10 was carried out on a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with the pH 8.0 Tris buffer. The column was washed with a stepwise gradient of increasing NaCl concentration and CFP-10 eluted in the 50 to 75 mm NaCl washes. Fractions containing CFP-10 were pooled, dialyzed against a 20 mm piperazine and 1 mm EDTA buffer at pH 5.8, and then applied to a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with the same piperazine buffer. CFP-10 was eluted from this column in a 50 mm NaCl wash and was judged to be over 95% pure. E. coli cells transformed with the expression vector for hexa-His-tagged CFP-10 were grown in LB medium containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin and were harvested 4 h after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were lysed with Bugbuster HT, and the soluble fraction containing His-tagged CFP-10 was then dialyzed into a 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA buffer at pH 8.0. The protein was purified by using a 10-ml Ni-NTA column pre-equilibrated with the pH 8.0 buffer, which was washed with a stepwise gradient of increasing imidazole concentration. The His-tagged CFP-10 was eluted in the 50 mm imidazole wash and was found to be at least 95% pure. It should be noted that if His-tagged CFP-10 was prepared from cells grown in medium containing only 20 μg/ml kanamycin then the purified protein was found to contain roughly equal amounts of both His-tagged CFP-10 and ESAT-6. The far UV CD spectra used to determine the secondary structure of ESAT-6, CFP-10, and the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex were acquired on a Jasco 715 spectrometer. The spectra were collected from protein samples dissolved in a 25 mm NaH2PO4 and 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 6.5, with the protein concentration adjusted to give an absorbance at 280 nm of about 1.0 for a path length of 1 cm. Typically, spectra were recorded from 180 to 250 nm at a scan speed of 20 nm per min, with each spectrum representing the average of 10 accumulations. During acquisition the samples were maintained at a regulated temperature (15 to 40 °C) in a 0.1-mm path length cell. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra of protein samples were acquired on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer. The spectra were recorded at 20 °C with excitation at 280 nm and fluorescence monitored from 300 to 450 nm. The final spectra were the average of 10 accumulations collected at a scan rate of 150 nm per min. Typically, the spectra were acquired from 1 μm protein samples dissolved in a 25 mm NaH2PO4 and 100 mmNaCl buffer at pH 6.5. The one-dimensional and 2D 1H NMR experiments were carried out on 350 μl samples of 0.5 to 1.0 mm ESAT-6, CFP-10, and ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex dissolved in a 25 mm NaH2PO4 and 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 6.5 (10% D2O). NMR data were acquired on 600-MHz Varian Inova and Bruker Avance spectrometers at temperatures between 15 and 35 °C. The 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (19Macura S. Ernst R.R. Mol. Phys. 1980; 41: 95-117Crossref Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) and total correlation spectroscopy (20Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3104) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with mixing times of 100–150 and 45 ms, respectively, with typical acquisition times of 35 ms in F1and 250 ms in F2. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra were collected as described above for a series of samples containing 1 μm CFP-10 and increasing concentrations of ESAT-6 (0 to 2.25 μm). The protein samples were prepared in a 25 mm NaH2PO4 and 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 6.5 and were incubated for 3 h at room temperature before acquiring the fluorescence spectra. In a typical pull down binding assay 0.1 μmol of His-tagged CFP-10 was loaded initially onto a 10-ml Ni-NTA column in a 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA buffer at pH 8.0, and the column was washed with five column volumes of the buffer. A slight molar excess of ESAT-6 was then applied to the column, and any protein that failed to bind was removed by washing once more with five column volumes of the Tris buffer including 20 mm imidazole. The proteins bound to the column were finally eluted in a 20 mm Tris and 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 8.0 containing 100 mmimidazole, and the composition of the protein fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The conformational stability of ESAT-6, CFP-10, and the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride was determined by monitoring the change in the wavelength of maximum intrinsic fluorescence emission as a function of guanidine hydrochloride concentration (21Williamson R.A. Natalia D. Gee C.K. Murphy G. Carr M.D. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out on 0.5 to 1.5 μm samples of the proteins dissolved in a 25 mm NaH2PO4 and 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 6.5, which contained between 0 and 2.25 m guanidine hydrochloride. The proteins were incubated with the denaturant overnight at 4 °C and then intrinsic fluorescence spectra were acquired at 10 °C as described previously. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for the ESAT-6/CFP-10 family of proteins was calculated using the ClustalX package (22Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35296) Google Scholar), with the M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae sequences of CFP-10/ESAT-6 family proteins obtained from the TuberculList and Leproma servers at the Pasteur Institute (www.genolist.pasteur.fr/TuberculList and www.genolist.pasteur.fr/Leproma). The expression of ESAT-6 in E. coli resulted in the production of insoluble inclusion bodies of the protein, which were isolated and solubilized in guanidine hydrochloride, and the ESAT-6 was refolded by removal of the denaturant by dialysis. Prior to purification on a Q-Sepharose column the refolded ESAT-6 was found typically to contain three main protein components, which were shown by electrospray mass spectrometry to have masses of 9902.8 ± 1.1 (∼75%), 9772.2 ± 1.1 (∼20%), and 8807.6 ± 0.9 Da (∼5%). The mass values obtained correspond to those expected for full-length ESAT-6 (9903.9 Da), ESAT-6 minus the N-terminal methionine (9772.7 Da), and ESAT-6 with the last 11 C-terminal residues removed (8807.6 Da). If phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA were omitted from the refolding buffers then the majority of the refolded ESAT-6 obtained was present as the C-terminally truncated species, which clearly arises from proteolytic cleavage between Ala-84 and Ser-85. The full-length ESAT-6 and ESAT-6 minus the N-terminal methionine were separated from the C-terminally truncated form by chromatography on Q-Sepharose and once purified were stable for many days at 20 °C. Typical yields for purified ESAT-6 were about 40 mg/liter. In contrast to ESAT-6, CFP-10 was expressed in E. coli as a soluble product, and the mass determined for the purified protein (10662.2 ± 0.6 Da) corresponds to that expected for CFP-10 after removal of the N-terminal methionine (10662.6 Da). Typical yields of purified CFP-10 were about 20 mg/liter. The His-tagged CFP-10 was also expressed as a soluble protein, and yields of about 10 mg/liter were obtained after purification. The E. coli cells transformed with the dual His-tagged CFP-10/ESAT-6 expression vector were grown initially in the presence of 40 μg/ml kanamycin and under these conditions showed no detectable coexpression of ESAT-6 with His-tagged CFP-10; however, when this was reduced to 20 μg/ml both proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE in roughly equal quantities. In addition, SDS-PAGE analysis of the protein isolated by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography of the lysate from cells grown at the lower kanamycin concentration revealed that the bound material consisted of an equimolar mixture of His-tagged CFP-10 and ESAT-6, which suggested that the proteins formed a stable, 1:1 complex. Typical intrinsic fluorescence spectra obtained for ESAT-6 (Trp-6, Trp-43, and Trp-58), CFP-10 (Trp-43), and the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex are shown in Fig.1. The spectra of both ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are characterized by a fluorescence maximum at about 353 nm at 20 °C, which corresponds to that expected for proteins in which all the tryptophan residues are fully exposed to the aqueous solvent. In contrast, the fluorescence maximum observed for the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex is blue-shifted to around 342 nm, which indicates that at least one of the four tryptophan side chains has moved to a significantly less polar environment on complex formation, such as the hydrophobic core of the complex. The far UV circular dichroism spectra shown in Fig 2 are representative of those acquired for ESAT-6, CFP-10, and the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex. The spectra obtained for both ESAT-6 and the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex are typical of those seen for proteins with a high helical content, whereas the strikingly different spectrum observed for CFP-10 alone is indicative are a largely unstructured, random coil polypeptide (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 24Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Analysis of these spectra with the CDPro package (25Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar) provided estimates of the secondary structure content for ESAT-6 (56% helix, 7% sheet, 12% turns, and 25% unstructured), CFP-10 (13% helix, 19% sheet, 17% turns, and 51% unstructured), and the complex (66% helix, 4% sheet, 9% turns, and 21% unstructured). Fig. 3 shows the one-dimensional1H NMR spectra recorded for ESAT-6, CFP-10, and the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex. The spectrum observed for the complex contains all the features expected for a folded protein, such as the cluster of high field-shifted methyl signals between 0 and 0.6 ppm and a significant number of resonances from backbone amide groups between 8.5 and 9.5 ppm. In addition, the line widths of the 1H signals indicate that the complex is a simple ESAT-6·CFP-10 heterodimer with a combined molecular mass of 20.5 kDa. The spectrum of the complex contrasts sharply with that obtained for CFP-10, in which there is no evidence of signals shifted from their random coil chemical shifts and therefore no evidence of any significant folded structure (26Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.1986Crossref Google Scholar). The spectrum obtained for ESAT-6 clearly sits somewhere between that of the complex and CFP-10, with a few 1H signals clearly shifted from random coil values, such as those from backbone NH groups between 8.5 and 9.3 ppm. Another noticeable feature of the ESAT-6 spectrum is that the 1H resonances are very broad compared with those of the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex. This is the opposite of what is expected as the line width of signals from ESAT-6 (9.9 kDa) should be about half of those for the complex (20.5 kDa) because of the 2-fold difference in molecular mass. The broad1H signals observed for ESAT-6 are indicative of either protein aggregation or exchange between multiple conformations. In 2D total correlation spectroscopy spectra of ESAT-6 collected under the same conditions at least 15 weak cross-peaks were detected between signals from backbone amide groups, which can only arise as a result of interconversion between multiple conformations in some regions of ESAT-6 (27Feeney J. Bauer C.J. Frenkiel T.A. Birdsall B. Carr M.D. Roberts G.C.K. Arnold J.R.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 91: 607-613Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of the 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and total correlation spectroscopy spectra of ESAT-6 suggests that over 70% of the signals from backbone NH groups may be broadened significantly by the exchange between multiple conformations, to the extent that cross-peaks involving these signals are not observed in 2D total correlation spectroscopy spectra. The graph shown in Fig. 4 illustrates the effect of increasing guanidine hydrochloride concentration on the wavelength of maximum intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence observed for ESAT-6, CFP-10, and the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex. The data show clearly that the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex is stable up to about 0.5m guanidine hydrochloride and then undergoes a cooperative unfolding reaction with a midpoint at 0.9 m guanidine hydrochloride, which is the type of behavior expected for a folded protein (21Williamson R.A. Natalia D. Gee C.K. Murphy G. Carr M.D. Freedman R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and suggests that protein dissociation and unfolding occur as a single event. In contrast, ESAT-6 does not show a cooperative denaturation curve, which suggests that the protein lacks any stable tertiary structure under native conditions. In the case of CFP-10, the wavelength of maximum fluorescence in the absence of guanidine hydrochloride already corresponds to that expected for a tryptophan fully exposed to an aqueous environment and is therefore insensitive to any unfolding induced by the denaturant. Secondary structure predictions were obtained for both ESAT-6 and CFP-10 using the JPRED2 package (28Cuff J.A. Clamp M. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). ESAT-6 is predicted to consist of three helical regions (residues 3 to 18, 23 to 42, and 50 to 86) linked by short loops with an overall helical content of 77%. This is a somewhat higher helical content than the 56% obtained from analysis of CD spectra acquired at 25 °C but very close to the 75% helix indicated by CD spectra recorded at 15 °C. CFP-10 is also predicted to contain only helical secondary structure with five helices (residues 3 to 15, 18 to 22, 29 to 35, 44 to 78, and 87 to 96) joined by short loops, which corresponds to an overall helical content of 70%. This figure contrasts sharply with the predominantly random coil structure indicated for CFP-10 by the CD and NMR analysis. Fig.5 illustrates the effect of increasing the molar ratio of ESAT-6 to CFP-10 on the wavelength of maximum intrinsic fluorescence observed for the mixture. The fluorescence maximum initially shifts from about 353 to 342.5 nm, with the shortest wavelength attained at a molar ratio of 1.0, and then shows a steady increase. The data strongly suggest that the two proteins interact to form a tight, 1:1 complex, in which the environment of at least one of the four tryptophan residues is significantly less polar and is therefore consistent with increased folding of one or both proteins. The results of SDS-PAGE analysis of a typical ESAT-6 pull down assay using His-tagged CFP-10 bound to a Ni-NTA column as the bait are shown in Fig. 6. ESAT-6 was shown previously not to bind to the Ni-NTA column, and so the data clearly indicate that ESAT-6 binds tightly to His-tagged CFP-10. In addition, the staining intensity observed for the two components of the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex clearly suggests a stoichiometry of 1:1. SDS-PAGE analysis of ESAT-6 purified from short term culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis has shown that the secreted protein consists of two major species, which both have the predicted N terminus and run with apparent molecular masses of between 4 and 6 kDa (29Sorensen A.L. Nagai S. Houen G. Andersen P. Andersen A.B. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1710-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This behavior is very similar to that observed for E. coli-expressed ESAT-6, where mass spectrometry revealed that the higher molecular mass band corresponds to a mixture of full-length ESAT-6 and ESAT-6 minus the N-terminal methionine and that the lower molecular weight species corresponds to ESAT-6 with 11 C-terminal residues removed. The similarity suggests that naturally secreted ESAT-6 is also highly susceptible to proteolytic removal of the 11 C-terminal residues. The circular dichroism spectra recorded for ESAT-6 indicate clearly that the majority of the protein is in a helical conformation at temperatures below 20 °C, with quantitative analysis of the data suggesting a helical content of about 75%, which is very close to the 77% suggested by secondary structure predictions. The helical structure though is relatively unstable and falls to around 56% at 25 °C and less than 30% at 40 °C. In addition, ESAT-6 shows no resistance to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride, which suggests that the protein is not folded fully even in the absence of the denaturant. The 1H NMR data acquired for ESAT-6 clearly indicate that a significant proportion of the protein (possibly as high as 70%) exists in multiple conformations, which interconvert on a time scale that leads to significant broadening of the 1H NMR signals from ESAT-6 and provides further evidence of structural instability in ESAT-6. Taken together, the spectroscopic data and structural predictions suggest that under in vivo-like conditions ESAT-6 contains a number of regions of regular helical secondary structure but little if any stable tertiary structure, and so the structure of isolated ESAT-6 appears to resemble a molten globule-like state. In contrast to ESAT-6, the combined features of the circular dichroism, fluorescence, and 1H NMR spectra of CFP-10 indicate clearly that the protein is an essentially unstructured, random coil polypeptide under in vivo-like conditions. This is somewhat surprising given a predicted helical content of over 70% and also the significant sequence similarity between CFP-10 and ESAT-6 (about 25% homology). The changes observed in the wavelength of maximum intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence on titrating CFP-10 with ESAT-6, together with the results of ESAT-6 pull down assays using His-tagged CFP-10, indicate clearly that ESAT-6 and CFP-10 form a tight, 1:1 complex. The fluorescence measurements were carried out at a CFP-10 concentration of 1 μm, and the distinct minimum in the wavelength of maximum intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence at an ESAT-6:CFP-10 ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 5) indicates not only that the two proteins form a 1:1 complex but also that at least 90% of the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are bound together at a concentration of 1 μm, which means that the binding is tight with a dissociation constant for the complex of 1.1 × 10−8m or lower. The spectroscopic and chemical denaturation data obtained for the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex show clearly that both proteins adopt a stable, fully folded structure in the complex. In recent years it has become clear that this type of behavior, in which a protein or protein domain is only folded fully when bound to its target or partner molecule, is more common than expected initially and may confer a number of functional advantages, including tighter control of the activity of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and a general mechanism for increasing the specificity of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions (30Carr M.D. Wollborn U. McIntosh P.B. Frenkiel T.A. McCormick J.E. Bauer C.J. Klempnauer K.-H. Feeney J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). Analysis of the circular dichroism spectra obtained for the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex suggests that about two-thirds of the polypeptide backbone adopts a regular helical conformation, which is only slightly lower than the helical content expected from secondary structure predictions determined for ESAT-6 and CFP-10. The large number of NH to NH nuclear Overhauser effects seen in 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra of the complex also indicates a predominantly helical secondary structure (26Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.1986Crossref Google Scholar) and is entirely consistent with the circular dichroism data. The adjacent genes for CFP-10 (Rv3874) and ESAT-6 (Rv3875) are cotranscribed and despite lacking a recognizable secretory signal sequence are both found in significant quantities in short term culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis (12Berthet F.-X. Ramussen P.B. Rosenkrands I. Andersen P. Gicquel B. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3195-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 29Sorensen A.L. Nagai S. Houen G. Andersen P. Andersen A.B. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1710-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the work reported here shows clearly that ESAT-6 and CFP-10 only adopt a stable, fully folded structure when they form a tight, 1:1 complex. The expression characteristics of both proteins, together with their structural properties, clearly suggest that the biologically active form of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 will be as the complex. CFP-10 and ESAT-6 are members of a large family of proteins found in the M. tuberculosis complex, which, in common with CFP-10 and ESAT-6, are generally found in pairs within the genome (7Cole S.T.

The phylogenetic tree calculated for the ESAT-6/CFP-10 family proteins identified in the M. tuberculosis (11 pairs) and M. leprae genomes (four pairs and two single genes; see Refs. 7Cole S.T.

Connor R. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) reveals that the proteins fall mainly into one of three pairing groups (Fig. 7). Interestingly, only the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 genes are conserved individually in M. leprae (ML0049 and ML0050, respectively), whereas the M. leprae proteins coded by ML2531/ML2532 seem to substitute for both the Rv0287/Rv0288 and Rv3019c/Rv3020c pairs from M. tuberculosis, and another single pair of M. lepraeproteins (ML1055/1181 and ML1056/1180) appears to substitute for five pairs of M. tuberculosis proteins (Rv1037c/Rv1038c, Rv1197/Rv1198, Rv1792/Rv1793, Rv2346c/Rv2347c, and Rv3619c/Rv3620c). There are no apparent M. leprae homologues for two pairs of ESAT-6/CFP-10-related genes (Rv3890c/Rv3891c and Rv3904c/Rv3905c) and one pair where there is an M. leprae equivalent for only one (Rv3444c/Rv3445c). The M. leprae genome contains only 1,604 functional protein genes and has been proposed to represent the minimal gene set for a pathogenic mycobacterium (9Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R. Honore N. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Mungall K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. et al.Nature. 2001; 409: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The retention of both ESAT-6 and CFP-10 as functional genes in M. lepraereiterates clearly their importance in the lifestyle of mycobacterial pathogens, and similar conservation arguments also suggest a significant role for both Rv0287/Rv0288 and Rv3019c/Rv3020c. This is supported by recent work (13Skjøt R.L.V. Oettinger T. Rosenkrands I. Ravn P. Brock I. Jacobsen S. Andersen P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which showed that, like ESAT-6 and CFP-10, the product of the Rv0287 gene is also secreted by M. tuberculosis cells in culture and is a major T-cell antigen recognized by over 70% of tuberculosis patients. The other members of the ESAT-6/CFP-10 family of proteins are all found as pairs in the genome of M. tuberculosis and are conserved mainly as pairs in M. leprae, which suggests that these pairs of genes will also be regulated coordinately, and the paired protein products form tight, 1:1 complexes and function as heterodimers. In addition, there is the interesting possibility that complex formation between members of the ESAT-6/CFP-10 family of proteins may not be limited to gene partners but could be much more widespread, such that 22 sequences in M. tuberculosis could give rise to many more than 11 functional protein complexes. This clearly suggests a mechanism for enhanced functional flexibility of ESAT-6/CFP-10 family proteins that may be very important for pathogenesis and virulence of members of the M. tuberculosiscomplex. Perhaps the best known precedence for this type of behavior is the leucine zipper family of transcription factors (c-Jun, c-Fos, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), ATF1, ATF2, etc.), which can form a large number of homo- and heterodimers with distinct functional properties (33Glover J.N.M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 34Kerppola T. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 373: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The characterization of the rules governing complex formation between members of the ESAT-6/CFP-10 family, together with the determination of the solution structure of the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex, is the focus of ongoing work in our laboratory."

Because TRAIL preferentially kills tumor cells, sparing normal tissues, interest has emerged in applying this biological factor for cancer therapy in humans. However, not all tumors respond to TRAIL, raising questions about resistance mechanisms. We demonstrate here that a variety of natural and synthetic ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) sensitize tumor but not normal cells to apoptosis induction by TRAIL. PPARγ ligands selectively reduce levels of FLIP, an apoptosis-suppressing protein that blocks early events in TRAIL/TNF family death receptor signaling. Both PPARγ agonists and antagonists displayed these effects, regardless of the levels of PPARγ expression and even in the presence of a PPARγ dominant-negative mutant, indicating a PPARγ-independent mechanism. Reductions in FLIP and sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis were also not correlated with NF-κB, further suggesting a novel mechanism. PPARγ modulators induced ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of FLIP, without concomitant reductions in FLIP mRNA. The findings suggest the existence of a pharmacologically regulated novel target of this class of drugs that controls FLIP protein turnover, and raise the possibility of combining PPARγ modulators with TRAIL for more efficacious elimination of tumor cells through apoptosis.

TRAIL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cytokines that is capable of inducing apoptosis (1Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The apoptosis-inducing receptors for TRAIL include Trail-R1 (DR4) and Trail-R2 (DR5), which are transmembrane type I receptors expressed on the surface of many types of cell. However, TRAIL also binds to non-apoptosis-inducing decoy receptors, which compete with death receptors for ligand and suppress apoptosis, including DcR1, DcR2, and osteoprotegerin (reviewed in Refs. 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar and 3Golstein P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R750-R753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Empiric analysis of the effects of TRAIL on normal and malignant cells has provided compelling evidence that recombinant TRAIL protein preferentially induces apoptosis of cancer cells without harming most types of untransformed cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). When properly prepared and purified, recombinant trimeric TRAIL also lacks significant toxicity in primate species that possess receptors capable of binding human TRAIL (4Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C.

Preclinical studies of recombinant TRAIL (extracellular domain) in mice have demonstrated impressive anti-tumor activity and synergy with cytotoxic anticancer drugs (6Bonavida B., Ng, C.P. Jazirehi A. Schiller G. Mizutani Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 793-802PubMed Google Scholar). However, not all tumors respond to TRAIL. This lack of response may be attributed either to unfavorable ratios of death and decoy receptors or because of intracellular resistance mechanisms (3Golstein P. Curr.

With respect to intracellular resistance mechanisms, the FLIP protein has been identified as a blocker of apoptosis induced by TNF family death receptors (reviewed in Ref. 11Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). FLIP binds to and neutralizes adapter proteins and pro-caspases normally recruited to the cytosolic domains of apoptosis-inducing TRAIL receptors upon ligand stimulation, thus interrupting early steps in TRAIL signaling. Furthermore, overexpression of FLIP protein has been documented in cancers (12Griffith T. Chin W. Jackson G. Lynch D. Kubin M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2833-2840PubMed Google Scholar). PPARγ is a member of the steroid/retinoid superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. Agonistic ligands of PPARγ include modified fatty acids, cyclopentenone-containing prostaglandins, triterpenoids, and the thiazolidinediones, a class of insulin-sensitizing drugs used in the treatment of type II diabetes (reviewed in Ref. 13Willson T.M.

For example, thiazolidinediones have been shown to suppress the growth of human colon and breast cancer cell linesin vitro and in vivo in the mouse (14Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D. King F.J.

Moreover, the concentrations of thiazolidinediones required for some apoptotic effects are beyond clinically attainable ranges (15Elstner E. Muller C. Koshizuka K. Williamson E.A. Park D. Asou H.

Here we explored the effects of PPARγ ligands on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in epithelial cancers cell lines. Our findings demonstrate a new PPARγ-independent mechanism for these compounds, resulting in rapid decreases in FLIP protein without concomitant reductions in c-FLIP mRNA, and causing sensitization of tumor but not several types of normal cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The mechanism invoked by these PPARγ modulatory compounds involves ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of FLIP, thus revealing the existence of an inducible pathway for reducing FLIP expression that might be exploited for promoting death receptor-induced apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Human prostate cancer, PPC-1 and LNCaP, ovarian cancer, OVCAR-3, and SK-OV-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Tulare, CA), 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing the same additives was used for HT29, COLO205 colon cancer, and HeLa cervical cancer cells. Cynomologus monkey hepatocytes were obtained from Cedra (Austin, TX). The TRAIL receptors of this species have been reported to be 84–99% identical in amino acid sequence to their human counterparts, and these monkey-derived cells have been shown to exhibit essentially identical apoptotic responses to recombinant preparations of TRAIL as their human counterparts (5Lawrence D.

The protease inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk, lactacystin, MG132, TLCK, and calpeptin were obtained from Calbiochem. MG-115 and epoxomicin were purchased from Sigma and Alexis (San Diego, CA), each. PPC-1 or HeLa cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) following the recommended protocol. For luciferase reporter assays, Tk-PPRE3-Luc plasmid (0.5 μg/35-mm well) was transfected into cells along with pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (0.2 μg/well). Cells were then cultured for 16 h in complete media and treated with various ligands for the indicated times. To reduce background activity, the usual medium was exchanged with medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum prior to ligand treatment. Luciferase activity was assayed with the luciferase assay system from Promega (Madison, WI) and measured with a Luminometer (EG & G Berthold). The activity of β-galactosidase was determined by incubating lysates with 0.7 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) at 37 °C for 10 min and measuring absorbance at 405 nm. For apoptosis experiments, cells in 35- or 60-mm dishes were co-transfected with 1 μg of pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and 4 μg of plasmid DNA encoding IKKβ, c-FLIP, CrmA, Bcl-2, PPARγ, and dominant-negative PPARγ (21Torii S.

The total amount of DNA per transfection was normalized by addition of empty plasmid DNA. For antisense experiments, FLIP antisense, ISIS 23296 (ACTTGTCCCTGCTCCTTGAA), or control oligonucleotide, ISIS 132383 (AGTTCTCTCTGCCCCTAGAT), was delivered into cells by lipofection at a final concentration of 300 nm, as described (23Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides were chimeric molecules in which the first and last 5 nucleotides in the sequence were 2′-O-methoxyethyl-modified, with the center 10 nucleotides composed of natural ribose moieties to support RNase H activity (24McKay R.A.

The oligonucleotides linkages contained phosphorothioate modifications to enhance nuclease resistance. Cell extracts were prepared, normalized for total protein content, and incubated with 100 μmZ-DEVD-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) in caspase assay buffer for measuring caspase-mediated release of AFC using a fluorimeter, as described (25Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takashashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). MTT assays were performed using a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (MTT-based Cell Proliferation Kit 1) following the suggested protocol. In brief, 5 × 104 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 48 h prior to treatment. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of PPARγ modulators with or without 25–250 (ng/ml) TRAIL for 24 h. MTT was added for 4 h at 37 °C, and absorbance at 550 nm was measured using a microtiter plate reader. Apoptosis was determined by fixing cells in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and staining with 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), scoring the percentage of cells having intensely condensed chromatin and/or fragmented nuclei by UV microscopy (n = 200). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells, and EMSAs were carried out as described previously (26Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In brief, oligonucleotides containing a consensus NF-κB-binding site, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (Promega) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences). After purification with MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences), the labeled probe (15 fmol) was incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extract for 25 min at room temperature and separated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE (22.5 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. After drying, gels were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Whole cell lysates prepared with RIPA buffer or cytosolic extracts prepared as above were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed with the following antibodies: anti-caspase 8 at 1:3000 (v/v) (21Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C.

Goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies at 1:3000 (v/v). Immunospecific bands were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation experiments, OVCAR-3 cells were treated with either CDDO (5 μm) or TRAIL (100 ng/ml) alone or both for 2 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline once and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 30 min. In parallel, 10% of cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer for immunoblot analysis. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, the lysates were mixed with 20 μl of anti-DR5 antibody (Alexis) and 50 μl of protein-A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 6 h. The immune complexes (immunoprecipitations) were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and the samples from immunoprecipitations and total lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for caspase 8 at 1:1000 (Alexis), FADD at 1:1000 (BD PharMingen), and c-FLIP (NF-6) at 1:20 (v/v). Cells were pretreated with PPARγ ligands for 15 min and then treated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for 20 min. Cytosolic extracts (200 μg) prepared as above were incubated with 2 μg of anti-IKKα (BD PharMingen) for 2 h, and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm NaF, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and washed once more with the kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, containing protease inhibitor mixture). Kinase assays were performed in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of GST-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. SK-OV-3 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding FLIP and His6-ubiquitin (pCW7). After 18 h, cells were treated with 5 μm CDDO for 4 h in the absence or presence of 400 nm epoxomicin and lysed in 1 ml of GTN buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100). His6-tagged ubiquitin was recovered from lysates by incubation for 30 min at 25 °C with 80 μl of cobalt chelate resin (CLONTECH). Captured proteins were eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100 after 3 washes of GTN buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using anti-FLIP antibody. PPC-1 or OVCAR-3 cells were treated with the ligands for 1 and 6 h, and then total RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The probe for c-FLIP was synthesized by using the human Apo3b Multi-Probe template set (BD PharMingen) with [α-32P]UTP and hybridized with 10 μg of RNA at 56 °C overnight. After RNase treatment, the protected transcripts were separated by denaturing PAGE (5%). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. To explore preliminarily the effects of PPARγ modulators on tumor cell responses to TRAIL, we contrasted the effects of three different classes of PPARγ ligands as follows: (a) 15d-PGJ2, a natural cyclopentenone prostaglandin having PPARγ agonist activity; (b) ciglitazone (Cig) and troglitazone (Tro), representing synthetic thiazolidinediones PPARγ agonists; and (c) the triterpenoids CDDO and CDDO-Me, which function as a weak agonist and as an antagonist of PPARγ, respectively (28Wang Y. Porter W.W. Suh N. Honda T. Gribble G.W. Leesnitzer L.M. Plunket K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Sporn M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When tested against a variety of solid tumor cell lines (PPC-1, PC3, OVCAR-3, SK-OV-3, HT29, COLO205, LNCaP, HeLa, HEY3, and HT1080) at concentrations of ≤1 μm, most of these PPARγ modulators had little effect on cell viability, as measured by MTT dye reduction assays (Fig. 1 and data not shown). For example, relative numbers of viable cells were within 80% of control following 1 day of treatment with 15d-PGJ2, Cig, Tro, CDDO, or CDDO-Me at ≤1 μm, although cytotoxic activity was observed at higher concentrations (5–25 μm). An exception was CDDO-Me, which exhibited anti-tumor activity at ≤1 μm in occasional tumor lines (data not shown). The sensitivity of these tumor cell lines to TRAIL was also tested. When treated with TRAIL, ≥80% of the tumor cells remained viable after 1 day. In fact, of 10 tumor lines treated with 100 ng/ml TRAIL, only one was significantly inhibited (not shown). Thus, neither PPARγ modulators nor TRAIL by themselves was generally effective at killing tumor cells. However, combined treatment of epithelial cancer cell lines with TRAIL and PPARγ modulators resulted in synergistic reductions in relative numbers of viable cells. Fig. 1 shows examples for several PPARγ modulators and tumor cell lines. Synergy was observed both when holding the concentration of TRAIL fixed (100 ng/ml) and varying the concentration of PPARγ modulators and, conversely, when holding the concentration of PPARγ modulators fixed and varying TRAIL (Fig. 1). In contrast to tumor cell lines, the combination of TRAIL and PPARγ modulators was not cytotoxic to normal cells, including primary cultures of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, peripheral blood leukocytes, and bone marrow (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). To explore whether these results were attributed to induction of apoptosis, tumor cell lines were treated with TRAIL in combination with PPARγ modulators, and apoptosis was measured by DAPI staining (counting percentages of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology, as determined by chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation). Also, caspase activity was measured in cell lysates (based on cleavage of the fluorigenic caspase substrate, Ac-DEVD-AFC), and cleavage of the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was monitored (by immunoblotting). Fig. 2 shows some representation data. Note that tumor lines such as prostate cancer PPC-1, ovarian cancer OCVAR-3, and cervical cancer HeLa are triggered by the combination of PPARγ modulators and TRAIL to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 2, A and B), activate caspases (Fig.2 C), and cleave the caspase substrate PARP (Fig.2 D). In contrast, culturing these cells with either TRAIL or PPARγ modulators alone had little effect. The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, potently suppressed TRAIL-induced cell death (not shown), further supporting an apoptotic mechanism. The synergistic effect of TRAIL and PPARγ modulators was not attributable to a mere shift in the kinetics of apoptosis induction, as demonstrated by time course analysis (Fig. 2 E). In addition to their effects on PPARγ activity, several PPARγ modulators have been reported to directly inhibit the IκB kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, thereby suppressing NF-κB induction (29Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Because NF-κB plays important roles in suppressing apoptosis induced by TNF, affecting expression of apoptosis-suppressing genes (30Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 31Wang C. Mayo M. Korneluk R. Goeddel D. Baldwin A. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), we explored whether inhibition of IKKα activity or suppression of NF-κB induction correlated with the ability of various PPARγ modulators to sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL. For IKKα activity assays, tumor cell lines such as PPC-1 were treated for 15 min with four different PPARγ modulators which we had demonstrated sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL, including 15d-PGJ2, ciglitazone, CDDO, and CDDO-Me. Because TRAIL did not induce significant IKK activation (not shown), TNF was added to cultures for 20 min to stimulate IKKs. Cells were then lysed, and IKKα was recovered by immunoprecipitation, measuring its activity byin vitro kinase assay using GST-IκBα as an in vitro substrate. Loading of equal amounts of IKKα protein was confirmed by immunoblotting. Although 15d-PGJ2 was a potent inhibitor of IKKα activation, consistent with previous reports (29Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar,32Straus D.S. Pascual G., Li, M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.-H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), and CDDO reduced IKKα activity by about half, the other PPARγ modulators ciglitazone and CDDO-Me had no effect on IKKα activity (Fig. 3 A). Thus, suppression of IKKα activity cannot explain the ability of ciglitazone and CDDO-Me to sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL. Similar conclusions were reached by assessing NF-κB induction using EMSAs, where binding of NF-κB to 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes containing NF-κB-binding sites was measured (Fig. 3 B). For example, when TNF was used as a stimulus for inducing NF-κB DNA binding activity, ciglitazone and CDDO-Me had little or no effect. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2 completely inhibited NF-κB induction and CDDO reduced levels of NF-κB DNA binding activity by about half, consistent with the kinase data (Fig.3 A). Thus, some PPARγ modulators that sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL reduce IKKα activity and inhibit NF-κB induction (15d-PGJ2; CDDO), but others do not (ciglitazone; CDDO-Me). To probe further the relationship of NF-κB to effects of PPARγ modulators on TRAIL sensitivity, levels of NF-κB were also measured in PPC-1 cells following stimulation with TRAIL (instead of TNF) and correlated with induction of apoptosis, using caspase-mediated cleavage of PARP as a surrogate marker for apoptosis (Fig.3 B). Similar to when TNF was employed, 15d-PGJ2caused striking reductions in NF-κB levels in TRAIL-stimulated cells, and this correlated with sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by PARP cleavage. In contrast, levels of NF-κB in TRAIL-stimulated cells were not reduced by ciglitazone, CDDO, and CDDO-Me (and may have even been slightly increased), yet all of these PPARγ modulators sensitized PPC-1 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We also tested additional prostaglandins, some of which inhibit NF-κB and others which do not, correlating their effects on NF-κB with TRAIL-induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 3 B). Among the seven prostaglandins tested (PGA1, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGJ2, 12d-PGJ2, and 15d-PGJ2), three of them (PGA1, PGJ2, and 15d-PGJ2) completely and one (12d-PGJ2) partially reduced levels of NF-κB to base line. Specifically, PGA1 completely inhibited NF-κB induction by either TRAIL or TNF, probably through direct inhibition of IKK activity as reported previously (29Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar), but it failed to sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig.3 B). Thus, reductions in NF-κB do not correlate with sensitization of tumor cells to TRAIL. In searching for a mechani"

However, the link between ligand-induced receptor activation and its oligomerization state as well as the proportion of the total receptor population that can engage in oligomeric complexes remain open questions. Here, the closely related human MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors (MT1R, MT2R) were used to address these issues. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments in living HEK 293 cells revealed that these receptors form homo- and hetero-oligomers. Constitutive energy transfer was observed for all receptor combinations at physiological expression levels and could be detected in single cell BRET experiments. Inhibition of the energy transfer by dilution of the BRET partners identified MT1R and MT2R dimers as the predominant receptor species, and this oligomerization state did not change upon agonist and antagonist binding. Agonists, neutral antagonists, and inverse agonists all promoted increases in BRET values for MT2R but not for MT1R homodimers in living cells and isolated plasma membranes. This indicates that no correlation could be inferred between the receptor activation state and the dimerization state of the receptor. This also suggests that ligand-promoted BRET increases represent specific ligand-induced conformational changes of pre-existing dimers rather then increased dimerization. The observation that ligands favored the energy transfer within the hetero-oligomer from MT1R to MT2R but not in the reverse orientation, from MT2R to MT1R, supports this view.

Even the proportion between monomeric and oligomeric receptor species and the exact oligomerization state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) remains a matter of controversy. Currently, two models are proposed. In the first model GPCR are monomeric in their inactive state, and agonist activation induces the formation of receptor oligomers. This model is based on low basal and strong agonist-induced energy transfer signals observed in fluorescence and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (FRET, BRET) experiments for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (3Cornea A.

A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). If ligand-promoted increases in BRET or FRET reflect changes in oligomerization that are linked to the receptor activation state, one would predict that ligands with different efficacies would lead to distinct changes in energy transfer. In other words, agonists should increase energy transfer, while inverse agonists and neutral antagonists should promote a decrease and no change, respectively. In the present study, the occurrence of constitutive homo and hetero-oligomerization among MT1R and MT2R was investigated in HEK 293 cells expressing physiological levels of these receptors using BRET approaches including a novel single cell BRET assay. The oligomerization state and the effect of ligands with distinct signaling efficacy on BRET signals were also systematically assessed to directly test the hypothesis linking receptor activation and oligomerization. Construction of β2AR-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and β2AR-Renilla luciferase (Rluc) fusion proteins and FLAG-tagged β2AR have been described elsewhere (7Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E.

Saubamea (Institut Cochin, Paris). MTR-Rluc MTR-YFP and MTR-YFP MTR-Rluc fusion proteins were constructed by ligating the YFP and the Rluc moieties at the C-terminal end of the receptors. For this, the coding regions of MT1R and MT2R were inserted into the cloning sites of the pRL-CMV vector (Promega, Madison, WI) in phase with the Renilla luciferase gene or cloned in phase with the YFP coding region of the Cytogem®-Topaze (pGFPtpz-N1) vector (Packard, Meriden, CT). Stop codons were then deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA sequence encoding the FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) was inserted by PCR just upstream of the MT1R coding region. The coding region of the MT2R was inserted downstream of six copies of the Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) in a pcDNA3 expression vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HEK 293 cells were grown in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm glutamine) (all from Invitrogen). Transient and stable transfections were performed using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to supplier instructions. Whole cell radioligand binding assays were performed as described (13Brydon L. Rocka F. Petit L. de Coppet P. Tissot M. Barrett P. Morgan P.J. Nanoff C. Strosberg A.D. Jockers R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2025-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-CYP at 200 pmol was used as the radioligand for β2AR and 2-[125I]iodomelatonin ([125I]-Mel) at 400 pmol for MTR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specific binding was defined as binding displaced by 10 μmd/l-propranolol (β2AR) or 10 μmmelatonin (Sigma). Melatonin-promoted G protein activation was determined in GTPγ35S binding assays with membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells stably expressing the MT2R as described recently (14Rocka F. Brydon L. Waldhoer M. Strosberg A.D. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Membranes or immunoprecipitates were denatured in 62.5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue at room temperature. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with the monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (250 ng/ml) (Sigma) or monoclonal anti-Myc-specific 9E10 (1 μg/ml). Immunoreactivity was revealed using appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Crude membranes were prepared, solubilized with 1% digitonin, a detergent known to maintain MTR in a native conformation, and immunoprecipitated as described recently (13Brydon L. Rocka F.

Precipitates were analyzed by assessing luciferase activity in a luminometer using coelenterazine h as substrate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then detached mechanically in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 5 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, and 10 mg/liter benzamidine (buffer A). Cell suspensions were homogenized with an Dounce homogenizer, and lysates centrifuged at 450 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was layered on top of a sucrose (1.3 m) cushion and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min. As reported previously (12Jockers R. Angers S. DaSilva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the light membrane vesicular fraction was found at the 0–1.3 m interface, whereas the plasma membrane fraction was sedimented at the bottom of the sucrose cushion. The pellet was washed once with buffer A and then resuspended in 75 mmTris, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and used for BRET experiments. Cyclic AMP levels were determined with an amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (Packard Instrument Company). Cells (10,000/assay) were incubated with anti-cAMP-acceptor beads for 30 min at 25 °C in stimulation buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH = 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine) with or without forskolin (1 μm) and increasing concentrations of melatonin. A biotinylated cAMP probe and streptavidin-donor beads prepared in lysis buffer (5 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 0.3% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) were added according to suppliers instructions. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, HEK 293 cells were detached and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 1–2 × 105 intact cells or isolated plasma membranes, prepared as described above, were distributed in a 96-well microplate in the absence or presence of ligands at 25 °C. Coelenterazine h substrate (Molecular Probes) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were performed with a lumino/fluorometer (FusionTM, Packard Instrument Company) that allows the sequential integration of luminescence signals detected with two filter settings (Rluc filter, 485 ± 10 nm; YFP filter, 530 ± 12.5 nm). The BRET ratio was defined as the difference of the emission at 530 nm/485 nm of co-transfected Rluc and YFP fusion proteins and the emission at 530 nm/485 nm of the Rluc fusion protein alone. Results were expressed in milliBRET units, 1 milliBRET corresponding to the BRET ratio values multiplied by 1000. The amount of Rluc and YFP fusion receptor expressed was determined for each condition. Maximal luciferase activity was used to determine the amount of Rluc fusion receptors and the fluorescence obtained upon exogenous YFP excitation to determine the amount of YFP fusion receptors. Luciferase activity and YFP fluorescence were converted into receptor numbers in standard curves performed in parallel experiments relating fluorescence and luminescence signals to radioligand binding (saturating concentration) (see supplemental material at http://www.jbc.org). Cells were transfected with constant amounts of vectors coding for fusion receptors (MT1R-Rluc/MT1R-YFP or MT2R-Rluc/MT2R-YFP) at a 1:1 protein ratio and increasing amounts of vector coding for wild-type MT1R or MT2R, respectively. The amount of Rluc and YFP receptor expressed was determined for each condition as described for the “Microplate BRET Assay” (see also supplemental material). The total amount of receptor was determined by radioligand binding using a saturating concentration of 125I-Mel. The quantity of wild-type receptor was determined from the difference between total receptors and the sum of the Rluc and YFP fusion proteins. The energy transfer was determined as described for the microplate BRET assay in the absence and presence of various ligands. Data were fitted by adapting the dimer, trimer, and tetramer model of energy transfer quenching proposed by Veatch and Stryer (15Veatch W. Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Assuming that oligomer formation is random between the different receptor species, the following equations can be used: dimer ( y = α − x), trimer (y = (α −x)2/α2), and tetramer (y = ( α −x)3/α3) model. ycorresponds to the BRET/BRET0 ratio, where BRET0 = energy transfer measured in the absence of competitor. x corresponds to the mole fraction of competitorversus the BRET partners. α corresponds to the value ofx when y = 0. To obtain α, experimental data were first fitted by linear regression (y =ax + b) with α = x wheny = 0. This value for α was than used in the equations described above to fit experimental data with the different models. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Coelenterazine h was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and bioluminescence was detected with a modified Olympus upright microscope fitted with a BH2-RFCA epifluorescence unit recorded through a plan 40× Olympus long working distance water immersion lens (numerical aperture 0.7). Images were acquired with a cooled Photonic Science (Robertsbridge, UK) extended ISIS video camera either with the Rluc or the YFP filter setting (Rluc filter: 485 ± 10 nm; YFP filter: 530 ± 12.5 nm). Areas corresponding to individual cells were randomly selected with Axon Imaging Workbench 2214 software, and the amount of light acquired for each area was integrated over 16 s and quantified for each filter setting. The BRET ratio for each cell was calculated on the basis of the difference of the emission at 530 nm/485 nm of co-transfected Rluc and YFP fusion proteins and the emission at 530 nm/485 nm of the Rluc fusion protein alone as described for the microplate assay. Western blot analysis of membranes derived from HEK 293 cells expressing N-terminally FLAG-tagged MT1R or N-terminally Myc-tagged MT2R revealed three groups of immunoreactive bands with apparent molecular masses of 45–60 kDa, 90–120 kDa, and >200 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1a). Given that similar pattern of migration on SDS-PAGE have been suggested to reflect the presence of monomeric, dimeric, and higher oligomeric states for other GPCR (2Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), the putative oligomerization of the MTR was assessed using a co-immunoprecipitation approach. We studied MT1R and MT2R oligomerization by co-immunoprecipitation using MT1R and MT2R fused at their C-tail to either Rluc or YFP. In a first series of experiments the pharmacological properties of these fusion proteins were studied individually in radioligand binding experiments. In good agreement with values previously obtained for wild-type receptors (16Petit L. Lacroix I. deCoppet P. Strosberg A.D. Jockers R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the affinity (Kd) of the MTR agonist 125I-Mel was 261 ± 31, 115 ± 22, 247 ± 60, and 255 ± 20 pm (n = 3) for MT1R-YFP, MT1R-Rluc, MT2R-YFP, and MT2R-Rluc, respectively. IC50 values for melatonin-promoted inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase a well established signaling pathway of MTR, were very similar to those obtained for wild-type receptors (16Petit L. Lacroix I. deCoppet P. Strosberg A.D. Jockers R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating that fusing Rluc and YFP did not significantly affect the functionality of the receptors (1.7 ± 0.7, 3.0 ± 1.2, 5.7 ± 5.2, and 3.7 ± 2.1 nm (n = 2) for MT1R-YFP, MT1R-Rluc, MT2R-YFP, and MT2R-Rluc, respectively). Oligomerization was assessed by the pairwise expression of receptor-Rluc and –YFP fusions, followed by precipitation using anti-green fluorescence protein antibodies and measuring co-immunoprecipitated luciferase activity. The results presented in Fig. 1b indicate that both MT1R and MT2R homo-oligomers can form. To rule out the possibility that co-immunoprecipitation could result from spurious, receptor-independent, interaction between the YFP and the Rluc, co-immunoprecipitation was also carried out using N-terminally FLAG-tagged receptors co-expressed with C-terminal Rluc fusion receptors. Co-immunoprecipitation of melatonin receptor oligomers was confirmed as was the specificity of the interaction shown by the absence of luciferase activity in precipitates prepared from cells co-expressing FLAG-tagged β2AR and MT1R- or MT2R-Rluc fusion proteins (Fig. 1b). To study receptor oligomerization in intact cells, we chose BRET, a technique that has recently been used to monitor protein-protein interactions (7Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The assay relies on the observation that the degree of physical proximity between molecules can be assessed in living cells by the level of energy transfer occurring between the energy donor Rluc and a fluorescent acceptor such as the YFP (17Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). To monitor the transfer of energy between the MTR fusion proteins, equimolar amounts of the Rluc and YFP constructs (as assessed by generating standard curves relating fluorescence and luminescence signals to radioligand binding sites; see supplemental material) were co-expressed in HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig 2, a and b, significant energy transfer was observed in living cells co-expressing MT1R-Rluc and MT1R-YFP as well as MT2R-Rluc and MT2R-YFP indicating that constitutive homo-oligomers exist for both receptor subtypes. Energy transfer levels detected were very similar to those observed for the β2AR-YFP/β2AR-Rluc couple (Fig. 2a) previously shown to form constitutive oligomers (7Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar, 9McVey M. Ramsay D. Kellett E.R.S. Wilson S. Pope A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48040-48047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Significant BRET between MT1R-Rluc and MT2R-YFP (Fig. 2a) as well as between MT2R-Rluc and MT1R-YFP (Fig. 2b) also indicated the occurrence of MT1R/MT2R hetero-oligomers when these receptor subtypes are co-expressed. The specificity of these interactions is illustrated by the absence of significant energy transfer between MTR-Rluc constructs and either β2AR-YFP or YFP alone. At equimolar concentrations, the level of BRET detected was independent of the receptor expression levels (data not shown). BRET was observed at receptor levels as low as 20 fmol/mg of protein, a concentration similar to those observed in native tissues such as the retina (70 fmol/mg) (18Dubocovich M.L. Takahashi J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3916-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and the hypophysal pars tuberalis (40 fmol/mg) (19Morgan P.J. Williams L.M. Davidson G. Lawson W. Howell E. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1989; 1: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) indicating that the constitutive homo- and hetero-dimerization detected by BRET did not result from over-expression and could reflect a physiological reality. We next wanted to determine the proportion and the nature (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of the oligomeric receptor fraction. BRET competition assays using non-tagged MTR were carried out to titrate receptor oligomers. For this, constant and equimolar amounts of MTR-YFP and MTR-Rluc (BRET receptors) were co-expressed with increasing concentration of the non-tagged receptor (competitor). The amount of each receptor species was determined for each data point as described under “Material and Methods” (see also supplemental material). Data were fitted by adapting the dimer (n = 2), trimer (n = 3), and tetramer (n = 4) model of energy transfer quenching proposed by Veatch and Stryer (15Veatch W. Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (see “Material and Methods”). These models can be applied with the assumption that oligomerization occurs randomly between tagged and non-tagged receptors (15Veatch W. Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, aand b, BRET decreased linearly with increasing amounts of competitor for both MT1R and MT2R homo-oligomers (r = 0.969 for MT1R, and r = 0.956 for MT2R), and the data were best fitted to the dimer model thus indicating that melatonin receptors exist as dimeric entities (n = 2) and not higher oligomeric structures. If all receptors are engaged in dimers, complete competition would be expected at a competitor/BRET partner ratio close to 1. In contrast, if a significant proportion of monomeric BRET receptors existed under basal conditions, an excess of non-tagged receptors would be needed to inhibit BRET because the monomeric fusion receptor pool would behave as a “chelator” for the non-tagged competitor. Because approximately equimolar amounts of non-tagged receptors (1–1.5) were sufficient to compete for the interactions occurring between BRET receptors, we concluded that most receptors exist indeed as dimeric entities. No inhibition of the BRET between MTRs was observed upon co-expression of a 5-fold excess of non-tagged β2AR confirming the specificity of the competition assay. The degree of constitutive energy transfer detected between GPCR has been suggested to result from overexpression of the receptors (4Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Sasi R. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. J.

Although the data presented above indicate that constitutive BRET could be detected at physiological levels of MTR, these as well as previous energy transfer studies (6Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were carried out in population of cells with heterogeneous levels of expression. To exclude the possibility that mean energy transfer values measured in whole-cell populations could be caused by high YFP/Rluc fusion protein expression in a non-representative cellular sub-population, single cell BRET measurements were carried out. Cells expressing Rluc-fused receptors were identified using a microscope coupled to an intensified CCD camera upon addition of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine h. The amount of light measured with Rluc (485 nm) and YFP (530 nm) filter settings was quantified for each cell, and the BRET ratio calculated. Direct fusion constructs covalently linking Rluc to YFP were used as a positive control (7Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4a, a mean energy transfer of 148 ± 23 milliBRET units above background (cells expressing Rluc alone) was obtained in 15 analyzed cells. Albeit to a lower extent, significant BRET was also observed for cells expressing MT1R-Rluc/MT1R-YFP, MT2R-Rluc/MT2R-YFP, and β2AR-Rluc/β2AR-YFP pairs. The specificity of these interactions is illustrated by the absence of significant transfer between MTR-Rluc constructs and β2AR-YFP expressed at equimolar quantities. The energy transfer observed in randomly selected single cells was then directly compared with the mean energy transfer of the entire cell population. For this purpose, constitutive energy transfer of the β2AR homo-dimer was measured at different YFP/Rluc fusion protein ratios. As can be seen in Fig. 4b, the single cell BRET measured by a microscope was identical to the BRET determined on the total population of cells using the microplate assay format, and this for all β2AR-YFP/β2AR-Rluc ratios. This indicates that the mean BRET values observed in heterogeneous population of cells do not reflect events occurring in a small subpopulation of cells expressing higher levels of"

In a bioinformatics approach, we now identified a new family of protein sequences from animals, plants, and fungi and characterized these sequences biochemically by expression inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. This resulted in the identification of the enzyme sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase (dihydroceramide desaturase) from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, andCandida albicans, in addition to a bifunctional sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase/C-4-hydroxylase from M. musculus. Among the sequences investigated are the Homo sapiens membrane lipid desaturase, the M. musculus degenerative spermatocyte, and the Drosophila melanogaster degenerative spermatocyte proteins. During spermatogenesis, but not oogenesis of des mutant flies, both cell cycle and spermatid differentiation are specifically blocked at the entry into the first meiotic division, leading to male sterility. This mutant phenotype can be restored to wild-type by complementation with a functional copy of the des gene (Endo, K., Akiyama, T., Kobayashi S., and Okada, M. (1996) Mol. Gen. Genet. 253, 157–165).

Their chemical structure differs from the more commonly known glycerolipids in having a long-chain amino alcohol, the sphingoid base (Fig.1), as a backbone. Sphingolipid biosynthesis starts in the endoplasmic reticulum from serine and a palmitic or stearic acid coenzyme A-thioester, which are condensed and subsequently reduced to form a sphingoid base. The free sphingoid base is then N-acylated to form a ceramide. In a further step, a polar head group is added onto the primary hydroxy group of the ceramide to give a variety of complex sphingolipids such as cerebrosides, sphingomyelin, and phytoglycolipids. A significant proportion of these sphingolipids is finally found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, where they have both structural and signaling functions (1Holthuis J.C.M. Pomorski T. Raggers R.J. Sprong H. van Meer G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1689-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, sphingolipid-derived messengers, in particular ceramide and phosphorylated sphingoid bases, control activities such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and motion (2Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), as well as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (3Mathias S. Peña L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Ceramide can be generated either by de novo synthesis as described above or by hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids. Once released, ceramides may be hydrolyzed to free sphingoid base and fatty acid, which themselves give rise to messenger molecules such as phosphorylated sphingoid bases. In addition, free and phosphorylated sphingoid bases can also be generated by de novo synthesis. Important postsynthetic modifications of sphingolipids are desaturation at the Δ4-position and hydroxylation at the C-4-position of the sphinganine, so that they contain (E)-sphing-4-enine ord-4-hydroxysphinganine (Fig. 1). In mammals, the (E)-Δ4-double bond contributes to the second messenger activity of ceramide (7Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is introduced by the enzyme sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase (8Stoffel W. Assmann G. Bister K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 352: 1531-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This enzyme is frequently called dihydroceramide desaturase in mammals, because its activity is highest with dihydroceramide as substrate (9Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill A.H., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The C-4-hydroxy group is introduced by the enzyme sphingolipid C-4-hydroxylase, which is encoded by the yeast SUR2 gene and its plant homologues (10Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the course of identifying enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis (12Sperling P. Ternes P. Moll H. Franke S. Zähringer U. Heinz E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Sperling P. Zähringer U. Heinz E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33621-33629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we were interested in cloning the sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase. Its biochemical characteristics, for example, the requirement of NAD(P)H and O2 as cofactors (9Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill A.H., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), are typical for membrane-bound desaturases and hydroxylases. These enzymes belong to a large superfamily defined by three characteristic sequence motifs, the histidine boxes HX 3–4H, HX 2–3HH, and (H/Q)X 2–3HH (15Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily introduce double bonds or hydroxy groups into many different lipid substrates, including fatty acyl groups, sphingoid bases, and sterols (16Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed the amino acid sequence of sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase to be similar to that of other known desaturases or hydroxylases which contain the histidine box sequence motifs. In a first approach, we expected the sequence of this enzyme to be similar to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae sphingolipid C-4-hydroxylase Sur2p (10Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11062-11068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), because desaturases and hydroxylases of identical regioselectivity and substrate specificity were believed to be very similar at the amino acid sequence level (16Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 17Sperling P. Heinz E. Eur. J. Lipid Sci. Technol. 2001; 103: 158-180Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, cloning and expression of sequences similar to S. cerevisiae Sur2p resulted in the discovery of sphinganine C-4-hydroxylases from plants (12Sperling P. Ternes P. Moll H. Franke S. Zähringer U. Heinz E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but not of the unknown Δ4-desaturase. This indicated that the sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase and Sur2p were not as similar as expected. We now employed a bioinformatics strategy to identify the protein sequence of the sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase. Using PSI-blast (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), an extensive collection of sequences characterized by the histidine box sequence motifs was assembled and subsequently grouped into families according to sequence similarity. After identifying a new family with candidate sequences from animals, plants, and fungi, which will be called the DES family, several of these sequences were cloned and biochemically characterized by expression in S. cerevisiae.By this strategy, the first sphingolipid Δ4-desaturases, as well as a bifunctional sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase/C-4-hydroxylase were identified. Among the sphingolipid Δ4-desaturases investigated are theDrosophila melanogaster degenerative spermatocyte(des-1) 1Typographic rules for genes and their products differ among the species mentioned in this study. Particularly inDrosophila, genes named after a recessive mutant phenotype, as well as the mutant itself, are typeset in lowercase italics. Any item in italics should therefore be considered a gene, messenger RNA, or complementary DNA, except when it is evident from the context that it refers to a mutant. Any item in Roman characters should be considered a protein.2(19Endo K. Akiyama T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the Mus musculusdegenerative spermatocyte (MDES) (20Endo K. Matsuda Y. Kobayashi S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1997; 39: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the Homo sapiensmembrane lipid desaturase (MLD) (21Cadena D.L. Kurten R.C. Gill G.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6960-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) proteins. A considerable amount of information about these proteins is already present in the literature, generated without knowing their biochemical activity. Their identification as sphingolipid Δ4-desaturases now allows assignment of unexpected cellular functions to Δ4-desaturated sphingolipids. We propose that Δ4-desaturated sphingolipids are involved in cell cycle control during Drosophilaspermatogenesis. The NCBI non-redundant protein sequence data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was searched using PSI-blast (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

The search yielded two non-overlapping sets including a total of 397 sequences containing the three histidine box motifs. These sequences were grouped into families by manual inspection of multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees generated with ClustalX (22Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Putative biochemical functions were assigned to each family based on experimentally characterized member sequences. The new DES family was identified as described under “Results,” and initially consisted of 7 sequences from H. sapiens (DES1, GenBankTM protein accession NP_003667), M. musculus (DES1, NP_031879), D. melanogaster (DES-1,CAA63889), C. elegans (NP_493549 and NP_501256), A. thaliana (AAD17340), and Schizosaccharomyces pombe(T40333). The TIGR Gene Indices (www.tigr.org/tdb) were searched with tblastn (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) for tentative consensus sequences with high similarity to the DES family at the protein level. Tentative consensus sequences corresponding to the DES family members identified in the PSI-blast searches (H. sapiens DES1, M. musculus DES1, andD. melanogaster DES-1) as well as tentative consensus sequences encoding new family members (DES2 homologue from H. sapiens, M. musculus DES2, and the DES homologue fromLycopersicon esculentum) were found. Corresponding cDNA clones were sequenced and their nucleotide sequences were submitted to the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. The sequence of I.M.A.G.E. Consortium cDNA clone 2578328 encoding H. sapiens DES1 has been submitted with accession number AF466375, I.M.A.G.E.

I.M.A.G.E. Consortium cDNA clone 2109176 encoding a DES2 homologue fromH. sapiens contains an incomplete coding sequence and was not investigated further. I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (LLNL) cDNA Clones (23Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B.

The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project cDNA Clone LP11871 (24Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Stapleton M. Harvey D.A.

Giovannoni, and C. Ronning, unpublished observations. was supplied by the Clemson University Genomics Institute. To find additional DES homologues from fungi, the Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa genomic sequences were searched with tblastn (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) for open reading frames showing high similarity to the DES family at the protein level. One open reading frame consisting of bases 7499–8611 of contig 6-2340 encoding Des1p from C. albicans and one open reading frame consisting of bases 17916–16535 of contig 9a58 encoding a Des1p homologue fromN. crassa were identified. Sequence data for C. albicans were obtained from the Stanford Genome Technology Center website at sequence-www.stanford.edu/group/candida. Sequence data forN. crassa were obtained from the Neurospora Genome Project website at mips.gsf.de/proj/neurospora. Complete open reading frames were amplified from the cDNA clones indicated in the previous section (H. sapiens,M. musculus, D. melanogaster, and L. esculentum) or from genomic DNA (C. albicans strain CAI4) by PCR with specific primers using proofreading Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The primer sequences were: CGCGGATCCATGGGGAGCCGCGTCTCG and GCTCTAGATTACTCCAGCACCATCTCTC (H. sapiens DES1), CGCGGATCCATGGGTAGCCGCGTGTCC and GCTCTAGATTACTCCAGAATCTCGTTCC (M. musculus Des1), CGCGGATCCATGGGTAATAGCGCGGCCC and GCTCTAGATCAC- AGGTGGTCCTTCGCC (M. musculus Des2), CGCGGATCCATGGGACAGAAAGTTTCGCG and GCTCTAGATTAGGAGGCCAGGCCGCG (D. melanogaster des-1), CGCGGATCCATGGGATTTGAAGGG- GAAAA and GCTCTAGACTATTCGGACTTGTTTGCTT (DES homologue fromL. esculentum), CGCGGATCCATGGACGCTGAAATCAAGCA and GCTCTAGATTAGTTCTCGTCTAACCTATTA (C. albicans DES1). The primers included adapter sequences containing the restriction sites KpnI (forward primer) or XbaI (reverse primer) (underlined). The PCR products were cloned into theKpnI and XbaI sites of the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were used to transform the S. cerevisiae strain sur2Δ(MATα lys2 ura3–52 trp1Δ leu2Δ sur2::TRP1) (10Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The plasmids carrying the open reading frames from C. albicans and L. esculentum were checked by sequencing. The insert sequence encoding the DES homologue from L. esculentum was identical to the cDNA sequence. The insert sequence encodingC. albicans Des1p differed in a single nucleotide (G or C at position 585) from the sequence determined by the Stanford Genome Technology Center, but this had no effect on the predicted protein sequence. C. albicans strain SC5314 was sequenced at the Stanford Genome Technology Center, whereas strain CAI4 was used in this study. Precultures of transformed sur2Δ cells were grown aerobically at 30 °C in complete minimal uracil dropout medium (25Treco D.A. Lundblad V. Asubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

Cultures were grown aerobically at 25 °C for 70 h (final A 600 = 2.5–3), subjected to heat shock at 37 °C for 90 min, and harvested by centrifugation. The heat shock treatment was performed to increase ceramide levels as observed in several studies (4Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol.

Zähringer U. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28590-28596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar with optimizations. Yeast cells (370–520 mg fresh weight) were harvested by centrifugation, washed with H2O, and hydrolyzed directly with ≈10% (w/v) Ba(OH)2 in 3 ml of 1,4-dioxane/H2O 1:1 (v/v) (20 h at 110 °C) (26Morrison W.R. Hay J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 202: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The free sphingoid bases were extracted by phase partitioning with CHCl3/1,4-dioxane/H2O, 8:3:8 (v/v/v). The organic phase was washed with an equal volume of 0.1m KOH + 0.5 m KCl. The sphingoid bases were converted to their DNP derivatives with 0.2 ml of 0.5% (v/v) methanolic 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 0.8 ml of 2 mboric acid/KOH, pH 10.5 (30 min at 60 °C) (27Karlsson K.-A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1970; 5: 6-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), extracted by phase partitioning with CHCl3/methanol/H2O, 2:1:1 (v/v/v), and purified by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates in CHCl3/methanol, 9:1 (v/v). The DNP-derivatized sphingoid bases were detected by their color (yellow under visible light and dark blue under UV illumination), extracted with CHCl3/methanol, 2:1 (v/v), followed by phase partitioning with CHCl3/methanol/0.1 m KOH, 2:1:1 (v/v/v), and dissolved in 0.5 ml of methanol. Analysis by reverse-phase HPLC was performed on a Multospher RP18–5 250 × 4-mm column (CS-Chromatographie) with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min and a concave gradient from 84 to 100% methanol/acetonitrile/2-propanol, 10:3:1 (v/v/v), against H2O in 55 min. The elution was monitored with a UV detector (ThermoQuest) at 350 nm. Reverse-phase HPLC/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) and ESI/MS/MS with direct infusion were performed with DNP-derivatized sphingoid bases on a MAT 95XL-Trap instrument (ThermoQuest) in negative ion mode. DNP-derivatized sphinganine, (E)-sphing-4-enine, and d-4-hydroxysphinganine (Sigma) were used as reference substances. For NMR analysis, S. cerevisiae sur2Δ cells (12 g fresh weight) expressing C. albicans Des1p were hydrolyzed in a total reaction volume of 120 ml (24 h under reflux) as described above. The free saturated and desaturated sphingoid bases were separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates in CHCl3/methanol/25% NH4OH, 40:20:3 (v/v/v), detected with ANS under UV illumination, and extracted separately with methanol/25% NH4OH/10:1 (v/v). The sphingoid bases were dissolved in dried pyridine, peracetylated with acetic anhydride andN,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (overnight at 25 °C) (28Gupta C.M. Radhakrishnan R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4315-4319Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and purified by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates in CHCl3/methanol, 20:1 (v/v). The peracetylated sphingoid bases were detected with ANS under UV illumination, extracted with CHCl3/methanol, 2:1 (v/v), followed by phase partitioning with CHCl3/methanol/0.1 m KOH, 2:1:1 (v/v/v), and dissolved in 0.5 ml of CDCl3 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional homonuclear correlation (1H,1H-COSY) spectra were recorded on a 600 MHz AVANCE DRX-600 spectrometer (Bruker) at 300 K with internal CDCl3 (δH = 7.24) as reference using XWINMR software (Bruker). Peracetylated (E)-sphing-4-enine (Sigma) was used as reference substance. We employed a bioinformatics strategy to identify candidate sequences for sphingolipid Δ4-desaturases. Using PSI-blast (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28590-28596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) protein sequences as queries, we assembled an extensive collection of sequences showing the histidine box sequence motifs characteristic for membrane-bound desaturases and hydroxylases. The final collection of 397 sequences from various organisms was grouped into families as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and each family was assigned a putative biochemical function based on experimentally characterized member sequences (Fig. 2). A candidate family for sphingolipid Δ4-desaturases was identified based on the following criteria. 1) The family should consist exclusively of sequences with so far unknown biochemical function. 2) It should contain sequences from animals, plants, and fungi, because Δ4-desaturated sphingolipids have been found in all these organisms. 3) The family should not contain sequences from S. cerevisiae, because this is one of the few eukaryotic organisms lacking Δ4-desaturated sphingolipids. One family with sequences from H. sapiens, M. musculus, Rattus norvegicus, D. melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans (animals),A. thaliana, Lycopersicon esculentum (plants),S. pombe, C. albicans, N. crassa(fungi), and Toxoplasma gondii conformed to all three criteria (Fig. 2, red branch, and Fig.3). Three of these sequences, DES-1 fromD. melanogaster, MDES from M. musculus, and MLD from H. sapiens, have previously been studied without knowing their biochemical function (19Endo K. Akiyama T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Endo K. Matsuda Y. Kobayashi S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1997; 39: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Cadena D.L. Kurten R.C. Gill G.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6960-6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To unify nomenclature, we will call this new family the DES family and refer to mouse MDES and human MLD both as DES1, to the second mouse homologue as DES2, and to the DES homologue from C. albicans as Des1p. 4Yeast nomenclature requires gene and protein names consisting of tree letters followed by a number. The number inC. albicans Des1p does not imply that it is a mouse or human DES1 homologue. C. albicans Des1p is equally related to both DES1 and DES2, as evident from Fig. 3. There is also a DES2 homologue in H. sapiens, but because we could not obtain its full-length sequence, we did not characterize it further. To investigate if the sequences in the DES family in fact encode sphingolipid Δ4-desaturases, the complete open reading frames coding for H. sapiens DES1, M. musculus DES1 and DES2, D. melanogaster DES-1, the DES homologue from L. esculentum, and C. albicansDes1p were cloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2 under the control of the inducible GAL1 promotor. The resulting plasmids were used to transform the S. cerevisiae sur2Δ mutant (10Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this mutant, the sphingolipid C-4-hydroxylase gene SUR2 (10Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11062-11068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) is disrupted, so that sphinganine is the only sphingoid base found in the sphingolipids. It was expected that these sphinganine-containing sphingolipids would be suitable as substrates for Δ4-desaturation. Expression of H. sapiens DES1, M. musculus DES1 and DES2, D. melanogaster DES-1, and C. albicans Des1p indeed resulted in the formation of sphingolipids containing the Δ4-desaturated sphingoid base (E)-sphing-4-enine (H. sapiens DES1, 2.1 mol %; M. musculus DES1, 0.2 mol %;M. musculus DES2, 0.7 mol %; D. melanogasterDES-1, 5.4 mol %; C. albicans Des1p, 6.3 mol %) (Fig. 4). In sur2Δ cells expressing the DES homologue from L. esculentum and in cells transformed with the empty vector pYES2 (control), no (E)-sphing-4-enine could be detected. In summary, H. sapiens DES1, M. musculus DES1 and DES2, D. melanogaster DES-1, and C. albicansDes1p show sphingolipid Δ4-desaturase activity, whereas no such activity could be detected with the DES homologue from L. esculentum under these experimental conditions. The identity of the sphingoid bases indicated in Fig.4 was confirmed by HPLC/MS. In the negative ion mode, pseudomolecular ions with (m/z = M r − 1) corresponding to the DNP derivatives of the sphingoid bases were detected at the expected retention times, with m/z = 466 for sphinganine, m/z = 464 for (E)-sphing-4-enine, and m/z = 482 for 4-hydroxysphinganine.

https://openalex.org/W2041752371,"Lamellar bodies are the specialized secretory organelles of alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells through which the cell packages pulmonary surfactant and regulates its secretion. Surfactant within lamellar bodies is densely packed as circular arrays of lipid membranes and appears to be the product of several trafficking and biosynthetic processes. To elucidate these processes, we reported previously on the generation of a monoclonal antibody (3C9) that recognizes a unique protein of the lamellar body membrane of 180 kDa, which we named LBM180. We report that mass spectrometry of the protein precipitated by this antibody generated a partial sequence that is identical to the ATP-binding cassette protein, ABCA3. Homology analysis of partial sequences suggests that this protein is highly conserved among species. The ABCA3 gene transcript was found in cell lines of human lung origin, in ATII cells of human, rat, and mouse, as well as different tissues of rat, but the highest expression of ABCA3 was observed in ATII cells. Expression of this transcript was at its maximum prior to birth, and hormonal induction of ABCA3 transcript was observed in human fetal lung at the same time as other surfactant protein transcripts were induced, suggesting that ABCA3 is developmentally regulated. Molecular and biochemical studies show that ABCA3 is targeted to vesicle membranes and is found in the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies. Because ABCA3 is a member of a subfamily of ABC transporters that are predominantly known to be involved in the regulation of lipid transport and membrane trafficking, we speculate that this protein may play a key role in lipid organization during the formation of lamellar bodies.

Dobbs L.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 395-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Dobbs L.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S31-S32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surfactant consists predominantly of phospholipids, synthesized by alveolar type II (ATII)1 cells, and several unique proteins. Surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D are synthesized by ATII cells, but with the exception of SP-C, they are also produced by other cells (3Rooney S.A. Young S.L. Mendelson C.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 4Batenburg J.J. Haagsman H.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 235-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The alveolar surfactant pool size appears to be controlled primarily by ATII cells that regulate both secretion to and re-uptake from the alveolar space. Prior to secretion, surfactant lipids along with surfactant proteins are stored in lamellar bodies as densely packed lamellae and are secreted into the alveolar lumen by regulated exocytosis (5Ryan U.S. Ryan J.W. Smith D.S. Tissue & Cell. 1975; 7: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The average ATII cell normally contains 150 ± 30 lamellar bodies (6Crystal R.G. West J.B. Weibel E.R. Barnes P.J. Crystal R.G. The Lung. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1999: 564Google Scholar) with an in vivobasal secretion rate of ∼15 lamellar bodies per h in rat lung (7Young S.L. Kremers S.A. Apple J.S. Crapo J.D. Brumley G.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 51: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ATII cells also endocytose surfactant from the alveolar space, some of which is recycled to lamellar bodies (8Hallman M. Epstein B.L. Gluck L. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Chander A. Reicherter J. Fisher A.B. J. Clin.

Invest. 1987; 79: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because of its central role in lung surfactant turnover, we have focused on the assembly of this organelle and the proteins that distinguish it from other secretory organelles. Lamellar bodies appear to be at the intersection of several membrane trafficking and vesicle sorting pathways. Surfactant lipids and proteins are targeted to lamellar bodies from both the secretory and endocytic pathways. SP-B and SP-C are delivered to lamellar bodies from the endoplasmic reticulum via the secretory pathway (13Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Haagsman H.P. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. van Golde L.M. Geuze H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L479-L486PubMed Google Scholar, 14Beers M.F. Lomax C.A. Russo S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15287-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas SP-A is secreted to the airspace and subsequently internalized and trafficked to lamellar bodies via clathrin-coated pits through early and late endosomes (12Young S.L. Fram E.K. Larson E. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L19-L26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ryan R.M. Morris R.E. Rice W.R. Ciraolo G. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized lipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, are also delivered to the lamellar body from the endoplasmic reticulum via the secretory pathway (16Chevalier G. Collet A.J. Anat. Rec. 1972; 174: 289-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17Jobe A. Ikegami M. Sarton-Miller I. Jones S. Yu G. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1983; 750: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Surfactant lipids are internalized and delivered to lamellar bodies by two pathways, one clathrin-dependent and another clathrin-independent but actin-dependent (19Muller W.J. Zen K. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L11-L19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins essential for the formation of lamellar bodies have not been completely defined. SP-B appears to be one of the key proteins necessary for the proper organization of lamellar bodies. Newborns with hereditary SP-B deficiency have poorly formed lamellar bodies and abnormal surfactant (20deMello D.E. Heyman S. Phelps D.S. Hamvas A. Nogee L. Cole S. Colten H.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21deMello D.E. Nogee L.M. Heyman S. Krous H.F. Hussain M. Merritt T.A. Hsueh W. Haas J.E. Heidelberger K. Schumacher R. J. Pediatr. 1994; 125: 43-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similar abnormalities have been demonstrated in SP-B-deficient mice (22Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Stripp B.R. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). However, other contributing factors must also exist because loss of lamellar bodies or poorly formed lamellar bodies have been observed in abnormalities associated with refractory neonatal respiratory failure and congenital alveolar proteinosis where SP-B appears normal (23Cutz E. Wert S.E. Nogee L.M. Moore A.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Tryka A.F. Wert S.E. Mazursky J.E. Arrington R.W. Nogee L.M. Pediatr. Dev. Pathol. 2000; 3: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the formation and organization of lamellar bodies, we began the process of identifying proteins that are uniquely expressed in this organelle. In our previous report (25Zen K. Notarfrancesco K. Oorschot V. Slot J.W. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L172-L183PubMed Google Scholar), we described the generation of a panel of 30 antibodies against the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies isolated from rat ATII cells. One of these antibodies, monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3C9, labels lamellar bodies of ATII cells with high specificity. Further characterization revealed that the antigen is an integral membrane protein with a molecular mass of 180 kDa, which we named LBM180. The present study identifies LBM180 as ABCA3, a member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, and characterizes temporal, spatial, and regulated expression. ABC transporters represent the largest family of transmembrane proteins, and its members have been found in every organism examined so far (26Dean M. Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins bind ATP and use the energy of its hydrolysis to drive the transport of various substrates across cell membranes (27Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar, 28Childs, S., and Ling, V. (1994) Important Adv. Oncol.21–36Google Scholar, 29Dean M. Allikmets R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The human ABC proteins are classified into subfamilies that include the ABCA subfamily of lipid transporters, multidrug resistance/transmembrane-associated proteins, adrenoleukodystrophy proteins, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (30Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). They transport a wide variety of substrates including lipids, ions, amino acids, peptides, sugars, vitamins, steroid hormones, and toxic compounds (30Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Their distinguishing features are two nucleotide binding domains with conserved Walker A and B motifs, both involved in ATP binding (present in many other ATP-utilizing proteins), one conserved sequence diagnostic to the ABC unit called the “ABC signature” located between the Walker A and B sequences, and 12 membrane-spanning helices (31Schriml L.M. Dean M. Genomics. 2000; 64: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity appears to be determined by the transmembrane domains, whereas coupling of the two nucleotide binding domains provides the energy required for transport. ABCA3 was originally cloned from a human medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line, and in humans, its message is expressed most highly in lung (32Klugbauer N. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Connors T.D. Van Raay T.J. Petry L.R. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Burn T.C. Genomics. 1997; 39: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, Yamano et al. (34Yamano G. Funahashi H. Kawanami O. Zhao L.X. Ban N. Uchida Y. Morohoshi T. Ogawa J. Shioda S. Inagaki N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) cloned ABCA3 from human lung and showed, by immunohistochemical analyses, that ABCA3 is an ATII cell lamellar body membrane protein. They also demonstrated that ABCA3 protein had a molecular mass of 150 kDa in human lung but when expressed in HEK 293 cells, the protein had a molecular mass of 180 kDa. ABCA3 is a member of the ABCA subfamily of transporters and shares high homology with ABCA1. ABCA1, along with a number of other transporters belonging to the same subfamily, is believed to participate in the regulation of cellular lipid transport (35Borst P. Zelcer N. van Helvoort A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 128-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 36Kaminski W.E. Orso E. Diederich W. Klucken J. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consequently Yamano et al. (34Yamano G. Funahashi H. Kawanami O. Zhao L.X. Ban N. Uchida Y. Morohoshi T. Ogawa J. Shioda S. Inagaki N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) suggested that ABCA3 may function as a transporter of the phospholipid components of pulmonary surfactant. We report that ABCA3 was identified by immunoprecipitation from purified lamellar bodies of rat lung with mAb 3C9 confirming the previous results in another species. The ABCA3 transcript was found in cell lines of human lung origin, in human, rat, and mouse ATII cells with the highest expression of ABCA3 mRNA observed in ATII cells. The transcript was also observed in significant quantities in several non-lung tissues in rats. The protein appears to be developmentally and hormonally regulated with a pattern similar to other surfactant-related proteins. Antibodies generated against peptides derived from the human ABCA3 sequence recognized a 180-kDa lamellar body protein in human fetal ATII cells. These together with previous results establish the presence of a preferentially expressed and developmentally regulated ABC transporter in lamellar bodies of ATII cell. Preliminary reports of this work have been published as abstracts (37Mulugeta S. Annan R.S. Notarfancesco K. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 43Google Scholar, 38Mulugeta S. Gonzales L.W. Ballard P.L. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: A496Google Scholar). The human full-length ABCA3 cDNA was prepared by amplifying three overlapping ∼2-kb segments of cDNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR method according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Advantage, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA of cells and tissues was transcribed by enzymatic reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification. The three segments chosen had unique restriction sites in their overlapping regions, namely BamHI,DraIII, and BsmI, and each were ligated into a TOPO-TA vector (pCR 2.1-TOPO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Following amplification of the plasmids in competent bacterial cells (Invitrogen), the three segments were cut with the aforementioned restriction enzymes and were ligated to each other. The primers (primer nucleotide numbering is based on the data base, from the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI), data accession number NM001089, of the human ABCA3) generated for these segments are as follows: forward primers, 5′-GACCACCTACTTCTCTAGCAGCACTGGGCG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides −47 to −18 from the START (ATG) codon; 5′-GGGCCATCTGGGATCTTCTTC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 2661–2681; and 5′-GAGGGGGGCGGCTTTAATGAGCGGTGCCTTGTG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 3602–3634; reverse primers, 5′-GGTAGGTCGAGGGACGGGACGTCATGGTCGTGC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 3111–3143; 5′-CTGCACGCACGGAAGTGC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 4061–4078; and 5′-CGGGAGTACGGGTCCTACGTCGTAGCGTAGAGG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 5841–5873. The 310-bp ABCA3 cDNAs of cells and tissues were prepared by RT-PCR using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GCGAGTGCGCGGCTTTTCCCTCCGAGAAGGACTT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 874–906; and reverse primer, 5′-CCGGATGTACCCAGGTTCTCCGCCATCAGGGGA-3′ (complement to bases corresponding to the peptide SPDGGEPGYIR), corresponding to nucleotides 1151–1183. EGFP/ABCA3 cDNA fusion constructs were generated by ligating the full-length hABCA3 cDNA into a pEGFP-N1 amino-terminal protein fusion vector (CLONTECH) after removing the STOP (TGA) codon of ABCA3 by cutting at an internal BglI restriction site located near the STOP site of ABCA3. All resultant plasmids were transformed into competent bacterial cells (Invitrogen) for amplification. Two peptides from putative antigenic regions of the deduced amino acid sequence of human ABCA3 were synthesized and used to immunize rabbits. These regions of the protein have no homologies to any other proteins in the NCBI data base and no homologies to any known rabbit sequence. The peptides prepared were CQEKERRLKEYM (ABCA3 luminal loop) and CGKPRAVAGKE (ABCA3 cytosolic domain) producing antibody 1 and antibody 2, respectively. Protein samples were separated with SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Samples were solubilized in sample buffer (125 mm Tris/HCl, 0.32 m sucrose, 2% (w/v) SDS, 65 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) at room temperature. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (BA83, 0.32-μm pore size; Schleicher & Schuell) overnight at 20 mA in transfer buffer (12.5 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 96 mmglycine, 0.1% SDS, 15% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.0). Protein-binding sites were blocked by TBS containing 2–5% non-fat dry milk for 60 min at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with primary antibody in TBS/milk solution for 2 h at room temperature. After three 15-min washes with TBS, the nitrocellulose was incubated for another 60 min at room temperature in TBS/milk solution containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, -rat, or, -rabbit IgG (1:2000 normal dilution). Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL System, Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was prepared from cells and tissues using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (BA83, 0.32-μm pore size; Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were prehybridized in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 4 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out overnight in the same buffer containing 106 cpm/ml of a 32P-labeled 310-bp ABCA3 cDNA fragment. The filters were washed twice for 15 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then twice for 20 min in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C, and the filters were exposed to a PhosphorImaging screen for 24–72 h. The intensities of signals on the autoradiogram were quantified on a PhosphorImager using the Quantity One computer software (Bio-Rad). To correct for RNA loading, the obtained signals were normalized with the densitometer quantified ethidium bromide-stained 28 S or 18 S bands. Animal protocols were reviewed and authorized by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of both the University of Pennsylvania and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA). “Timed-pregnant” Wistar rats (mating day = Gestational Day (GD) 1, term = GD 22) and newborn Wistar rats were used. Pregnant rats were delivered by Caesarian section at GD 17, 19, and 21 or were allowed to deliver naturally. Neonatal rats were designated to be 1-day-old postnatal day (PD) 1. PD 1, 4, 7, 14, and 16-week-old (as adult) rats were subjected to study. All animals were sacrificed by cutting the abdominal aorta after a surgical level (toe pinch) of anesthesia was induced with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (<50 mg/kg). Cells in culture were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and washed. Lung tissues were cryosectioned (5–8 μm), and sections adhered to slides. The slides were incubated in NaBH4 to reduce tissue autofluorescence, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). After washing, cells or sections were blocked with 5% normal goat serum, washed with PBS, incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with fluorescent Texas Red-conjugated secondary IgG for 1 h. Specimens were mounted in Mowiol and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Antigen retrieval by anti-ABCA3 was carried out as described previously (39Robinson J.M. Vandre D.D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells on glass cover slips were rinsed in serum-free medium, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and treated with 1% SDS for 5 min before continuing with immunofluorescence described above. Samples were observed with inverted Nikon fluorescence microscopes equipped with either a cooled CCD camera and MetaMorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) or Bio-Rad Microradiance 2000 confocal attachment (Bio-Rad). Human fetal lungs were obtained from 14- to 22-week gestation therapeutic abortions under protocols approved by the Committee on Human Research at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Fetal lung parenchyma was minced into 1-mm3 pieces and placed in organ culture, as described previously (40Wagle S. Bui A. Ballard P.L. Shuman H. Gonzales J. Gonzales L.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L381-L390PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue pieces were distributed in two parallel strips on 60-mm culture dishes placed on a platform that rocks (3 oscillations/min) to expose the explants alternately to serum-free Waymouth medium (2 ml/dish) or an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. The explants were maintained for 1–5 days in medium without (control) or with dexamethasone (Dex, 10 nm) 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1 mm) plus isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, 0.1 mm), or both Dex and the cAMP agents. IBMX was added to all explants treated with 8-bromo-cAMP to maintain tissue cAMP levels. Fresh medium was added every 24 h. Tissue explants were harvested either before culture (preculture) or at various times during culture. Hormones were added to the medium of treated explants after 24 h of culture. The hormone concentrations used maximally stimulated phosphatidylcholine synthesis in the explants as described previously (41Gonzales L.W. Ballard P.L. Gonzales J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ATII cells were isolated using elastase essentially according to the method of Dobbs and Williams (42Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141PubMed Google Scholar). The lungs of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused via the pulmonary artery and excised. The lungs were lavaged with elastase solution, chopped, placed in a flask, and shaken. The tissue was filtered through graded filters; the cells were centrifuged and then resuspended in minimal essential media without serum. The cells were “panned” on IgG plates to remove the macrophages and lymphocytes and replated in minimal essential media with 10% fetal calf serum. Every preparation of isolated ATII cells was identified by morphology and by staining of lamellar bodies with phosphine 3R (Pfaltz & Bauer, Inc.) or Nile Red (Sigma). Viability was monitored by exclusion of trypan blue. Rare cultures with more than l0% macrophages were discarded. Fetal ATII precursor cells were isolated from human (14- to 22-week gestational age) lung using collagenase-trypsin digestion and differential adhesion to remove fibroblasts and plated on coverslips coated with extracellular matrix produced by Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (43Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J.F. Margraf L.R. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 44Gonzales L.W. Angampalli S. Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Feinstein S.I. Matlapudi A. Ballard P.L. Pediatr. Pathol. Mol. Med. 2001; 20: 387-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Final cultures contained fewer than 10% fibroblasts. Cells were cultured in Waymouth's medium in 35-mm dishes. The following day, Dex (10 nm), cAMP (0.1 mm), and IBMX (0.1 mm) (DCI) were added to the media for the remainder of the culture period. Media were changed daily, and cells were studied at days 1 and 4 of culture. Fetal human lung treatment results in the differentiation of the precursor cells into ATII-like cells that contain lamellar bodies, express SP-A, -B, and –C mRNAs, process SP-B and -C proprotein to mature forms, and have regulated exocytosis of phospholipids (45Gonzales L.W. Ballard P.L. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 262AGoogle Scholar). Lamellar bodies were isolated from rat lungs cleared of blood or from human lung explants using upward flotation on a sucrose density gradient, as described previously (46Chander A. Dodia C.R. Gil J. Fisher A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 753: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The lamellar body fraction was collected between 0.35 and 0.50 m sucrose and pelleted in 0.20 m sucrose by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. To isolate lamellar body membranes, the freshly isolated lamellar body fraction was suspended in hypotonic solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm sucrose, pH 7.2) along with protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/mlN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin A) and set on ice for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was loaded on a cushion of 0.50m sucrose and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g using a swinging bucket rotor. The lamellar body membrane fraction was recovered from the pellet, whereas the lamellar body content fraction was recovered at the interface of buffer and 0.50m sucrose. Total RNA from day 4 control and hormone (DCI)-treated cells was used to prepare cDNAs and biotin-labeled cRNAs according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). We performed hybridization with microarray chip 9000183 (Affymetrix), which contains probes for ∼5,600 human genes, and analyzed data using Affymetrix software. Two separate experiments were performed with cells from lungs of 14- and 17-week gestation. Immunoprecipitation was carried out, as described previously (47Xie J. Drumm M.L., Ma, J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Lamellar body membrane fraction was resuspended in ice-cold PBS. To reduce nonspecific binding, the lamellar body membrane suspension was incubated with-end-over-end rotation for 90 min at 4 °C with 10 μl of preimmune serum (normal goat serum, Jackson ImmunoResearch) followed by 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred into a clean tube and incubated with mAb 3C9 on end-to-end rotation for 90 min at 4 °C. Antibody complex was then precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose by incubation for 90 min at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The immune complex protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and the bound proteins were solubilized with 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) (10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS, and 0.062 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, and the proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Transfection was performed by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 4 μg of pEGFP-N1-tagged ABCA3-containing plasmid was preincubated with 6 μl of FuGENE 6 in a total volume of 100 ml of serum-free medium at room temperature for 15–30 min. The complex mixture was added dropwise to 60–70% confluent cells in a 35-mm dish containing 3 ml of fresh medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times, and medium was replaced 3 days after start of transfection. Experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. All values were expressed as mean ± S.E. All computations were performed using SigmaStat 2.0 statistical analysis software (Jandel Corp., Chicago, IL). The lamellar body membrane-specific protein LBM180 was identified previously using monoclonal antibody, mAb 3C9 (25Zen K. Notarfrancesco K. Oorschot V. Slot J.W. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. Am. J.

However, the individual contributions of the four CYP3Agenes to total CYP3A activity remain unclear. To elucidate the role ofCYP3A7, we have studied its expression in human liver and intestine. In both organs, expression of CYP3A7 mRNA was polymorphic. The recently identified CYP3A7*1C allele was a consistent marker of increased CYP3A7 expression both in liver and intestine, whereas the CYP3A7*1B allele was associated with increased CYP3A7 expression only in liver. Because of the replacement of part of the CYP3A7 promoter by the corresponding region of CYP3A4, theCYP3A7*1C allele contains the proximal ER6 motif ofCYP3A4. The pregnane X and constitutively activated receptors were shown to bind with higher affinity to CYP3A4-ER6 than to CYP3A7-ER6 motifs and transactivated only promoter constructs containing CYP3A4-ER6. Furthermore, we identified mutations inCYP3A7*1C in addition to the ER6 motif that were necessary only for activation by the constitutively activated receptor. We conclude that the presence of the ER6 motif of CYP3A4mediates the high expression of CYP3A7 in subjects carryingCYP3A7*1C.

The CYP3A subfamily composed of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A43 in humans is of special importance because it accounts for as much as 30% of total liver cytochrome P450 content (1Shimada T. Yamazaki H. Mimura M. Inui Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 414-423PubMed Google Scholar). At least 50% of all medicines are metabolized by enzymes of the CYP3A subfamily (2Guengerich F.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The most abundant CYP3A isoform in liver and intestine is CYP3A4. Its interindividual hepatic expression varies 60-fold (3Özdemir V. Kalow W. Tang B.-K. Paterson A.D. Walker S.E. Endrenyi L. Kashuba A.D. Pharmacogenetics. 2000; 10: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and the in vivo function as assessed by clearance displays at least a 20-fold difference (4Wilkinson G.R. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1996; 24: 475-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Induction by xenobiotics (e.g. rifampin) and endogenous compounds (e.g. steroid hormones) further modulates the variability of CYP3A4 expression among individuals. The induction of CYP3A4and most likely that of other CYP3A genes is mediated by the nuclear receptor NR1I2 (pregnane X receptor (PXR)1) (reviewed in Ref. 5Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).CYP3A4-inducing compounds bind to PXR and stimulate the transcriptional activity of the receptor. Additional nuclear receptors such as NR1I3 (constitutively activated receptor (CAR)) and NR1I1 (vitamin D receptor) have also been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of CYP3A4 (6Zelko I. Negishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Thummel K.E. Brimer C. Yasuda K. Thottassery J. Senn T. Lin Y. Ishizuka H. Kharasch E. Schuetz J. Schuetz E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although the substrate specificity of CYP3A5 is similar to that of CYP3A4, CYP3A5 has been regarded to be less important for drug elimination because it is expressed at much lower levels than CYP3A4 in most livers of Caucasian origin (8Hustert E. Haberl M. Burk O. Wolbold R., He, Y.-Q. Klein K. Nuessler A.C. Neuhaus P. Klattig J. Eiselt R. Koch I. Zibat A. Brockmöller J. Halpert J.R. Zanger U.M. Wojnowski L. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). CYP3A43 is expressed at very low levels in adult human livers, accounting for only 0.1–0.2% of CYP3A4transcripts (9Gellner K. Eiselt R. Hustert E. Arnold H. Koch I. Haberl M. Deglmann C.J. Burk O. Buntefuss D. Escher S. Bishop C. Koebe H.-G. Brinkmann U. Klenk H.-P. Kleine K. Meyer U.A. Wojnowski L. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 10Westlind A. Malmebo S. Johansson I. Otter C. Andersson T.B. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Oscarson M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, its contribution to the elimination of CYP3A substrates is regarded to be negligible (10Westlind A. Malmebo S. Johansson I. Otter C. Andersson T.B. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Oscarson M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This variability in CYP3A expression and function explains why the intensity and duration of drug action and the occurrence of side effects show large patient-to-patient variability. Although a recent analysis suggests that, depending on the drug, 60–90% of patient-to-patient variability in CYP3A function is caused by genetic factors (3Özdemir V. Kalow W. Tang B.-K. Paterson A.D. Walker S.E. Endrenyi L. Kashuba A.D. Pharmacogenetics. 2000; 10: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), the sources for variability in constitutive CYP3A expression remain largely unknown. However, a common genetic polymorphism in intron 3 ofCYP3A5 was recently identified. It results in high expression genotypes and explains the >10-fold increase in CYP3A5 protein expression observed in 10–30% of livers of Caucasian origin (8Hustert E. Haberl M. Burk O. Wolbold R., He, Y.-Q. Klein K. Nuessler A.C. Neuhaus P. Klattig J. Eiselt R. Koch I. Zibat A. Brockmöller J. Halpert J.R. Zanger U.M. Wojnowski L. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 11Kuehl P. Zhang J. Lin Y. Lamba J. Assem M. Schuetz J. Watkins P.B. Daly A. Wrighton S.A. Hall S.D. Maurel P. Relling M. Brimer C. Yasuda K. Venkataramanan R. Strom S. Thummel K. Boguski M.S. Schuetz E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). In some persons, CYP3A5 can contribute to >50% of total CYP3A content, thus exceeding CYP3A4 levels. Correspondingly, CYP3A5 has been proposed to contribute substantially to the elimination of CYP3A substrates (11Kuehl P. Zhang J. Lin Y. Lamba J. Assem M. Schuetz J. Watkins P.B. Daly A. Wrighton S.A. Hall S.D. Maurel P. Relling M. Brimer C. Yasuda K. Venkataramanan R. Strom S. Thummel K. Boguski M.S. Schuetz E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). These findings could explain why there is less variability in the in vivo clearance than one would predict based on the >60-fold variability in CYP3A4 expression. The role of CYP3A7 in the biotransformation of CYP3A substrates in adult liver and intestine is not known. CYP3A7 accounts for 30–50% of total cytochrome P450 in fetal liver (12Shimada T. Yamazaki H. Mimura M. Wakamiya N. Ueng Y.F. Guengerich F.P. Inui Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1996; 24: 515-522PubMed Google Scholar) and was at first regarded to be exclusively expressed there (13Komori M. Nishio K. Kitada M. Shiramatsu K. Muroya K. Soma M. Nagashima K. Kamataki T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4430-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Since then, CYP3A7expression was detected in 54–88% of adult livers (14Schuetz J.D. Beach D.L. Guzelian P.S. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Greuet J. Pichard L. Bonfils C. Domergue J. Maurel P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, quantitative data on CYP3A7 expression in adult livers are missing. Moreover, the mechanisms responsible for expression ofCYP3A7 in adult livers remain unknown. Using a large collection of human livers, we report here thatCYP3A7 mRNA is polymorphically expressed in both liver and intestine, with ∼11% of subjects belonging to a distinct subgroup of high expression phenotype. Two-thirds of the subjects in this group carry the CYP3A7*1C or (less frequently) theCYP3A7*1B promoter allele. The CYP3A7*1C allele is the exclusive marker of high CYP3A7 expression in the intestine. Functional differences between CYP3A7 andCYP3A7*1C proximal promoter ER6 (evertedrepeat separated by 6 base pairs) motifs in binding and activation by the nuclear receptors PXR and CAR were identified as the mechanisms responsible for the high CYP3A7expression in CYP3A7*1C carriers. Normal human liver tissue samples were obtained from patients of Caucasian origin undergoing liver resection at the Department of Surgery, Campus Virchow-Clinic, Humboldt University (Berlin, Germany) (16Lang T. Klein K. Fischer J. Nüssler A.K. Neuhaus P. Hofmann U. Eichelbaum M. Schwab M. Zanger U.M. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Liver pieces were immediately placed into RNAlater (Ambion Inc.), incubated for 24 h at 4 °C, and then stored frozen at −80 °C until RNA isolation. Human intestine samples were obtained from patients of Caucasian origin undergoing either gastrectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy at the Department of Surgery, Robert Bosch Hospital (Stuttgart, Germany). In addition, a liver wedge biopsy was obtained from a subset of these patients. Normal intestine tissue (duodenum or proximal jejunum) was dissected and either immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen or incubated for 24 h at 4 °C in RNAlater and then stored at –80 °C until RNA preparation. The matching liver biopsies were processed as the intestine samples. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples of the patients using the QIAamp DNA blood kit (QIAGEN Inc.). To determine the CYP3A7 genotypes, a 614-bp fragment of the CYP3A7 proximal promoter and exon 1 (−426 to +188 with respect to the transcriptional start site) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGC TCT GTC TGG CTG GGT ATG A-3′ (bases 110480–110501 of GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF280107) and 5′-GAA CAG TTA CTC ACA GAT AGA GGA GTA TC-3′ (bases 111093 to 111065). The standard PCR consisted of 1× PCR buffer with 1.5 mm MgCl2 (QIAGEN Inc.), 200 μm dATP, 200 μm dCTP, 200 μmdGTP, 200 μm dTTP, 0.5 μm each primer, 1.25 units Taq polymerase (QIAGEN Inc.), and 20 ng of genomic DNA in a total volume of 50 μl. Cycling conditions were one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min and 34 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 62 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc.), directly sequenced using the ABI BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and analyzed using the PHRED/PHRAP/POLYPHRED/CONSED software package (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). A restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was developed for the CYP3A7*1C allele. Oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATG ACC TAA GAA GAT GGA GTG-3′ (bases 110153–110173 of GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF280107) and 5′-GAA GGG CAT GGT CTA CAC TAT-3′ (bases 112620 to 112600) were used to amplify a 2468-bp fragment of the CYP3A7 gene. PCR was performed with 100–200 ng of genomic DNA, 1× OptiPerform buffer III (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), 1× OptiZyme Enhancer (PAN Biotech), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μmdATP, 200 μm dCTP, 200 μm dGTP, 200 μm dTTP, 1 μm each primer, and 1 unit of PowerScript (PAN Biotech) in a volume of 50 μl. Cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturing cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min and by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were analyzed on an agarose gel, and the 2468-bp fragment was purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and digested with the restriction endonuclease SspI. The wild-type allele fragment has two SspI sites (positions 110734/110739 and 112353/112358), resulting in three fragments of 1617, 585, and 266 bp. In contrast, in the CYP3A7*1C allele, the site at position 110734/110739 is destroyed through mutation of the T at position 110739 to G (corresponding to position –167 of theCYP3A7 promoter). The resulting two fragments have sizes of 2202 and 266 bp, respectively (see also Fig. 2). Total RNA was prepared from human liver and intestine samples using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. RNA was treated with DNase I to remove contaminating genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA was generated from 0.5 to 1 μg of total RNA using random hexamer primers and TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) according to the standard protocol of the manufacturer. PCRs were set up with cDNA corresponding to 35 or 40 ng of total RNA for liver or intestine samples, respectively, and the TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Primers were used at a final concentration of 400 nm, and probes at 200 nm. Expression levels ofCYP3A7, CYP3A4, villin, and 18 S rRNA were quantified by TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR using the ABI 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The experiments were performed according to a standard protocol for the ABI 7700 sequence detection system. Assays were done in triplicate. Oligonucleotide primers and probes were designed with the PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems). Probes were labeled with the 5′-reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein and the 3′-quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. Oligonucleotides used forCYP3A7 were as follows: primers 5′-AAG GGC TAT TGG ACG TTT GAC A-3′ and 5′-ATC CCA CTG GCC CGA AAG-3′ and probe 5′-TAT TTA TGA CTG TCA ACA GCC TAT GCT GGC TAT CA-3′. The specificity of the assay was determined using in vitro transcribed CYP3A4,CYP3A5, and CYP3A43 RNAs. Serial dilutions ofin vitro transcribed CYP3A7 or of a plasmid containing CYP3A7 cDNA were used to create the calibration curve. Oligonucleotides used for CYP3A4 were as follows: primers 5′-TCA GCC TGG TGC TCC TCT ATC TAT-3′ and 5′-AAG CCC TTA TGG TAG GAC AAA ATA TTT-3′ and probe 5′-TCC AGG GCC CAC ACC TCT GCC T-3′. The specificity of the CYP3A4 assay was determined using in vitro transcribed CYP3A5,CYP3A7, and CYP3A43. Serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed CYP3A4 were used to create the calibration curve. Oligonucleotides used for villin were as follows: primers 5′-CTG GCA ACC TTA GGG ACT GG-3′ and 5′-GTT AGC ATT GAA CAC GTC CAC TTT-3′ and probe 5′-CCA GAT CAC TGC TGA GGT CAC AAG C-3′. To create the calibration curve for the villin assay, serial dilutions of Caco-2 TC7 cDNA were used. The expression levels of CYP3A7 andCYP3A4 in liver samples were normalized with respect to the expression of 18 S rRNA, as determined using the TaqMan ribosomal RNA control reagents (Applied Biosystems) and serial dilutions of HepG2 cDNA for the calibration curve. CYP3A7 andCYP3A4 expression levels in intestine samples were normalized with respect to the expression levels of villin. CYP3A7 expression data were tested for gaussian distribution by calculating a probability plot with Statgraphics Plus Version 2.0 for Windows (Statistical Graphics Corp.). The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze for statistically significant associations between CYP3A7expression and CYP3A7 genotype. These analyses were performed using GraphPAD InStat Version 3.05 for Windows 95. The eukaryotic expression plasmid for human PXR has been described previously (17Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). To construct a eukaryotic expression plasmid for human CAR, the open reading frame of human CAR was amplified by PCR from human liver cDNA using primers 5′-ATG AAT TCC ACC ATG GCC AGT AGG GAA GAT GAG CTG-3′, which introduced anEcoRI site and an optimized Kozak consensus sequence, and 5′-CGT CTA GAT TAG CTG CAG ATC TCC TGG AGC AG-3′, which introduced anXbaI site. The EcoRI/XbaI-digested PCR fragment was cloned into appropriately digested vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), creating pcDhCAR1, and verified by sequencing. The CYP3A7 proximal promoter (−869 to +50) was amplified from human genomic DNA by PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-GCG GTA CCA TCT CAT CCA TGC CAT GTC TCT TT-3′ and 5′-ACA AGC TTG CTG TTT GCT GGG CTG TGT GTG-3′. The oligonucleotides introduced a KpnI and aHindIII restriction site on the 5′- and 3′-ends of the amplified fragment, respectively. The PCR product was digested withKpnI and HindIII and cloned into appropriately digested luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). The identity of the cloned DNA fragment with the CYP3A7 promoter was verified by sequencing of the resulting plasmid, pGL3-CYP3A7(−869). This plasmid was then digested with KpnI and BglII, leading to deletion of the region between positions –869 and –350; and the overhanging ends were converted to blunt ends by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase and religated. The resulting plasmid, pGL3-CYP3A7(−350), henceforth referred to as the CYP3A7 construct, contains the region between positions –350 and +50. A reporter gene construct containing the CYP3A7*1C variant of the CYP3A7 promoter was obtained by amplification and cloning of the appropriate portion of genomic DNA from a subject heterozygous for CYP3A7*1C. Oligonucleotide primers 5′-CAT AGG TAA AGA TCT GTA GGC A-3′ and 5′-ACA AGC TTG CTG TTT GCT GGG CTG TGT GTG-3′ encompassed the BglII site at position –351 and introduced a HindIII site at position +50, respectively. The PCR product was digested with BglII and HindIII and cloned into appropriately digested pGL3-Basic. A plasmid clone containing the CYP3A7*1C variant was selected by sequencing and is referred to as CYP3A7(*1C). Mutagenesis of the CYP3A7promoter was done using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The single base pair mutations constituting the CYP3A7*1C allele were introduced either alone or in combinations. Thus, mutations at positions –167 and –159, which convert the ER6 motif ofCYP3A7 into the corresponding ER6 motif of CYP3A4(T G AACTCAA A GGAGGTCA, mutated bases in boldface italics), were introduced into the CYP3A7 construct, creating CYP3A7(ER6A4). This construct was further mutated. First, the mutation at position –188 of CYP3A7*1C was introduced, creating CYP3A7(A4:−188,ER6). Second, the mutation at position –129 ofCYP3A7*1C was introduced, creating CYP3A7(A4:ER6,−129). Third, the mutations at positions –181, −179, and −178 ofCYP3A7*1C were introduced, creating CYP3A7(A4:3B,ER6). The CYP3A7(A4:−188,ER6) construct was further mutated by introducing the mutations at positions –181, −179, and −178 of CYP3A7*1C, thus creating CYP3A7*1C(A7:−129). The introduction of all the mutations and the absence of other, undesired mutations were verified by sequencing. To create a CYP3A4 promoter reporter gene comparable in size to the CYP3A7 constructs, unidirectional deletion of pGL3-CYP3A4(−1105) (18Hustert E. Zibat A. Presecan-Siedel E. Eiselt R. Mueller R. Fuß C. Brehm I. Brinkmann U. Eichelbaum M. Wojnowski L. Burk O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1454-1459PubMed Google Scholar) was performed with the double-stranded nested deletion kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing identified a clone encompassing the CYP3A4 promoter region from positions –374 to +51, pGL3-CYP3A4(−374), further referred to as the CYP3A4 construct. Mutation of the ER6 element of the CYP3A4promoter was done by sequential PCR steps according to standard procedures and converting the ER6 motif into the corresponding ER6 motif of CYP3A7 (T T AACTCAA T GGAGGTCA, mutated bases in boldface italics), thus creating CYP3A4(ER6A7). The CYP3A4 construct was further mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit: the T at position –188 was converted to G, creating CYP3A4(A7:−188). The introduction of all the mutations and the absence of other undesired mutations were verified by sequencing. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (17Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The human PXR, CAR, and RXRα proteins were synthesized using the using expression plasmids pcDhPXR (17Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), pcDhCAR1, and pCMX-hRXRα (kindly provided by R. Schüle, Klinik fuer Tumorbiologie, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany) and the TNT T7 Quick Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Oligonucleotides for theMDR1 –7.8-kb enhancer nuclear receptor response element DR4(I) (wild-type) were as described (17Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for theCYP3A4 and CYP3A7 proximal ER6 PXR-binding sites were as follows: ER6-A4 sense, 5′-GAT CCA ATA TGA ACT CAA AGG AGG TCA GTG A-3′; ER6-A4 antisense, 5′-GAT CTC ACT GAC CTC CTT TGA GTT CAT ATT G-3′; ER6–3A7 sense, 5′-GAT CCA ATA TTA ACT CAA TGG AGG TCA GTG A-3′; and ER6–3A7 antisense, 5′-GAT CTC ACT GAC CTC CAT TGA GTT AAT ATT G-3′. Retarded complexes were quantified with the BAS1800 II phosphor-storage scanner (Fuji) and AIDA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The human colon carcinoma cell line LS174T (19Tom B.H. Rutzky L.P. Jakstys M.M. Oyasu R. Kaye C.I. Kahan B.D. In Vitro (Rockville). 1976; 12: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultivated as described previously (17Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). One day before transfection, LS174T cells were plated in 24-well plates (Falcon) at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. The plasmid DNA was transfected using the EffecteneTM transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Usually, 150 ng of reporter gene plasmid, 20 ng of β-galactosidase reference plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH), and 0.1 ng of human PXR or 10 ng of human CAR expression plasmid were used per well. pUC18 plasmid DNA was used to fill up to a total amount of 200 ng of DNA/well. Six to seven hours after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove EffecteneTM-DNA complexes and supplied with fresh medium (without phenol red and supplemented with fetal calf serum that was pretreated with dextran-coated charcoal). Cells cotransfected with the PXR expression plasmid were treated with 10 μm rifampin dissolved in Me2SO or with an equivalent amount (0.1%) of Me2SO only. Transfections were done in triplicate. At least three independent experiments were performed, using at least two different plasmid DNA preparations of each construct. Cells were harvested 40 h after the removal of the EffecteneTM-DNA complexes and lysed with 150 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). After centrifugation, cleared lysates were used for reporter gene assays, which were done in duplicate. For luciferase measurements, 300 μl of an assay solution (25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 50 μm luciferin, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 27 μm coenzyme A, and 30 mm dithiothreitol) were automatically injected into 20 μl of cell lysate, and luminescence was measured immediately for 4 s with an AutoLumat Plus (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). β-Galactosidase assays were done according to Jain and Magrath (20Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the enzyme activity was measured as described above. Luciferase activity was normalized with respect to transfection efficiencies using the corresponding β-galactosidase activity. To identify statistically significant differences, one-way analysis of variance with the Student-Newman-Keuls post-test was performed with mean values of at least three independent experiments done in triplicates using GraphPAD InStat Version 3.05 for Windows 95. CYP3A7 mRNA expression was analyzed in a total of 127 liver samples obtained from adult individuals.CYP3A7 was expressed in every liver. However, interindividual variability of CYP3A7 expression was very pronounced, showing a >700-fold difference (TableI). Statistical analysis demonstrated a clear deviation from gaussian distribution, with a distinct subgroup of 11% of livers that expressed >25,000 (log10 4.4) transcripts/ng of total RNA (Fig. 1,A and B). To compare the expression ofCYP3A7 with that of CYP3A4, we analyzedCYP3A4 expression in the same samples (Table I). On average,CYP3A7 transcripts accounted for only 1.5% of combinedCYP3A4 and CYP3A7 transcripts. However, in the 11% of livers expressing >25,000 CYP3A7 transcripts/ng of total RNA, its contribution was 7.7 ± 5.1% (median of 6.4% and range of 2.4–20.7%). In contrast, the corresponding value was 1.2 ± 2.0% (median of 0.46% and range of 0.01–14.5%) in the 89% of livers expressing lower levels of CYP3A7. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001).Table IExpression of CYP3A7 and CYP3A4 mRNAs in human livers n1-aNumber of samples analyzed.Mean ± S.D.1-bValues are given as transcripts/ng of total RNA and were normalized with respect to the expression of 18 S ribosomal RNA.Range1-bValues are given as transcripts/ng of total RNA and were normalized with respect to the expression of 18 S ribosomal RNA.

Open table in a new tab Recently, several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in the CYP3A7 proximal promoter region, and three alleles (CYP3A7*1B, CYP3A7*1C, andCYP3A7*1D) were defined in Caucasians (11Kuehl P. Zhang J. Lin Y. Lamba J. Assem M. Schuetz J. Watkins P.B. Daly A. Wrighton S.A. Hall S.D. Maurel P. Relling M. Brimer C. Yasuda K. Venkataramanan R. Strom S. Thummel K. Boguski M.S. Schuetz E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of these alleles in CYP3A7 expression, we sequenced the proximal promoter region of CYP3A7, encompassing these alleles, in the subjects of the liver bank. The results, presented in Table II, were in accordance with the previously published allele frequencies (11Kuehl P. Zhang J. Lin Y. Lamba J. Assem M. Schuetz J. Watkins P.B. Daly A. Wrighton S.A. Hall S.D. Maurel P. Relling M. Brimer C. Yasuda K. Venkataramanan R. Strom S. Thummel K. Boguski M.S. Schuetz E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). A restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (Fig. 2) was used to confirm the sequencing data regarding the CYP3A7*1Callele. Subsequently, this assay was used to screen for the presence of this allele. CYP3A7 expression was significantly increased in the livers of all subjects heterozygous or homozygous for theCYP3A7*1C allele (Mann-Whitney U test,p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). TheCYP3A7*1B allele was detected in two subjects, and it was also significantly associated with high CYP3A7 expression (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). A third CYP3A7*1B heterozygote was present in the study group from which we obtained intestine and liver samples. This subject also showed strongly increased CYP3A7 expression in the liver (Fig. 4 B). In contrast,CYP3A7*1D was not associated with high CYP3A7expression (data not shown). CYP3A7*1B,CYP3A7*1C, and CYP3A7*1D were never found together in any subject investigated. With the exception of oneCYP3A7*1C heterozygote, all subjects with theCYP3A7*1C or CYP3A7*1B allele belonged to the group expressing >25,000 transcripts/ng of total RNA. Taken together,CYP3A7*1C and CYP3A7*1B alleles were specifically associated with approximately two-thirds of the cases of increasedCYP3A7 expression in this group (Fig. 1 B).Table IIFrequencies of the CYP3A7*1B, CYP3A7*1C, and CYP3A7*1D promoter allelesIndividuals analyzedHeterozygous individualsHomozygous individualsAllele frequency % CYP3A7*1B104200.96 CYP3A7*1C127713.54 CYP3A7*1D104200.96 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Impact of CYP3A7 promoter alle"

Nuclear receptors exhibit distinct preferences for such motifs depending both on the bound ligand and on the NR box sequence. To better understand the structural basis of motif recognition, we characterized the interaction between estrogen receptor α and the NR box regions of the p160 coactivator TIF2. We have determined the crystal structures of complexes between the ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor α and 12-mer peptides from the Box B2 and Box B3 regions of TIF2. Surprisingly, the Box B3 module displays an unexpected binding mode that is distinct from the canonical LXXLL interaction observed in other ligand-binding domain/NR box crystal structures. The peptide is shifted along the coactivator binding site in such a way that the interaction motif becomes LXXYL rather than the classical LXXLL. However, analysis of the binding properties of wild type NR box peptides, as well as mutant peptides designed to probe the Box B3 orientation, suggests that the Box B3 peptide primarily adopts the “classical” LXXLL orientation in solution.

Like other nuclear receptors (NRs), ERα exhibits a characteristic modular domain organization that includes two autonomous transcriptional activation functions (AF1 and AF2) that regulates transcription through interactions with NR coregulators (1Klinge C.M. Steroids. 2000; 65: 227-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). AF1, which resides in the N-terminal region of ERα, is constitutively active and regulated by growth factors (4Tora L.

In contrast, AF2, which is located in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ER, is entirely dependent on ligand for its activity. In recent years, structural and functional studies of both the AF2 domain of ERα and associated coregulators have greatly enhanced our knowledge of ligand-dependent, ER-mediated transcriptional activation. A large number of coactivators have been isolated that primarily target the LBD of the receptor in a ligand- and AF2-dependent manner (7Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The most widely studied group of AF2 coactivators includes the p160 family of proteins (steroid receptor coactivator 1, TIF2/glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1, and steroid receptor coactivator 3/AIB1) (9Chen H.W.

These factors possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and/or function in complexes with other acetyltransferases such as p300/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein-associated factor (16Blanco J.C.

Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and are therefore believed to influence promoter accessibility. The critical importance of p160 coactivators in ER signaling has been highlighted by recent knockout studies and the discovery of p160 gene amplification in ER-positive breast cancer (19Xu J.M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). A common feature of all AF2 coactivators is that they contain one or more copies of a leucine-rich signature motif, referred to as the LXXLL motif (where X denotes any amino acid) or the NR box (7Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). p160 factors, such as TIF2, contain a central NR-interacting domain with three evenly spaced LXXLL motifs. Differences in the spacing of the LXXLL modules in combination with variable flanking sequences has been shown to account for the overall receptor affinity and in particular NR specificity (21Wärnmark A.

Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p160 recruitment to ER is also influenced by the bound receptor ligand (23Bramlett K.S., Wu, Y. Burris T.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Full-length ERα and the isolated ERαLBD are able to interact with all three LXXLL motifs of TIF2 but have a distinct preference for the second motif (13Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Hormone binding to NRs induces structural rearrangements in the LBD/AF2 domain, resulting in the formation of a specific binding site for coactivators and other regulatory modulators (24Bourguet W. Germain P. Gronemeyer H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Structural studies with peptides corresponding to the LXXLL interaction motifs of p160 coactivators have demonstrated that the binding site, which maps to the AF2 region of the receptor, comprises a shallow groove on the surface of the LBD (25Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). The structure of a complex between the LBD of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and a fragment of the NR-interacting domain of steroid receptor coactivator 1 containing two LXXLL motifs revealed that each module binds along the AF2 site as a helix so that each docking site on the receptor homodimer is occupied (26Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). A similar mode of NR box interaction has been observed with agonist-liganded thyroid and estrogen receptors (25Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L.

In this study, we have taken a structural and biochemical approach to further investigate the interactions between ERα and the LXXLL motifs of TIF2. Recombinant human ERα(1–595) (>80% purity) was obtained from PanVera, and recombinant human ERαLBD (residues 301–553) (>95% purity) was provided by Karo Bio AB (Huddinge, Sweden), respectively. N-terminally biotinylated peptides (>95% purity) were purchased from Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). The human TIF2 LXXLL peptide sequences were as follows: Box B1 (residues 636–649), KGQTKLLQLLTTKS; Box B2 (residues 685–698), EKHKILHRLLQDSS; and Box B3 (residues 740–753), KENALLRYLLDKDD. The mutant peptide sequences were as follows: Box 2/4Y, EKHKILHRYLQDSS; Box 2/AA, EKHKIAHRALQDSS; Box 3/−3K, KEKALLRYLLDKDD; Box 3/1H, KENALHRYLLDKDD; Box 3/5Q, KENALLRYLQDKDD; Box 3/1H/5Q, KENALHRYLQDKDD; Box 3/−3K/1H/5Q, KEKALHRYLQDKDD; Box 3/3H, KENALLRHLLDKDD; and Box 3/3Q, KENALLRQLLDKDD. The 12-mer peptides used for co-crystallization had the following sequences: Box B2, EKHKILHRLLQD; Box B3, KENALLRYLLDK and had unmodified N and C termini. Human ERαLBD (residues Ser301-Thr553) was expressed, purified, and carboxymethylated as described previously (30Hegy G.B. Shackleton C.H.L. Carlquist M. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Sjoholm P. Witkowska H.E. Steroids. 1996; 61: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The RALcore and E2-liganded LBDs were prepared by the inclusion of 75 μmof the respective ligand in the E2-Sepharose column elution buffer. Prior to crystallization, peptide complexes were prepared by the addition of peptides at a peptide to LBD ratio of either 1:1 (Box 2/RALcore) or 5:1 (Box 3/E2) followed by incubation at 18 °C for 12 h. The crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at 18 °C. Diffraction data were collected in-house (Box B2) and at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Box B3) to a maximum resolution of 2.45 and 2.4 Å, respectively. RALcore/Box B2 crystals were cryoprotected by sequential transfer from 5 to 25% ethylene glycol in 5% steps. E2/Box B3 crystals were transferred to 30% (v/v) glycerol prior to freezing. The data were recorded using either a MAR345 image plate (Box B2) or ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector (Box B3) and indexed, reduced, and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar). The structures of the hERα-RALcore/Box B2 and hERα-E2/Box B3 were solved using molecular replacement. In both cases, a single LBD dimer was located within the crystallographic asymmetric unit using the coordinates of a hERαLBD-E2 dimer (Protein Data Bank code1ERE) (28Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W.

The measurements were performed using a BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All of the experiments were performed at 25 °C in a binding buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20. Research grade streptavidin sensor chips were obtained from BIAcore AB. The streptavidin chips were first treated with three 1-min pulses of 50 mm NaOH and 1m NaCl at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Biotinylated peptides were immobilized on individual surfaces to variable responses (20–150 RU). Samples of full-length ERα or ERαLBD liganded with 17β-E2 were then injected over each surface and a control surface with no peptide bound. The chip surfaces were regenerated down to the peptide level by applying two or three 1-min pulses of 10 mm NaOH. Kinetic and affinity determinations were performed using the BIAevaluation software 3.0 (BIAcore AB). Different binding models (different rate equations) were tested in the global curve fitting procedure, and the model best describing the experimental data was a conformational change model (21Wärnmark A.

To examine the structural basis of ER AF2/LXXLL recognition, we co-crystallized ERαLBD with two 12-amino acid peptides derived from the second (Box B2) and third (Box B3) NR box regions of TIF2. To facilitate crystal growth we screened a range of liganded LBDs and found that a different agonist/ER combination yielded crystals depending on the peptide used. The resultant NR Box B2 and NR Box B3 co-crystals diffract to around 2.4 Å resolution, and their structures were determined by molecular replacement (Table I). In both complexes, the asymmetric unit contains a single noncrystallographic LBD dimer that is identical in structure to other ERαLBD agonist complexes (25Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L.

Each LBD displays the canonical NR fold composed of 12 α-helices (H1–12) (35Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The coactivator binding site of each LBD monomer, formed by residues from helices H3, H4, H5, and H12, is occupied by peptide. Although the electron density for the NR Box B2 and Box B3 peptides is clear and continuous, not all of the peptide motif was visible. In each case, only nine residues of 12 could be defined, and the remaining residues were disordered. The ordered residues form two turns of α-helix that encompasses the core hydrophobic motif and two flanking residues at either end (peptide numbering −2 to +7). By convention, the residues in the coactivator peptide are numbered so that the first leucine of the LXXLL motif represents the +1 position. Residues prior to the core consensus sequence are designated by negative numbers (−1 to −5), with the amino acid immediately preceding the LXXLL given as the −1 position. Interestingly, the region of both LXXLL motifs that is well ordered in the crystal structures corresponds closely to the minimal core sequence capable of binding to NRs (36Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The binding mode of the Box B2 peptide is identical to that observed in analogous complexes between related coactivator LXXLL motifs and NR LBDs (25Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L.

Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) have previously described, the interactions made by an identical peptide bound to hERαLBD complexed with diethylstilbestrol; this structure will only be described in brief. Here, hERαLBD was liganded with the aroylbenzothiophene core of raloxifene (RALcore). In contrast to raloxifene, which is an ER AF2 antagonist, RALcore (raloxifene minus its basic amine-containing side chain) acts as a potent receptor agonist. Despite the difference in bound ligand, the two TIF2 Box B2 co-crystal structures are essentially identical. In the Box B2 complex presented here, the ligand, RALcore, adopts a similar orientation within the binding cavity to that observed with other ER agonists (e.g. E2 and diethylstilbestrol). However, the binding mode of RALcore is reversed when compared with raloxifene so that its phenolic moiety is directed toward Glu353 and Arg394. The 12-mer Box B2 peptide adopts a helical conformation with its N-terminal end interacting with Glu542 (H12) through hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate group and the main chain amides of Ile689 and Leu690 (Fig.1, A and B). The C-terminal end of the peptide helix is capped by the ε-amino group of Lys362 through hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyls of Leu693 and Leu694. All three leucines of the LXXLL peptide are in contact with the LBD. The leucines at the +1 and +5 positions of the motif are buried at the LBD-peptide interface and project into two shallow pockets in the binding groove. The isoleucine at −1 and the +4 Leu lie on the periphery of the binding site (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, examination of the initial ERαLBD-E2/TIF2 Box B3 complex electron density maps reveals that the Box B3 LXXLL motif peptide adopted a novel binding orientation that was distinct from all NR box·NR LBD complexes determined to date (Fig. 1C). At first glance, the position adopted by the peptide appears identical to that observed in the Box B2 structure. Both hydrophobic pockets along the binding groove are filled by leucine side chains from the Box B3 peptide. However, on closer examination, it is apparent that the peptide has “corkscrewed” along the coactivator cleft by one residue in the direction of Lys362. Consequently, the completely buried leucines are contributed by the −1 and +4 residues and the amino acids at the −2 (Ala) and +3 (Tyr) positions lying on the edge of the groove (Fig. 1D). Therefore, in the ERαLBD·Box B3 peptide complex, the interacting motif comprises the sequence LXXYL rather than the consensus LXXLL. Despite this fundamental difference, the van der Waals' contacts between the peptide and LBD are virtually identical to those observed for Box B2. The side chain of Leu744 (−1) is completely buried and interacts with Ile358 (H3), Val376 (H5), Leu379 (H5), Glu380 (H5), and Met543 (H12). Leu748 (+4) is also sandwiched between the peptide and the LBD and sits in an indentation formed by Ile358, Leu372, and Val376. Ala743 (−2) and Tyr747 (+3) rest on the edge of the groove and make nonpolar contacts with the side chains of Val355 (H3), Ile358 (H3), and Leu539 (H12), respectively (Fig. 1C). A minor variation in the positioning of the Box B3 peptide is observed between each monomer within the noncrystallographic ERαLBD homodimer and gives rise to slightly different N and C capping interactions made by Lys362 and Glu542. SPR analyses were performed to investigate the interactions between ERα AF2 and the LXXLL motifs of TIF2 in a more quantitative manner. Biotinylated 14-mer peptides containing the LXXLL motifs of wild type TIF2 (NR Boxes B1–B3) were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip surface. Fig.2A demonstrates the steady state response at different concentrations of injected E2-liganded ERαLBD over a surface immobilized with NR Box B3. The plot was fitted to a steady state model, and the “steady state affinity” was determined from the following relationship between the level of binding and the concentration. Req=KACRmax1+KACn(Eq. 1) where n specifies how many binding sites on the immobilized molecule that are on average blocked by binding one analyte molecule (n = 1). Rmax is the theoretical binding capacity, and Req is the steady state binding level. The steady state dissociation constant (KD) was determined to be 260 nm. We then pursued kinetic measurements for this interaction and calculated the affinity from the rate constants. Fig. 2B shows the concentration-dependent association of E2-liganded ERαLBD with NR Box B3 along with the calculated line of best fit using a conformational change model (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref.21Wärnmark A. Almlof T. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23397-23404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This model assumes that the receptor first forms an unstable complex with peptide and then undergoes a conformational change that leads to a more stable complex. However, in reality the actual binding model could be more complicated because liganded ER is typically dimeric and therefore capable of binding two peptide motifs (one for each LBD in an ER homodimer). Based on the reported equilibrium constants for ER dimerization (37Brandt M.E. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4843-4849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 38Notides A.C. Lerner N. Hamilton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4926-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we have assumed that, at the concentrations of ER and ERαLBD used in this study (≥16 nm), the receptor exists as a homodimer. To further simplify the system, we also immobilized limited amounts of each peptide to the chip surfaces so as to make it impossible for two peptides to bind simultaneously to a single ER homodimer. The resulting apparent dissociation constant calculated for NR Box B3 was around 250 nm, which agrees very well with the dissociation constant calculated from steady state data and supports the choice of binding model used in data interpretation. Kinetic measurements were also performed for TIF2 NR Box B1 and NR Box B2 peptides. Table II summarizes the rate constants and affinities for all of the LXXLL motifs of TIF2. As shown previously using the full-length ER (21Wärnmark A. Almlof T. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23397-23404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the NR Box B2 motif binds to ER with the highest affinity, followed by Box B1, which binds slightly better than the Box B3 motif.

In pressure-overloaded myocardium, we show S6K1 activation accompanied by activation of protein kinase C (PKC), c-Raf, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). To explore the importance of the c-Raf/MAPK kinase (MEK)/MAPK pathway, we stimulated adult feline cardiomyocytes with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), insulin, or forskolin to activate PKC, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, or protein kinase A (PKA), respectively. These treatments resulted in S6K1 activation with Thr-389 phosphorylation as well as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 protein phosphorylation. Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation of S6K1 was observed predominantly in TPA-treated cells. Dominant negative c-Raf expression or a MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) treatment showed a profound blocking effect only on the TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 and mTOR. Whereas p38 MAPK inhibitors exhibited only partial effect, MAPK-phosphatase-3 expression significantly blocked the TPA-stimulated S6K1 and mTOR phosphorylation. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin blocked the Thr-389 but not the Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation of S6K1. Therefore, during PKC activation, the c-Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway mediates both the Thr-421/Ser-424 and the Thr-389 phosphorylation in an mTOR-independent and -dependent manner, respectively.

Although this response is initially compensatory, a transition from this state to failure occurs when further growth of the heart is not sufficient to normalize the wall stress and maintain contractile function (1Chua B.H. Russo L.A. Gordon E.E. Kleinhans B.J. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C323-C327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a major research interest in cardiovascular disease is to understand how the increase in hemodynamic load is transmitted intracellularly for mediating hypertrophic growth. Although the mechanical load appears to directly regulate the hypertrophic growth initiation, the signaling mechanism that connects load to such growth is not well understood. A major cellular event during cardiac hypertrophy is increased protein synthesis (1Chua B.H. Russo L.A. Gordon E.E. Kleinhans B.J. Morgan H.E. Am. J.

Circulation. 1991; 83: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Enhanced protein synthesis can occur via accelerated protein translation, increased biogenesis of translational components, or both. A significant amount of mRNA of vertebrate cells possesses a unique 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine (5′-TOP)1 sequence in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), and these mRNA species generally code for specific ribosomal proteins (6Meyuhas O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6321-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 7Price D.J. Nemenoff R.A. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Their translation is largely controlled via phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal S6 protein (S6 protein) at its C terminus (8Stewart M.J. Thomas G.

A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of S6K1: the 70-kDa isoform was first isolated from mouse 3T3 cells (13Jeno P. Ballou L.M. Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the 85-kDa isoform of this kinase was then identified (14Reinhard C. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4052-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The p85 isoform is expressed from the same transcript as the p70 isoform through an alternative translational initiation start site, which adds a 23-amino acid nuclear localization signal to the N terminus (15Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 16Grove J.R. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 85-kDa isoform is predominantly in the nucleus, whereas the 70-kDa isoform is present mostly in the cytoplasm. Both the S6K isoforms are collectively called p70/85S6K, p70S6K, or S6K1 and have been shown to phosphorylate the S6 protein and mediate the biogenesis of the translational components, including several of the ribosomal proteins and elongation factors (12Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The p85 isoform has been shown to have additional roles in translational control, G1 to S phase transition, and increased DNA synthesis (17Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Recent studies using S6K1 knockout mice (18Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) resulted in the discovery of another S6K (S6K2), which possesses 70% homology with the p70 isoform of S6K1 but is predominantly present in the nucleus due to a C terminus-bound nuclear localization signal. In the case of S6K1, complex multisite phosphorylations have been shown to occur in a sequential manner for kinase activation (22Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 23Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). At least eight different phosphorylation sites have been identified and can be divided largely into two sets (although the same numbering is used for the position of amino acids in p70 and p85 S6K1 isoforms, 23 residues should be added to convert to the numbering of the p85 isoform). One set of phosphorylation sites, which is important for the kinase activity and sensitivity to rapamycin, has sites in the linker region (Thr-389 and Ser-404 sites) and the catalytic domain (Thr-229 and Ser-371 sites) (22Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 26Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thr-389 is located immediately C-terminal to the catalytic domain, and the phosphorylation at this site, which occurs during mitogenic stimulation and is rapamycin-sensitive, is important both for Thr-229 phosphorylation and increased kinase activity. The Thr-229 site is present in the activation loop of the catalytic domain, and phosphorylation at this site is mediated by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (27Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). A second set of phosphorylation sites involves four different residues in the pseudosubstrate domain: Ser-411, Ser-418, Thr-421, and Ser-424. Phosphorylation of these residues is important for subsequent Thr-389 phosphorylation as well as kinase function (28Mahalingam M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Excluding Ser-411, the phosphorylation of the remaining three residues is mediated independent of the rapamycin-sensitive pathway(s) (26Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation sites in the pseudosubstrate domain (also known as autoinhibitory domain) contain the consensus “Ser/Thr-Pro” sequence and, therefore, can be phosphorylated by several members of the proline-directed protein kinases, including the MAPK and cyclin-dependent kinases (29Mukhopadhyay N.K.

Furthermore, an isoform of PKC (e.g. PKCδ) has been shown to associate directly with mTOR (38Kumar V. Pandey P. Sabatini D. Kumar M. Majumder P.K. Bharti A. Carmichael G. Kufe D. Kharbanda S.

In 1- to 4-h pressure-overloaded feline myocardium, our recent study (42Laser M. Kasi V.S. Hamawaki M. Cooper G. Kerr C.M. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24610-24619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that the PKC, but not the PI3K-dependent pathway, contributes significantly to S6K activation. In the present study, we observed that this activation was also accompanied by the activation of the c-Raf/MAPK pathway. Therefore, we used cultured adult feline cardiomyocytes or cardiocytes to explore: (i) whether c-Raf, MEK, and MAPKs are key intermediary players for PKC-mediated S6K1 activation, and (ii) whether the PKC- but not the PI3K-mediated S6K1 activation requires the c-Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway. Using dominant negative c-Raf (C4B) adenovirus, we demonstrate for the first time that c-Raf is a critical downstream component for the PKC-mediated, but not the PI3K or the PKA-mediated, phosphorylation of S6K1 and mTOR at their critical sites in adult feline cardiocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PKC-mediated S6K1 activation and mTOR phosphorylation require the involvement of both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1, 4-dithiothreitol, and E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Aprotinin, leupeptin, sodium orthovanadate, okadaic acid, EGTA, Triton X-100, and β-glycerophosphate were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO); insulin was from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY); 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), forskolin, bisindolylmaleimide-I (BIM), wortmannin, U0126, SB202190 and SB203580 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The following antibodies were commercially obtained: anti-C-terminal S6K1 (C-18) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-Thr-389 S6K1, anti-phospho-Thr-421/Ser-424 S6K1, anti-phospho-PKC (pan), anti-phospho-Thr-202/Tyr-204 ERK1/2, anti-phospho-Thr-180/Tyr-182 p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-Thr-183/Tyr-185 SAPK/JNK (stress activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase), anti-phospho-Ser-235/Ser-236 ribosomal S6 protein, anti-phospho-Ser-2448 mTOR, and anti-phospho-Thr-308 PKB from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA); anti-c-Raf from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY). Adult cats weighing ∼3 kg were used for right ventricular pressure-overload (RVPO) by partial occlusion of the pulmonary artery, as we described previously (43Rozich J.D. Barnes M.A. Schmid P.G. Zile M.R. McDermott P.J. Cooper G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 485-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 44Cooper G. Satava R.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1974; 37: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cats underwent partial pulmonary artery occlusion by either external banding for 24 and 48 h or insertion of a balloon catheter for 1 and 4 h. Systemic arterial pressure remained the same whereas the pulmonary arterial pressure was at least doubled. The left ventricle (LV) from each cat served as the same animal internal control for pressure-overloaded right ventricle (RV). Additional control samples (LV and RV) were obtained from sham-operated cats by thoracotomy and pericardiotomy without any arterial occlusions. The care of the animals and all experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines of Medical University of South Carolina. Adult feline cardiocytes were isolated from normal cats and cultured on laminin coated four-well culture trays as described previously (45Cooper G. Mercer W.E. Hoober J.K. Gordon P.R. Kent R.L. Lauva I.K. Marino T.A. Circ. Res. 1986; 58: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Isolated cardiocytes were suspended in a 1.8 mm Ca2+ containing mitogen-free M-199 medium at pH 7.4. Cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well and cultured at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. c-Raf dominant negative mutant plasmid (RSV-Raf-C4B) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Abdellatif at the Baylor College Medicine. The plasmid was derived by fusing the N-terminal regulatory domain of c-Raf to the C-terminal antigenic region of B-Raf (46Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The dominant negative effect is attributed to a cysteine finger domain in the N-terminal regulatory domain (C4), which interacts with upstream factors resulting in the loss of endogenous c-Raf activation. RSV-Raf-C4B was cloned into adenovirus shuttle plasmid pAd.CMV-Link.1 (47He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Each cDNA insert was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the shuttle plasmid by standard cloning procedures. The shuttle plasmid contained linker arms flanking either side of the cDNA insert that consists of adenovirus-5 sequences from 0 to 1 map unit and 9 to 16 map units, respectively. The plasmid was modified previously to produce a high level of expression by placing the constitutively active CMV promoter on the 5′-end of the multiple cloning sites and the SV40 polyadenylation signal on the 3′-end. As a test to demonstrate constitutive expression of the cDNA inserts, the shuttle plasmid was transiently transfected into human 293 kidney cells and protein expression monitored by Western blotting. The purified shuttle plasmid was digested with the restriction enzymes NheI andNarI to obtain the “rescue” fragment. The fragment was then purified on agarose gel, and 2 μg of purified rescue fragment was used for homologous recombination. The adenoviral plasmid pTG3602 from the SCS110 bacterial strain was grown, and the purified plasmid was linearized by cutting at theClaI site present in the E1A region. Linearized pTG3602 (10 ng) was then mixed with the rescue fragment, and the DNA mixture was transformed into the BJ5183 bacterial strain and incubated overnight. Colonies were screened by digesting the DNA with XhoI and performing a Southern blot to confirm the presence of the cDNA insert. The DNA with the proper orientation and insert was transformed into the DH5α bacterial strain for recombination. The recombinant construct, purified using Qiagen Maxi-preps, was digested overnight with PacI and transfected into 293 cells using LipofectAMINE. The 293 cell line has the E1 region integrated into its genome; the defective E1 region of the adenoviral genome was complemented by the cellular genome. Adenoviral plaques were allowed to develop, and the plaque was purified a second time by infecting 293 cells and overlaying with agar. After large-scale preparation, adenoviruses were purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation, dialyzed, and titered by plaque assay (48Kirshenbaum L.A. MacLellan W.R. Mazur W.

IRL Press, Oxford1995: 285-306Google Scholar). Adenovirus for mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-3 (MKP-3), generated using similar protocol, was obtained from Dr. Donald R. Menick's laboratory. Freshly isolated adult feline cardiocytes were cultured overnight and stimulated with 200 nm TPA, 100 nm insulin, or 1 μm forskolin in the presence or absence of various pharmacological agents for indicated periods of time. Stock solutions for TPA and forskolin were prepared in Me2SO, and Me2SO-treated cardiocytes were used as controls for these experiments. For treatment with pharmacological inhibitors, cardiocytes were preincubated for 30 min with the inhibitors and then the cells were stimulated with TPA, insulin, or forskolin. For the adenoviral expression, freshly isolated cardiocytes were plated on laminin-coated trays and incubated for 4 h prior to infection. Cells were then incubated overnight in serum-free M-199 media containing the adenovirus at m.o.i. (multiplicity of infection) levels of 2 and 10 for MKP-3 and 250 for C4B. Cells infected with an equal m.o.i. of β-galactosidase adenovirus served as control. The media was replaced with serum-free M199 media, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h before agonist stimulation. Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble samples were prepared as we previously described (50Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4500-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with a few minor modifications. Briefly, following the stimulation, cardiocytes were extracted with lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm E-64, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.02 μm okadaic acid, 0.5 mmEGTA). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 160,000 × gfor 30 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using BCA (Pierce) reagent. The supernatant was then boiled with SDS-sample buffer and used as detergent-soluble fraction. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was resuspended in SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at room temperature to obtain detergent-insoluble fraction. The protein concentration in each sample was determined using BCA reagent (Pierce) and adjusted for comparison. 20 μl of detergent-lysed subfractions (or insoluble fraction in the case of S6 protein detection) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked for 1 h using 10% milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.1m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Blots were incubated with the primary antibodies in TBST buffer overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Following the incubation with the primary antibodies, blots were washed three times with TBST buffer each for 5 min and incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the blots, the proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, MA). The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the PKC-mediated S6K1 activation in adult cardiocytes requires the activation of the c-Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway. To test this possibility, we analyzed whether the S6K1 phosphorylation/activation in pressure-overloaded feline myocardium is accompanied by the activation of MAPK family members (ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNKs), c-Raf, and PKC. The activation of all these kinases can be analyzed by taking three different approaches: (i) Western blot analysis using regular antibodies to observe changes in the mobility on SDS-PAGE, which is indicative of distinct phosphorylation of these kinases upon activation, (ii) Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies to determine the phosphorylation of critical residues necessary for kinase activation, and (iii) immune complex kinase assays. In the present study, we undertook the first two approaches. Right ventricular pressure overload was induced for time periods of 1–48 h by pulmonary artery occlusion. Sham-operated control cats underwent similar surgical interventions without occluding the pulmonary artery. Compared with the sham control ventricles (LV or RV) or unloaded same animal LV controls, 1-h pressure-overloaded RVs exhibited a dramatic change in the mobility of both the S6K isoforms (p70 and p85) during SDS-PAGE separation (Fig.1 A). This retarded mobility (band shifting) was also seen in 4- and 24-h pressure overloaded RV, and returned partially to the control levels in 48 h RV. We used phospho-specific antibodies that detect either the Thr-389-phosphorylated or the Thr-421/Ser-424-phosphorylated (simultaneously) S6K1 isoforms. Thr-389 and Thr-421/Ser-424 phosphorylation of the p70 S6K isoform was either almost absent or present at very low levels in unloaded control LVs and RVs. However, 1-h pressure-overloaded RVs exhibited a robust increase in phosphorylation of all three sites. Such increased phosphorylation was also observed in 4-, 24-, and 48-h pressure-overloaded RVs. In the case of the p85 isoform, Thr-389 phosphorylation was significant in 4- and 24-h pressure-overloaded myocardium, whereas for the Thr-421/Ser-424 sites, significant phosphorylation was observed as early as 1 h and persisted up to at least 48 h of pressure overloading. The pattern of S6K1 activation matches precisely with our earlier studies performed under similar conditions (42Laser M. Kasi V.S. Hamawaki M. Cooper G. Kerr C.M. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24610-24619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Overall, these data demonstrate once again that S6K1 is activated to a substantial level as early as 1 h of pressure overloading of the myocardium, and the activation is sustained for at least 24 h. Interestingly, the S6K1 activation is also accompanied by an increased mTOR phosphorylation at the Ser-2448 site. Such enhanced phosphorylation, which is indicative of mTOR activation (51Nave B.T. Ouwens M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), was observed as early as 1 h of pressure overload and matches the S6K1 activation time course. Next, we analyzed whether a signaling pathway that includes the activation of PKC, c-Raf, and the MAPK family members accompanies the S6K1 activation process. The activation of MAPK family members and PKC was determined by Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies whereas c-Raf activation was analyzed by its retarded electrophoretic mobility during SDS-PAGE separation combined with Western blot detection. Analysis using phospho-specific antibodies for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK isoforms, 42 and 44 kDa), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK isoforms, 42 and 60 kDa) showed a clear activation of all of these family members in 1- to 4-h pre"

J. 1964; 90: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), purified as the free acid according to the method of Grisostomi et al. (33Grisostomi C. Kast P. Pulido R. Huynh J. Hilvert D. Bioorg. Chem. 1997; 25: 297-305Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. The purity of chorismic acid was 98% as determined by UV spectroscopy using ε274 nm = 2,630m−1 cm−1 (34Heide E. Morrison J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1573-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and 95.3% by analytical C-18 reverse phase HPLC at 280 nm. Prephenic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid were present at 0.6, 1.4, and 0.06%, respectively, as judged by HPLC. Isochorismate was isolated from K. pneumoniae 62-1 harboring theentC plasmid pKS3-02 (35Schmidt K. Leistner E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 45: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which was grown in medium A containing kanamycin (60 μg/ml), and transferred to 2-liter production medium BN (11Young I.G. Batterham T.J. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 177: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) containing 0.1 mm each of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan plus 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG) (35Schmidt K. Leistner E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 45: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After precipitation with 2 m barium acetate, a 1:2 mixture of isochorismate and chorismate (600 mg from 2 liters of culture) was obtained, of which 50-mg portions were purified on a Nucleosil 120 C-18 column (10 × 250 mm) in aqueous 0.27% formic acid, pH 2.5. Elution at 4.1 ml/min was carried out by a methanol (%, v/v) step gradient: 10 min, 0%; 10–16 min, 0–19%; 16–41 min, 19%; 41–51 min, 19–28.5%; 51–58 min, 28.5%; 58–63 min, 28.5–95%; 63–73 min, 95% (35Schmidt K. Leistner E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 45: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 2E. W. Leistner, personal communication. Isochorismic acid and chorismic acid were eluted with 19% methanol after 30 min and with 28.5% methanol after 48 min, respectively, neutralized with NaOH, and freeze-dried. Isochorismate (ε278 nm = 8,300 m−1cm−1; Ref. 36Rusnak F. Liu J. Quinn M. Berchtold G.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) preparations adjusted to 200 μm contained 65 mm sodium formate, 43 μm sodium prephenate, and 20 μm sodium phenylpyruvate. No contamination of the isochorismate preparations with chorismate or with salicylate could be detected. At an isochorismate concentration giving half-maximal velocity (12.5 μm), the addition of 20 μm sodium prephenate, 8 μmsodium phenylpyruvate, or 26 mm sodium formate (i.e. a 10-fold excess over the contamination levels present in our isochorismate preparations) had no effect on IPL activity. An analytical detection method at pH 7.0 was worked out for isochorismate, using a Nucleosil C-18 column (4 × 250 mm). Elution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was carried out with a 0–65% (v/v) linear gradient of acetonitrile in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm ion pair reagent tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (Fluka), using a Hewlett-Packard 1050 system equipped with a diode array detector. p-Hydroxybenzoate (10.2 min), prephenate (10.9 min), chorismate (11.7 min), isochorismate (12.4 min), phenylpyruvate (15.6 min), and salicylate (16.4 min) were eluted at the retention times indicated and quantitated at λmax with a diode array UV detector. Routine procedures were used for the isolation of DNA and for cloning experiments (37Del Sal G. Manfioletti G. Schneider C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 77: 221-226Google Scholar). Plasmid pME6152, containing pchB under the tacpromoter, was constructed by cloning the 0.75-kb pchB XhoI-PstI fragment of pME3368 (2Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in pMMB67EH (40Fürste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blöcker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M. Lanka E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 48: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). A 0.75-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment encodingpchB(I88T) from mutated pME6152 (see below) was subcloned into pUK21 (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and pMMB67EH, resulting in pME6169 and pME6179, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the pchB(I88T) gene on pME6179 was determined by using the Thermo Sequenase II dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the ABI Prism™ 373 sequencer. P. aeruginosaADD1976/pME3324 (a T7 promoter expression vector with pchB; Ref. 2Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen.

Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) containing carbenicillin (250 μg/ml) in 1-liter flasks with shaking at 37 °C. At A600 nm = 0.8, the chromosomal T7 RNA polymerase gene was induced for 1 h by the addition of IPTG at 1 mm final concentration. Rifampicin was then added at 200 μg/ml, and the incubation was continued for 2 h. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells from three flasks were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min and washed twice in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (buffer A). Cells (wet weight of 3 g), which could be stored at −20 °C, were broken in 15 ml of buffer A by sonication for 5 × 30 s. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min; the resulting crude extract containing 8–10 mg/ml protein was applied to a 1.6 × 20-cm DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme was eluted with 300 ml of buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing PchB, detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in 10–20% gradient gels stained with Coomassie Blue, were combined (100 ml) and loaded onto a column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (1.6 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with 200 ml of buffer A. The enzyme was eluted as a broad peak with 150 ml of buffer A. Fractions containing PchB were pooled (80 ml), and a solution of 0.4% (w/v)n-octyl-β-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem) was slowly added by stirring to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), to avoid protein precipitation during the concentration steps. This fraction was concentrated to 2 ml by ultrafiltration through an Amicon YM3 membrane in a stirred cell, followed by further concentration with an Amicon Centriplus C-10 concentrator (cut-off: 10,000 Da). The concentrated fraction was chromatographed on a 1.6 × 70-cm column of Bio-Gel P100 polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) in buffer A at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. PchB-containing fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The subunit molecular mass of PchB was estimated by SDS-PAGE (42Lämmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) in 10–20% gradient gels (Ready Gel, Bio-Rad), with standards of the Low Molecular Weight Calibration Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The molecular mass of the native PchB was estimated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-150 (1.6 × 70 cm, 0.1 ml/min), Bio-Gel P100 (1.6 × 70 cm, 0.1 ml/min), and FPLC Superose 12 HR (10/30, 0.4 ml/min) columns in buffer A, with ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), lysozyme (14.6 kDa), proteinase K (28.8 kDa), pepsin (34.5 kDa), protein A (42 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) as markers. The elution volumes were plotted against the logarithm of molecular masses for the standards, and the linear regression curve was used to estimate the apparent molecular mass of PchB. In addition, the molecular mass of native PchB was estimated from PAGE in nondenaturing gels of 7.5, 10, 12, 15, and 20% polyacrylamide, with the Low Molecular Weight Calibration Kit (Amersham Biosciences) as a standard, by Ferguson plot analysis (43Tietz D. Chrambach A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The slopes obtained from plots of the logarithm of relative mobility versuspolyacrylamide concentration were plotted against the molecular weight of the standard proteins. The N-terminal sequence of PchB was determined by Dr. P. James (ETH, Zürich, Switzerland) on an Applied Biosystems Peptide Sequencer model 473A, using the Edman degradation procedure. Samples of 50 μl of purified PchB (0.54 μg/μl) in buffer A were treated with 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cross-linker was prepared immediately before use as a 5 mm solution in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.75m NaCl. The samples were incubated with constant agitation at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Each sample was split into two aliquots, treated with the solubilizing solution (final concentrations: 1.2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) with or without 40 mm DTT to cleave the cross-links, incubated at 50 °C for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% polyacrylamide gradient. Standard proteins (Low and High Molecular Weight Kits, Amersham Biosciences) and the PchB control were not exposed to DTSSP, but were otherwise treated in the same way. IPL activity of PchB was determined by measuring the fluorescence of salicylate formed using an excitation wavelength of 305 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm in a PerkinElmer LS30 fluorimeter. Unless stated otherwise, the incubation mixture contained, in a final volume of 500 μl, 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 600 μm isochorismate (purified by HPLC), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and enzyme. Controls without enzyme were included routinely, to correct for nonenzymatic reactions. The reaction at 37 °C was initiated by the addition of isochorismate and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of concentrated HCl, followed by extraction with 3 ml of ethyl acetate. Blanks were obtained from nonincubated reaction mixtures. The amount of salicylate formed was determined from a standard curve obtained with 0.5–8 μmsalicylic acid (Fluka) in ethyl acetate. One IPL unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme converting 1 μmol of isochorismate to salicylate/min. The reaction was stopped within the first 10% of the isochorismate-to-salicylate conversion. CM activity of PchB was assayed by the method of Cotton and Gibson (44Cotton R.G.H. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 100: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as modified by Ahmad and Jensen (45Ahmad S. Jensen R.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1988; 5: 282-297PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the enzymatic reaction, prephenate, is converted to phenylpyruvate under acidic conditions, which is subsequently measured by its absorbance at 320 nm at basic pH. The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.2 ml, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm chorismate, and enzyme. Control reaction mixtures lacking enzyme were always included to estimate the amount of prephenate formed nonenzymatically during the incubation period. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 m HCl, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min to convert the prephenate formed to phenylpyruvate. Phenylpyruvate concentrations were determined at 320 nm after the addition of 0.7 ml of 2.5 m NaOH, using ε320 nm = 17,500 m−1 cm−1 (44Cotton R.G.H. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 100: 76-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One CM unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme needed for the formation of 1 μmol of prephenate (assayed as phenylpyruvate)/min. Assays were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Initial velocity data were fitted to the equations of Hanes (Table II), Lineweaver-Burk (Fig. 3, A–C), and Dixon using Enzpack software (Biosoft).Table IIKinetic parameters of PchB for IPL and CM activities at 37 °CActivitySubstrateKmVmaxkcatKi2-aFor the determination of the inhibition mode, data were fitted to the Lineweaver-Burk equation (v−1 = KmVmax−1 [S]−1 +Vmax−1) (see Fig. 3).

Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with or without pME6152 (pchB+) was grown at 37 °C with shaking in 500-ml flasks containing 100 ml of minimal medium E (48Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), amended with 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 1 mm thiamine, and 1 mm IPTG. Control cultures were grown in minimal medium E supplemented with 1 mm tyrosine and 1 mmphenylalanine. The cultures were inoculated with approximately 107 washed cells/ml, previously grown in minimal medium E supplemented with both amino acids, ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). Cell growth was monitored by following the A600 nm. Rabbit antibodies were generated by subcutaneous injection of purified PchB (110 μg/500 μl) emulsified with 500 μl of complete Freund's adjuvant. Three booster injections with the same amount of antigen at 4-week intervals were applied. Ten days after the final injection, blood was collected and aliquots of the serum obtained were kept at −80 °C. The enzyme (typically 0.1 μg) and cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose sheet (Bio-Rad) in a Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) with a transfer buffer containing 25 mmTris base (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) ethanol. The antiserum was diluted 1:1,000 with Tris-buffered saline-Tween (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20) for use in PchB immunoblots, which were treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). PchB was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). IPL was purified from the overproducing strain P. aeruginosa ADD1976/pME3324 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Table I. In crude extract, PchB constituted ∼20% of the soluble protein. Purification by DEAE-ion exchange chromatography resulted in a 5.9-fold increase in specific activity. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and molecular sieving on Bio-Gel P100 removed some contaminants, but did not improve the specific activity (Table I). PchB protein tended to form insoluble aggregates in concentrated solution. Therefore, pooled fractions after phenyl-Sepharose chromatography were concentrated by ultrafiltration in the presence of 0.1%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, allowing a higher recovery. Used at this concentration, n-octylglucose had no effect on IPL activity. Glycerol, which was present in buffer A, did not influence IPL activity either, in concentrations of up to 30%. PchB was eluted from the Bio-Gel column in a single symmetric peak, with a purity of >98% as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2, lane 1). The PchB polypeptide (calculated molecular mass of 11.5 kDa) migrated slightly ahead of the 14.4-kDa marker, α-lactalbumin (Fig. 2).Table IPurification of the PchB enzyme from the overproducing strain P. aeruginosa ADD1976/pME3324, based on IPL activityPurification stepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldCrude cell extract107.4251.32.341001DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B14.6200.613.7479.85.9Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B8.9100.811.3340.14.8Bio-Gel P1004.456.712.8922.65.5 Open table in a new tab The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the PchB polypeptide (Met-Lys-Thr-Pro-Glu-Asp-X-Thr-Gly-Leu) obtained by Edman degradation matched that predicted from the DNA sequence (2Serino L. Reimmann C. Baur H. Beyeler M. Visca P. Haas D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) after processing of the first methionine. Mobility of PchB in PAGE under nondenaturing conditions was similar to that of carbonic anhydrase (28.7 kDa), and a Ferguson plot indicated an apparent molecular mass of 30 ± 2 kDa. Analytical size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-150, Superose 12 HR, and Bio-Gel P100 gave values of ∼32, 31 ± 1, and 34 ± 2 kDa, respectively, for native PchB. PchB was cross-linked with the homobifunctional, water-soluble agent DTSSP and treated with the solubilizing buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After SDS-PAGE, a substantial fraction of PchB was found to migrate as a covalently linked dimer (Fig. 2, lane 2). Larger forms corresponding probably to trimers and tetramers were also seen with much lower intensities (Fig. 2, lane 2). Increasing the cross-linker concentration to 2 mm appeared to favor the dimeric form (data not shown). Treatment of cross-linked PchB with DTT converted these forms back to the monomeric subunit (data not shown). The fact that the band corresponding to the dimer was dominant after cross-linking can be interpreted in favor of a dimeric structure of native PchB. The apparent molecular mass obtained by molecular sieving would also be compatible with a trimeric PchB structure. However, CM ofMethanococcus jannaschii (27MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a dimeric protein whose 99-amino acid sequence is related to that of PchB (see below), showed an apparent molecular mass of 29.4 kDa in gel filtration experiments.

We have shown that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) supplementation induces rapid proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which is reduced upon removal of bFGF or by bFGF immunoneutralization. The PAF receptor antagonist LAU-8080 inhibited bFGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation, indicating the involvement of PAF in the bFGF-mediated signaling of HUVEC. Although FGF receptor phosphorylation was not affected by LAU-8080, the bFGF-mediated prolonged phosphorylation, and activation of Erk-1 and -2 were attenuated.

Many cells produce PAF, including monocytes, endothelial cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, and these cell types can themselves become targets of PAF bioactions (6Venable M.E. Zimmermann G.A.

PAF acts through a specific G-protein-linked receptor containing seven α-helical domains that span the plasma membrane (7Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh H.

Sci. 2001; 22: 201-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Although bFGF does not contain a traditional signal sequence, it is now clear that it is secreted via a tightly regulated non-conventional secretory pathway and is localized in the basement membrane and extracellular matrix of numerous tissues (14Klein S. Roghani M. Rifkin D.B. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Regulation of Angiogenesis. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). bFGF binds to its high affinity receptor (FGFR-1 and FGFR-2) and induces their dimerization and activation of protein-tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation. The activation of the receptor induces the Ras-independent cascade (via activation of phospholipase Cγ) (15Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F., Li, W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Ras-dependent cascade (initiated via Grb-2, Sos, and Ras) (16Kremer N.E. D'Arcangelo G. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), resulting in the activation of Raf. The Ras-dependent pathway results in the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Mek) and subsequent phosphorylation of MAP kinase (Erk) (17L'Allemain G. Pouyssegur J. Weber M.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Activation of Erk causes downstream activation of phospholipase A2. Using cloned guinea pig PAF receptor stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Honda et al. (18Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that PAF potentially activates MAP kinase and both the 42- and 44-kDa Erk-1 and Erk-2 and that PAF receptor couples to both pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Like the Ras-dependent cascade, the Ras-independent cascade also results in the activation of phospholipase A2, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to lyso-PAF and arachidonic acid. Lyso-PAF is converted to PAF by an acetyltransferase. It has been demonstrated that PAF receptor activation was facilitated through both the associated G-protein and through an unknown tyrosine kinase (19Thurston A.W., Jr. Rhee S.G. Shukla S.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1106-1112PubMed Google Scholar). Although the study did not identify the tyrosine kinase, the data were consistent with a Janus kinase or Src-family kinase as possible suspects. The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is one of the major mechanisms by which cytokine receptors transduce intracellular signals. To date, four mammalian JAKs (JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and TYK-2) and seven STATs have been identified and characterized (20Pellegrini S. Dusanter-Fourt I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 615-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Both JAKs and STATs become phosphorylated on their tyrosine residues followed by homo- or heterodimerization, nuclear translocation, and finally transcriptional activation of specific genes (21Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thrombopoietin induced a rapid phosphorylation of STAT-5B (a target of JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, and TYK-2), which was inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonist WEB-2170 (22Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In a recent study, Lukashova et al. (23Lukashova V. Asselin C. Krolewski J.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stanková J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24113-24121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using monocytic cell lines U937 and MonoMac-1, show that G-protein-independent activation of TYK-2 occurred after activation of the PAF receptor with PAF, which was followed by a time-dependent activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT-1, STAT-2, STAT-3, and STAT-5) (23Lukashova V.

Shukla S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9123-9127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) introduced anti-v-Src antibody into rabbit platelets and found that PAF-stimulated inositol phosphate production and aggregation were significantly reduced. Furthermore, PAF caused phosphorylation of both Src and phospholipase Cγ in rabbit platelets and A431 cells, suggesting direct phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ by Src. In the present report we show that bFGF stimulates HUVEC proliferation, which is antagonized by the PAF receptor (PAFR) antagonist LAU-8080. The PAFR antagonists do not affect activation of the FGFR by bFGF, but the downstream activation of Erk by bFGF is partially dependent on PAF. Antagonism of the bFGF-stimulated STAT-3 phosphorylation by PAFR antagonists suggests the importance of STAT-3 in PAF-mediated signaling. Also, prolonged activation of STAT-3 by bFGF may be through the production of PAF and activation of PAFR. JAK-2 and Src are both involved in bFGF-mediated HUVEC proliferation and are also phosphorylated upon exposure of HUVEC to bFGF. PAFR antagonists attenuate bFGF-stimulated JAK-2 phosphorylation but have no effect on the phosphorylation of Src by bFGF. Finally, Src is involved in the PAF-stimulated immediate phosphorylation of STAT-3, whereas JAK-2 is pivotal in the delayed STAT-3 phosphorylation. The prolonged phosphorylation of STAT-3 may be either through Src and/or JAK-2. PAF was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, PAF receptor antagonists CV-3988 and BN-52021 (Ginkgolide B) were obtained fromBiomol Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA, and LAU-8080 was synthesized by Prof. Julio Alvares-Builla at the Universidad de Alcala, Madrid, Spain. Antibodies used were monoclonal mouse anti-FGF-receptor (Ab-1) and monoclonal mouse anti-bFGF (Ab-3) (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA), monoclonal mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), rabbit antiserum anti-JAK-2 and rabbit polyclonal anti-human TYK-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), monoclonal mouse anti-phospho-JAK-2 (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT-3, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-STAT-3, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse, and goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Phosphorylated Erk-1 and -2 were detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase, and MAP kinase activity was detected using the nonradioactive p44/42 MAP kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Src-family inhibitor PP1 was from Biomol ResearchLaboratories, whereas the JAK-2 inhibitor Tyrphostin AG-490 (T-9142) (Tyrphostin B42) was from LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA. bFGF, FBS, endothelial growth medium (EGM-2), and endothelial basal medium (EBM-2) were from Clonetics, Walkersville, MD. HUVEC were grown to subconfluent levels in EGM-2 obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD, and plated onto 6-well culture plates (1 × 106 cells/well). HUVEC were then washed once with EBM-2 and starved of the growth factors by switching them to EBM-2 supplemented with 0.2% FBS (BioWhittaker) for 16 h. Cells were again washed once with EBM-2 and then exposed to the various experimental conditions for different time points. At the end of each time point, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), lysed in the cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 m EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 70 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 2% SDS, and 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were used as indicated below. Human embryonic diploid lung fibroblasts (WI-38, ATCC-CCL75) were grown to subconfluent levels in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMC) were a kind gift from Dr. Emel Songu-Mize and were maintained on M199 medium (Sigma-Aldrich). EBM-2 supplemented with 2% FBS was added to each well of a 24-well plate and pretreated for 4 h with either growth factors, a mixture of bFGF and monoclonal anti-bFGF Ab-3 antibody, 10 μm LAU-8080, 50 μm AG-490, or 170 nm PP1 at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Growth factor-starved HUVEC were then transferred to each well (2 × 104 cells/well) along with 1 μm[3H]thymidine and incubated in the CO2incubator. Similarly, minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% FBS or M199 medium was added to each well of a 24-well plate and pretreated with bFGF, 10 μm LAU-8080, 10 μm BN-52021, or 3 μm CV-3988 individually or in combination for 4 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. WI-38 or ASMC cells were then transferred to each well (2 × 104 cells/well) in combination with [3H]thymidine and incubated in the CO2incubator. After 144 h of incubation, the cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold saline, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with methanol, and air-dried. The labeled DNA was dissolved in 0.05 n NaOH at 37 °C, neutralized with 0.05n HCl, transferred to a scintillation vial containing the scintillation mixture, and counted. HUVEC were incubated with bFGF and/or 10 μm LAU-8080 for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed with the cell lysis buffer, and cell lysates were incubated with anti-FGF receptor Ab-1 antibody at 4 °C overnight and precipitated by incubation with 100 μg of protein G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing 3 times with lysis buffer, complexes were dissolved in 1× loading buffer, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and detected using the chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce). Phosphorylated Erk-1 and -2 were detected by separating the cell lysates on a 12% SDS-PAGE (40 μg protein/lane), blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane, incubating with anti-phospho-p44/42 Erk antibody, and chemiluminescent detection. Erk activity in HUVEC treated with bFGF and/or 10 μm LAU-8080 for different time points was detected using the nonradioactive p44/42 Erk assay kit. Briefly, 200 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated with immobilized phospho-p44/42 Erk antibody overnight at 4 °C. For the positive control, 2 ng of active Erk was added to control cell lysate and treated subsequently like all the other samples. The samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer followed by kinase buffer. Pellets were then suspended in kinase buffer and supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated with 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with phospho-Elk-1 antibody, and detected by chemiluminescence. The growth factor-starved HUVEC were exposed to either 10−7m PAF, bFGF, 10 μm LAU-8080, 10 μm BN-52021, or 3 μm CV-3988 for various time points. To inhibit the Src or JAK-2 pathways, overnight starved cells were pretreated for 30 min with either 170 nm PP1 or 50 μm AG-490. After the completion of each time point, cells were lysed in the cell lysis buffer containing 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue, and samples were boiled for 5 min and separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE (40 μg total protein/lane). The separated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with the antibodies against the phosphorylated proteins in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk plus 0.5% Tween 20, overnight at 4 °C. After washing and incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the phosphorylated proteins were revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce). Membranes were stripped by incubation in 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 55 °C. After washing, membranes were blocked with blocking buffer and reprobed with antibodies against the non-phosphorylated proteins, respectively, and developed as described above. PAF receptor antagonist LAU-8080 was used to elucidate the involvement of PAF in HUVEC proliferation mediated by the bFGF-signaling pathway. The basal level of HUVEC growth was achieved by an overnight incubation of HUVEC in basal medium. After establishing the basal growth rates, bFGF, VEGF, EGF, and IGF-1 were added individually to HUVEC maintained on EBM-2 supplemented with 2% FBS with or without 10 μmLAU-8080. As seen in Fig. 1A, a small but significant reduction in HUVEC growth was observed when LAU-8080 was included in the medium containing VEGF. However, the addition of LAU-8080 to the medium containing bFGF resulted in a much larger growth reduction of HUVEC. In a subsequent experiment, a mixture of each of the above growth factors was analyzed whereby only one growth factor was removed from the medium, and the other three remained with or without the presence of LAU-8080. Growth reduction in the presence of LAU-8080 was observed when VEGF, EGF, and IGF were removed from the medium, whereas the growth of HUVEC was not reduced by LAU-8080 when bFGF was removed from the medium (Fig. 1B). These observations suggest the involvement of PAF in the bFGF-mediated signaling pathway, since only the bFGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation was affected by the PAFR antagonist LAU-8080. Attenuation of the bFGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation was observed after bFGF immunoneutralization using monoclonal anti-bFGF Ab-3 antibody (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the bFGF-mediated signaling pathway stimulates HUVEC proliferation. The addition of monoclonal antibody Ab-3 alone or the boiled antibody (used as a negative control) had no effect on HUVEC proliferation. Attenuation in HUVEC proliferation was observed when LAU-8080 was added to HUVEC along with bFGF. LAU-8080 alone had no effect on HUVEC proliferation as compared with the basal level. Attenuation of HUVEC proliferation by the PAF receptor antagonist suggests the involvement of PAF at some point in the bFGF-mediated signaling of HUVEC. As seen in Fig.1D, bFGF also stimulated the proliferation of the lung fibroblasts (WI-38) and ASMC, which was attenuated by the PAF receptor antagonists LAU-8080, BN-52021, and CV-3988. This observation further suggests that the growth promoting effect of bFGF is blocked by the PAF receptor antagonists not only in HUVEC but also in other cell types. Binding of bFGF to the FGFR leads to its immediate activation and phosphorylation at tyrosine residues. To elucidate the effect of PAF receptor antagonists LAU-8080 on the level of FGFR phosphorylation, HUVEC were exposed to a short (10 min) pulse of bFGF with or without 10 μm LAU-8080. Antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine revealed the immunoprecipitated FGFR. As shown in Fig. 2, there is no significant difference in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation, confirming that the PAF receptor antagonist do not antagonize FGFR activity. We hypothesized that activation of FGFR by bFGF would lead to the early phosphorylation and activation of Erk, whereas prolonged stimulation of Erk would be through downstream production of PAF, antagonized by LAU-8080. To test this hypothesis, HUVEC were starved of growth factors overnight (EBM supplemented with 0.2% FBS), after which they were exposed to bFGF with or without 10 μm LAU-8080, and the levels of phosphorylation (Fig.3A) and activity (Fig.3B) of Erk-1 and -2 were determined. As seen in Fig 3C, no phosphorylation or activity of Erk-1 and -2 were observed until 15 min. After 15 min, phosphorylation and the activity of Erk-1 and -2 were observed, which peaked 30 min after treatment with bFGF and continued until 60 min after bFGF exposure. LAU-8080 attenuated the prolonged phosphorylation and activity of Erk-1 and -2 after 15 min in the cells treated with bFGF, demonstrating that prolonged activation of Erk by bFGF involves PAF. After an overnight incubation in EBM supplemented with 0.2% FBS, HUVEC were treated with 10 μm LAU-8080, 10 μm BN-52021, or 3 μm CV-3988 in the presence of EGM-2 (containing bFGF, VEGF, IGF-1, EGF, 2% FBS). STAT-3 phosphorylation in HUVEC stimulated with EGM-2 was investigated over time (Fig.4A). As seen in Fig.4B, there was a significant reduction in the level of STAT-3 phosphorylation in the presence of each of the PAF receptor antagonists (LAU-8080, BN-52021, CV-3988) as compared with vehicle-treated cells (Control). Because STAT-3 is phosphorylated by a number of cytokines and growth factors, inhibition of phosphorylation in the presence of the PAFR antagonists suggested that STAT-3 is one of the components involved in PAF-mediated signaling. Of the various members of the Janus kinase family of protein kinase, we have determined that TYK-2 and JAK-2 are expressed in HUVEC, whereas JAK-1 and JAK-3 are not (data not shown). TYK-2 is not phosphorylated even after stimulation of HUVEC with PAF or bFGF at all the time points (data not shown). JAK-2 is constitutively expressed in HUVEC regardless of the addition of PAF or bFGF (data not shown). STAT-1 and STAT-3 are expressed in HUVEC, but STAT-5a, STAT-5b, and STAT-6 are not (data not shown). HUVEC were exposed to bFGF after an overnight exposure to basal medium devoid of growth factors. As seen in Fig. 5, a slight increase in phosphorylation of STAT-3 was observed after 1 min followed by a rapid increase in STAT-3 phosphorylation after 15 min of bFGF exposure. This increased STAT-3 phosphorylation is maintained after prolonged exposure to bFGF alone through the 30- and 60-min time points. The PAF receptor antagonists LAU-8080, BN-52021, and CV-3988 antagonize the bFGF-stimulated STAT-3 phosphorylation at all time points. Phosphorylation of STAT-3 in the presence of PAF is not observed until 15 min of exposure, which peaks at the 30-min time point. All PAF antagonists antagonize this delayed phosphorylation of STAT-3 by PAF, suggesting that PAF causes the phosphorylation of STAT-3 through PAFR-associated kinases that are blocked by the PAFR antagonists. Exposure of HUVEC to bFGF and PAF alone results in maximal phosphorylation of STAT-3 after 30 min, suggesting that bFGF would induce the prolonged activation of STAT-3 through the production of PAF and activation of PAF receptor. JAK-2 inhibitor AG-490 and Src inhibitor PP1 were used to elucidate the involvement of JAK-2 and Src in bFGF-mediated HUVEC proliferation. After establishing basal growth rates, HUVEC were exposed to bFGF, AG-490, or PP1 individually or in combination. As seen in Fig. 6, bFGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation was attenuated by both AG-490 and PP1. Attenuation of bFGF-mediated proliferation was greater in the presence of AG-490 than PP1 and was comparable with that of AG-490 alone (without supplementation with bFGF). PP1 alone attenuated HUVEC proliferation, but this effect was to some extent overcome by stimulation of HUVEC by bFGF. These observations suggest that although signaling through JAK-2 is critical for HUVEC proliferation, both JAK-2 and Src are involved in bFGF-mediated HUVEC growth. Growth factor-starved HUVEC were exposed to bFGF with or without the PAFR antagonists, and the level of JAK-2 and Src phosphorylation was investigated at different time intervals. Phospho-JAK-2 and JAK-2 levels are shown in Fig. 7A. As seen in Fig. 7C, phosphorylation of JAK-2 was observed after 1 min of bFGF exposure and was maintained through the 30-min time point and decreased slightly after 60 min of bFGF stimulation. The PAFR antagonists LAU-8080, BN-52021, and CV-3988 attenuated this bFGF-stimulated JAK-2 phosphorylation at all time points, suggesting that the PAF-PAFR pathway is involved in the bFGF-mediated JAK-2 phosphorylation in HUVEC. Levels of phospho-Src and Src are shown in Fig. 7B. bFGF alone did not induce phosphorylation of Src until 15 min and was followed by a rapid phosphorylation at the 30-min time point (Fig. 7D). The PAFR antagonists did not antagonize this bFGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Src, suggesting that Src is also a component of the bFGF-signaling pathway, and its stimulation by bFGF is independent of the PAF-PAFR pathway. To further elucidate the involvement of JAK-2 and Src in the phosphorylation of STAT-3, HUVEC were pretreated for 30 min in the presence of the JAK-2 inhibitor AG-490 and/or Src inhibitor PP1 to obtain the base-line phosphorylation of STAT-3. After this pretreatment, HUVEC were stimulated with PAF with or without the PAFR antagonists for different time intervals. Control cells were exposed to PP1 and AG-490 for the duration of the experiment. As seen in Fig.8B, JAK-2 was not phosphorylated in the presence of AG-490 but was unaffected by PP1. Phosphorylation of JAK-2 occurred in PP1-pretreated HUVEC cells after 15 min of PAF stimulation (Fig. 8E), reached maximal levels after 30 min, and dropped to the base line after 60 min of PAF exposure. PAF receptor antagonists LAU-8080, BN-52021, and CV-3988 attenuated JAK-2 phosphorylation below the base-line level at all time points. Phosphorylation of Src was observed in the AG-490-pretreated HUVEC cells but was inhibited in the presence of PP1 (Fig.8C). Rapid phosphorylation of Src occurred after 1 min of PAF stimulation in AG-490-pretreated cells (Fig. 8F). Src phosphorylation decreases with time, reaching nadir at 30 min, and was rephosphorylated after 60 min of PAF exposure. Attenuation of the Src phosphorylation was observed at all time points in the presence of the PAF receptor antagonists LAU-8080, BN-52021, and CV-3988. Phospho-STAT-3 and STAT-3 levels are shown in Fig 8A. When JAK-2 was inhibited by AG-490, STAT-3 was rapidly phosphorylated at 1 min after exposure to PAF (Fig. 8D). The level of STAT-3 phosphorylation then decreased with time through the 30-min time point. Phosphorylation of STAT-3 was again observed after prolonged exposure to PAF (60 min). However, as seen in Fig. 8D, when Src was inhibited by PP1, profound phosphorylation of STAT-3 was observed only after 30 min of PAF stimulation and was maintained through 60 min. STAT-3 phosphorylation was attenuated at all time points by the PAF receptor inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of the PAF receptor. The above observations taken together suggest that the immediate (1 min) PAF-mediated phosphorylation of STAT-3 is independent of JAK-2 and may be dependent on Src, since phosphorylation of Src as well as STAT-3 are observed to be maximal at this time point in the AG-490-pretreated cells. PP1 pretreatment caused an attenuation of both Src as well as STAT-3 phosphorylation after 1 min of PAF exposure, further supporting the immediate Src-dependent phosphorylation of STAT-3. Maximal phosphorylation of STAT-3 occurred at 30 min following stimulation by PAF, corresponding to maximal JAK-2 phosphorylation in the PP1-pretreated cells. The presence of the JAK-2 inhibitor AG-490 caused complete attenuation of both JAK-2 and STAT-3 phosphorylation at this time point, suggesting that at 30 min, STAT-3"

Here we show that HIV-1 envelope gp41 residues 650–685 bind GalCer in a galactose-specific manner. The gp41 residues that display this lectin activity are highly conserved among HIV-1 isolates and constitute three regions: residues 650–661, which encompass a charged helix; residues 662–667, referred to as the conserved epitope ELDKWA, the epitope recognized by antibodies that neutralize HIV-1 entry in epithelial and CD4+-mononucleated cells; and residues 668–685, a hydrophobic Trp-rich sequence that stabilizes the structure of the galactose binding site. Similar to other galactose-specific lectins, the gp41 lectin site is active only as an oligomer. Finally the orientation of the galactose toward the gp41 lectin site appears to be controlled by the lipid microenvironment of the epithelial membrane. From the experimental data we construct a theoretical model of the interaction between gp41 and GalCer based on thermodynamic considerations. This model integrates the dynamics and the spatial organization of the viral envelope glycoproteins, GalCer organized in raft microdomains in the apical region of the epithelial cell membrane and the interfacial water. Characterization of the minimal sequence and structure of gp41 in direct interaction with GalCer may help unravel the still unknown immunogenic determinant able to elicit antibodies against ELDKWA and target of one of the rare neutralizing antibodies against gp41.

Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1998; 40: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The virus infects and replicates poorly in these initial target cells because fusion and integration are rare events. Instead, interaction between HIV-11envelope glycoproteins and epithelial cells or dendritic cells initiates transcytosis or trapping, respectively, which are non-degradative, non-integrative processes that facilitate delivery of intact virus to CD4+ target cells in the submucosa. As the first step of HIV-1 interaction with monostratified epithelium, HIV-1 binds to the apical membrane of gastrointestinal, endocervical, or rectal epithelial cells. This membrane has a characteristic lipid composition with the external leaflet highly enriched in glycosphingolipids (2Simons K. van Meer G.

Bomsel, unpublished results. Importantly, rafts were shown to mediate pathogen interaction with the target cell (for a review, see Ref. 7van der Goot F.G. Harder T. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), for example respiratory syncytial virus endocytosis into dendritic cells (8Werling D. Hope J.C. Chaplin P. Collins R.A. Taylor G.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein consists of two non-covalently associated subunits, the transmembrane gp41 and the surface gp120. At the surface of the virus, HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins oligomerize to form a spike in which gp120 forms a cap covering most of the gp41. Crystallographic studies of recombinant proteins suggest that the extracellular domain of gp41 contains at the N-terminal end a fusion peptide buried below gp120 in the spike and two helices referred to as the N-terminal and C-terminal helix (10Lu M. Kim P.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Wei S. Hong J. Min L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5378-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A study of interdomain interactions involved in the virus spike assembly shows that the region extending outside the gp120 cap and, therefore, accessible to the solvent comprises residues 650–685, the last residues before the transmembrane domain (12Wyatt R. Desjardin E. Olshevsky U. Nixon C. Binley J. Olshevsky V. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9722-9731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 650–685 cover the charged C-terminal helix enriched in amino acids containing free amino and carboxyl groups and a succession of aromatic amino acids (5 Trp, 1 Phe, and 1 Tyr). This region has rarely been studied due to its hydrophobicity despite the importance of the set of Trp in CD4+ cell infection (13Salzwedel K. West J.T. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2469-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until now, most structural and functional studies of gp41 domains have focused on the initial step involved in HIV-1 fusion with CD4+ mononuclear cells (14Mobley P.W. Pilpa R. Brown C. Waring A.J. Gordon L.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2001; 17: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and on the structure of gp41 in its fusogenic conformation. In contrast, the native structure of gp41 on the virion, embedded in the viral membrane, before its interaction with the target cell remains poorly defined. We have shown earlier (15Bomsel M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) that HIV-1 crossed a monostratified epithelial barrier using transcytosis. HIV-1 transcytosis occurred without virus fusion with epithelial cells. A transcytosis process did not modify HIV-1 since the virus retained its infectious potential and could spread infection to CD4+-mononucleated cells. In our recent study of the initial steps in HIV-1 transcytosis across CD4− epithelial cells (16Alfsen A. Iniguez P. Bouguyon E. Bomsel M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6257-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that gp41 binds to epithelial cell GalCer and that disruption of GalCer-containing raft microdomains inhibited HIV-1 transcytosis. The phenotype of HIV-1 in chronically infected patients is a mixture of two virus subtypes, the R5 virus and the X4 virus, using CCR5 and CXCR4 as coreceptor for infection of CD4+ cells, respectively. However, after acute infection, mainly R5 viruses are isolated and, therefore, are supposed to be the main vector of infection (17Zhu T., Mo, H. Wang N. Nam D.S. Cao Y. Koup R.A. Ho D.D. Science. 1993; 261: 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). This suggests that a selection process occurs at the site of HIV entry in the recipient from the HIV-1 mixture inoculated by the donor. In human tissues, epithelial cells express in addition to GalCer only CCR5 but not CXCR4 (18Meng G. Wei X., Wu, X. Sellers M. Decker J.M. Moldoveanu Z. Orenstein J.M., F. Graham M.F. Kappes J.C. Mestecky J. Shaw G.M. Smith P.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Similarly, dendritic cells, the recognized primary HIV cell target in pluristratified mucosa, highly express CCR5 (19Granelli-Piperno A. Delgado E. Finkel V. Paxton W. Steinman R.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2733-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies anti-CCR5 block HIV transfer from epithelial cells (18Meng G. Wei X., Wu, X. Sellers M. Decker J.M. Moldoveanu Z. Orenstein J.M., F. Graham M.F. Kappes J.C. Mestecky J. Shaw G.M. Smith P.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) or dendritic cells to CD4+ cells, the next HIV cell target in the mucosa, but not HIV binding to epithelial2 or dendritic cells (20Geijtenbeek T.B. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L. Nottet H.S. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Thus, HIV binding to its initial target cells at mucosal sites appears independent of HIV coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. In contrast, the binding of gp41 to GalCer involved the conserved ELDKWA region (residues 662–667) of gp41. This region is a potential vaccine target since antibodies to ELDKWA inhibit gp41 binding to epithelial GalCer (16Alfsen A. Iniguez P. Bouguyon E. Bomsel M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6257-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), block HIV-1 transcytosis across a tight epithelial barrier (21Bomsel M. Heyman M. Hocini H. Lagaye S. Belec L. Dupont C. Desgranges C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and neutralize infection by a large array of HIV-1 primary isolates both in vitro and in vivo(22Baba T.W. Liska V. Hofmann-Lehmann R. Vlasak J., Xu, W. Ayehunie S. Cavacini L.A. Posner M.R. Katinger H. Stiegler G. Bernacky B.J. Rizvi T.A. Schmidt R. Hill L.R. Keeling M.E., Lu, Y. Wright J.E. Chou T.C.

Birx D.L. Lewis M.G. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). However, despite numerous attempts, neutralizing antibodies to ELDKWA could not be naturally elicited in vivo. Characterization of the immunogenic determinant able to elicit HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies against ELDKWA remains a challenge for the design of a vaccine against HIV-1. Lectins are glycoproteins that bind sugar with a high specificity. Numerous studies (24Ochoa J.L. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 215: 351-360Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Hoekstra D. Duzgunes N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharyya L. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) on the lectin carbohydrate binding properties demonstrate that this interaction is dependent on charge transfer processes facilitated by hydrogen bond formation. Two kinds of functional groups, free amino and carboxyl groups, and two aromatic structures, Trp and Tyr, could participate in the formation of hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water and may form charge transfer complexes with carbohydrates. As discussed above, residues of the solvent-exposed portion of gp41 contain these two types of functional groups. Here, we sought to determine the minimal sequence and the structure and the oligomerization state of gp41 including ELDKWA able to interact with epithelial GalCer. Such a domain may provide a clue on the immunogenic determinant able to elicit HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies against ELDKWA. We also sought to determine whether this interaction between gp41 and epithelial GalCer is of the lectin-carbohydrate type. In addition, we investigated the role of the raft lipid microdomain in the orientation of the galactose head of GalCer toward its binding site on gp41. Using the present experimental data and thermodynamic computation of the affinity constant of the gp41 peptide for the GalCer, we have constructed a theoretical model of HIV-1 lectin interaction with glycosphingolipids organized in an epithelial cell membrane. According to this model, the dynamics and the spatial organization of the viral spike lectin and the epithelial cell membrane play an essential role in the gp41 lectin-carbohydrate interaction. ELDKWA (21Bomsel M. Heyman M. Hocini H. Lagaye S. Belec L. Dupont C. Desgranges C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), P1 (amino acids 650–685), P2 (amino acids 660–679), P3 (amino acids 650–669), P4 (amino acids 640–659), and leucine zipper (LZ) (amino acids 586–608) with a C-terminal CONH2 were synthesized by Eurogentec (Belgium). Peptides were prepared as stock solutions of 500 μm in phosphate buffer 0.1 m, pH 7.2, and used at a final concentration of 10–500 μm as indicated. For the cellular studies, a biotin was added to ELDKWA and P1 at their N-terminal end during synthesis by Eurogentec. Each peptide contains therefore one biotin. Peptide binding to HT29 epithelial cells was performed as previously described (16Alfsen A. Iniguez P. Bouguyon E. Bomsel M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6257-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) using biotinylated ELDKWA or P1 at the indicated concentrations (25–500 μm). Bodipy-galactosylceramide (BpGalCer*), a C12-coupled bodipy, Bodipy-glucosylceramide (BpGluCer*), and Bodipy-sphingomyelin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and stored as an ethanolic solution. To study the interaction of Bp-glycolipids* and peptides, the ethanolic solution of Bp-glycolipid* was directly injected in the peptide-containing solution of PBS at a final concentration of 1–6 μm Bp-glycolipid*. At these concentrations, <5 mol %, we verify that no collisional quenching due to any form of aggregation was observed. This is in agreement with the characteristics of the probe, as indicated by the manufacturer. Unlabeled GalCer, ganglioside GM1, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Single bilayer lipid vesicles were prepared according to the ethanol injection procedure (27Fung B.K.-K. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5241-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Aliquots of PC, unlabeled GalCer or GM1, and cholesterol, each dissolved in chloroform, were mixed at the following ratio. GalCer·PC (4:1) with or without cholesterol is referred to as “raft lipids,” and GM1·PC (1:4) with or without cholesterol is referred to as “non-raft lipids.” The solvent was removed under nitrogen. Dry lipids were dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 1–5 mm. The fluorescent Bp-glycolipid* in ethanol was added to the ethanolic solution at concentrations of 10–40 μm and rapidly injected through a needle with continuous and vigorous stirring into the peptide-containing solution to obtain the desired final concentration. The final proportion of ethanol in the working solution was always <0.5%. The circular dichroic spectra of peptides in the far UV (λ, 200–260 nm) was obtained on a spectrometer Mark V dichrograph Jobin et Yvon equipped with software for the acquisition of the data. The concentration of peptides varied from 10 to 500 μm using a different path length from 0.01 to 2 cm. Blanks for buffer were subtracted, and spectra were analyzed based on the characteristic spectra of α-helix, β-pleated sheet and random coil (28Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar) and using the equation (θ)λι = 3300Δελι/m = (θ)αιλιPα + (θ)βιλιPβ + (θ)ρλιPρ, with Pα + Pβ + Pρ = 1 for each pair of wavelengths λι between 210 and 222 and between 222 and 231; Δελι is the molar dichroic absorption coefficient (m−1 cm−1) at λι;m is the number of residues per polypeptide chain; (θ)λ is the molar ellipticity per residue; (θ)αλι, (θ)βλι, and (θ)ρλι, are the characteristic molar ellipticities per residue in each structure; and Pα, Pβ, and Pρ are the different proportions of each secondary structure. Absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-visible Varian DMS 70 spectrophotometer. Steady state fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were obtained on a spectrofluorimeter with the experimental arrangement (29Klein R. Tatischeff I. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 45: 55-65Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Tatischeff I. Klein R. Birks J.B. Excited State of Biological Molecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 375-387Google Scholar) equipped with MAC II Ci and Labview 3.1 software for the acquisition of data and Kaleidagraph 3.0 for analysis of the data. The entrance and exit slit widths were 2 mm for the McPherson excitation monochromator and 1.8 and 1 mm for the Baush & Lomb emission monochromator. Quartz cuvets of 2 × 10 mm or 3 × 3 mm were positioned with 2 perpendicular micrometers. The absorbance peaks (ε/cm) of the samples were less than 0.1 to eliminate inner filter effect in all measurements with the peptide and the fluorescent lipid alone. In the experiments with the fluorescent probe incorporated in lipid vesicles, corrections have been made to account for the fractional absorbance of the solution using the formula B(λ) = A(λ)/A(λ) + As(λ){1 − 10−(A(λ) + As(λ)}. All spectra were made at 22 °C. Fluorescence quantum yield (Q d ) of the donor peptides were determined from a solution of Trp in PBS using a value of Q o = 0.13 for Trp, as given by Chen et al. (31Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Steiner R.F. Leach S.J. Physical Principle and Techniques of Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1969: 171-244Google Scholar). Calculation of the energy transfer efficiency from the P1 Trp residues to the Bodipy on C12 of the ceramide chain of BpGalCer* were made using the decrease in the value of the maximum I f in arbitrary units at 350 nm of the peptide bound to BpGalCer*,I fa/I fo. Q o , the quantum yield of P1, was equal to 0.078. The efficiency of the transfer is given by T ef =Q a /Q o , whereQ a is the quantum yield of P1 in the presence of the acceptor obtained fromI fa/I fo. The Förster radius, calculated for such a transfer from the Förster equation, is R o = (JQ o K 2)/ῡ4)1/6(9.79 × 103 Å), where K 2 is the dipole-dipole orientation factor, taken as 2/3 for randomly oriented donor and acceptor molecules, and υ is the wave number. J, the donor–acceptor spectral overlap integral in cm3m−1, is calculated from the emission spectrum of the P1 absorption spectrum of BpGalCer* overlap between 300 and 475 nm, εm280 nm (P1) = 29.73 × 103, εm360 nm (BpGalCer*) = 28.8 × 103, and εm505 nm(BpGalCer*) = 85 × 103. For measurements in the presence of lipids, the fractional molar absorption for P1 in the lipid medium is ε = 23.0 × 103. Each value on the curves is the representative result of more than 10 reproducible experiments for each set of data in different conditions obtained after standard control for each day. We previously showed that the conserved hexapeptide ELDKWA in gp41 was the determinant for gp41 binding to epithelial GalCer (16Alfsen A. Iniguez P. Bouguyon E. Bomsel M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6257-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Gp41 binds epithelial cell GalCer, and this interaction is inhibited by an excess of ELDKWA peptide. The ELDKWA peptide appears to be a key component of the exposed sequence of gp41 capable of binding the target cell. Therefore, we determined whether ELDKWA binds directly to the epithelial cell GalCer using our in vitro model (15Bomsel M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 1 (first row), ELDKWA (25–500 μm) did not bind to epithelial cells. In the gp41 molecule, ELDKWA (gp41 residues 662–667) is surrounded by a charged helix at the N terminus and a hydrophobic Trp-rich region at the C terminus. These two regions may provide a structure to ELDKWA (32Imberty A. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. Rougé P. Pérez S. Adv. Biophys. Chem. 1993; 3: 71-117Google Scholar). Therefore, we synthesized a longer peptide P1 of 35 amino acids (gp41 residues 650–685) encompassing part of the helix, ELDKWA, and the Trp-rich region. As mentioned above, P1 covers the part of gp41 exposed at the surface of the viral particle before the virus interacts with target cells (12Wyatt R. Desjardin E. Olshevsky U. Nixon C. Binley J. Olshevsky V. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9722-9731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the inability of ELDKWA alone to bind epithelial cell surface, P1 bound the epithelial surface in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, second row). The concentration-dependent binding of P1 to GalCer suggests that P1 adopts a structured, concentration-dependent oligomeric state. Such a result would be in agreement with the well recognized oligomeric structure of the intact virion envelope spike (33Gorny M.K. Zolla-Pazner S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6186-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 34Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13922-13928Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 35Thomas D.J.

A. 1994; 91: 12676-12680Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) that interacts with epithelial cells of the mucosa. In gp41, LZ peptide (residues 586–608) has been shown to interact with the gp41 C-terminal helix, which share residues 650–664 with P1, as a necessary step in the fusion process. Preincubation of biotinylated P1 with the LZ in stoichiometric amount (100 μm) prevented biotinylated P1 binding to the epithelial cell surface (Fig. 1,third row). The present results suggest that gp41 in the fusogenic state (when both the C-terminal helix and LZ interacts tightly) cannot interact with GalCer (see also Fig.4 d). We next determined the structure and oligomerization state of P1 by circular dichroism (CD) in the far UV and measured P1 molar ellipticity as a function of concentration. As shown in Fig. 2 a, below 50 μm the CD spectrum of P1 indicates a poorly structured molecule, as shown for related peptide DP178/T20 (residues 643–678) at 10 μm (14Mobley P.W. Pilpa R. Brown C. Waring A.J. Gordon L.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2001; 17: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At a concentration above 50 μm, the CD spectra of P1 exhibit well defined extrema at 207 and 222 nm, which is characteristic of an α-helical structure. With a value of the molar ellipticity of θλ222 = −7.76 × 103 and θλ207 = − 8.2 × 103 calculated for 35 residues and given a value of − 22 × 103 for 100% helix (37Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar), the estimated percent of helicity for P1 is ∼35%. The CD spectra obtained at higher concentrations, namely 250 and 500 μm, also exhibited negative peaks at 207 and 222 nm, thus confirming the helical structure of the peptide (data not shown). However, the mean residue ellipticity value at 220 nm (θλ220) exhibited a direct linear relationship with the P1 concentration (Fig. 2 b), displaying a slope of 0.045 for P1 between 25 and 100 μm. For P1 between 100 and 500 μm, the slope is 10 times lower (0.0045) even if no aggregation was observed from the absorbance value. Such a P1 concentration dependence of θλ220 indicates on the one hand interchain interaction, as shown for poly-lysine peptides (38Lu-Ku L. Spector A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1968; 91: 220-221Google Scholar), and on the other hand secondary structure changes, as shown for staphylococcal-D-toxin (39Thiaudiere E. Siffert O. Talbot J.C. Bolard J. Alouf J.E. Dufourcq J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We next used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Trp present on P1 and Bodipy-labeled GalCer (BpGalCer*) to determine the exact sequence of gp41 peptide required for HIV-1 gp41 to bind to GalCer. P1 contains three modules, 1) the charged C-terminal helix, 2) ELDKWA, and 3) the Trp-rich region of gp41. Besides P1, three additional peptides were synthesized; they are P2 (residues 660–679), including ELDKWA and the Trp-rich region; P3 (residues 650–669), including the charged C-terminal helix and ELDKWA; and P4 (amino acid 640–659), including the charged C-terminal helix. The fluorescence emission spectra of the P1–4 peptides at 50 μm as a result of Trp excitation at 280 nm are shown on Fig.3 a. P4 without Trp served as a negative control. For FRET, the peptide Trp residues were used as the donor, and BpGalCer* was used as the acceptor. Fig. 3 b shows that the probes are compatible for FRET. Indeed, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the Trp-containing peptides (P1, P2, and P3) overlaps the BpGalCer* absorption spectrum in the wavelength range of 300–475 nm. BpGalCer* excited at 488 nm fluoresced with a peak at 525 nm only when the probe was in a hydrophobic medium such as organic solvents, lipids, or P1, a peptide with hydrophobic residues, namely five Trp, one Phe, and one Tyr, but did not fluoresce in the aqueous buffer PBS (Fig.3 c, inset). The maximum intensity of intrinsic fluorescence (I f) of BpGalCer* excited at 488 nm was dependent on the P1 concentration (Fig. 3 c). In the presence of only P1 without additional lipids, the relationship betweenI f and P1 concentration is linear. However, a sharp transition occurred at 50 μm P1 when BpGalCer* is embedded in P1 and raft lipids. The BpGalCer* is then in the hydrophobic environment of the lipid fatty acyl chain, protecting the fluorescent Bodipy from radiation-less energy loss interaction with the aqueous solvent and, therefore, increasing the quantum yield of the fluorescent probe. Therefore, on the one hand BpGalCer* adopts a specific raft-induced orientation due to its hydrophobic part embedded among the fatty acid tails of the surrounding lipids, and on the other hand, the interaction of the galactosyl moiety with the P1 lectin site stabilizes this orientation at the concentrations where the lectin site is efficient. Such characteristics could explain the highest intrinsic fluorescence of the probe, evidenced by the transition in theI f value, in the presence of 50–100 μm P1. A significant amount of energy transferred from P1 Trp residues to BpGalCer* when P1 (50 μm) was excited at 280 nm (Fig.4 a). The efficiency of this transfer was T ef = 0.58 × 0.078 = 0.045, as calculated withI fa/I fo = 0.58. The Förster radius (R o ), the distance at which energy transfer is 50%, calculated with a spectral overlap value ofJ = 5.9 × 10−16 cm3m−1 (Fig. 3 b), was 28 Å, which corresponds to the distance between the Bodipy on the ceramide chain and the carbohydrate binding site in the peptide. Given the distance between the C12 atom of the ceramide, to which the Bodipy probe is conjugated, to the galactose ring as 12–15 Å, one can calculate the distance between the galactose and the galactose binding site in P1 (at 50 μm) to be less than 15 Å. FRET from P1 is sugar-specific as no transfer occurred to Bodipy-glucosylceramide (BpGlucCer*) (Fig. 4 b); a similar absence of transfer was observed from P1 to Bodipy-sphingomyelin and -ceramide (data not shown). These results show that P1 at 50 μm presents a galactosyl-specific binding site. From P1–4, only P1 was able to transfer energy to BpGalCer* (Fig.4 a). The importance of the charges on the helical part of the peptide in FRET is revealed by the absence of FRET from P2 to BpGalCer*. The absence of FRET from P3, containing the charged helix and ELDKWA but not the stacked hydrophobic Trp aromatic rings, provides evidence for a hydrophobic region requirement for gp41 binding to GalCer (Fig. 4 a). Carbohydrate sites of galactose-specific lectins have been shown to arrange as a pocket containing non-contiguous c"
https://openalex.org/W1979107436,"Stats (signal transducer and activator of transcription) are latent transcription factors that translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Constitutive activation of Stat3 alpha by upstream oncoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases has been found in many human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines. Constitutively activated Stat3 alpha is often correlated with the activation of ErbB-2, a member of the EGFR family. To explore the involvement of ErbB-2 in the activation of Stat3 and the mechanism underlying this event, an ErbB-2 point mutant was used as a model of constitutively activated receptor. Phenylalanine mutations (Y-->F) were made in the autophosphorylation sites of the receptor, and their ability to activate Stat3 alpha was evaluated. Our results suggest that Stat3 alpha and JAK2 associates with ErbB-2 prior to phosphorylation of the receptor and that full activation of Stat3 alpha by ErbB-2 requires the participation of other non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Both Src and Jak2 kinases contribute to the activation of Stat3 alpha but Src binds to ErbB-2 only when the receptor is phosphorylated. Our results also suggest that tyrosine 1139 may be important for Src homology 2 domain association because a mutant lacking this tyrosine reduces the ability of the Src homology 2 domain to bind to ErbB-2 and significantly decreases its ability to activate Stat3 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2042263540,"Infections of bacteria and viruses induce host defense reactions known as innate responses including the activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), critical for the activation of type I interferon system. Upon immediate early signals triggered by the infection, IRF-3 is phosphorylated and a homodimer results. The homodimer complexes with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 in the nucleus; thus, holocomplex of IRF-3 competent in DNA binding is generated. We showed CBP/p300 to be indispensable for the DNA binding activity of the holocomplex and to aid the binding through direct interaction with the DNA. We demonstrated that p300 binds with the IRF-3 homodimer via a Q-rich domain and that an intact histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain is indispensable for the DNA binding of the holocomplex along with a CH3 domain, which connects the HAT and Q-rich domains. These results highlight a novel function of CBP/p300: direct involvement in sequence-specific DNA binding. Furthermore, the critical function of these domains in virus-induced gene activation was demonstrated in vivo by using p300 mutants. Infections of bacteria and viruses induce host defense reactions known as innate responses including the activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), critical for the activation of type I interferon system. Upon immediate early signals triggered by the infection, IRF-3 is phosphorylated and a homodimer results. The homodimer complexes with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 in the nucleus; thus, holocomplex of IRF-3 competent in DNA binding is generated.

Infection by a virus or treatment with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)1 induces the activation of an array of genes including the gene for type I interferon (IFN-α and -β) in various cell types (1DeMaeyer E. DeMaeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1-153Google Scholar, 2Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In certain cells such as macrophages, however, bacterial endotoxin triggers a signal leading to the activation of type I IFN genes along with other cytokine genes. Type I IFN genes are directly activated by the immediate early response, and the secreted IFN expands the response by activating additional sets of genes involved in antiviral responses and the modulation of cellular functions. Therefore, the activation of type I IFN genes is crucial to the amplification of the signal triggering late responses. A very low basal expression and a rapid reversal to efficient expression after activation are characteristics of type I IFN genes. It has been shown that the versatile transcription factors NF-κB, ATF-2, and c-Jun are involved in the activation of the IFN-β gene (3Du W. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 5Fujita T. Miyamoto M.

However, when these factors were activated by nonviral/dsRNA stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-1, no significant activation of the IFN-β gene was observed, indicating that activation of these factors alone are not sufficient (6Fujita T.

Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4421-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Promoter analysis of IFN-α and -β revealed the involvement of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of proteins (8Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Sato M. Ozato K. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). IRF-1–9 contain a conserved DNA binding domain at their N termini and potentially bound to the IRF motif in the promoter (9Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Although some of the IRFs specifically bound to the promoter of the IFN-β gene or a synthetic IRF element in vitro, the exogenous expression of these IRFs is not sufficient to activate the gene as efficiently as viral infection (10Fujita T. Kimura Y. Miyamoto M. Barsoumian E.L. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1989; 337: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Studies from different laboratories using dominant negative mutants, gene disruption techniques, and specific ribozymes show that IRF-3 plays a critical role in the viral induction of type I IFN genes (11Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). IRF-3 is expressed ubiquitously and accumulated in cytoplasm in an inactive form. Viral infection or treatment with dsRNA triggers a signal, which results in the specific phosphorylation of serine residues of IRF-3 (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

The phosphorylated IRF-3 becomes a homodimer and then forms a complex with the coactivators CBP/p300 in the nucleus (16Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem.

This holocomplex of IRF-3 is conferred DNA binding activity for the IRF motif and possibly the potential to initiate gene activation (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E.

CBP/p300 interacts with various DNA-binding transcription factors with its respective domains and forms a multimeric complex on promoter DNA (20Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Because CBP and p300 are histone acetyltransferases, their involvement in the activation of nucleosomal loci by histone acetylation is suggested (21Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar). In vitro, CBP/p300 does not significantly alter the DNA binding affinity or specificity of the DNA-binding transcription factors, except in some cases (for example p53 and c-Myb) where the DNA binding is modulated by acetylation (22Gu W.

It has been observedin vitro that the complex of IRF motif DNA and the activated IRF-3 invariably associates with CBP/p300, suggesting an unusually high affinity of CBP/p300 for the phosphorylated IRF-3 and/or a direct association of CBP/p300 with the DNA in the context of an IRF-3 holocomplex (13Yoneyama M.

In the present study, we analyzed molecular mechanism behind the formation of the IRF-3 holocomplex. The biochemical reconstitution of the holocomplex from IRF-3 homodimers and CBP/p300 and the use of various p300 mutants allowed us to identify the critical domains of p300. The physiological importance of these domains in gene expression was shown in cells using the corresponding mutants of p300. L929, 293T, and HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. DNA transfection of L929 cells and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection were performed as described previously (8Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Sato M. Ozato K. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). DNA transfection of 293T cells was performed by calcium phosphate methods as reported (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (27Iwamura T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Mori W. Shiota K. Okabe Y. Namiki H. Fujita T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Expression constructs of pEFp50IRF-3, pEFHAp300 and pEFGSTIRF-3 were described previously (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 17Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for p300 deletion mutants were obtained by deletion of SpeI (Δ143–957), BamHI (Δ599–1240),BspHI and SmaI (Δ194–1572), orPmaCI (1–1946) fragments from pEFHAp300. pEFHAp300 (1235–2412), pEFHAp300 (1235–2221), and pEFHAp300 (1235–2412ΔHAT) were obtained by PCR with oligonucleotides corresponding to the end point sequences. To generate pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957MutAT2),XbaI and NdeI fragment from pBluescript KS containing p300 (MutAT2) was inserted into pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957) (28Kraus W.L. Manning E.T. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8123-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To obtain an expression construct of pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957ΔZZ), a PCR fragment corresponding to amino acids 1302–1663 was inserted into XbaI/MunI-digested pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957). The expression vector of pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957ΔTAZ) was constructed by insertion of two appropriate PCR fragments into pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957) to delete amino acids 1725–1806, and a MluI site was introduced to join these fragments without mutation. To obtain constructs of pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957ΔZn1/2, Δ143–957ΔZn1α1, Δ143–957ΔZn2/3, and Δ143–957ΔZn1), appropriate fragments were inserted into theMluI site of pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957ΔTAZ). To generate pEFHAp300 (Δ143–957Δα1), the Gene Editor in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) was used. The vector pLNCX-FLAG-CBP was used for expression of human CBP (29Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoyama A. Ohki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7184-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The reporter construct p-55C1B-CAT was described previously (7Watanabe N. Sakakibara J. Hovanessian A.G. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4421-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Anti-p50 epitope monoclonal antibody was established by Dr. N. Hanai (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd.). Anti-human IRF-3 and anti-human IRF-3 NES antiserum were described previously (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 17Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Anti-HA polyclonal (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-HA mouse monoclonal (12CA5), anti-p300 (N-15, Santa Cruz), anti-GST (B-14, Santa Cruz), and anti-CBP (A-22, Santa Cruz) polyclonal antibodies were obtained commercially. Recombinant full-length histidine-tagged human p300 was a gift from Dr. T. Ito of Saitama Medical University. The protein was expressed by a baculovirus system and purified to homogeneity on a nickel column. L929 cells were transfected with pEFp50IRF-3 and infected with NDV for 12 h. The whole cell lysate prepared by a standard procedure (150 μl) was treated with 1% DOC on ice for 10 min, then separated on a 5-ml gradient (10–40% glycerol containing 1% DOC, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) by centrifugation for 16 h at 50,000 rpm in a Hitachi p55ST2 rotor. After fractionation of the gradient into 20 fractions, Nonidet P-40 was added to give a final concentration of 2%. Each fraction was assayed for IRF-3 and p300 by immunoblotting. The IRF-3 fraction free of p300 was pooled. L929 cells were transiently transfected with pEFGSTIRF-3 and infected with NDV for 12 h. The cell extract and HA-tagged recombinant p300 proteins generated from 293T cells were mixed and rotated with glutathione (GT)-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min. After an extensive wash with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. EMSA was performed as described previously (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). To examine the DNA binding activity of homomeric IRF-3, L929 or HeLa cell extract was treated with DOC (final 1%) on ice for 30 min and then subjected to EMSA. To investigate the DNA binding activities of p300 deletion mutants, L929 cells were transiently transfected with pEFp50IRF-3 and infected with NDV for 12 h. The extract and HA-tagged recombinant p300 mutants derived from 293T cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then the binding mixture was added. EMSA was performed with the lysate of infected L929 cells expressing p50-tagged IRF-3 and a32P-labeled ISG15 probe in which thymines were substituted with bromodeoxyuridines (BrdUrd). The probe sequence was: 5′-GAGAGGGAAACCGAAACUGAATTAGCTTTCAGUUUCGGUUUCCCTCTC-3′ (positions of BrdUrd are indicated by U, and the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) is underlined). After electrophoresis, the gel was irradiated (302 nm for 20 min) to cross-link the complex to the probe. The band corresponding to the holocomplex was excised from the gel, and the protein-DNA complexes were eluted with SDS loading buffer. Complexes were precipitated by acetone (80%) and dissolved with radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% DOC, and 0.1% SDS). The samples were analyzed directly or subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE. To detect the intrinsic HAT activity of p300 deletion mutants, whole cell lysates of 293T cells expressing HA-tagged p300 mutants were prepared. The lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-HA polyclonal antibody and then dissolved with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). [14C]Acetyl-CoA (500 Bq) and 1 μg of histone were added to the reaction buffer and reacted at 30 °C for 1 h. SDS loading buffer was added to stop the reaction. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane, and acetylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. The same membrane was reacted with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. To investigate the acetylation of IRF-3, L929 cells were transiently transfected with pEFGSTIRF-3 and mock-treated or infected with NDV for 12 h. The cell extracts were precipitated using GT-Sepharose 4B and then dissolved with reaction buffer as described above. [14C]Acetyl-CoA (500 Bq) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. SDS-PAGE, detection of acetylated proteins, and immunoblotting with anti-p300 or anti-GST antibodies were performed as described above. For the digestion of GST-IRF-3 into GST and IRF-3, virus-activated GST-IRF-3 was precipitated as described above. After the in vitroacetylation assay was performed, the resin was dissolved with reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5% glycerol) and incubated at 16 °C for 2 h with recombinant thrombin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). SDS loading buffer was added to stop the reaction. After transfer to PVDF, acetylated proteins were detected by autoradiography and then reacted with anti-IRF-3 or anti-GST antibody. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The CAT assay was performed as described previously (7Watanabe N. Sakakibara J. Hovanessian A.G. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4421-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been shown that viral infection or treatment with dsRNA results in the formation of a holocomplex of IRF-3, exhibiting activity to bind the ISRE or IRF motif (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 15Weaver B.K. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4159-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The holocomplex is composed of a homodimer of IRF-3 and the coactivators CBP/p300 (17Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A typical result of electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) with extract of mouse L929 cells expressing human IRF-3 and infected with NDV (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2) or HeLa cells that had been treated with poly(I·C) for 60 min (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6) are shown. Supershift experiments with specific antibodies showed that the IRF-3 holocomplex contained endogenous IRF-3 and CBP/p300, as demonstrated previously (13Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), but not IRF-7 (data not shown). The generation of the IRF-3 holocomplex was dependent on induction by virus or poly(I·C) (lanes 2 and 6) and independent of overexpression of IRF-3 (lanes 5 and 6, untransfected HeLa cells), demonstrating that the inducible interaction between IRF-3 and CBP/p300 is not because of an artifact of transient overexpression. Furthermore, co-precipitation experiment with untransfected cells demonstrated that the interaction is physiologically relevant (Fig.1 B). It was shown that treatment of extract with 1% DOC results in a dissociation of CBP/p300 from IRF-3 homodimers (17Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the activity to bind ISRE of the holocomplex induced either by NDV or poly(I·C) disappeared (Fig. 1 A,lanes 4 and 8). It has been shown that bacterially expressed recombinant IRF-3 could bind to IRF motif (30Schafer S.L. Lin R. Moore P.A. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2714-2720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar); however, we did not detect the faster migrating band corresponding to IRF-3 under these conditions (see below and “Discussion”). The bands indicated by asterisks were demonstrated as nonspecific bands by supershift experiments (data not shown). Because DOC treatment reversibly dissociates the tight association between the transcription factor NF-κB and its inhibitory subunit IκB (31Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), the result prompted us to dissociate the IRF-3 holocomplex into components and reconstitute them in vitro. To isolate IRF-3 homodimers, an extract of L929 cells expressing human IRF-3 and infected with NDV was treated with 1% DOC and subjected to glycerol density gradient fractionation. The fractionation allowed us to isolate human IRF-3 homodimers essentially free of p300 (Fig. 1 C). The isolated homodimers exhibited no significant DNA binding on EMSA (Fig.1 D, lane 1). The faster mobility bands indicated by asterisks were shown as a nonspecific bands by supershift experiment (data not shown). However, the addition of recombinant p300, which was produced in insect cells and exhibited no significant ISRE DNA binding on its own (Fig. 1 D, lane 4), generated DNA binding activity similar to the IRF-3 holocomplex (Fig.1 D, lanes 2 and 3). When the isolated IRF-3 homodimers were mixed with extracts of 293T cells, which had been transiently transfected with expression vectors for CBP or p300 (Fig. 1 E, lanes 2 and3) but not with vector alone (lane 1), DNA binding activity similar to that of the IRF-3 holocomplex was generated. A similar result was obtained using the IRF motif of IFN-β gene as a probe (data not shown). Thus, unlike most of the DNA-binding transcription factors, which utilize CBP/p300, IRF-3 absolutely requires the coactivators for DNA binding. The results prompted us to investigate whether p300 physically interacts with DNA. To test the contribution of p300 to the binding of IRF-3 to DNA, the ISG15 probe with thymines changed to BrdUrd was used. A complex containing32P-labeled probe and the holocomplex of IRF-3 was resolved by EMSA (Fig. 2 A) showing that the probe detects IRF-3 holocomplex and ISGF3 as the standard probe (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The EMSA in Fig. 2 Awas performed on a large scale. The gel was UV-cross-linked in situ, and the band of IRF-3 holocomplex (NDV+) or corresponding area of the gel with uninfected extract (NDV−) was excised and extracted with SDS loading buffer. The recovered complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). To our surprise, the size of the major complex was >200 kDa, much larger than the expected molecular size of the IRF-3/probe complex (lane 4). This band was not evident in the corresponding area of the gel in which extract from uninfected cells was run (lane 3) nor when UV irradiation was omitted (lanes 1 and2). To identify the peptide moiety of the recovered complex, the gel eluate was precipitated using specific antibodies. The >200-kDa complex was precipitated with anti-CBP and anti-p300 (lane 10) but not with the control antibody (lane 12), indicating that CBP/p300 is in direct contact with DNA in the context of the holocomplex bound to the target DNA. Anti-IRF-3 precipitated a small but significant amount of 66-kDa complex (lane 11), which likely corresponds to IRF-3 monomer cross-linked to the probe. The other >200 kDa complex, likely corresponding to IRF-3 and CBP/p300 simultaneously cross-linked to the probe. The results strongly suggest that p300 aids the binding of IRF-3 by directly interacting with the DNA. Next we examined the region of p300 required to induce the DNA binding activity of the IRF-3 holocomplex. A series of deletion mutants of p300 were expressed in 293T cells (Fig.3 A). The ability of these mutants to associate with phosphorylated IRF-3 was tested in vitro (Fig. 3 B, top panel,left). The extracts of 293T cells overexpressing HA-tagged p300 mutants were reacted in vitro with those of L929 cells that had been transfected with GST-IRF-3 and infected with NDV to phosphorylate specific serine residues of IRF-3. The bound p300 mutants were, respectively, co-precipitated with GT-Sepharose and detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA (Fig. 3 B, GST pull-down/α HA). In any case, GST-IRF-3 from uninfected cells did not form a complex with p300, indicating that phosphorylation is essential (data not shown). Because each of the mutants Δ143–957, Δ599–1240, Δ194–1572, 1235–2412, and 1235–2221 did form a complex with GST-IRF-3, the N-terminal region up to 1572 amino acids is dispensable for the association with IRF-3. Whereas 1–1946 did not bind to GST-IRF-3, indicating that the binding domain resides in the C-terminal region (1947–2221). This is consistent with our previous finding that GSTΔp300 (1752–2221) bound to IRF-3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (17Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well as with results from other laboratories (CBP, 1992–2441; Ref. 14Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Thus, the Q-rich region is defined as the interface of the interaction with IRF-3 homodimer. Next we tested whether the complex of IRF-3 homodimers and p300 mutants binds to DNA (Fig. 3 B, top panel,right). 293T cell lysate containing HA-p300 or the respective mutants was reacted with the lysate of L929 cells containing activated p50 tag-IRF-3. The mixture was subjected to EMSA using the ISG15 probe (EMSA). Under these conditions, the L929 extract exhibited DNA binding activity corresponding to the holocomplex composed of p50-IRF-3 and endogenous mouse p300 (EMSA, lane 1). However, the addition of excess p300 increased the intensity of the DNA-bound complex (lane 2), indicating that p300 is a limiting factor in the extract. Interestingly, the addition of p300 mutants Δ143–957, Δ599–1240, 1235–2412, and 1235–2221, which are smaller than the intact p300, generated a DNA-bound complex that migrated faster than the IRF-3 holocomplex (EMSA, arrows,lanes 3, 4, 7, and8). Supershift experiments showed that the complexes binding DNA contained both p300 mutants and IRF-3 (data not shown). Δ194–1572, which exhibited strong binding with the phosphorylated IRF-3 (Fig. 3 B, GST pull-down/α HA,lane 5), failed to promote DNA binding (Fig. 3 B,EMSA, lane 5). Comparison of the structures of Δ143–957, Δ194–1572, 1235–2412, and 1235–2221 suggests the presence of a region between 1241 and 1573 critical for DNA binding activity. Because this region corresponds to the HAT domain, several additional mutants were generated. Two sets of mutants of the HAT domain were generated (Fig.4 A). The internal region of 50 amino acids was deleted from the mutant 1235–2412 to generate 1235–2412ΔHAT. This deletion has been shown to remove the catalytic activity of HAT (32Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Additionally, the substitution of 6 amino acids in a distinct region of HAT was shown to inactivate the enzyme (28Kraus W.L. Manning E.T. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8123-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This substitution was introduced into the mutant Δ143–957 to generate Δ143–957MutAT2. These mutants were overexpressed in 293T cells, and cell extracts were subjected to a HAT a"
https://openalex.org/W2143644333,"It was generally accepted that plants, algae, and phototrophic bacteria use adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) for assimilatory sulfate reduction, whereas bacteria and fungi use phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). The corresponding enzymes, APS and PAPS reductase, share 25–30% identical amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of APS and PAPS reductase amino acid sequences from different organisms, which were retrieved from the GenBankTM, revealed two clusters. The first cluster comprised known PAPS reductases from enteric bacteria, cyanobacteria, and yeast. On the other hand, plant APS reductase sequences were clustered together with many bacterial ones, including those fromPseudomonas and Rhizobium. The gene for APS reductase cloned from the APS-reducing cyanobacteriumPlectonema also clustered together with the plant sequences, confirming that the two classes of sequences represent PAPS and APS reductases, respectively. Compared with the PAPS reductase, all sequences of the APS reductase cluster contained two additional cysteine pairs homologous to the cysteine residues involved in binding an iron-sulfur cluster in plants. Mossbauer analysis revealed that the recombinant APS reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster with the same characteristics as the plant enzyme. We conclude, therefore, that the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster determines the APS specificity of the sulfate-reducing enzymes and thus separates the APS- and PAPS-dependent assimilatory sulfate reduction pathways."

In this study, we demonstrate that Pin1 interacts with protein kinase CK2, an enzyme that generally exists in tetrameric complexes composed of two catalytic CK2α and/or CK2α′ subunits together with two regulatory CK2β subunits. Our results indicate that Pin1 can interact with CK2 complexes that contain CK2α.

In vitro, Pin1 inhibits the phosphorylation of Thr-1342 on human topoisomerase IIα by CK2. Topoisomerase IIα also interacts with Pin1 suggesting that the effect of Pin1 on the phosphorylation of Thr-1342 could result from its interactions with CK2 and/or topoisomerase IIα.

Pin1 belongs to the parvulin family of isomerases, which is distinct from the cyclophilin and FK506 binding protein peptidyl-prolyl isomerase families. Studies on Pin1 provide evidence for its involvement in the G2/M transition and in mitosis. Pin1 can interact with many mitotic regulators including Myt1, Wee1, Plk1/Plx1, and Cdc25, although not with Cdc2 (8Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S.

Two groups found that the addition of recombinant Pin1 to cycling Xenopus extracts in vitro stopped extracts from entering mitosis (8Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S.

They also clearly demonstrated that xPin1 is required for the execution of the DNA replication checkpoint. Collectively, these results link Pin1 to the G2/M transition and events regulating mitosis. Another important protein implicated in cell cycle events and in cell viability is the highly conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase CK2,1 a tetrameric enzyme that is composed of two catalytic (CK2α and/or CK2α′) subunits and two regulatory (CK2β) subunits (reviewed in Refs. 12Glover C.V.C.

Genetic studies in yeast suggest a role for CK2 at distinct stages during cell cycle progression including the G2/M transition where it is required for the phosphorylation of topoisomerase II (12Glover C.V.C.

In mammalian cells, CK2 activity increases when quiescent cells are stimulated to proliferate (reviewed in Refs. 13Issinger O.-G. Pharmacol.

Studies performed using selective CK2 inhibitors, antisense down-regulation, or kinase-inactive mutants of CK2 also illustrate that CK2 is required during various stages of cell cycle progression including the G2/M transition and in checkpoint control (18Ford H.L.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6994-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, CK2 activity levels are elevated in a number of tumors and leukemic cells. Targeted overexpression of CK2 in transgenic mice results in the development of T cell lymphoma and mammary tumorigenesis (21Seldin D.C. Leder P.

Collectively, these studies implicate CK2 as an important component of signaling pathways involved in cell cycle progression and transformation. Although the mechanism of CK2 regulation is not fully understood, one way in which it could be regulated is through phosphorylation. Several sites on CK2 are known to be phosphorylated in cells (25Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J. Cicirelli M.F. Harrylock M. Ericsson L.H. Piening C.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In fact, in light of its predicted involvement in various aspects of cell cycle progression, it is notable that CK2 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (26Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, one isoform of the CK2 catalytic subunit (i.e. CK2α) is selectively phosphorylated in mitotic cells at 4 sites localized within its C-terminal 60 amino acids. Interestingly, the other isoform of the CK2 catalytic subunit (i.e. CK2α′) has a distinct C-terminal domain that lacks these phosphorylation sites and is not phosphorylated in mitotic cells (26Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitotic phosphorylation sites on CK2α can all be phosphorylated in vitro by p34Cdc2, suggesting that this enzyme is responsible for the mitotic phosphorylation of CK2 and that CK2 is a participant in a p34Cdc2-mediated protein kinase cascade. Identification of the sites that are phosphorylated by p34Cdc2 revealed that the mitotic phosphorylation sites on CK2α (Thr-344, Thr-360, Ser-362, and Ser-370) can all be classified as proline-directed phosphorylation sites because each of the phosphorylated residues is immediately N-terminal to a proline (28Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The regulatory β subunit of CK2 is also phosphorylated at autophosphorylation sites and at a site that is maximally phosphorylated in mitotic cells (26Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Lozeman F.J. Eisenman R.N. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13943-13951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the identification of these phosphorylation sites, no clear effect of phosphorylation of CK2 on CK2 activity has yet been observed (29Bosc D.G. Luscher B. Litchfield D.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 213-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the mitotic phosphorylation sites on CK2 are all Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro sites that resemble the optimal binding motif for Pin1 (30Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U., Xu, J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that CK2 may interact with Pin1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner as a part of events regulating the cell cycle. Experiments described in this paper were undertaken to test for an interaction between Pin1 and CK2 and for the phosphorylation dependence of this interaction. Furthermore, having demonstrated interactions between CK2 and Pin1, we examined the effects of Pin1 on CK2 activity toward several substrates. Of particular interest was topoisomerase II, a protein that is important for cell cycle progression. At the non-permissive temperature, yeast with temperature-sensitive CK2 fail to enter mitosis (12Glover C.V.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 27Litchfield D.W. Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Biochim. Biophys.

In these yeast, topoisomerase II is hypo-phosphorylated and inactive, suggesting that it is a bona fide physiological target for CK2. Additionally, it was recently demonstrated in mammalian cells that CK2 phosphorylates residues on topoisomerase IIα, including Thr-1342, which are residues that are maximally phosphorylated in mitotic cells (32Ishida R.

In this study, we demonstrated that Pin1 inhibits thein vitro phosphorylation of Thr-1342 on topoisomerase IIα by CK2 and that Pin1 interacts with topoisomerase IIα. Maximal inhibition of phosphorylation of Thr-1342 by CK2 requires full-length Pin1 with intact WW and isomerase domains. CK2 constructs had HA or Myc tags to allow the identification or isolation of transfected CK2 subunits from endogenous CK2 subunits. As described previously (35Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the HA tag consists of three repeats of the influenza hemagglutinin epitope YPYDVPDY, and the Myc tag consists of the Myc epitope MASMEQKLISEEDLNN. Constructs encoding CK2α with a C-terminal HA tag were generated using pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). The following CK2α constructs were employed: wild-type α-HA, α-4A-HA, α-4D-HA, and α-4E-HA. In these latter three constructs, the four mitotic phosphorylation sites on CK2α, (i.e. Thr-344, Thr-360, Ser-362, and Ser-370) were mutated to alanines, aspartic acids, and glutamic acids, respectively, by using sequential PCR. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The CK2α′ subunit was HA-tagged at its N terminus and was also expressed using pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). In addition to wild-type CK2α′, a construct encoding a chimera consisting of the N-terminal domain of CK2α′ with the C-terminal domain of CK2α, as described previously (35Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was utilized. The latter chimeric construct encodes residues 1–296 of CK2α′ together with the C-terminal fragment of CK2α (i.e. residues 296–391 of CK2α) instead of the natural C terminus of CK2α′ (i.e. residues 297–350 of CK2α′). Generation of the chimeric construct was described previously (35Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and was achieved using a Bsu36I restriction site that is conserved between CK2α and CK2α′. Importantly, the four mitotic phosphorylation sites on CK2α (i.e. Thr-344, Thr-360, Ser-362, and Ser-370) are all located with the C-terminal portion of CK2α that was transferred to CK2α′ to generate the chimera. Constructs encoding CK2β subunits had N-terminal Myc tags and were also in pRc/CMV. In addition to wild-type Myc-CK2β, constructs were generated to encode Myc-CK2β with mutations at its mitotic phosphorylation site at Ser-209. For these constructs, Ser-209 was mutated to alanine (i.e. Myc-βS209A) or to aspartic acid (i.e. Myc-βS209D). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Several DNA constructs were made for use in the production of recombinant GST-Pin1 fusion proteins. GST fusion proteins were generated using the pGEX-KG (36Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) vector. The Pin1 cDNA was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 928227). It was amplified by PCR to introduce NcoI and HindIII restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively, of the Pin1 coding region to facilitate subcloning. Primers for PCR were as follows: GGA TCC CCA TGG CGG ACG AGG AGA AGC TG (forward primer designated p1) and GGA TCC AAG CTT CAC TCA GTG CGG AGG ATG ATG (reverse primer designated p2). The PCR product (∼490 bp) was ligated into PCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The modified Pin1 cDNA was then subcloned into pGEX-KG using the NcoI and HindIII sites to generate pGEX-KG-Pin1. Four mutant GST-Pin1 constructs were also generated. GST-Pin1Y23A and GST-Pin1R68A,R69A are full-length GST-Pin1 fusion proteins with point mutations resulting in the loss of WW binding ability (37Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and a dramatic decrease in isomerase activity (9Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P.

GST-Pin1-(1–54) encodes a GST fusion protein with the WW domain of Pin1 and GST-Pin1-(47–163) is a GST fusion protein encoding only the peptide prolyl isomerase domain of Pin1 (37Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Pin1Y23A and Pin1R68A,R69A were also made by sequential PCR. In the first round for Pin1Y23A, primer pairs p-1 with p-3 (TTG AAG TAG GCC ACT CGG CCT GAG CT) and p-2 with p-4 (CCG AGT GGC CTA CTT CAA CCA CAT) were used. Likewise, for Pin1R68A,R69A primers p-1 with p-5 (CGA GGG TGC TGC TGA CTG GCT GTG C) and p-2 with p-6 (AAG CAC AGC CAG TCA GCA GCA CCC TCG TCC T) were used. For the second round of PCR, primers p-1 and p-2 were used for both fragments. Pin1-(1–54) encompassing the WW domain of Pin1 was created using primers p-1 and p-8 (GGA TCC AAG CTT CCT GGC AGG CTC CC) and Pin1-(47–163) with primers p-7 (TGG CCT TGG CTG AGC TGC AGT) and p-9 (GGA TCCATG GCAAAC GGG CAG GGG GAG). All of these final PCR products were then separately ligated into PCR-Blunt. Fragments encoding Pin1-(47–163), Pin1Y23A, and Pin1R68A,R69A in PCR-Blunt were digested withNcoI and HindIII yielding the desired fragments of ∼340, 490, and 490 bp, respectively. TheseNcoI/HindIII fragments were then used to replaceNcoI/HindIII fragments from the Pin1 in pGEX-KG. For Pin1-(1–54), a 165-bp NcoI/BlpI fragment was isolated from the pCR-Blunt construct and subcloned into pGEX-KG vector that had been similarly digested. For the constructs described above in detail, all PCR amplifications were done using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and sequenced by dideoxy sequencing (38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oelgeschlager M. Janknecht R. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2221-2228PubMed Google Scholar), were generous gifts of Dr. B. Luscher (Hannover, Germany). GST, GST-Pin1, and GST-Pin1 mutant proteins were expressed in BL21 or DH5α bacteria grown in 2× YT with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C. After cultures reached an absorbance of greater than 0.6 at 600 nm, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Indofine Chemical Corp.) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 2–4 h, cells were pelleted, washed with PBS (130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and then resuspended in PBS containing 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma) before being lysed using a French press or by sonication. Triton X-100 was added to this bacterial lysate to a final concentration of 1%, and the solution was incubated with continual mixing for 15–25 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 6600 × g. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione immobilized on agarose beads (Sigma) for 20–60 min at 4 °C or room temperature with continuous mixing. After thorough washing with PBS, the beads were used directly, or the protein was eluted using free glutathione (10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT). Eluted protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, with or without 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie protein assay (Pierce) and using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Other GST fusion proteins that were used in kinase assays were similarly isolated. These included GST-C92 (39Blackwell T.K. Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), a GST fusion protein encoding the C-terminal 92 amino acids of c-Myc, GST-Max (40Bousset K. Henriksson M. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Litchfield D.W. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3211-3220PubMed Google Scholar), a GST fusion protein encoding Max, and GST-631 (41Krieg J. Oelgeschlager M. Janknecht R. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2221-2228PubMed Google Scholar), a GST fusion protein encoding the N-terminal 198 amino acids of c-Myb. GST-CK2α-C126 was expressed, purified, and phosphorylated with purified p34Cdc2 using [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (28Bosc D.G. Slominski E. Sichler C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25872-25878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cleavage of GST-Pin1 was achieved by incubating with thrombin (1:100) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT at 37 °C. Pin1 was subsequently separated from the GST by FPLC using a Mono S (HR5/5) column. Briefly, thrombin cleaved GST, and Pin1 fractions were diluted with an equal volume of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA and applied to the Mono S column. GST was not retained in the column and appeared in the flow-through. Pin1 was retained on the column and eluted using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing Pin1 were identified by SDS-PAGE and stored at −20 °C. Y2C, a 205-amino acid portion of the topoisomerase IIα C terminus with a His tag to facilitate purification, and a mutant form of Y2C with a threonine to alanine substitution at residue 1342 were described previously (33Daum J.R. Gorbsky G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30622-30629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Y2C fragment encodes residues 1158–1362 of topoisomerase IIα and has a pI of 8.5 indicating an overall basic character. These proteins were expressed in BL21 bacteria grown in LB or 2× YT with 50 μg/ml kanamycin monosulfate (Sigma) at 37 °C. After cultures reached an absorbance of greater than 0.4 at 600 nm, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and 3 h later the cells were pelleted. Cells were used directly or stored at −20 °C. Proteins were harvested using a modified version of the manufacturer's recommendations using Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen). Briefly, pellets were thawed on ice for 15 min, resuspended in 8 m urea, 0.1m NaH2PO4, 0.01 mTris-Cl, pH 8.0, and incubated at room temperature for 15–60 min with gentle mixing. After centrifugation at 6,600 × g for 20–30 min, the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA Superflow beads for ∼1 h with vigorous mixing. Beads were washed repeatedly with 8m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.3. After removing the last wash, sample buffer (108 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3.6% SDS, 18% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to beads to release the Y2C proteins. Pin1 with an N-terminal His tag and a fusion protein designated N70 encoding residues 1–610 of SecA also with an N-terminal His tag were obtained from Dr. K. Hamilton and Dr. B. Shilton, respectively (London, Ontario, Canada). Polyclonal antipeptide antibodies directed against the N terminus of CK2α (residues 2–19), the C terminus of CK2α (residues 376–391), the C terminus of CK2α′ (residues 333–350), and the C terminus of CK2β (residues 198–215) have been described elsewhere (19Vilk G.

https://openalex.org/W2110162864,"The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains an endogenous high affinity Zn2+ binding site with three coordinating residues on its extracellular face (His193, His375, and Glu396). Upon binding to this site, Zn2+ causes inhibition of [3H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([3H]MPP+) uptake. We investigated the effect of Zn2+ on outward transport by superfusing hDAT-expressing HEK-293 cells preloaded with [3H]MPP+. Although Zn2+ inhibited uptake, Zn2+facilitated [3H]MPP+ release induced by amphetamine, MPP+, or K+-induced depolarization specifically at hDAT but not at the human serotonin and the norepinephrine transporter (hNET). Mutation of the Zn2+coordinating residue His193 to Lys (the corresponding residue in hNET) eliminated the effect of Zn2+ on efflux. Conversely, the reciprocal mutation (K189H) conferred Zn2+sensitivity to hNET. The intracellular [3H]MPP+ concentration was varied to generate saturation isotherms; these showed that Zn2+ increasedVmax for efflux (rather than KM-Efflux-intracellular). Thus, blockage of inward transport by Zn2+ is not due to a simple inhibition of the transporter turnover rate. The observations provide evidence against the model of facilitated exchange-diffusion and support the concept that inward and outward transport represent discrete operational modes of the transporter. In addition, they indicate a physiological role of Zn2+, because Zn2+ also facilitated transport reversal of DAT in rat striatal slices.

Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). The transporters are situated primarily in the presynaptic membrane and include the transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (hDAT,1 hNET, and hSERT, respectively) (1Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). These transporters form a subfamily within the large class of Na+/Cl−-coupled transporters (2Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Monoamine transporters have been the focus of intensive research, in particular because they represent targets for clinically important therapeutics, e.g. antidepressant drugs (3Iversen L. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which increase the availability of serotonin and/or norepinephrine by blocking reuptake. Moreover, drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine target these transporters (4Seiden L.S. Sabol K.E. Ricaurte G.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 639-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It has been well known that the monoamine transporters are not only capable of sodium-dependent transmembrane uptake but also of reverse transport of their substrate (5Levi G. Raiteri M. Trends. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 415-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Substrate efflux can be observed upon membrane depolarization, if the transmembrane sodium gradient is abrogated, or it can be elicited by extracellular substrates. The latter mechanism is thought to underlie the addictive and reinforcing properties of amphetamine derivatives (4Seiden L.S. Sabol K.E. Ricaurte G.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 639-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, excitation of glutamatergic receptors at dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra induces reverse operation of hDAT; this contributes to important autoinhibitory effects mediated by the dopamine D2-receptors to regulate overstimulatory inputs of the subthalamic nucleus (6Falkenburger B.H. Barstow K.L. Mintz I.M. Science. 2001; 293: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This novel evidence indicates a critical physiological role for reverse transport; thus, monoamine transporters mediate both inwardly and outwardly directed fluxes of monoamine in the brain.The bivalent cation Zn2+ is widely distributed in the central nervous system (7Perez-Clausell J. Danscher G. Brain Res. 1985; 337: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Zn2+ serves as a chelated counter ion for stored neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles (8Berneis K.H. Pletscher A. Da Prada M. Nature. 1969; 224: 281-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and, upon nerve stimulation, Zn2+ is co-released with the neurotransmitter (9Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The same can be observed under pathological conditions, i.e. in brain ischemia. Physiologically, the extracellular concentration of Zn2+ may reach 10–20 μm (10Vogt K. Mellor J. Tong G. Nicoll R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and these levels may further rise up to 300 μm in pathological situations (9Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 11Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 12Koh J.Y. Suh S.W. Gwag B.J., He, Y.Y. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The release of Zn2+ is very interesting, because the activity of several neurotransmitter receptors and transporters are modulated by micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ (13Westbrook G.L. Mayer M.L. Nature. 1987; 328: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 14Laube B. Kuhse J. Rundstrom N. Kirsch J. Schmieden V. Betz H. J.

For example, Zn2+ has recently been reported to block transport-associated ion currents through glutamate transporter subtypes (salamander excitatory amino acid transporter (17Spiridon M. Kamm D. Billups B. Mobbs P. Attwell D. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and EAAT1 (15Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). Moreover, Zn2+ was found to enhance binding of cocaine analogues to and inhibit uptake of dopamine by synaptosomal membranes (18Richfield E.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 100-108PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that is accounted for by direct binding of Zn2+ to hDAT (19Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).The high affinity Zn2+ binding site in wild type hDAT was mapped to three coordinating residues situated on the extracellular face of the transporter, His193 in the large extracellular loop between transmembrane segment (TM) 3 and 4, His375 at the external end of TM 7 and Glu396 at the external end of TM 8 (19Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect on uptake suggests that, by binding to the transporter, Zn2+ constrains relative movements between extracellular loop 2, TM 7, and TM 8 that are critical for the translocation process. Moreover, due to the strict geometric requirements for binding the small zinc(II) ion, and based on several additional engineered Zn2+ binding sites in hDAT, it became possible to deduce a model of the tertiary structure in a putative TM 7/8 microdomain (21Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, a simple exchange of corresponding amino acids resulted in the transfer of the high affinity binding properties to the hNET (19Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and to the more distantly related rat γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (22MacAulay N. Bendahan A. Loland C.J. Zeuthen T. Kanner B.I. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40476-40485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This reveals strong support toward an evolutionary conserved motif in the tertiary structure of Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters highly relevant for the translocation process.The mechanistic basis for transport reversal is poorly understood. Earlier models compared the transporter to a revolving door, which mediates influx or efflux provided that there is a driving force, i.e. the gradient of Na+ and substrate (23Fischer J.F. Cho A.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1979; 208: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). In this model of facilitated exchange-diffusion, inward and outward transport are stoichiometrically linked events and, thus, strictly coupled. Hence, the model predicts that inhibition of influx must result in reduced efflux. Here, we have exploited the ability of Zn2+ to bind specifically to the dopamine transporter to demonstrate that inward and outward transport represent discrete operational modes of a sodium-coupled transporter. Our results show that physiologically relevant concentrations of Zn2+enhance reverse transport by hDAT (but not by hNET or hSERT), although uptake is blocked. This presumably has physiological implications, because a regulation of dopamine transport by Zn2+ can be recapitulated in striatal slices.DISCUSSIONIt has generally been assumed that amphetamine, methylenedioximethamphetamine (“ecstasy”) and related drugs of abuse induce reversal of transport in the monoamine transporters, because they are substrates for inward transport. The transporter-mediated influx of such substrate has been considered a prerequisite for non-exocytotic release of neurotransmitter by reversed transport. Thus, the core assumption of the facilitated exchange-diffusion model (23Fischer J.F. Cho A.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1979; 208: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar) predicts that the transporter operates like a revolving door. If this model is correct, inward transport of amphetamine (or congeners), of the Cl− counterion and of Na+ is tightly coupled to efflux of neurotransmitter (34Sitte H.H. Huck S. Reither H. Boehm S. Singer E.A. Pifl C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Conversely, the model of facilitated exchange-diffusion has to be refuted, if efflux and influx can be separated. In several previous studies, the kinetics of transport were difficult to reconcile with a tight coupling of inward and outward transport, but it has proven difficult to obtain unequivocal evidence against the facilitated exchange-diffusion model, because it was not possible to separate inward and outward transport (27Sitte H.H. Hiptmair B. Zwach J. Pifl C. Singer E.A. Scholze P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Pifl C. Singer E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In the present study we demonstrate that Zn2+ discriminated between inward and outward transport mediated by hDAT; Zn2+blocked uptake of substrates but promoted efflux. The actions of Zn2+ were specific and not accounted for by any site of action other than the transporter molecule hDAT per se, because (i) it was abrogated by mutation of a single His residue Zn2+ (His193) that participates in the coordination of the transition metal. (ii) Based on the Zn2+ resistance of hSERT and hNET, we rule out an action on other cellular Zn2+-binding proteins that are relevant for establishing the driving force for transport (e.g.Na+/K+-ATPase (36Hexum T.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 3441-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)). (iii) In hNET, mutational replacement of Lys189, the residue homologous to His193 in hDAT, is predicted to result in the formation of a tridentate coordination sphere for Zn2+, because the other two residues are conserved at the homologous positions (19Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Accordingly, [3H]MPP+ release was enhanced by Zn2+ in hNET-K189H. Although qualitatively similar (i.e. of comparable affinity), the effect of Zn2+ on hNET-K189H was less pronounced in magnitude than that on wild type hDAT. Most likely, this difference can be rationalized by subtle structural and functional differences between the two transporters. Thus, the observation that Zn2+ can enhance substrate release while simultaneously blocking substrate uptake invalidates the facilitated exchange-diffusion model. Zn2+ enhanced MPP+-induced efflux; contrary to amphetamine, MPP+ cannot enter the cells by simple diffusion to any appreciable extent. It is therefore conceivable that binding of the substrate to the extracellular site of the transporter rather than substrate influx suffices to induce transport reversal. Accordingly, influx and efflux must represent discrete operational modes of the transporter.It has been generally assumed that, under physiological conditions, monoamine transporters operate exclusively in the inward mode; their main physiological task is to rapidly remove exocytotically released neurotransmitter from the synapse (37Povlock S.L. Amara S.G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar). The importance of reverse transport, which results in non-exocytotic, Ca2+-independent release of neurotransmitter (38Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), has long been relegated to pathophysiological situations (e.g.ischemia, see Ref. 38Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) or to drug abuse (e.g. amphetamine derivatives and other psychostimulants, see Ref. 34Sitte H.H. Huck S. Reither H. Boehm S. Singer E.A. Pifl C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, most recently, a physiological role was reported for the reverse mode of operation: Upon excitation of glutamatergic input from the subthalamic nucleus, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra release dopamine due to transport reversal. This non-exocytotically released dopamine suffices to support dendrodendritic autoinhibition (6Falkenburger B.H. Barstow K.L. Mintz I.M. Science. 2001; 293: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In many brain regions, Zn2+ is stored in synaptic vesicles and co-released together with glutamate; under basal conditions, the extracellular levels of Zn2+ are low (∼10 nm; see Refs. 39Frederickson C.J. Howell G.A. Kaserkis E.J. Neurology and Neurobiology. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1984Google Scholar, 40Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Upon neuronal stimulation, however, Zn2+is co-released with the neurotransmitters and, consequently, the free Zn2+ concentration may transiently reach values that range from 10–20 μm (10Vogt K. Mellor J. Tong G. Nicoll R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) up to 300 μm (11Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The concentrations of Zn2+ shown in this study, required for the stimulation of dopamine release (as well as inhibition of uptake), covered this physiologically relevant range, with maximum stimulation occurring at 3–30 μm. It is therefore conceivable that the action of Zn2+ on hDAT does not merely reflect a biochemical peculiarity but that it is physiologically relevant. This conjecture is supported by the finding that the facilitating action of Zn2+ can also be demonstrated in rat striatal slices. Furthermore, we showed, in transfected cells, that efflux induced by membrane depolarization is also enhanced by Zn2+. Interestingly, reversal of the Na+ gradient per se (by iso-osmotic replacement of Na+ with choline) was not enhanced by Zn2+. The mechanistic basis for this discrimination remains obscure, and its implication is unclear, because in neurons, where DAT is expressed physiologically, there is no reversal of the Na+ gradient without depolarization. Transport reversal by depolarization has recently been documented in neurons ex vivo; it was suggested that the release of glutamate depolarized the dendrites resulting in transport reversal and subsequent release of dopamine non-exocytotically from the dendritic region (6Falkenburger B.H. Barstow K.L. Mintz I.M. Science. 2001; 293: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, when Zn2+ is co-released with glutamate, it may greatly augment the efflux of dopamine.Interestingly, the enhancement of substrate-induced release was only observed for the endogenous Zn2+ binding site; the engineered Zn2+ binding site in which a His residue was introduced in TM7 at position 377, i.e. on top of coordinating His371 (21Norregaard L. Visiers I. Loland C.J. Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Gether U. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15836-15846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, two of the three coordinating residues (i.e. His371 and Glu396 in TM8) were the same as in the endogenous Zn2+ binding site. Because of the distance constraints, the transition metal ion cannot assume a position that differs vastly from that in the endogenous Zn2+ binding site. Nevertheless, Zn2+ failed to enhance outward transport, although inward transport was potently suppressed. This discrepancy points to a critical role for extracellular loop 2, which carries His193 in mediating the action of Zn2+ on reverse transport. But how can Zn2+ binding concomitantly lead to inhibition of inward transport and facilitation of outward transport? Previous data have shown that Zn2+ inhibits translocation but not substrate binding to the transporter (19Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This led to the conjecture that Zn2+ imposed a conformational constraint on the transporter, which impeded movements critical for the translocation process (19Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As a result, the turnover rate was predicted to be diminished with stabilization of the transporter mainly in a conformation with the substrate binding site open to the extracellular environment (outward facing conformation (19Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)). Clearly, the present data are inconsistent with a simple inhibition of the transporter turnover rate in the presence of Zn2+. Rather they suggest that Zn2+ binding facilitates the return step of the transporter in a way that increases the chances that a substrate molecule is carried with the transporter from the intracellular to the extracellular environment. As a net result, the transporter still primarily accumulates in the outward facing conformation. However, when assessed in a quantitative manner, efflux of MPP+ did not increase due to an altered affinity of MPP+ for the transporter from the intracellular side; the increased probability of outward transport is solely accounted for by the higher efficiency with which substrate is carried to the extracellular side in the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 6). However, Zn2+ cannot per se induce efflux; thus, substrate needs to be bound simultaneously at the outward and the inward facing end of the permeation pathway. This is difficult to envisage if the transporter is viewed as a monomeric unit that contains a single permeation pore. It may therefore be interesting to consider the possibility that the transporter does not operate by a simple alternating access scheme. For example, the conformational constraint that Zn2+ imposes on the tertiary structure may facilitate the opening of the alternative pathway that allows intracellular substrate to permeate through the hydrophobic core of the transporter. Alternatively, a parsimonious explanation of the data is the hypothesis that there is only a single path for substrate but that the functional unit is not the monomeric transporter. Precedent for oligomeric channels or transporters with more than one pore per functional unit include Cl− channels (two pores/homodimer, Ref. 41Dutzler R. Campbell E.B. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 415: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar) and aquaporins (four pores/tetramer, Ref.42Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). In the presence of Zn2+, binding of extracellular substrate to one transporter favors translocation of intracellular substrate by the second transporter unit in the oligomer. This scheme is supported by the fact that transporters constitutively form oligomers (43Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 44Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Based on this model, mutants that are defective in oligomerization ought to be incapable of supporting reverse transport. This prediction is currently being explored. The principal physiological action of the monoamine transporters is the removal of synaptically released neurotransmitter by a sodium-driven secondary-active transport mechanism (1Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). The transporters are situated primarily in the presynaptic membrane and include the transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (hDAT,1 hNET, and hSERT, respectively) (1Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). These transporters form a subfamily within the large class of Na+/Cl−-coupled transporters (2Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Monoamine transporters have been the focus of intensive research, in particular because they represent targets for clinically important therapeutics, e.g. antidepressant drugs (3Iversen L. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which increase the availability of serotonin and/or norepinephrine by blocking reuptake. Moreover, drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine target these transporters (4Seiden L.S. Sabol K.E. Ricaurte G.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 639-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been well known that the monoamine transporters are not only capable of sodium-dependent transmembrane uptake but also of reverse transport of their substrate (5Levi G. Raiteri M. Trends. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 415-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Substrate efflux can be observed upon membrane depolarization, if the transmembrane sodium gradient is abrogated, or it can be elicited by extracellular substrates. The latter mechanism is thought to underlie the addictive and reinforcing properties of amphetamine derivatives (4Seiden L.S. Sabol K.E. Ricaurte G.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 639-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, excitation of glutamatergic receptors at dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra induces reverse operation of hDAT; this contributes to important autoinhibitory effects mediated by the dopamine D2-receptors to regulate overstimulatory inputs of the subthalamic nucleus (6Falkenburger B.H. Barstow K.L. Mintz I.M. Science. 2001; 293: 2465-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This novel evidence indicates a critical physiological role for reverse transport; thus, monoamine transporters mediate both inwardly and outwardly directed fluxes of monoamine in the brain. The bivalent cation Zn2+ is widely distributed in the central nervous system (7Perez-Clausell J. Danscher G. Brain Res. 1985; 337: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Zn2+ serves as a chelated counter ion for stored neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles (8Berneis K.H. Pletscher A. Da Prada M. Nature. 1969; 224: 281-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and, upon nerve stimulation, Zn2+ is co-released with the neurotransmitter (9Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The same can be observed under pathological conditions, i.e. in brain ischemia. Physiologically, the extracellular concentration of Zn2+ may reach 10–20 μm (10Vogt K. Mellor J. Tong G. Nicoll R. Neuron. 2000; 26: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and these levels may further rise up to 300 μm in pathological situations (9Howell G.A. Welch M.G. Frederickson C.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 11Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 12Koh J.Y. Suh S.W. Gwag B.J., He, Y.Y. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The release of Zn2+ is very interesting, because the activity of several neurotransmitter receptors and transporters are modulated by micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ (13Westbrook G.L. Mayer M.L. Nature. 1987; 328: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 14Laube B. Kuhse J. Rundstrom N. Kirsch J. Schmieden V. Betz H. J.

For example, Zn2+ has recently been reported to block transport-associated ion currents through glutamate transporter subtypes (salamander excitatory amino acid transporter (17Spiridon M. Kamm D. Billups B. Mobbs P. Attwell D. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and EAAT1 (15Vandenberg R.J. Mitrovic A.D. Johnston G.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). Moreover, Zn2+ was found to enhance binding of cocaine analogues to and inhibit uptake of dopamine by synaptosomal membranes (18Richfield E.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 100-108PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that is accounted for by direct binding of Zn2+ to hDAT (19Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The high affinity Zn2+ binding site in wild type hDAT was mapped to three coordinating residues situated on the extracellular face of the transporter, His193 in the large extracellular loop between transmembrane segment (TM) 3 and 4, His375 at the external end of TM 7 and Glu396 at the external end of TM 8 (19Norregaard L.

These are thought to originate from the excision of DNA loop domains and from the cleavage of nuclear DNA at the internucleosomal positions, respectively. In this report, we demonstrate that different apoptotic insults induced apoptosis in NB-2a neuroblastoma cells that was invariably accompanied by the formation of HMW DNA fragments of about 50–100 kb but proceeded either with or without oligonucleosomal DNA cleavage, depending on the type of apoptotic inducer. We demonstrate that differences in the pattern of DNA fragmentation were reproducible in a cell-free apoptotic system and develop conditions that allow in vitro separation of the HMW and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation activities. In contrast to apoptosis associated with oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, the HMW DNA cleavage in apoptotic cells was accompanied by down-regulation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD) and was not affected by z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that the caspase/CAD pathway is not involved in the excision of DNA loop domains. We further demonstrate that nonapoptotic NB-2a cells contain a constitutively present nuclease activity located in the nuclear matrix fraction that possessed the properties of topoisomerase (topo) II and was capable of reproducing the pattern of HMW DNA cleavage that occurred in apoptotic cells. We demonstrate that the early stages of apoptosis induced by different stimuli were accompanied by activation of topo II-mediated HMW DNA cleavage that was reversible after removal of apoptotic inducers, and we present evidence of the involvement of topo II in the formation of HMW DNA fragments at the advanced stages of apoptosis.

In addition, another type of DNA cleavage during apoptosis has been reported to yield a set of the high molecular weight (HMW)1 DNA fragments of about 50–100 kb (7Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W. Dive C.

At the same time, increasing evidence indicates that the formation of the HMW DNA fragments during apoptosis can proceed without internucleosomal DNA cleavage (7Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W. Dive C.

In this report, we describe apoptosis in NB-2a neuroblastoma cells that can proceed either with or without internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, depending on the type of apoptotic inducer. We demonstrate that HMW DNA cleavage and internucleosomal DNA cleavage represent separate programs of DNA disintegration and present evidence of the involvement of topo II in the formation of HMW DNA fragments during apoptosis. Mouse NB-2a cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CCL 131) were routinely cultured in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Apoptosis was induced in exponentially growing NB-2a cells either by serum withdrawal or by cell treatment with 10 μm etoposide (Calbiochem). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, followed by staining with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma). Cytosolic extracts were prepared by treatment of cells with 10 volumes of ice-cold cytosol-preparing buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) as described previously (12Solovyan V. Bezvenyuk Z. Huotari V. Tapiola T. Suuronen T. Salminen A. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 62: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The activity of caspase 3-like proteases was assayed using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (BD PharMingen) at a final concentration of 20 μm. Caspase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclei and cytosolic extracts for cell-free apoptosis assay were prepared as described previously (12Solovyan V. Bezvenyuk Z. Huotari V. Tapiola T. Suuronen T. Salminen A. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 62: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected, resuspended in 1 volume of cytosol-preparing buffer, transferred to a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer, allowed to swell for 20 min on ice, and lysed with gentle strokes of a B-type pestle. After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 1000 ×g for 5 min, the crude nuclear pellet was used for the preparation of nuclei, whereas the supernatant, after an additional centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, was aliquoted and used as a cytosolic extract in the reconstituted apoptosis system. Nuclei were purified by centrifugation of a crude nuclear pellet at 1000 × g for 10 min through a layer of 1 m sucrose prepared in cytosol-preparing buffer, followed by washing and resuspension in nuclear storage buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm spermine, 1 mm PMSF, and 50% glycerol) at 1 × 108nuclei/ml. Prepared nuclei were either stored at −70 °C or used immediately in reconstitution experiments. In the reconstituted apoptosis system, 2 μl of nuclei (2 × 105) were incubated with 10 μl of cytosolic extracts (5 mg/ml protein) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by embedding of the nuclei into low-melting point agarose and analysis of DNA integrity. In some experiments, cytosolic extracts were pretreated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-topo IIα-specific (catalogue no. 2011-1; TopoGEN) or JB-1 topo IIβ-specific antibodies (kindly provided by Dr. D. Sullivan, University of South Florida) at a dilution of 1:20. Intact cells or purified nuclei were embedded in low-melting point agarose drops (50 μl) and incubated with 10 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium sarkosyl (Sigma), and 0.5% SDS) containing 100 μg/ml proteinase K and 40 μg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C. Agarose drops containing deproteinized DNA samples were washed three times with washing buffer (lysis buffer without protein denaturants), loaded quantitatively in the wells of a 1% agarose gel, and subjected to either conventional or field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) as described earlier (12Solovyan V. Bezvenyuk Z. Huotari V. Tapiola T. Suuronen T. Salminen A. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 62: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Samples were solubilized in 1× Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Extracted polypeptides (30 μg) were resolved at 200 V on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoretically transferred to ECL-nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm; Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 100 V. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% nonfat dried milk, and 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated in the same solution for 1 h at room temperature with anti-CPAN (dilution, 1:250) and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (dilution, 1:1000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 18211 anti-topo IIα or 18513 anti-topo IIβ antibodies (36Willmore E. Frank A.J. Padget K. Tilby M.J. Austin C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (dilution, 1:500) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (1:4000) in an identical solution for 1 h at room temperature and then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intact cells were embedded in low-melting point agarose, extracted once with high salt extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 m NaCl) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times for 30 min at 4 °C with washing buffer (high salt extraction buffer without NaCl), and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in DNA cleavage buffer (washing buffer supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2). After incubation, high salt-extracted cells were treated with lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS) and subjected to fractionation by FIGE. Cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by etoposide treatment as described above. Cells were collected, embedded in agarose, lysed, and fractionated by FIGE in low-melting point agarose gel. Agarose plugs containing 50–100-kb DNA fragments derived either from etoposide-treated or serum-deprived cells were excised from 1% low-melting point agarose gel, washed three times with STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm NaCl), and melted at 65 °C. ExoIII exonuclease buffer (supplied by manufacturers) was added to a final concentration of 1×, and 50–100-kb DNA fragments were treated with ExoIII exonuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 0–40 min. For lambda exonuclease assay, 50–100-kb DNA fragments in 1× lambda exonuclease buffer were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C either with or without 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, and then the samples were incubated for 15 min at 70 °C in the presence of 1 mm PMSF followed by treatment with lambda exonuclease (New England Biolabs) for 0–40 min. After incubation, 20 μm aliquots were transferred to 10 μm stop buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS), loaded into wells of a 1% agarose gel, and fractionated by conventional gel electrophoresis. Apoptosis in NB-2a cells was induced either by serum deprivation or by etoposide treatment as described above. Apoptotic cells were embedded in agarose, lysed, and fractionated by FIGE in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Agarose plugs containing 50–100-kb DNA fragments were excised from the gel, and DNA was extracted from the agarose using a Qiagen DNA purification kit. Extracted DNA was treated with 10 units of DNase I (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C in DNase digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm PMSF). DNase-treated samples were resolved in 7% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-topo IIβ-specific antibody. The treatment of NB-2a neuroblastoma cells with a genotoxic agent, etoposide, and withdrawal of growth factors both induced cell death, associated with the caspase 3 activation and chromatin condensation typical of apoptosis (Fig.1). Analysis of DNA integrity revealed that apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and apoptosis induced by etoposide were associated with distinct patterns of DNA disintegration (Fig. 1). Whereas serum withdrawal induced disintegration of nuclear DNA into HMW fragments of about 50–100 kb with concomitant development of an oligonucleosomal DNA ladder (Fig. 1B), etoposide induced the formation of HMW but not oligonucleosomal DNA fragments over the entire range of concentrations tested (Fig. 1C). No DNA laddering was observed in the floating etoposide-treated cells, in contrast to that seen in the serum-deprived cells (results not shown). The distinct patterns of DNA fragmentation caused by serum withdrawal and etoposide were accompanied by an increase in the activity of caspase 3-like proteases (Fig. 1D), thus indicating that activation of caspases is invariably associated with apoptotic DNA disintegration but does not necessarily lead to the formation of an oligonucleosomal DNA ladder in NB-2a cells. Data presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the distinct patterns of DNA disintegration induced by serum withdrawal and etoposide in NB-2a cells were reproducible in a reconstituted cell-free apoptotic system, in which nuclei isolated from nonapoptotic NB-2a cells were treated with cytosolic extracts prepared from apoptotic cells. Whereas cytosolic extract prepared from etoposide-treated cells induced the formation of 50–100-kb DNA fragments without production of an oligonucleosomal DNA ladder, the cytosolic extract of serum-deprived cells induced both HMW and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in substrate nuclei (Fig.2A). Furthermore, the formation of HMW DNA fragments induced by cytosolic extract of serum-deprived cells was almost completely abolished by suramin, without affecting the internucleosomal DNA cleavage (Fig. 2B), whereas the presence of Zn2+ions in the cytosolic extract inhibited the cytosol-dependent formation of oligonucleosomal but not HMW DNA fragments in substrate nuclei (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the lack of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is a characteristic feature of etoposide-induced apoptosis in NB-2a cells and that the formation of HMW and oligonucleosomal DNA fragments, at least in a cell-free system, is mediated by separate nuclease activities. Data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the capacity of cytosolic extracts to initiate disintegration of DNA in substrate nuclei was progressively increased during apoptosis induced by either etoposide or serum deprivation in NB-2a cells. Pretreatment of cytosolic extracts of etoposide-treated cells with recombinant caspase 3 potentiated cytosol-dependent formation of HMW DNA fragments without producing an oligonucleosomal DNA ladder (Fig.3A), thus suggesting that caspase 3 may be involved in the activation of HMW DNA fragmentation activity. In contrast to the cytosolic extract prepared from etoposide-treated cells, the cytosolic extract of serum-deprived cells induced both HMW DNA cleavage and internucleosomal DNA cleavage in substrate nuclei, but only when the cytosolic extract was prepared from the cells at the late stage of apoptosis (i.e. after 48 h of serum deprivation; Fig.3B). Cytosolic extract prepared from the cells at an advanced stage of apoptosis (after 36 h of serum deprivation) possessed a weak DNA fragmentation capacity; however, this extract potentiated the formation of both HMW and oligonucleosomal DNA fragments in substrate nuclei after pretreatment with recombinant caspase 3 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, cytosolic extract of the early apoptotic cells (after 24 h of serum deprivation) induced disintegration of DNA in substrate nuclei mainly to HMW DNA fragments without obvious production of an oligonucleosomal DNA ladder, even after pretreatment with recombinant caspase 3 (Fig. 3B). Only HMW DNA fragmentation without any sign of internucleosomal DNA cleavage was observed when the cytosolic extract of nonapoptotic cells was pretreated with recombinant caspase 3 (results not shown). The capacity of the late apoptotic extract but not the early apoptotic extract to induce internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in substrate nuclei was consistent with up-regulation of CAD protein observed during apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in NB-2a cells (Fig.3C). At the same time, the progressive increase in the capacity of cytosolic extracts of etoposide-treated cells to induce HMW DNA fragmentation was accompanied by down-regulation of CAD in etoposide-treated cells (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that CAD is selectively induced during apoptosis associated with oligonucleosomal but not HMW DNA fragmentation, thus supporting the hypothesis that CAD has no role in the formation of HMW DNA fragments. Because caspases play a pivotal role in the activation of the CAD-dependent pathway of DNA disintegration (37Wolf B.B. Schuler M. Echeverri F. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30651-30656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we investigated the pattern of DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells in the presence of a broad range caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. Data presented in Fig. 4A demonstrate that z-VAD-fmk effectively suppressed internucleosomal DNA cleavage but only partially inhibited the formation of HMW DNA fragments in serum-deprived cells. In contrast, z-VAD-fmk, although effectively suppressing the cleavage of caspase-targeted poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, possessed only a slight inhibitory effect on the formation of HMW DNA fragments during etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig.4B). The results suggest that caspases are not essential in the induction of HMW DNA fragmentation in NB-2a cells during etoposide-induced apoptosis. Data presented in Fig 5A demonstrate that heating of substrate nuclei selectively abrogates the cytosol-dependent formation of HMW DNA fragments but not oligonucleosomal DNA fragments, suggesting that a heat-labile component of HMW DNA fragmentation activity pre-exists in nuclei prepared from nonapoptotic NB-2a cells. Because the formation of HMW DNA fragments is widely believed to originate from the excision of DNA loop domains at the positions of their attachment to the nuclear matrix, we analyzed DNA fragmentation activity in nonapoptotic NB-2a nuclei extracted with a high concentration of salt (a procedure commonly used for the preparation of histone-depleted DNA loop domains attached to the insoluble nuclear matrix (17Paulson J.R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1977; 12: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 18Cook P.R. Brazell I.A. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 22: 287-302PubMed Google Scholar). Data presented in Fig. 5Bdemonstrate that incubation of the high salt-extracted nuclei in DNA cleavage buffer induced cleavage of nuclear DNA into 50–100-kb DNA fragments, with a pattern of fragmentation similar to that found in apoptotic cells. The observation that an ordered cleavage of DNA into the HMW DNA fragments is retained in the high salt-extracted nuclei strongly supports the idea that HMW DNA fragments represent DNA loop domains excised by a nuclear matrix-associated domain nuclease. The excision of DNA loop domains in the high salt-extracted nuclei proceeded in a highly efficient manner, was slightly potentiated by etoposide (Fig. 5B, lanes 2–4), and was inhibited by a catalytic inhibitor of topo II, suramin (Fig.5B, lanes 5–10). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of suramin was markedly suppressed in the presence of etoposide, a drug that potentiates topo II-dependent DNA cleavage (19Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar,20Liu L.F. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 15: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B, lanes 5–7). Also, conditions that favor topo II-dependent rejoining reaction lead to almost complete religation of the cleaved HMW DNA fragments into noncleaved DNA (Fig. 5B, lane 12). The biochemical properties of an inducible HMW DNA cleavage in high salt-extracted nuclei observed and demonstrated here add credence to the suggestion that the domain nuclease possesses the properties of topo II. An efficient HMW DNA cleavage (>90% of the total DNA was cleaved into 50–100-kb fragments under inducible conditions), which was inhibitable by suramin and reversible under salt-dependent religation conditions, was also observed by us in postmitotic cerebellar granule neurons, in which the level of topo IIα, but not topo IIβ, was reduced to a negligible level (Ref.21Tsutsui K. Sano K. Kikuchi A. Tokunaga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5769-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; results not shown). This suggests that topo IIβ may be involved in inducible excision of DNA loop domains in high salt-extracted nuclei. To evaluate the role of topo II in degradation of nuclear DNA during apoptosis, we first analyzed the effect of suramin on the pattern of DNA fragmentation in apoptotic NB-2a cells. As in the in vitro model of inducible excision of DNA loop domains (Fig. 5), suramin effectively suppressed the formation of HMW DNA fragments during apoptosis induced by etoposide in NB-2a cells (Fig.6A). In contrast to serum deprivation, in which suramin at these concentrations suppressed all features of apoptosis (i.e. DNA fragmentation and caspase activation), the protective effect of suramin against HMW DNA fragmentation in etoposide-treated cells occurred despite the persistence of high caspase 3 activity (results not shown), thus suggesting that the protective effect of suramin is downstream of caspase activation in this apoptotic pathway and may be caused by the direct inhibition of topo II. The addition of suramin to the cells at advanced stages of apoptosis, when activation of caspases had already occurred, also resulted in suppression of HMW DNA fragmentation in both etoposide-treated and serum-deprived cells, thus suggesting a reversible feature of HMW DNA cleavage during apoptosis (Fig.6B). Because topo II enzyme is known to remain covalently attached to the 5′ ends of broken DNA during topo II-mediated DNA cleavage (19Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 20Liu L.F. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 15: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we further investigated the role of topo II in apoptosis by analyzing whether HMW DNA fragments isolated from apoptotic cells are topo II-associated. Data presented in Fig. 6C demonstrate that the HMW DNA fragments fractionated from etoposide-treated cells under denaturing conditions were sensitive to the 3′-5′ exonucleaseExoIII but exhibited a marked resistance to the 5′-3′ exonuclease lambda. Pretreatment of isolated HMW DNA fragments with proteinase K abolished this resistance (Fig. 6C), suggesting that protection against lambda exonuclease was caused by protein(s) associated with the 5′ termini of the HMW DNA fragments. HMW DNA fragments isolated from serum-deprived cells possessed similar properties (Fig. 6C), although the resistance to the lambda exonuclease was not so evident as in the case of DNA fragments isolated from etoposide-treated cells. Treatment of the isolated HMW DNA fragments with DNase I followed by analysis of the digest with SDS-PAGE revealed no visible polypeptides associated with the HMW DNA fragments after Coomassie Blue staining, except a ∼35-kDa protein seen in apoptotic but not control preparations (Fig. 6D). Probing of the same digest with anti-topo IIα antibody revealed immunoreactive bands associated with HMW DNA fragments, but no obvious band corresponding to the full-length 170-kDa protein was detected (Fig.6D). In contrast, anti-topo IIβ antibody revealed a clear ∼180-kDa band associated with DNA fragments derived from either serum-deprived or etoposide-treated cells (Fig. 6D). The data indicate that topo IIβ is at least one of the enzymes associated with apoptotic HMW DNA fragments. Cell-free system experiments (Fig.6E) further revealed that antibody raised against full-length topo II protein possessed a protective effect against HMW DNA cleavage induced by apoptotic cytosolic extract in substrate nuclei. Whereas anti-nuclear factor κB antibody had no obvious effect on the formation of HMW DNA fragments, both anti-topo IIα and anti-topo IIβ antibodies inhibited cytosol-dependent HMW DNA cleavage in substrate nuclei, with the protective effect of the anti-topo IIβ antibody being more evident. In the cell-free apoptotic system, anti-topo IIβ antibody almost completely suppressed the formation of HMW DNA fragments in substrate nuclei induced by cytosolic extracts of etoposide-treated cells, and it markedly suppressed the HMW DNA cleavage without affecting the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by cytosolic extract of serum-deprived cells (Fig.6E)"

Fatty acyl-CoA thioesters have recently been proposed to be naturally occurring ligands of HNF-4α and to regulate its transcriptional activity as function of their chain length and degree of unsaturation (Hertz, R., Magenheim, J., Berman, I., and Bar-Tana, J. (1998) Nature 392, 512–516). However, the apparent low affinities (μm K d values) obtained with a radiolabeled fatty acyl-CoA ligand binding assay raised questions regarding the physiological significance of this finding. Furthermore, it is not known whether interaction with fatty acyl-CoA alters the structure of HNF-4α. These issues were examined using rat recombinant HNF-4α ligand-binding domain (HNF-4αLBD) in conjunction with photon counting fluorescence and circular dichroism. First, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between HNF-4αLBD tryptophan (Trp) and cis-parinaroyl-CoA yielded an intermolecular distance of ≤42 Å, thus pointing to direct molecular interaction rather than nonspecific coaggregation. Second, quenching of HNF-4αLBD intrinsic Trp fluorescence by fatty acyl-CoAs (e.g. pamitoyl-, stearoyl-, linoleoyl-, and arachidonoyl-CoAs) yielded a single binding site withK d values of 1.6–4.0 nm. These affinities were 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than those previously derived by radiolabeled fatty acyl-CoA ligand binding assay. Third, binding of fatty acyl-CoAs was specific as the binding affinities of the respective free fatty acids or free CoA (K d values of 421–742 nm) were significantly lower. Fourth, circular dichroism demonstrated that the HNF-4αLBD secondary structure was significantly and differentially altered by fatty acyl-CoA binding. The opposite effects of saturated versuspolyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs on HNF-4α LBD secondary structure correlated with their opposite regulatory effects on HNF-4α function. Fifth, the CoA thioesters of some hypolipidemic peroxisome proliferators bind with high affinity (K d values as low as 2.6 nm) to HNF-4α LBD, thus indicating that HNF-4α may serve as target for these drugs. In summary, these data demonstrate for the first time high affinity binding to HNF-4α of fatty and xenobiotic acyl-CoAs in the physiological range, resulting in significantly altered HNF-4α conformation.

Liver Gene Expression. VRG Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar). Unlike retinoid X receptor α, with which it has 40% amino acid sequence homology, HNF-4 does not form heterodimers with any other nuclear receptor, but binds to direct repeat-1 DNA sequences as homodimer (3Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5131-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).

HNF-4α responsive genes encode transcription factors (HNF-1α, PXR), proteins involved in fatty acid, lipoprotein, and lipid metabolism (apoA-I, apoA-II, apoB, apoC-II, apoC-III, Lp(a), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, mitochondrial fatty acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, and fatty acid-binding protein), carbohydrate metabolism (insulin, glut2, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, aldolase B, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), amino acid and protein metabolism (ornithine transcarbamylase, tyrosine aminotransferase, phenylalanine hydroxylase, and antitrypsin α1), P450 enzymes (steroid 15α-hydroxylase, fatty acyl ω-hydroxylase, cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase, and drug metabolizing P450 enzymes (cyp3α 4–6)), hematopoiesis (erythropoietin and transferrin), blood coagulation (factors VII, IX, and X and fibrinogen), and others (e.g. cellular retinol-binding protein and transthyretin) (reviewed in Refs. 2Sladek F.M.

Since HNF-4α activates the transcription of some nuclear receptors (HNF-1α) and may further directly interact with other transcription factors (HNF-1α), the above list of HNF-4α responsive genes may include some which are transcriptionally affected by HNF-4α indirectly. The first demonstration of putative HNF-4 ligands showed that long chain fatty acyl-CoA (LCFA-CoAs) thioesters (15Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J.

Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) bind to HNF-4α and, depending on their chain length, degree of saturation, and respective substitutions, are able to activate or inhibit transcription of a reporter gene enhanced by the C3P element of the apoC-III promoter (12Hertz R.

However, the radioligand competition assay used to demonstrate acyl-CoA binding in these previous studies yieldedK d values in the micromolar range (12Hertz R. Sheena V. Kalderon B. Berman I.

Although total tissue levels of LCFA-CoAs (free + bound) are in the range 0.4–164 μm, depending on tissue, cell, nutrition, and pathology (reviewed in Refs. 16Gossett R.E. Frolov A.A. Roths J.B.

Based on these considerations as well as computer modeling of the HNF-4α structure, it has been suggested that HNF-4α does not significantly bind LCFA-CoAs (19Bogan A.A. Dallas-Yang Q.

However, it must be considered that radioligand competition assays for lipidic ligand-binding proteins typically yield K d values that are 2–3 orders of magnitude higher (i.e. lower affinity) than K d values determined by direct fluorescence or microcalorimetry binding assays (reviewed in Ref. 20McArthur M.J.

Thus, it seems possible that the radioligand acyl-CoA competition binding results significantly underestimated the affinity of HNF-4α for its endogenous ligands. The objective of the present investigation was to resolve these issues through (i) direct fluorescent ligand binding assays based on quenching of tryptophan emission by putative HNF-4α ligands using a recombinant HNF-4α ligand-binding domain (HNF-4αLBD), (ii) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between HNF-4αLBD aromatic amino acids and bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA (naturally occurring fluorescent LCFA-CoA) to calculate the intermolecular distance between ligand and its binding site, and (iii) circular dichroism to characterize the secondary structure of HNF-4αLBD as well as potential changes induced therein by LCFA-CoA binding. cis-Parinaric acid and NBD-stearic acid were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Coenzyme A, palmitoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, linoleoyl-CoA, arachidonoyl-CoA, arachidonic acid, and bezafibrate were from Sigma. Medica 16, as well as the coenzyme A thioesters of Medica 16 and bezafibrate, were chemically synthesized as described (21Bar-Tana J. Kahn-Rose G. Srebnik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8404-8410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kawaguchi A. Yohmura T. Okuda S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Rat HNF-4α1 cDNA encoding the sequence from amino acid 132 to 455 was synthesized by PCR with the following primers: 5′-CCGGCTCGAGGATGGCTTCCTGCTT-3′ and 5′-GCGCCATATGAGGTCAAGCTACGAG-3′. This DNA fragment was cloned into the NdeI/XhoI site of pET21b plasmid (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI) and sequenced. The recombinant protein was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLyS strain ofEscherichia coli. His-tagged HNF-4αLBD was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel-NTA resin (Quiagen, Chatsworth, CA), desalted, lyophilized, and stored at −70 °C. Prior to use, the protein was solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 mNaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol (binding buffer). Protein was determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Purity of recombinant rat His-HNF-4αLBD (amino acids 132–455 of the wild type rat HNF-4α1 with 6 His residues attached at the C terminus) was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE separated a single protein band of 36 kDa as detected by staining with Coomassie Blue and indicated 97% purity (Fig. 1, panel A). Western blotting with rabbit anti-rat HNF-4αLBD polyclonal antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was performed as described (23Frolov A. Petrescu A.

A single reacting band at the same molecular weight was detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1,panel B). Fluorescent cPNA-CoA was chemically synthesized (22Kawaguchi A. Yohmura T. Okuda S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) utilizing a naturally occurring fluorescent fatty acid, cis-parinaric acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Unreacted, freecis-parinaric acid was retained into the organic phase of a chloroform:methanol:water mixture (24Juguelin H. Cassagne C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Further removal of free CoA from cPNA-CoA in the aqueous phase was performed by HPLC, as described (25Hubbell T. Behnke W.D. Woodford J.K. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3327-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purity level of the HPLC fraction containing cPNA-CoA was checked by assessing the absorption spectrum with a UV/VIS spectrometer, model Lambda 2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT). HPLC of the aqueous extract showed two major peaks, 1 and 4 separated by over 32 min, as well as two minor, peaks 2 and 3 with retention times between 3 and 6 min (Fig.2 A). The absorbance spectrum of the partially purified cPNA-CoA (Fig. 2 B) exhibited a 260-nm maximum characteristic for CoA as well as three maxima within 280–324 nm, characteristic for the conjugated double bonds of cPNA-CoA. The absorbance spectrum of HPLC-peak 1 (Fig. 2 C) did not reveal the presence of a conjugated tetraene (peaks between 280 and 324 nm) of cPNA-CoA, but instead showed absorbance maximum near 260 nm, typical of free CoA (not shown). In contrast, the absorbance spectrum of peak 4 taken from the HPLC chromatogram in Fig.2 A exhibited absorbance characteristics of both the conjugated tetraene and thioester linkage present in cPNA-CoA (Fig. 2 D). Absorbance spectra of oleoyl-CoA demonstrated only the presence of the thioester linkage but not the conjugated tetraene present only in cPNA-CoA (not shown). Direct binding assays not requiring separation of bound from free ligand were performed usingcis-parinaroyl-CoA as described (25Hubbell T. Behnke W.D. Woodford J.K. Schroeder F.

To establish specificity for LCFA-CoA, this assay was repeated using fluorescent fatty acids: cis-parinaric acid and NBD-stearic acid. Briefly, HNF-4αLBD was added to phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, or binding buffer as described above to yield a final concentration of 170 nm HNF-4αLBD. Increasing fluorescent ligand was then added to yield final concentrations of 10–4000 nm cis-parinaroyl-CoA. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a PC1 photon counting fluorimeter (ISS Inc., Urbana, IL) and maximal intensities measured. The K d and number of binding sites (n) were calculated as previously described (26Frolov A. Cho T.H. Murphy E.J. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6545-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Frolov A. Cho T.H. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. J. Biol.

Where it was possible (e.g. NBD-stearic acid) the number of binding sites was determined with a higher degree of accuracy from the reverse titration binding curve in which a constant amount of ligand was titrated with increasing concentration of HNF-4∝LBD. To investigate direct binding of nonfluorescent LCFA-CoAs to HNF-4αLBD, the effect of LCFA-CoA binding on intrinsic fluorescence of HNF-4αLBD aromatic amino acids was examined. Briefly, 170 nm HNF4αLBD were titrated with increasing ligand (5–4000 nm). Two types of fluorescence measurements were obtained. First, both Tyr and Trp residues were excited at 280 nm. Second, the contribution of Trp from Tyr residues was resolved by selective excitation of Trp at 295 nm. Since fluorescence emission was maximal at 333 nm in both cases, Trp was the main contributor to HNF-4αLBD fluorescence emission. All steady state fluorescence measurements were performed using a PC1 photon counting fluorimeter (ISS, Champaign, IL) in the L-format with a 300-watt xenon arc lamp light source and 4 nm band-passes in both excitation and emission monochromators. In ligand-induced HNF-4αLBD fluorescence quenching experiments, the number of binding sites (n) was estimated by fitting the binding curve to a Hill plot according to the equation, y =ax b/(c b + x b), where a is F max corresponding toB max = nE0, bis the number of binding sites (n), and c isK d . Examination of the excitation and emission spectra of HNF4α-LBD revealed that the emission of Trp overlapped significantly with excitation of cis-parinaroyl-CoA, a condition ideal for Forster FRET (31Forster T. Florkin M. Statz E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier, New York1967: 61-77Google Scholar). Since FRET varies as (intermolecular distance)1/6, the donor (HNF-4αLBD Trp) and acceptor (cis-parinaroyl-CoA) residues must be in very close proximity, generally a few Å, for efficient FRET to occur. To determine the average intermolecular distance between HNF-4αLBD Trp residues and bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA, HNF-4αLBD (170 nm) was titrated with increasingcis-parinaroyl-CoA (5–4000 nm final concentration). The HNF-4αLBD Tyr/Trp or Trp only, were excited at 280 and 295 nm, respectively. Maximal fluorescence emission intensities of HNF-4αLBD Tyr/Trp or Trp were obtained at 333 nm while maximal emission of cis-parinaroyl-CoA was measured at 430 nm. If bound cis-parinaroyl-CoA acceptor was located within the optimal FRET distance from the HNF-4αLBD Trp, then efficient energy transfer occurred such that HNF-4αLBD Tyr/Trp or Trp fluorescence emission was quenched while, concomitantly, sensitized fluorescence emission of cis-parinaroy-CoA was at 430 nm. The intermolecular distance between HNF-4αLBD Trp and boundcis-parinaroyl-CoA was calculated from E =R 06/(R 06+ R 2/36), where E is the FRET efficiency, R 0 is the critical distance for 50% efficiency, and R 2/3 is the actual distance between donor and acceptor (31Forster T. Florkin M. Statz E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier, New York1967: 61-77Google Scholar, 32Frolov A. Miller K. Billheimer J.T. Cho T.-C. Schroeder F.

Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar). The energy transfer efficiency was calculated by quenching of HNF-4αLBD Trp according toE = 1 −F DA/F D, where FDA and FD are the fluorescence intensities of HNF-4αLBD Trp (energy donor) at 333 nm in the presence and absence ofcis-parinaroyl-CoA (energy acceptor) upon excitation of HNF-4αLBD Trp at 295 nm. The transfer efficiency (E) was also calculated from the excitation spectrum of the energy acceptor (i.e. cis-parinaroyl-CoA) as previously described by Stryer (34Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar) according to E = (G(λ2)/G(λ1) − εA(λ2)/εA(λ1)] × [εA(λ1)/εD(λ2)), where G(λ) is the magnitude of the corrected excitation spectrum of the energy acceptor excited at wavelength λ1; εD(λ) and εA(λ) are the extinction coefficients of the donor and acceptor at wavelength λ. Gis measured at two wavelengths: at λ1, where the donor has low absorption (320 nm), and at λ2, where the extinction coefficient of the donor is large compared with that of the acceptor (280 nm). This second method is especially useful when the local environment of the donor is different in the presence of the acceptor, provided that the absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor moieties are known (34Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The critical distance for 50% efficiency (R 0 in Å) was calculated as described (35Parker C.A. Photoluminescence in Solution. Elsevier Scientific Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1968Google Scholar, 36Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) using R 0 = 0.211[k 2 n −4 Q D J(λ)]1/6with wavelength expressed in nanometers and J(λ), the overlap integral, expressed as m−1cm−1nm4. Q D, the quantum yield for HNF-4αLBD Trp and J(λ) were calculated as described earlier (35Parker C.A. Photoluminescence in Solution. Elsevier Scientific Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1968Google Scholar, 36Wu P. Brand L. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The orientation factork 2 and the refractive index n were assumed to be 2/3 and 1.4, respectively, as for proteins in solution. Far UV CD spectra of HNF-4αLBD (2 μm) were taken in the absence and presence of ligands as described (37Petrescu A.D. Gallegos A.M. Okamura Y. Strauss I.J.F. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36970-36982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except that 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 30 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol was used as buffer. The CD measurements were performed with a J-710 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Baltimore, MD) using a 1-mm cuvette. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 195 nm at 50 nm/min with a time constant of 1 s and a bandwidth of 2 nm. For each CD profile an average of 10 scans was obtained. Percentages of various secondary structures in HNF-4αLBD were calculated from the CD spectra by using the CDsstr program (38Hennessey J.P. Johnson W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar,39Compton L.A. Johnson W.C., Jr. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). cis-Parinaroyl-CoA was chosen as a fluorescent ligand to examine the fatty acyl-CoA binding properties (K d and B max) of HNF-4αLBD because: (i) cis-parinaroyl-CoA is a naturally occurring fluorescent fatty acyl-CoA with structure similar to other fatty acyl-CoAs (Table I); (ii)cis-parinaroyl-CoA absorbance overlaps with aromatic amino acid fluorescence emission, thereby allowing fluorescence resonance energy transfer; (iii) cis-parinaroyl-CoA has been extensively used in fatty acyl-CoA fluorescence binding assays (25Hubbell T.

Furthermore, cis-parinaroyl-CoA fluorescence binding assay does not underestimate fatty acyl-CoA binding as do radioligand binding assays (reviewed in Refs. 20McArthur M.J. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A.

Thus, quenching of HNF-4αLBD Trp emission at 333 nm was examined upon titration with increasing concentrations ofcis-parinaroyl-CoA. HNF-4αLBD was excited either at 280 nm to excite both Trp/Tyr (Fig.3 A) or at 295 nm to selectively excite HNF-4αLBD Trp (Fig. 3 C). In both cases, the fluorescence emission of HNF-4αLBD was quenched by increasing concentrations of cis-parinaroyl-CoA. Upon excitation of both Trp/Tyr (at 280 nm), the binding curve ofcis-parinaroyl-CoA to HNF-4αLBD demonstrated saturation binding (Fig. 3 B). A reciprocal plot of the binding curve (Fig. 3 B, inset) was linear, suggesting either a single binding site or two binding sites with the same K d . The number of binding sites was resolved by fitting the binding curve to a Hill plot, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Hill plot yielded n = 1.08, i.e. one binding site with a K d of 248.5 nm (TableII). The number of binding sites calculated from direct titration, considering the molecular mass of HNF-4αLBD monomer (36,000 Da), was 0.73. On selective excitation of Trp at 295 nm, a saturation binding curve was again obtained (Fig. 3 D) with linear reciprocal plot of the binding curve (Fig. 3 D, inset). Fitting to the Hill plot resulted in n = 1.42 and K d of 238.2 nm (Table II). Taken together, measurement of the direct quenching of HNF-4αLBD aromatic amino acid fluorescence bycis-parinaroyl-CoA indicated that HNF-4αLBD boundcis-parinaroyl-CoA with nanomolar affinity at one binding site per monomer.Table IChemical structures of fatty acids and peroxisome proliferators whose CoA thioesters as well as free acid forms were tested for HNF-4αLBD binding Open table in a new tab Table IIBinding affinity of HNF-4αLBD for cis-parinaroyl-CoA, CoA, and cis-parinaric acidLigandEx.2-aExcitation wavelength.Em.2-bEmission wavelength.Fluorophore K d n nm nmcPNA-CoA280333Tyr/Trp248.51.08cPNA-CoA295333Trp238.21.42cPNA-CoA280430cPNA-CoA2-cSensitized emission.250.40.71cPNA-CoA295430cPNA-CoA2-cSensitized emission.758.91.02CoA2803"

Noticeably, NC7-P but not P, dissipated the parasite plasma membrane potential and caused depletion of intraparasite potassium at nonhemolytic conditions. Confocal microscopy analysis of infected cells localized the rhodaminated derivative in association with parasite membranes and intraerythrocytic tubulovesicular structures, whereas in normal cells, the peptide localized exclusively at the plasma membrane.

Consequently, essential ions and metabolites are free to leak in and out and to dissipate the electric potential across the membrane, eventually leading to cell death. Antimicrobial peptides often display a broad spectrum of activity affecting Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi, some enveloped viruses, and many types of cancer cells. Yet many are relatively inactive on normal eukaryotic cells (28Mor A. Nicolas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1934-1939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Martin E. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. J.

Although the basis for this discrimination is also unclear, it appears to be related to the lipid composition of the target membrane (i.e. fluidity, negative charge density, and the absence or presence of cholesterol) and the presence in the peptide-susceptible organisms of a large negativetrans-membrane electrical potential (31Andreu D. Rivas L. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 415-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 32Cruciani R.A. Barker J.L. Zasloff M. Chen H.C. Colamonici O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Such a peptide-based antimicrobial system has attractive advantages over classical antibiotics because it makes it extremely difficult for microbial targets to develop resistance (15Chen J. Falla T.J. Liu H.J. Hurst M.A. Fujii C.A. Mosca D.A. Embree J.R. Loury D.J. Radel P.A. Chang C.C., Gu, L. Fiddes J.C.

Res. 2001; 50: 440-447Crossref Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a major drawback of such an antimicrobial system is reflected in its unselective activity over a wide range of cell types, which could be problematic, for instance, in systemic routes of administration (37Gura T. Science. 2001; 291: 2068-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dermaseptin S4 is a 28-residue antimicrobial peptide isolated from frog skin (38Mor A. Nicolas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The native peptide was shown to exert antiplasmodial activity (4Ghosh J.K. et al.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31609-31616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas subsequent studies (17Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Feder R. Nechushtai R. Mor A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) identified a 13-residue derivative, K4-S4(1–13), displaying a considerable in vitro effectiveness on Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal human parasite (5Krugliak M. Feder R. Zolotarev V. Gaidukov L. Dagan A. Ginsburg H. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The antiplasmodial action was rapid and was shown to be mediated by permeabilization of host cell plasma membrane. Although K4-S4(1–13) was less hemolytic to normal erythrocytes, it was deemed necessary to develop additional derivatives that could affect the parasite with minimal threat to erythrocytes. Recently, acyl derivatives of K4-S4(1–13) were shown to increase antiplasmodial activity, although the most potent antiparasitic peptides still displayed high hemolytic activity (6Dagan A. Efron L. Gaidukov L. Mor A. Ginsburg H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, a series of new dermaseptin S4 derivatives based on K4-S4(1–13) were produced and investigated for antiplasmodial and hemolytic properties. After screening for the most selective compound, we investigated its detailed mechanism of action. The reference peptide K4-S4(1–13) was synthesized by the solid phase method, applying the Fmoc1active ester chemistry on a fully automated, programmable peptide synthesizer (model 433A; Applied Biosystems) as described (17Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 4-Methylbenzhydrylamine resin (Novabiochem) was used to obtain amidated peptides. The various analogs were prepared by linking the N terminus of K4-S4(1–13) to one of the compounds detailed in Table I as follows. After removing the Fmoc group (20% piperidine/N-methylpyrrolidone), the resin-bound peptide (20 mg) was suspended in 0.7 ml of dimethylformamide to which a 2-fold molar excess of the relevant tert-butyloxyl-carbonyl protected aminocarboxylic acid was added followed by 3-fold molar excess of 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. In the specific case of t-BOC aminolauric acid, reactants were mixed in dimethylformamide/CH2Cl2 (1:1). The reaction mixture was sonicated for 5 min and then agitated for 24 h at room temperature. The resin was washed with dimethylformamide and then with ether/dichloromethane (1:1) and dried for 4 h at 50 °C. For visualization studies, rhodamine was covalently attached to the deprotected N terminus of NC6-P (Table I) while still linked to the resin. Peptide labeling, cleavage from the resin, and purification by HPLC were also performed as described (17Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The purified peptides were subjected to amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry to confirm their composition. Peptides were stocked as lyophilized powder at −20 °C. Prior to testing, fresh solutions were prepared in water, briefly vortexed, sonicated, centrifuged, and then diluted in the appropriate medium.Table IStructure of the parent peptide P and its derivatives1 Amino acid sequence in the one letter code. Open table in a new tab 1 Amino acid sequence in the one letter code. Human blood was rinsed three times in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3) by centrifugation for 1 min at 2700 × g, and then 2.5 × 108 red blood cells (RBC) suspended in 50 μl PBS were added to Eppendorf test tubes containing 200 μl of peptide solutions (serial 2-fold dilutions in PBS), PBS alone (for baseline values), or distilled water (for 100% hemolysis). After incubation (3 h under agitation, 37 °C) the samples were centrifuged, and the hemolytic activity was assessed as a function of hemoglobin leakage by measuring the absorbance of 200 μl of supernatant (405 nm). The statistical data were obtained from at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The W2 strain of P. falciparum was cultivated as described (40Kutner S. Breuer W.V. Ginsburg H. Aley S.B. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using human RBC. The culture was synchronized by the sorbitol method (41Lambros C.J. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar) using the less toxic alanine, and infected cells were enriched from culture by Percoll-alanine gradient centrifugation (40Kutner S. Breuer W.V. Ginsburg H. Aley S.B. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Synchronized cultures at the ring stage were cultured at 1% hematocrit and 2% parasitemia in the presence of 10 μm of dermaseptin derivatives. After 18 h of incubation, parasite viability was determined by [3H]hypoxanthine (Hx) uptake (final concentration, 2 μCi/ml) during 6 h and compared with controls (without peptide). Parallel cultures were tested after 6 h for hemolysis as determined by hemoglobin absorbance at 405 nm and compared with cells lysed in water. Parasite viability in the presence of increasing peptide concentrations was determined as described above. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined by nonlinear regression fitting of the data using Sigmaplot. The same procedures were used for the measurement of parasite viability and hemolysis and the stage and the time dependence of drug effect at the different stages. Trophozoite stage culture in modified growth medium (wash medium containing 10 mm bicarbonate and 7% plasma) at 0.5% hematocrit was incubated in the presence of 1 μmrhodamine 123 for 30 min at 37 °C. Rhodamine 123 accumulates inside cells in proportion to the membrane potential (ΔΨ) and has been shown to respond to the dissipation of the plasma membrane ΔΨ in P. falciparum (42Tanabe K. Izumo A. Kato M. Miki A. Doi S. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aliquots of this culture were then exposed to P, NC7-P, or a mixture of 10 μm nigericin (K+:H+ exchanger) and 10 μmmonensin (Na+:H+ exchanger) to dissipate the ion gradient across membranes (positive control). The samples were taken at different time intervals, and the cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in original sample volume of PBS. Aliquots of 120 μl were placed in a 96-well plate and read in a fluorescence reader (excitation wavelength λex = 530 nm, emission wavelength λem = 585 nm). Relative fluorescence (as a percentage of that of the untreated control at the same time) was plotted against the time of incubation. Infected cells at the young trophozoite stage were enriched from culture using the Percoll-alanine gradient (97% parasitemia, determined on Giemsa-strained thin blood smears) and incubated at 0.5% hematocrit in culture medium at 37 °C, with or without 10 μm P or NC7-P. At time 0 and after 4 h, aliquots were taken, cells were washed in PBS, and parasites were freed by saponine (0.003% w/v in PBS)-induced lysis for several minutes at room temperature. The parasites were washed several times in PBS and finally washed with 110 mm MgCl2 buffered with 10 mm Hepes. The parasites were disrupted by freezing and thawing, and potassium content in the supernatant was determined by inductive-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy on an Optima 3300 Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cultures (1% hematocrit) of trophozoites (∼ 90% parasitemia) and uninfected human erythrocytes were incubated in the presence of the rhodaminated peptide at 1 and 10 μm. After 15 and 120 min, the cells were washed and analyzed. In control experiments, the cells were incubated in the presence of free rhodamine and unlabeled NC7-P under similar conditions. Confocal microscope images of the samples (nonfixed cells) were taken using an MRC 1024 confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad). The microscope (Axiovert 135M; Zeiss) is equipped with a 63× objective (Apoplan; NA 1,4). For rhodamine excitation, an Argon ion laser adjusted at 514 nm (emission wavelength = 580 ± 32 nm) was used. To reduce hemolytic activity, acylated peptides (6Dagan A. Efron L. Gaidukov L. Mor A. Ginsburg H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were converted to aminoacyl derivatives. Identity of the synthetic products (TableI) was confirmed by mass analysis of the HPLC-purified peptides (purity was > 95%). As shown in Fig.1 A, acylation of P resulted in increased hydrophobicity concomitant with increased acyl chain length. Comparatively, aminoacyl analogs had reduced hydrophobicity, presumably because of their increased polarity. Fig. 1 B shows that increased hydrophobicity of acyl derivatives first counteracts the hemolytic activity of the parent peptide (as measured in PBS) and thereafter increases it. The aminoacyl derivatives display similar biphasic effect albeit at considerably higher concentrations. It is suggested that the biphasic effect results from the opposing forces of membrane solubilization (enhanced by acyl chain length) and surface aggregation (essential for hemolytic activity) (11Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6567) Google Scholar). To identify peptides that will selectively kill the parasite without lysis of the host cell, the aminoacyl peptides were screened at a single dose of 10 μm for antiplasmodial and hemolytic activities. All of the peptides tested inhibited plasmodial growth to various extents. But, whereas derivatives with short hydrocarbon chains had either lower (e.g. NC2-P) or similar (e.g. NC4-P) antiplasmodial activity compared with the parent peptide P, the more hydrophobic peptides NC7-P and NC12-P were more active (Fig.2 a). Yet although derivatives with 2–7 hydrocarbons (NC2-P, NC4-P, and NC7-P) were less hemolytic, NC12-P displayed increased hemolytic action (Fig. 2 b). To select for the most suitable derivative, we compared the ratio of relative inhibition to relative hemolysis. This analysis (Fig.2 c) revealed that NC4-P and NC7-P were the most selective,i.e. the antiplasmodial activity was superior to the hemolytic action. Two additional branched derivatives (N2C6-P and N4C9-P) were prepared to assess the effect of modulating the charge and hydrophobicity. Compared with P, N2C6-P did not display improved antiplasmodial activity but resulted in increased hemolysis, whereas N4C9-P displayed reduced antiplasmodial and hemolytic activities (Fig. 2, aand b). Because NC7-P combined both increased antiplasmodial effect with lower hemolysis compared with P (as reflected by the increased ratio of the percentage of inhibition to the percentage of lysis in Fig. 2 c), this derivative was chosen for further and more detailed investigations. The dose response of NC7-P was investigated and compared with the parent peptide P using synchronized cultures of P. falciparum that were exposed to the peptides either at the ring or at the trophozoite stage. NC7-P was more effective than P at the ring stage (IC50 = 5.3 ± 0.7 and 7.7 ± 0.9 μm, respectively), but the opposite was observed for the trophozoite stage (IC50 = 6.2 ± 0.5 and 3.4 ± 0.3 μm, respectively). The stage dependence results indicated that ring stage parasites were less sensitive to P, as previously observed (5Krugliak M. Feder R. Zolotarev V. Gaidukov L. Dagan A. Ginsburg H. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), than the more mature trophozoite stage. This was not observed with NC7-P. Moreover, the slopes of the dose-response curves were slightly higher for NC7-P (1.9 ± 0.5 and 2.3 ± 0.4, respectively) compared with P (1.5 ± 0.2 and 1.4 ± 0.1, respectively), indicating some differences in the stoichiometry of drug and target relations. NC7-P (10 μm) was found to be similarly active, and its action was time-dependent both for ring and trophozoite stages, displaying maximal activity after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 3). Removal of the peptide from the culture after 5 h of incubation and measuring parasite viability 19 h later, revealed that the antiplasmodial effect proceeded further even in the absence of peptide in the medium. These results suggest that internalized peptide (see below) could not be removed from the cells and that the antiplasmodial effect was cytotoxic. To further understand the mechanism of antiplasmodial activity, P and NC7-P were tested simultaneously for their hemolytic and antiplasmodial activities. Infected cells at the young trophozoite stage were enriched (∼90% parasitemia) from culture and exposed (0.5% hematocrit) to increasing peptide concentrations. Parasite viability was determined after 2 h of exposure to peptides followed by 4 h of exposure to hypoxanthine in culture conditions, whereas hemolysis was assayed on normal and infected erythrocytes after 6 h of exposure to the peptide. Under these conditions of short time exposure of trophozoite-enriched cultures, NC7-P was more inhibitory than P (IC50 = 14.2 ± 0.5 and 19.6 ± 1.6 μm, respectively). Yet NC7-P was much less hemolytic than P to infected erythrocytes (LC50 = >60 and 21.2 ± 0.6 μm, respectively), whereas this discrepancy was less pronounced for uninfected cells (Fig.4). The fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 accumulates in parasites in correlation with the parasite membrane ΔΨ, and permeabilization of the parasite membrane by the peptide is expected to reduce ΔΨ and thus dye accumulation, as attested by the effect of the ionophores nigericin and monensin (Fig. 5 a). No dissipation of ΔΨ was observed with P, whereas NC7-P caused a discernible reduction. Moreover, exposure of infected cells (∼90% parasitemia) to 10 μm peptides and measurement of potassium content in saponin-freed parasites revealed no effect of P and a marked reduction in the presence of NC7-P (Fig. 5 b). The congruity of both types of results clearly indicates that at nonhemolytic concentrations NC7-P but not P can cross the host cell membrane without upsetting it and interact with the parasite plasma membrane to permeabilize it. A fluorescent peptide where rhodamine was covalently linked to the N terminus of the peptide was prepared and compared with NC7-P with respect to antiplasmodial and hemolytic activities as described above. The rhodaminated peptide had similar antiplasmodial activity, but it was considerably more hemolytic than NC7-P (data not shown). Inspection by confocal microscopy (mid-depth Z slice) of uninfected human erythrocytes exposed to 1 or 10 μmlabeled peptide for up to 2 h under culture conditions revealed intense labeling of many cells (Fig.6 a). The dye was seen associated exclusively with the erythrocyte membrane. Fluorescence intensity increased with concentration, but the number of labeled cells remained practically unchanged with time (not shown). Similar exposure of trophozoite-infected human erythrocytes (∼90% parasitemia) labeled many more cells with the same pattern of dose and time dependence seen with uninfected erythrocytes (Fig. 6 b). Further magnifications disclosed that the label was specifically localized in the parasites and that labeling existed in the host compartment of inclusions that can be identified as tubulovesicular structures and Maurer's clefts. In control experiments where the cells were incubated under similar conditions but in the presence of 10 μm free rhodamine and 10 μm unlabeled NC7-P, neither the infected nor the normal cells were labeled. To design dermaseptin derivatives with greater selectivity, we have been guided by the following rationale. Selective activity of antimicrobial peptides demonstrably depends on the membrane lipid composition (17Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Mor A. Hani K. Nicolas P. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 79: 2075-2083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The lipid composition of the infected cell is considerably different from that of uninfected erythrocytes and other somatic cells of the host in that it is devoid of cholesterol and it has considerably less sphingomylin and phosphatidyl serine, larger concentrations of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol, and a decreased level of unsaturation of the fatty acids (43Vial H.J. Ancelin M.L. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis and Protection. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1998: 159-175Google Scholar). Although the lipid compositions of host and parasite membrane are similar, the potential of the parasite membrane is considerably higher than that of the host cell membrane (42Tanabe K. Izumo A. Kato M. Miki A. Doi S. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it is in the right polarity needed for enhancement of peptide incorporation (32Cruciani R.A. Barker J.L. Zasloff M. Chen H.C. Colamonici O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3792-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 33Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 34Diaz-Achirica P. Ubach J. Guinea A. Andreu D. Rivas L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that the discriminating effect of the dermaseptin derivative could be exerted on two additional levels: (i) preference for infected cells because of lipid composition and (ii) the preference for the parasite membrane because of favorable ΔΨ once inside the cytosol of the infected cell. Increasing the lipophilicity of the peptide will render it more permeable through the host cell membrane and therefore more accessible to the parasite membrane. Because this feature also increases hemolytic activity (6Dagan A. Efron L. Gaidukov L. Mor A. Ginsburg H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Feder R. Dagan A. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4230-4238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we have used aminoacyl moieties to reduce hydrophobicity and, hence, the risk for hemolysis. This reasoning has been tested experimentally using seven peptides of varying N termini. For all derivatives the antiplasmodial and hemolytic activities were found to depend on the nature of the added moiety. Sorting the derivatives by their selectivity (ratio of the percentage of inhibition to the percentage of hemolysis), NC7-P was singled out as the most selective and was further used in parallel with the parent peptide P for detailed investigations. To acquire a deeper understanding of the selectivity effect, parallel determination of antiplasmodial activity and lysis of normal and infected erythrocytes were conducted for short incubation times. The IC50 values obtained in these experiments were understandably higher than those obtained in the standard dose-response test that lasted 24 h because of the time dependence effect and the increased number of infected cells (from 2 to ∼90%, respectively). Outstandingly, whereas with P the dose dependence of growth inhibition and lysis of infected cells overlapped, with NC7-P more than 50% growth inhibition occurred at concentrations that did not cause lysis at all. This discrepancy is possibly even larger because both growth inhibition and lysis are time-dependent processes, and exposure to peptides was only 2 h in the first case and 6 h in the second. Noticeably, whereas P was more lytic to infected cells than to uninfected cells, such discrepancy was much less pronounced for NC7-P. This is a further demonstration of the lipid-dependent specificity of peptides. Unlike P (5Krugliak M. Feder R. Zolotarev V. Gaidukov L. Dagan A. Ginsburg H. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), NC7-P was not stage-selective, being equally inhibitory for both the young ring stage and the more mature trophozoites. We propose that P acts essentially by lysing the host cell membrane. It is more lytic to host cells harboring mature parasite stages, indicating dependence on changes induced by parasite in the host cell membrane. Because the latter evolves with parasite maturation, throphozoites are expected to be more sensitive than rings, as was found (5Krugliak M. Feder R. Zolotarev V. Gaidukov L. Dagan A. Ginsburg H. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, the selectivity of the NC7-P seems to depend on the differential ΔΨ of host and parasite membrane. Because this is established from the onset of parasite development, the permeable peptide is always sucked into the parasite membrane and affects it. For this reason stage dependence with NC7-P is neither expected nor observed. The antiplasmodial effect of NC7-P was clearly time-dependent. It was found to have a stage-independent cytotoxic activity that persisted and accrued even when it was discarded from the culture. This indicates that the association of NC7-P with the parasite membrane is essentially irreversible and that even without saturation of the putative peptide binding sites, it results in the continuous loss of the parasites viability because of membrane permeabilization. The interaction of a fluorescent analog of NC7-P with uninfected erythrocytes was seen to be localized at the cell membrane. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that if the peptide was internalized, its fluorescence was quenched by hemoglobin. In infected cells, the fluorescent analog reached the parasite and labeled its plasma membrane and the tubulovesicular network that emerges from the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane and extends to the erythrocyte membrane (44Elmendorf H.G. Haldar K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 45Elford B.C. Ferguson D.J. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 80-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The high resolution images obtained by fluorescence confocal microscopy recall the subcellular distribution of the fluorescent phospholipid NBD-PC (46Grellier P. Rigomier D. Clavey V. Fruchart J. Schrevel J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), attesting to the association of the peptide with the membranes of the infected cell. Parenthetically, the staining of a subpopulation of infected cells conforms with partial inhibition of parasite growth as measured by the hypoxanthine viability assay that integrates the response of the entire parasite population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration ever of an antiplasmodial compound that acts on a subpopulation of cells in an all-or-none fashion rather than reducing vital processes in each cell. The lipophilic and membrane-trophic character of NC7-P insinuates that its interaction with the parasite membrane would lead to nonselective permeabilization. The observed dissipation of ΔΨ could result from increased permeability to protons because the major generator of ΔΨ is presumably the V-type H+ pump (47Mikkelsen R.B. Tanabe K. Wallach D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 48Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol.

Short circuiting of the electrogenic function of the pump presumably underlies the observed loss of cellular potassium, the maintenance of which seems to depend on ΔΨ. Although these presumptions could explain the gradual and irreversible loss of vital cellular functions, we cannot exclude at the present time the possibility that NC7-P acts on a different cellular target that mediates its cytotoxic action. In conclusion, we demonstrate in this investigation that membrane active peptides can be engineered to act specifically on the membrane of the intracellular parasite to perturb its functions. This selective activity reduces the potential harm from inadvertent lysis of the erythrocytes of the host. This is a major achievement in the fine tuning of peptide composition toward its further development as a potential antimalarial drug. It has been shown previously that intravenous administration of P to rats was well tolerated at least up to 10 mg/kg (39Feder R. Nechushtai R. Mor A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that the LD50 of S4 derivatives (including P) administered intraperitoneally in mice was 25 mg/kg, whereas effectiveness against Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced peritonitis was achieved at ≤4.5 mg/kg (49Navon-Venezia S. Feder R. Gaidukov L. Carmeli Y. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because NC7-P is less hemolytic than P, it can be assumed that it will be less toxic in vivo. Such concentrations are substantially higher than the IC50 of NC7-P against the malaria parasite, indicating that it could also be effective in vivo. It remains to be shown experimentally that NC7-P is not toxic to mammalian cells or to whole animals and that its antiplasmodial effect is maintained in vivo. Investigations of these aspects are underway in our laboratory.

https://openalex.org/W2047572414,"We have probed the structural/functional relationship of key residues in human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and compared their properties with those of the corresponding residues in Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (ECAP). Mutations were introduced in wild-type PLAP,i.e. [E429]PLAP, and in some instances also in [G429]PLAP, which displays properties characteristic of the human germ cell alkaline phosphatase isozyme. All active site metal ligands, as well as residues in their vicinity, were substituted to alanines or to the homologous residues present in ECAP. We found that mutations at Zn2 or Mg sites had similar effects in PLAP and ECAP but that the environment of the Zn1 ion in PLAP is less affected by substitutions than that in ECAP. Substitutions of the Mg and Zn1 neighboring residues His-317 and His-153 increasedk cat and increased K m when compared with wild-type PLAP, contrary to what was predicted by the reciprocal substitutions in ECAP. All mammalian alkaline phosphatases (APs) have five cysteine residues (Cys-101, Cys-121, Cys-183, Cys-467, and Cys-474) per subunit, not homologous to any of the four cysteines in ECAP. By substituting each PLAP Cys by Ser, we found that disrupting the disulfide bond between Cys-121 and Cys-183 completely prevents the formation of the active enzyme, whereas the carboxyl-terminally located Cys-467-Cys-474 bond plays a lesser structural role. The substitution of the free Cys-101 did not significantly affect the properties of the enzyme. A distinguishing feature found in all mammalian APs, but not in ECAP, is the Tyr-367 residue involved in subunit contact and located close to the active site of the opposite subunit. We studied the A367 and F367 mutants of PLAP, as well as the corresponding double mutants containing G429. The mutations led to a 2-fold decrease ink cat, a significant decrease in heat stability, and a significant disruption of inhibition by the uncompetitive inhibitors l-Phe and l-Leu. Our mutagenesis data, computer modeling, and docking predictions indicate that this residue contributes to the formation of the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates and stabilizes the side chain of the inhibitor during uncompetitive inhibition of mammalian APs.

Bowers G.N. Posen S. Alkaline Phosphatases. Plenum Press, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar). APs also catalyze a transphosphorylation reaction in the presence of large concentrations of phosphate acceptors. APs occur widely in nature and are found in many organisms from Escherichia coli to man. APs are homodimeric enzymes, and each catalytic site contains three metal ions (two Zn ions and one Mg ion) that are necessary for enzymatic activity (2Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Whereas the main features of the catalytic mechanism are conserved between mammalian APs and the E. coli enzyme, there are important differences. Mammalian APs (a) have higher specific activity and K m values, (b) have a more alkaline pH optimum, (c) are inhibited byl-amino acids and peptides through an uncompetitive mechanism, and (d) display lower heat stability. These properties, however, differ noticeably within the group of mammalian AP isozymes. Many of the isozyme-specific properties have been attributed to a flexible loop region or “crown” domain of the molecule (3Bossi M. Hoylaerts M.F. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25409-25416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Menez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol.

Some mammalian APs, such as the human intestinal isozyme, are activated by magnesium ions, whereas the human placental AP is more similar to the E. coli enzyme in that its activity is not enhanced by the addition of magnesium (1McComb R.B. Bowers G.N. Posen S. Alkaline Phosphatases. Plenum Press, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar). For many years, E. coli AP (ECAP) was the only source of structural information on APs (2Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), but now the three-dimensional structure of the first mammalian AP, i.e. human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), has been solved (4Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Menez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). As had been predicted from sequence comparisons (5Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 186: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the central core of PLAP, consisting of an extended β-sheet and flanking α-helices, is very similar to that of ECAP. The same is true in the immediate vicinity of the three catalytic ions. However, a number of distinctive features, including a different positioning of the amino-terminal segment of the molecule and the expanded top loop or “crown” domain, are now apparent (4Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Menez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). An additional noncatalytic metal-binding site not present in ECAP was uncovered, which appears to be occupied by calcium (4Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Menez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol.

Kishigami S. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas PLAP has five nonhomologous residues. Furthermore, whereas ECAP is located in the periplasmic space of the bacterium, PLAP is an ectoenzyme bound to the plasma membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor (8Micanovic R. Brink B.L.

In the present paper, we embarked on a wide-range mutagenesis study on structure-function relationships in mammalian APs, using the PLAP structure as a paradigm. The aim was to pinpoint the features of PLAP responsible for the specific properties of this AP isozyme, as well as the properties of mammalian APs in general. The active site metal ligand residues were mutated to alanines or to the analogous residues in the structure of ECAP, and cysteines were mutated to serines. Furthermore, Tyr-367 is conserved in all mammalian APs and occupies a unique position in the PLAP structure, serving as a bridge from one subunit in the dimer to the active site of another subunit. We mutagenized the Tyr-367 residue to Ala and Phe. Mutations were studied individually as well as in combination with the E429G substitution because this change has been shown to significantly affect many of the enzymatic properties of PLAP by conferring germ cell alkaline phosphatase characteristics to the resulting mutant enzyme (10Hoylaerts M.F.

The present analysis of structurally and catalytically important residues in PLAP has identified critical positions serving a different structural role in mammalian and bacterial alkaline phosphatases. We have also defined the location of the hydrophobic pocket that participates in stabilizing the side chains of uncompetitive inhibitors in the immediate vicinity of the active site of mammalian alkaline phosphatases. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR with mutated oligonucleotide primers. The strategy involves the introduction of restriction sites for enzymes that cut at a distance from their recognition sites (BsaI, BspMI,Alw26I, and EarI) or the use of endogenous restriction enzyme sites. Either the PLAP-FLAG/pcDNA3 or PLAP/pSVT7 plasmid was used as a template in PCR reactions. PCR products were subcloned into a pCR2.1 or PCRII-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The restriction fragments were then cut and ligated with the fragments of PLAP-FLAG/pcDNA3 and pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen). All final constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. Plasmid DNA was prepared by the alkaline lysis procedure. Sequencing was performed using Sequenase according to the manufacturer's protocol (AmershamBiosciences). The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for amplifying the site-directed mutagenized fragments in the case of the active site metal ligands are described in this section. The name of the primer (all are shown 5′ to 3′) is given first, followed by the sequence (positions that denote the mutation are underlined): D42A, GCG-GTC-TCC-TGG-GCG-CTG-GGA-TGG-G; 42−, ATG-GTC-TCG-CCC-AGG-AAG-ATG-ATG-AG; H153A, CCG-GTC-TCG-TGC-AGG-CCG-CCT-CGC-CAG-CCG; H153D, CCG-GTC-TCG-TGC-AGG-ACG-CCT-CGC-CAG-CCG; S155A, CCG-GTC-TCG-TGC-AGC-ACG-CCG-CGC-CAG-CCG; S155T, CCG-GTC-TCG-TGC-AGG-CCG-CCA-CGC-CAG-CCG 153155−, GCG-GTC-TCC-TGC-ACT-CGT-GTG-GTG-GT; E311A, CCC-CGC-GGC-TTC-TTC-CTC-TTC-GTG-GCG-GGT-GGT; D316A, AGG-GTC-TCC-GCA-TCG-CCC-ATG-GTC-ATC-AT; H317K, AGG-GTC-TCC-GCA-TCG-ACA-AAG-GTC-ATC-AT; 316317−, CCG-GTC-TCG-ATG-CGA-CCA-CCC-TCC-AC; H320A, GCG-GTC-TCC-ATG-GTC-ATG-CTG-GAA-AGC-AGG; 320−, TCG-GTC-TCA-CCA-TGG-TCG-ATG-CGA-CC; D357A, GCG-GTC-TCA-CTG-CCG-CCC-ACT-CCC-ACG-TC; H358A, GCG-GTC-TCA-CTG-CCG-ACG-CCT-CCC-ACG-TC; H360A, GCG-GTC-TCA-CTG-CCG-ACC-ACT-CCG-CCG-TC; 357358360−, GAG-GTC-TCG-GCA-GTG-ACG-AGG-CTC-AG; H432A, GCC-GCG-CGC-GAA-CAC-CGC-CAC-GTC-CTC-GCC-TGC-GGC-GGT-CTC-TTC; 317−, ATG-GGT-CTC-GTC-GAT-GCG-ACC-ACC-CTC; PLAPFLAG, TCA-CTT-GTC-ATC-GTC-GTC-CTT-GTA-GTC-GGT-GGT-GCC-GGC-GGG-GGG-CGC; H317A, TTC-CTC-TTC-GTG-GAG-GGT-GGT-CGC-ATC-GAC-GCT-GGT-CAT; H319A, TTC-CTC-TTC-GTG-GAG-GGT-GGT-CGC-ATC-GAC-CAT-GGT-GCT-CAT-GA; and E429G(−), GCC-GCG-CGC-GAA-CAC-CGC-CAC-GTC-CTC-GCC-TGC-GTG-GGT-CTC-ACC-GTC. pSVT7 PLAP was used as the template in PCR reactions with the following primer pairs: 1, T7 and 42−; 2, D42A and 153155−; 3, H153A and 316317−; 4, H153D and 316317−; 5, S155A and 316317−; 6, S155T and 316317−; 7, E311A and H432A; 8, D316A and H432A; 9, H317K and H432A; 10, H320A and H432A; 11, D357A and H432A; 12, H358A and H432A; 13, H360A and H432A; 14, S155A and 357358360−; 15, S155A and 320−; and 16, D357A and PLAP-FLAG. PCR products were subcloned and sequenced to verify sequence integrity, and then the following fragments were isolated and combined with fragments from pSVT7 PLAP to produce the indicated PLAP mutants in pSVT7: 1/HindIII-BsaI and 2/Bsa BamHI for D42A; 2/BamHI-BsaI and 3/BsaI-SacI for H153A; 2/BamHI-BsaI and 4/BsaI-SacI for H153D; 2/BamHI-BsaI and 5/BsaI-SacI for S155A; 2/BamHI-BsaI and 6/BsaI-SacI for S155T; 7/SacII-SacI for E311A; 4,5,6/SacII-BsaI and 8/BsaI-SacI for D316A; 4,5,6/SacII-BsaI and 9/BsaI-SacI for H317K; 15/SacII-BsaI and 10/BsaI-SacI for H320A; 14/SacII-BsaI and 11/BsaI-SacI for D357A; 14/SacII-BsaI and 12/BsaI-SacI for H358A; 14/SacII-BsaI and 13/BsaI-SacI for H360A; and 11/EagI-BssHII for H432A.HindIII-SacII from H153D andSacII-BssHII from H317K were combined to construct [D153, K317]PLAP. PLAP residues past 483 were replaced by the 8-amino acid FLAG epitope by ligating wtEcoRI-BssHII with 16/BssHII-Xba into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).HindIII-BssHII fragments for all the pSVT7 PLAP mutants were subcloned with theBssHII-XbaPLAP-FLAG fragment into pcDNA3 to create constructs encoding carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged secreted APs. For other active site area mutations, PLAP-FLAG/pcDNA3 was used as template in the following PCR reactions: 317–44, H317A and E429G(−); 319–44, H319A and E429G(−); and 429, H357A and E429G(−). After PCR products were subcloned, the following restriction fragments were cut and ligated together with PLAP-FLAG/pcDNA3 fragments to give final constructs: 429/SacI-PauI for E429G; 317–44/EarI-SacI for H317A; 319–44/EarI–SacI for H319A; 317–44/EarI-SacI and 429/SacI-PauI for H317A and E429G; and 319–44/EarI-SacI and 429/SacI-PauI for the double H319A + E429G mutation. The fragments XbaI-BsmBI from the H153A final construct and BsmBI-XbaI from the E429G final construct were combined to prepare [A153, G429]PLAP. To prepare the cysteine mutants, the following PCR primers were used: F101, ACA-GCC-GGT-CTC-TAC-CTG-AGC-GGG-GTC-AAG-GGC; R101, CTT-GAC-GGT-CTC-CAG-GTA-GGC-CGT-GGC-TGT; F121, GCA-GCC-GGT-CTC-TTT-AAC-CAG-AGC-AAC-ACG-ACA-CGC; R121, CGT-GTT-GGT-CTC-GTT-AAA-GCG-GGC-GGC-TGC; F183, GCC-TCG-ACC-TGC-CAG-GAG-GGG-TCC-CAG-GAC; R183, AGC-GAT-ACC-TGC-GCA-CCC-CTC-CTG-GCG-GGC; C467S, GGG-GCG-CCA-GGT-CGC-AGG-CGG-TGT-AGG-GCT-CCA-GGG-AGG-CGG; C474S, GGG-GCG-CCA-GGT-CGG-AGG-CGG-TGT-AGG-GCT-CCA-GGC-AGG-CGG; SSR, GGC-GGT-CTC-GGG-CTC-CAG-GGA-GGC-GGC-GAA; ALW, GCC-GCC-CGT-CTC-GAG-CCC-TAC-ACC-GCC-TCC-GAC-CT; T7, TAA-TAC-GAC-TCA-CTA-TAA-GGG; and SP6, ATT-TAG-GTG-AGA-CTA-TAG. The products of the PCR reactions (CYS1, F101 and R183; CYS2, R101 and T7; CYS3, F121 and R183; CYS4, R121 and T7; CYS5, R183 and T7; CYS6, F183 and SP6; CYS7, D357A and C467S; CYS8, D357A and C474S; CYS9, D357A and SSR; and CYS10, ALW and SP6) were isolated and subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector. The following restriction fragments were cut and ligated with the fragments of PLAP-FLAG/pcDNA3 to make the final constructs: CYS1/BsaI-BstEII and CYS2/EcoRI-BsaI for the C101S mutant; CYS3/BsaI-BstEII and CYS4/EcoRI-BsaI for C121S; CYS5/EcoRI-BspMI and CYS6/BspMI-XbaI for C183S; CYS7/PauI-KasI for C467S; CYS8/PauI-KasI for C474S; and CYS9/PauI-Alw26I and CYS10/Alw26I-XbaI for the double S467 + S474 mutation. All final constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. The following PCR primers were used: Y367A(R), CGAAGATGGAGCTCCCTCGCAGGGGGGCGCCTCC; Y367F(R), CGAAGATGGAGCTCCCTCGCAGGGGGAAGCCTCC; in PCR reactions. For PCR reaction 367A/ we used primers H153A andY367A(R), whereas for reaction 367F/ the primers H153A and Y367F(R) were used. Restriction fragments were then cut and combined with fragments from PLAP-FLAG/pCDNA3 to make the final constructs (for the [A367]PLAP or [F367]PLAP mutants, BsmBI-SacI from 367A or 367F, respectively; for the [A367, G429]PLAP or [F367, G429]PLAP mutants, SacI-XbaI from [E429G]PLAP andBsmBI-SacI from A367 or F367, respectively). PLAP-FLAG constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells for transient expression by the DEAE-dextran- or calcium phosphate-mediated method. Three and 6 days after transfection, conditioned media were collected and concentrated about 10 times by ultrafiltration on 50 Centricon columns (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). PLAP-FLAG proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG M2 antibody gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure relative specific activities, microtiter plates were coated with 2 μg/ml M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). After the addition of recombinant APs, the activity of the bound enzymes was measured as the change in absorbance at 405 nm over time at 37 °C upon the addition of 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate in 1.0 mdiethanolamine buffer (pH 9.8), 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 μm ZnCl2. PLAP-FLAG served as a reference for each microtiter plate. The p-nitrophenol concentration formed was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 10,080 liter × mole−1 × cm−1. To calculateK m , substrate concentration was varied between 0.2 and 1.6 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, and the initial reaction rate was measured at 37 °C over a time interval of 5 min. Results were fit by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism version 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). AP pH/activity profiles were done using 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate in 50 mmbuffer with 1 mm MgCl2 and 20 μmZnCl2; bis-tris propane for pH range 6.5–9.5, and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol for pH range 9.5–11. The pH was checked after dissolving the substrate. The 50 mm3-(cyclohexylaminol)-1-propanesulfonic acid buffer proved to be inhibitory to PLAP but not ECAP activity. The carboxyl-terminal FLAG fusion protein of ECAP (Eastman Kodak Co.) was used for comparison. The heat stability of PLAP mutants was studied by incubating the enzyme samples in 1 m diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 20 μmZnCl2. After a 10-min incubation at a given temperature, the samples were placed on ice. Residual activities were then measured in duplicate with 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate at pH 9.8 in the same buffer. The cysteine-specific probe 4-(aminosulfonyl)-7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (ABD-F; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was used to label wild-type PLAP (not modified with FLAG peptide). Free ABD-F shows no fluorescence but can form fluorescent adducts with protein thiol groups with an excitation maximum at 390 nm and an emission maximum at about 500–520 nm. In a modification reaction, 20-μl aliquots of 50 mm ABD-F solution in Me2SO were added to 1-ml samples of PLAP solution (0.4 μm/liter) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, either at nondenaturing conditions or in the presence of denaturant (4 m guanidine hydrochloride), reducing agent (1 mm tris-(2-carboxylethyl)phosphine; Molecular Probes Inc), or both. The samples were then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C while protected from light. Fluorescence spectra were measured with a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer with excitation at 390 nm. The binding of inhibitors l-Leu andl-Phe to the PLAP molecule was modeled using the flexible ligand docking program FlexX (14Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). The active site of PLAP was defined as a sphere of 9 Å around the Zn1 atom. The phosphate ion present in the enzyme structure was included in the receptor model. Ligands were prepared in the SYBYL mol2 format, in energy-minimized form, with all hydrogens added and formal charges assigned. The amino groups ofl-Leu and l-Phe were left unprotonated. The manual “base fragment” selection (14Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar) option was used, and either the carboxylic, amino, or hydrophobic groups of the ligand were chosen as the base fragment. To pinpoint the residues important for catalysis and stability of human PLAP, we constructed and characterized 23 individual site-directed mutants of PLAP (Fig. 1) as well as 7 double mutations. Residues serving as ligands to catalytically important metal ions, i.e. Asp-42, His-153, Ser-155, Glu-311, Asp-316, His-320, Asp-357, His-358, His-360, and His-432, were mutagenized into Ala. Two residues in the vicinity of the Mg-binding site in PLAP that are not conserved in ECAP, i.e.His-153 and His-317, were mutagenized into Ala or to Asp and Lys, respectively. Some active site mutations were studied in the context of both wild-type PLAP, i.e. [E429]PLAP, and [G429]PLAP because this substitution has been shown to have profound influences on the behavior of the enzyme by conferring upon it germ cell alkaline phosphatase characteristics (11Hummer C.

Furthermore, the mammalian APs have 5 cysteine residues/monomer in positions that are not homologous to the 4 cysteines of ECAP (7Sone M. Kishigami S. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and we mutagenized each of these 5 cysteines of PLAP to Ser and also studied the [C467S, C474S] double mutant. In addition, mutagenesis of the Tyr-367 residue, a signature feature of mammalian APs, was also performed. To simplify the recovery and purification of the recombinant PLAP variants, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring sequence of PLAP was replaced by the FLAG octapeptide, and all mutants were expressed as secreted, epitope-tagged, enzymes. We had previously determined that the addition of the FLAG sequence does not interfere with the kinetic properties of the molecule (15Di Mauro, S., Manes, T., Hessle, H., Kozlenkov, A., Pizauro, J. M., Hoylaerts, M. F., and Millán, J. L. (2002)J. Bone Miner. Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). This strategy facilitated the production of large amounts of recombinant protein and enabled the fast and efficient isolation of each mutant AP using anti-FLAG affinity purification. Two substitutions resulted in mutant enzymes that did not have any AP activity over background levels in the culture media, i.e. C121S and C183S. We could not detect any FLAG-tagged protein in the media for these mutants by Western blot analysis, indicating that these mutations had severe adverse consequences on protein structure, proper folding, and/or secretion. Fig.2 shows a detailed comparison of the structure of the active site region of PLAP and ECAP including all the metal ligands that were mutagenized in this study. When substituting the Zn1 ligands in PLAP, i.e. Asp-316, His-320, and His-432, two of the three mutants, i.e. [A316]PLAP and [A432]PLAP, retained significant activity (TableI). The k cat andK m of [A316]PLAP showed a 2.8- and 2.25-fold decrease relative to wt PLAP. Thus, the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ) of the [A316]PLAP mutant remains comparable to that of wt PLAP. Thek cat of [A432]PLAP was also reduced 2.7-fold, but its K m increased 3.7-fold for a resulting 5.8-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency. In contrast, the introduction of the H320A mutation reduced the specific activity of PLAP by >200-fold. Saturation of each of the mutants with Zn2+ concentrations of up to 10 mm did not result in any increase in activity. It should be noted that analogous mutations in ECAP were reported to have very different consequences. Notably, the D327A substitution in ECAP (analogous to Asp-316 in PLAP) resulted in a 3000-fold decrease in k cat and a 2000-fold increase in K m for a 107-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency that was not reversible by the addition of Zn2+ (16Xu X. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16244-16251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the activity of the H412A mutant in ECAP (analogous to H432A in PLAP) was responsive to 0.2 mm Zn2+, reaching k catand K m values only 2-fold lower that those of wt ECAP (17Ma L. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31614-31619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H331A mutation (analogous to H320A in PLAP) has not been studied in ECAP. These results indicate that there are significant differences in the environment of Zn1 in the PLAP structure compared with the ECAP structure and that substitutions of the Zn1 ligands are better tolerated in PLAP than in ECAP. This may reflect the fact that the top flexible loop, or crown domain, that harbors E429 in PLAP appears to provide additional stabilization to the active site environment, so that Zn2+ cannot easily diffuse in or out of the PLAP molecule, as we have previously observed (18Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millán J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, even though the state of coordination of Zn1 is affected by the mutations, the Zn2+ ion remains in place and is able to function in catalysis.Table IKinetic parameters of PLAP mutantsPLAP mutants k cat K m k cat/K m (s −1 ) (mm) (s −1 mm −1 wt PLAP460 ± 110.36 ± 0.031288 [G429]PLAP344 ± 140.10 ± 0.0053400Conserved active site residues [A42]PLAP6.4 ± 0.80.68 ± 0.049 [A155]PLAP5.1 ± 0.50.38 ± 0.0214 [T155]PLAP529 ± 370.18 ± 0.012813 [A311]PLAP2.8 ± 0.41.26 ± 0.082 [A316]PLAP193 ± 60.16 ± 0.011073 [A320]PLAP1.8 ± 0.9ND1-aND, not determined.ND [A357]PLAP18 ± 3.70.21 ± 0.0278 [A358]PLAP<1.0NDND [A432]PLAP170 ± 61.36 ± 0.18221Nonconserved active site residues [D153]PLAP313 ± 140.71 ± 0.03442 [A153]PLAP989 ± 531.22 ± 0.08825 [A153, G429]PLAP546 ± 350.31 ± 0.031761 [K317]PLAP906 ± 640.80 ± 0.031097 [A317]PLAP999 ± 311.13 ± 0.19884 [A317, G429]PLAP797 ± 380.25 ± 0.023188 [D153, K317]PLAP400 ± 181.2 ± 0.1340Active site neighboring residues [A319]PLAP6.5 ± 1.5NDND [A319, G429]PLAP12.8 ± 2.2NDND [A360]PLAP552 ± 231.4 ± 0.1608 [A367]PLAP195 ± 110.35 ± 0.02557 [F367]PLAP178 ± 140.27 ± 0.02659 [A367, G429]PLAP202 ± 60.22 ± 0.01918 [F367, G429]PLAP200 ± 110.17 ± 0.011176Cysteine residues [S101]PLAP489 ± 130.41 ± 0.051193 [S467]PLAP206 ± 150.36 ± 0.05572 [S474]PLAP221 ± 130.33 ± 0.03670 [S467, S474]PLAP244 ± 110.40 ± 0.04610 [S121]PLAP & [S183]PLAPNDNDND1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Alanine substitutions of the Zn2 ligands in PLAP, i.e.Asp-42, Asp-357, and His-358, resulted in significant decreases in specific activity, ranging from >25-fold (D357A) to undetectable levels (H358A). None of these values changed in response to the addition of Zn2+. Whereas the K m of [A42]PLAP nearly doubled, the K m of [A357]PLAP decreased slightly. Thus, the catalytic efficiencies of [A42]PLAP and [A357]PLAP were reduced by 130- and 16-fold, respectively. Whereas no studies have been performed in ECAP on residues analogous to Asp-357 and His-358, the [A51]ECAP mutant, analogous to [A42]PLAP, was shown to be >800-fold less active than the wt ECAP (19Tibbitts T.T. Murphy J.E. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 700-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ala-42 is a bidentate ligand, coordinating not only to Zn2 but also to Mg. Alanine substitution of the other two Mg ligands, i.e.Ser-155 and Glu-311, reduced the specific activity of PLAP ∼100- and 200-fold, respectively. The K m for [A155]PLAP did not change, but it increased about 4-fold for [A311]PLAP. A similar pattern was seen for the corresponding E322A mutation in ECAP (20Xu X. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10683-10691Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the S155T substitution hardly affects the activity of the resulting mutant and even doubles its catalytic efficiency (TableI). Whereas most of the AP active site residues are perfectly conserved throughout evolution, some important differences exist in the neighborhood of the Mg ion (Fig. 2). His-153 and His-317 in PLAP are homologous to Asp-153 and Lys-328, respectively, in ECAP. The substitution of D153H and K328H in ECAP produced enzymes with kinetic properties similar to those of mammalian APs. For example, the D153H/K328H double ECAP mutant displayed a 5.6-fold higherk cat and a 30-fold higher K m , a decrease in heat stability, and a shift in pH optimum to alkaline pH values (21Murphy J.E.

We performed a kinetic analysis of a truncated myo1e that consists of the motor and the single IQ motif with a bound calmodulin. We determined the rates and equilibrium constants for the key steps in the ATPase cycle. The maximum actin activated ATPase rate (Vmax) and the actin concentration at half-maximum of Vmax(KATPase) of myo1e are similar to those of the native protein. The KATPase is low (∼1 μm), however the affinity of myo1e for actin in the presence of ATP is very weak. A weak actin affinity and a rapid rate of phosphate release result in a pathway under in vitro assay conditions in which phosphate is released while myo1e is dissociated from actin. Actin activation of the ATPase activity and the lowKATPase are the result of actin activation of ADP release. We propose that myo1e is tuned to function in regions of high concentrations of cross-linked actin filaments. Additionally, we found that ADP release from actomyo1e is > 10-fold faster than other vertebrate myosin-I isoforms. We propose that subclass-1 myosin-Is are tuned for rapid sliding, whereas subclass-2 isoforms are tuned for tension maintenance or stress sensing.

The molecular details of myosin-I function in the cell are not known, but myosin-Is are thought to play important roles in cortical membrane tension (2Dai J. Ting-Beall H.P. Hochmuth R.M. Sheetz M.P.

Myosin-Is are the most diverse of the unconventional myosins and are represented by at least two phylogenetically distinct subclasses based on sequence comparison of motor domains (9Sokac A.M. Bement W.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 200: 197-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Subclass-1 myosin-I isoforms have long tails that contain lipid binding (TH1), proline-rich (TH2), and Src homology-3 (TH3) domains. Subclass-1 isoforms were first discovered in lower eukaryotes (10Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are sometimes termed “amoeboid” isoforms. However, vertebrate members of this subclass have been identified (11Bement W.M. Wirth J.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subclass-2 myosin-I isoforms have short tails that contain only TH1 domains and are also widely expressed (9Sokac A.M. Bement W.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 200: 197-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The kinetic mechanisms of all characterized myosin-Is follow the same pathway with the same biochemical intermediates (13Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 32: 1053-1060Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Pollard T.D. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21624-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, considerable kinetic variability exists within the myosin-I family. Key rate constants of isoforms from lower eukaryotes are significantly faster (3–10-fold) than those of the vertebrate isoforms. The characterized lower eukaryote isoforms belong to subclass-1 (13Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 32: 1053-1060Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the characterized vertebrate isoforms are members of subclass-2 (14Jontes J.D. Milligan R.A. Pollard T.D. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14332-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21624-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), thus suggesting the possibility that kinetic properties correlate with the isoform subclass rather than with the specific organism. Measurement of the rate constants of a vertebrate subclass-1 isoform will help determine whether kinetic properties are conserved within the subclasses. Additionally, knowing the rate constants of the different isoforms allows us to understand the physical limitations and properties of myosin-I isoforms and thus provides insight into the cellular functions of the subclasses. Comparisons of the sequences of myosin-I subclasses may also help unravel the structural modifications required for kinetic tuning of all myosin motors. Myo1e, also known as myr-3 (12Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and human myosin-IC (11Bement W.M. Wirth J.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is the subclass-1 myosin-I expressed in nearly all vertebrate cells. Localization studies show that myo1e is found in regions of high actin concentration (17Stöffler H.-E. Honnert U. Bauer C.A. Hofer D. Schwarz H. Muller R.T. Drenckhahn D. Bähler M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2779-2788PubMed Google Scholar, 18Skowron J.F. Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 308-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and steady-state biochemical investigations suggest that myo1e is capable of cross-linking actin filaments via an ATP-insensitive actin binding site in its tail (19Stöffler H.-E. Bähler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14605-14611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This cross-linking results in triphasic actin activated ATPase activity. Unlike myosin-Is from lower eukaryotes, the ATPase activity of myo1e appears to be regulated allosterically by its tail domain (19Stöffler H.-E. Bähler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14605-14611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the ATPase activity is not predicted to be regulated by heavy chain phosphorylation by p21-activated kinase homologs (20Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We measured all of the key rate constants in the myo1e ATPase pathway and found that, like subclass-1 isoforms from lower eukaryotes, the rate constants are significantly faster than the characterized vertebrate subclass-2 isoforms, thus suggesting conservation of kinetics and function within a single subclass across phylogenetic boundaries. However, we also found differences in the myo1e kinetics which may tune the motor for function in regions of high actin concentration. N-Methyanthraniloyl (mant)1 nucleotide derivatives were purchased from Molecular Probes, and 2′-deoxymantATP (dmantATP) was synthesized as described by Hiratsuka (21Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). ADP and ATP concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically before each experiment by absorbance at 259 nm, ε259 = 15,400m−1 cm−1. MantATP and mantADP concentrations were determined by absorbance at 255 nm, ε255 = 23,300 m−1cm−1 (21Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared and gel filtered (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin concentrations were determined by absorbance at 290 nm, ε259 = 26,600 m−1cm−1 (23Houk T.W. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Actin was labeled with pyrenyl iodoacetamide (pyrene-actin) and gel filtered (24Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All actin was stabilized with a molar equivalent of phalloidin (Sigma). Calmodulin (CaM) was expressed in bacteria and purified as described (25Putkey J.A. Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Free CaM (1–3 μm) was included in all solutions. The cDNA for human myosin-IC (accession NM 004998), kindly provided by W. M. Bement (University of Wisconsin), was truncated at Glu720, generating a construct containing the motor domain and the only IQ motif (referred to as myo1eIQ throughout the paper). A FLAG peptide sequence was inserted at the C terminus and subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus was generated using standard procedures. Myo1eIQ with bound calmodulin was purified fromSf9 cells that were coinfected with virus containing recombinant myo1eIQ and CaM (Fig.1). Four liters of log phase cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected and incubated at 27 °C for 60 h with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin), 2 mm MgATP, and 0.05% Igepal at 4 °C; and homogenized with five strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Cell extract was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto anti-FLAG antibody columns (Sigma). Columns were washed with 5 column volumes of lysis buffer + 2 mm MgATP and 5 column volumes of lysis buffer. Myo1eIQ was eluted with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 μmCaM, 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin. Eluted protein was loaded directly on to an 8-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in column buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 1 mmDTT) and eluted with a linear 25 mm–1 m KCl gradient. The Mono Q column separated myo1eIQ from FLAG peptide, ADP, ATP, and free CaM. Fractions containing myo1eIQ were dialyzed versus storage buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol), which concentrated the protein and allowed for storage at −20 °C. Quantitative densitometry showed that myo1eIQ was >95% pure, and the CaM:myo1eIQ ratio was 1:1. Approximately 2 mg of pure myo1e protein was obtained from 4 liters of cells. SCHEME 1 Steady-state ATPase activities were measured in KMg50 or KMg0 buffer at 25 °C using the NADH-coupled assay as described (27De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Steady-state binding of 0.2 μm myo1eIQ to 0–50 μm actin was measured in KMg50 and KMg0 at 25 °C in the presence of 2 mm MgATP by ultracentrifugation assays (350,000 × g for 20 min). The fraction of actin-bound myosin was determined by assaying the NH4/EDTA ATPase activity of the supernatant (29Chalovich J.M. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2432-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient kinetic measurements were made at 25 °C with an Applied Photophysics(Surrey, UK) SX.18MV stopped flow having a 1.2-ms dead time. Tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 295 nm) was measured using a 320 nm WG long pass emission filter (Oriel). A 400 nm long pass filter (Oriel) was used to monitor pyrene (λex = 365 nm), and mantADP and mantATP (λex = 295 nm) fluorescence. Usually three to five transients were averaged before nonlinear least square fitting. The time courses presented in the figures show the average of one to four individual traces. Transients were fitted to exponential functions using the software supplied with the stopped flow. Transient Pi release was measured using the coupled assay system containing the fluorescently labeled mutant of the phosphate-binding protein (PiBP (30White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R.

The dead time of the instrument in this configuration was ∼2 ms. Quenched flow measurements were performed with a KinTek (State College, PA) RQF-3 apparatus. Errors reported are standard errors in the fits. Kinetic modeling and simulations were performed using Scheme 1 of the actomyosin ATPase, where A is actin and M is myosin. Computer simulations were performed with KSIM (Neil C. Miller) or Berkeley-Madonna (Robert I. Macey and George F. Oster; University of California, Berkeley). The ATPase activities of subclass-1 myosin-I isoforms from all lower eukaryotes are activated by phosphorylation of serine or threonine at the TEDS site in an actin binding, surface loop by proteins that have homology to p21-activated kinases (20Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although myo1e has serines immediately adjacent to the TEDS site, it is not predicted to be regulated by heavy chain phosphorylation (20Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We were unable to phosphorylate myo1eIQ with Pak3 or Acanthamoeba myosin-I heavy chain kinase (not shown), thus confirming the TEDS rule (20Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The steady-state ATPase activity of myo1eIQ is activated ∼2-fold by actin filaments. Steady-state (Fig.2) and single turnover measurements (not shown) gave rates of ∼0.6 s−1 in the absence of actin (Table I) in KMg50. The actin concentration at half-maximum of the steady-state ATPase rate (KATPase) is 1.2 ± 0.36 μm, and the maximum ATPase rate (Vmax) at saturating actin is 1.2 ± 0.03 s−1. The triphasic ATPase activity observed with native myo1e was not observed (19Stöffler H.-E. Bähler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14605-14611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Table ISteady-state ATPase parameters for myo1eIQVmax1-aMaximum steady-state ATPase rate in the presence of saturating actin filaments.KATPase1-bActin filament concentration at half maximum activation of steady-state ATPase.v01-cSteady-state ATP turnover rate in the absence of actin filaments.s−1head−1μms−1 head−10 mmKCl1.1 ± 0.061-dUncertainties represent standard errors in the best fits of the data.10 ± 2.20.39 ± 0.0250 mm KCl1.2 ± 0.031.2 ± 0.360.58 ± 0.041-a Maximum steady-state ATPase rate in the presence of saturating actin filaments.1-b Actin filament concentration at half maximum activation of steady-state ATPase.1-c Steady-state ATP turnover rate in the absence of actin filaments.1-d Uncertainties represent standard errors in the best fits of the data. Open table in a new tab Steady-state actin binding measurements show that myo1eIQ is dissociated predominantly from 0–50 μm actin in KMg0 (Fig. 2) and KMg50 (not shown) in the presence of 2 mm MgATP. Therefore, in the presence of ATP, the predominant steady-state myo1eIQ intermediates have a very weak affinity for actin with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) greater than 50 μm. An ∼80% fluorescence quenching upon strong binding of myo1eIQ to pyrene-actin allowed us to monitor the association of myo1eIQ with actin in the absence (Reaction 1) and presence (Reaction 2) of MgADP. Data were modeled as AM⇄k−7k+7A*+MREACTION 1 and AM·ADP⇄k−11k+11A*+M·ADPREACTION 2 where A* represents the unquenched fluorescent state of pyrene-actin. Time courses of myo1eIQ and myo1eIQ-ADP binding to pyrene-actin follow single exponentials rates that depend linearly on the actin concentration (Fig. 3A). The apparent second order rate constant for myo1eIQ binding to actin obtained from the slope is k−7 = 9.0 ± 0.7 μm−1 s−1 (Table II). The apparent second order rate constant for myo1eIQ-ADP binding to actin isk−11 = 1.2 μm−1s−1 (Table II).Table IIRate and equilibrium constants for the myo1eIQ ATPase cycleActin bindingATP hydrolysisk−7(μm−1s−1)9.0 (±0.7)2-aPyrene fluorescence.k+3+ k−3(s−1)108 (±14)2-bQuenched flow.k+7(s−1)0.056 (±0.0002)2-aPyrene fluorescence.k+3(s−1)592-bQuenched flow.K−7(nm)6.22-aPyrene fluorescence.k−3(s−1)492-bQuenched flow.k−11 (μm−1s−1)1.2 (±0.01)2-aPyrene fluorescence.K31.22-cSingle turnover.k+11(s−1)0.066 (±0.0002)2-aPyrene fluorescence.K11(nm)552-aPyrene fluorescence.k+9(s−1)>4002-aPyrene fluorescence.PireleaseK10(μm)2-cSingle turnover.(>50)2-aPyrene fluorescence.k+4(s−1)1.5 (±0.2)2-dPi-BP.ATP bindingADP bindingK1k+2fast(μm−1s−1)11 (±0.4)2-eMant fluorescence.k−5/K6(μm−1s−1) (40 ± 4.0)2-eMant fluorescence.K1k+2slow(μm−1s−1)0.65 (±0.0)2-eMant fluorescence.k−5(s−1)237 (±13)2-eMant fluorescence.K1′k+2fast(μm−1s−1)3.7 (±0.3)2-eMant fluorescence.K6(μm)6.0 (±0.9)2-eMant fluorescence.K1′k+2′slow(μm−1s−1)0.15 (±0.0)2-eMant fluorescence.k+5fast(s−1)6.32-eMant fluorescence.K1′k+2′ (μm−1s−1)0.86 (±0.11)2-aPyrene fluorescence.k+5slow(s−1)1.72-eMant fluorescence.1/K1′ (μm)397 (±23)2-aPyrene fluorescence.k−5′/K6′ (μm−1s−1)13 (±1.8)2-eMant fluorescence.k+2′ (s−1)440 (±9.0)2-aPyrene fluorescence.k+5′ (s−1)93 (±5.0)2-eMant fluorescence.K1′k+2′ (μm−1s−1)1.1 (±0.01)2-fLight scattering.k+5′ (s−1)104 (±4.0)2-eMant fluorescence.1/K1′ (μm)334 (±46)2-fLight scattering.K5′K6′ (μm)3.9 (±0.29)2-aPyrene fluorescence.k+2′ (s−1)439 (±23)2-fLight scattering.2-a Pyrene fluorescence.2-b Quenched flow.2-c Single turnover.2-d Pi-BP.2-e Mant fluorescence.2-f Light scattering. Open table in a new tab The rate of dissociation of myo1eIQ and myo1eI-ADP from pyrene-actin was measured by competition with 60-fold excess of unlabeled actin (Fig. 3B). Time courses fit single exponentials with rates k+7 = 0.056 s−1 and k+11 = 0.065 s−1 (Table II). Dissociation equilibrium constants (K7 and K11) calculated from the dissociation and association rates (k+7/k−7 and k+11/k−11) areK7 = 6.2 nm and K11 = 55 nm (Table II). We used the enhancement in fluorescence of the ATP analog mantATP to measure the rate of nucleotide binding. Unlike skeletal muscle myosin-II (32Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence change upon MgATP binding was not detected. The transient increase in mantATP fluorescence was best fit to two exponentials (data not shown). The two exponentials are not the result of the presence of multiple mantATP isomers (33Woodward S.K.A. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) because a two exponential fluorescence increase was also detected when experiments were performed with dmantATP, which is a single-isomer preparation of mantATP. The amplitude of the fast exponential phase is 70–80% of the signal, and its rate is linearly related to the dmantATP concentration (Fig.4A). We assumed a two-step ATP binding reaction, M+ATP⇄K1M(ATP)→k+2M·ATP*REACTION 3 where K1 is a rapid equilibrium and k+2 is a rate-limiting isomerization to the high fluorescence state of dmantATP (ATP*). The apparent second order rate constant for dmantATP binding, given by the slope of the plot of the observed rate versus nucleotide concentration, isK1k2 = 11 ± 0.4 μm−1 s−1 (Fig. 4A). Fits of the slow exponential phase yielded an apparent second order rate constant 0.65 μm−1 s−1(Fig. 4A, inset). It was proposed for skeletal muscle subfragment-1 that this slow rate reports the conformational change that accompanies ATP hydrolysis (k3, Scheme 1 (33Woodward S.K.A. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)). A two-exponential fluorescence increase was also observed in the presence of actin. The amplitude of the fast exponential phase is 40–60% of the signal, and its rate is linearly related to the nucleotide concentration with an apparent second order rate constant ofK1′k2′ = 3.7 ± 0.3 μm−1 s−1 (Fig.4B). The linear fit of the rates does not pass through the origin. The apparent second order rate constant determined from the slow exponential phase is 0.15 μm−1s−1 (Fig. 4B, inset). Pyrene-actin fluorescence was used to monitor the ATP-induced population of the weakly bound states (13Ostap E.M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 32: 1053-1060Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Geeves M.A. Jeffries T.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mixing ATP with pyrene-actomyo1eIQ resulted in an increase in fluorescence (Fig. 5A, upper trace in inset). Fluorescence transients were best fit to single exponentials at all ATP concentrations examined, and the rate of the fluorescence increase was hyperbolically related to the ATP concentration (Fig. 5A). The mechanism of ATP-induced fluorescence enhancement was modeled as shown in Reaction 4, AM+ATP⇄K1′AM(ATP)→k+2′A*M·ATPk+9⇵k−9A*+M·ATPREACTION 4 where K1′ is a rapid equilibrium, k2′ is a rate-limiting isomerization to the high fluorescence A*M·ATP state, and k+9 is the dissociation rate. The maximum rate is k2′ = 440 ± 9.0 s−1 and K1′ = 397 ± 23 μm (Table II). The association rate constant for MgATP binding to actomyo1eIQ obtained from the initial slope (K1′k2′) is 0.86 ± 0.11 μm−1s−1 (Fig.5B) with a y intercept of zero. Light scattering measurements were used to monitor the rate of actomyo1eIQ dissociation by MgATP (Fig. 5A). This measurement is different from the pyrene-actin measurements in that pyrene-actin fluorescence reports the population of the attached and detached M·ATP states (Scheme 1). Mixing MgATP with actomyo1eIQ resulted in a rapid decrease in light scattering (Fig. 5A, lower trace ininset). The time courses follow single exponentials with rates that depend hyperbolically on the MgATP concentration (Fig.5A). Fits to Reaction 4 yielded rate constants (K1′ = 334 ± 46 μm;k+2′ = 439 ± 23 s−1) nearly identical to those obtained with pyrene-actin (Table II). Therefore, the maximum rate of dissociation (k+9) upon ATP binding is limited by k+2′ (Reaction 4). The rate of ATP hydrolysis in the absence of actin (k+3 + k−3; Scheme 1) was measured directly by quenched flow (Fig.6). There is a rapid initial burst of ATP hydrolysis which fits a single exponential with a rate of 108 ± 14 s−1 at 50 μm MgATP. The rate of ATP binding under experimental conditions is expected to be >500 s−1 (Table II), so this measurement is not limited by the rate of nucleotide association. The presence of a phosphate burst indicates that the rate-limiting step occurs after ATP hydrolysis. The amplitude of the phosphate burst is 0.55 Pi/myosin (Fig.6). If we assume that B = K3/(1 + K3) and K3 = (k+3/k−3), thenK3 = 1.2, k+3 = 59 s−1, and k−3 = 49 s−1(Table II). Fluorescently labeled PiBP was used to measure directly the rate of phosphate release (k+4 and k+4′) in sequential mix, single turnover, stopped flow experiments (Fig.7A (30White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 30: 11828-11836Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). Apyrase-treated myo1eIQ (2 μm) was mixed with 1 μm ATP, aged for 400 ms to allow for ATP binding, and mixed with 0–40 μm actin (Fig. 7B). PiBP was included with the myo1eIQ and the actin to prevent transients resulting from phosphate released during the age time or phosphate contamination in the actin. The time course of phosphate release in the absence of actin follows a single exponential with a rate of 1.5 s−1 in KMg0 and KMg50 (Fig. 7A). There is no lag in the phosphate release transients (Fig. 7A, inset), indicating that phosphate release precedes ADP release. Unlike previously characterized myosins (28De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14196-14202Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 30: 11828-11836Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar), actin did not increase the rate of phosphate release (Fig 7B). This result is likely caused by the weak affinity of the M·ADP·Pi state for actin (see “Discussion”). The fluorescence increase of mantADP was used to determine the rate constants for ADP association to myo1eIQ and actomyo1eIQ (Fig.8). In the absence of actin, time courses of fluorescence fit two exponential rates with approximately equal amplitudes. The fast phase was hyperbolically related to the nucleotide concentration (Fig. 8A) and modeled as a two-step binding reaction, M+ADP⇄1/K6M(ADP)→k−5M·ADP∗REACTION 5 where * indicates high mantADP fluorescence. The maximum rate is k−5 = 237 ± 13 s−1and K6 = 6.0 ± 0.9 μm (Table II). The rate of the slow exponential phase shows only a slight nucleotide dependence and plateaus at ∼11 s−1 at >10 μm mantADP (Fig. 8A, inset). The origin of this second exponential is not known, but it may report the population of a second M·ADP state (see “Discussion”). In the presence of actin, time courses of fluorescence were best fit to single exponential rates that were linearly related to the nucleotide concentration (Fig. 9A). The signal to noise ratio of the fluorescence signal limited the range of testable mantADP concentrations, so we were not able to measure the maximum rate of mantADP binding (k−5′). Therefore, the apparent second order rate constant for mantADP binding was obtained by a linear fit to the data assuming the two-step binding model of Reaction 5 (k−5′/K6′ = 13 ± 1.8 μm−1 s−1; Fig.9A). The non-zero y intercept reveals a dissociation rate constant of k+5′ = 93 ± 5 s−1. The rates of mantADP dissociation from myo1eIQ (Fig.8B) and actomyo1eIQ (Fig. 9A, inset) were measured by competition with 250-fold excess of MgATP. Fluorescence time courses of mantADP dissociation fit two-exponential rates of 6.3 and 1.7 s−1 in the absence of actin and a single exponential rate of k+5′ = 104 ± 4 s−1 in the presence of actin (Table II). The rate of MgADP dissociation from actomyo1eIQ is similar to that reported by the y intercept in the mantADP association experiment (Fig. 9A). The affinity of MgADP for actomyo1eIQ was determined by competition experiments in which the ternary pyrene-actomyo1eIQ-ADP complex was mixed with MgATP (Fig.9B). Fluorescence transients fit single exponential rates that had a hyperbolic dependence on the MgADP concentration, suggesting that AM·D and AM states are in rapid equilibrium. Therefore, the dependence of kobs on MgADP concentration is as follows, kobs=k01+[ADP]Kd(Eq. 1) where kobs is the observed dissociation rate, k0 is the d"
https://openalex.org/W2142262231,"p8 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein, which was identified because its expression is strongly activated in response to several stresses. Biochemical and biophysical studies revealed that despite a weak sequence homology p8 is an HMG-I/Y-like protein, suggesting that p8 may be involved in transcription regulation. Results reported here strongly support this hypothesis. Using a pull-down approach, we found that p8 interacts with the general co-activator p300. We also found that, similar to the HMG proteins, p300 was able to acetylate recombinant p8in vitro, although the significance of such modification remains to be determined. Then a screening by the two-hybrid system, using p8 as bait, allowed us to identify the Pax2trans-activation domain-interacting protein (PTIP) as another partner of p8. Transient transfection studies revealed that PTIP is a strong inhibitor of the trans-activation activities of Pax2A and Pax2B on the glucagon gene promoter, which was chosen as a model because it is a target of the Pax2A and Pax2B transcription factors. This effect is completely abolished by co-transfection of p8 in glucagon-producing InRIG9 cells, indicating that p8 binding to PTIP prevents inhibition of the glucagon gene promoter. This was not observed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts that do not express glucagon. Finally, expression of p8 enhances the effect of p300 on Pax2A and Pax2B trans-activation of the glucagon gene promoter. These observations suggest that in glucagon-producing cells p8 is a positive cofactor of the activation of the glucagon gene promoter by Pax2A and Pax2B, both by recruiting the p300 cofactor to increase the Pax2A and Pax2B activities and by binding the Pax2-interacting protein PTIP to suppress its inhibition. p8 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein, which was identified because its expression is strongly activated in response to several stresses.

In vivo, p8 mRNA expression is activated in several tissues in response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (2Jiang Y.F. Vaccaro M.I. Fiedler F. Calvo E.L. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, like other pancreatitis-induced proteins p8 is also constitutively expressed in several tissues (1Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Calvo E.L. Ortiz E.M. Vasseur S. Keim V. Morisset J. Iovanna J.L. J.

Bruland O.S. Fodstad O. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4675-4680PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that expression of the candidate of metastasis 1 (Com 1) protein, which is identical to the human p8 (3Vasseur S. Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Bodeker H. Canepa E. Moreno S. Iovanna J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), could mediate the growth of tumor cells after metastatic establishment in a secondary organ. This suggests that activated expression of p8 in metastatic cells is required for tumor progression. This was recently confirmed by showing that p8-expressing fibroblasts transduced with a retrovirus encoding both the RasV12 and the E1A oncogenes could generate tumors in vivo, whereas p8-deficient fibroblasts could not (6Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia S. Bagnis C. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, p8 is a stress-induced protein critical for tumor development. The deduced protein sequence revealed that p8 contains a canonical bipartite signal for nuclear targeting, suggesting that p8 should be located in the nucleus. Supporting this hypothesis, we detected p8 within the nucleus of COS-7 cells transfected with a p8 expression plasmid, although it was also partly localized to the cytoplasm (3Vasseur S. Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Bodeker H. Canepa E. Moreno S. Iovanna J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of the p8 primary structure suggested that it was a DNA-binding protein (1Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Calvo E.L. Ortiz E.M. Vasseur S. Keim V. Morisset J. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32360-32369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). More recently we performed biochemical and biophysical studies showing that human recombinant p8 was in many aspects very similar to the HMG1-I/Y proteins, although sharing with them only 35% amino acid sequence identity (7Encinar J.A. Mallo G.V. Mizyrycki C. Giono L. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Rico M. Canepa E. Moreno S. Neira J.L. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2742-2751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, despite a weak sequence homology, p8 can be considered an HMG-I/Y-like protein. In addition, we recently found that p8 acts as a co-transcription factor since it is able to enhance the transcription activity of the Smad proteins in response to TGF-β (8Garcia-Montero A. Vasseur S. Giono L. Canepa E. Moreno S. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which p8 could enhance the trans-activation of Smads remains unclear, however. This report describes first attempts to characterize partners of p8 in gene regulation. We found that p8 binds to and is acetylated by p300, and when looking for other partners of p8 by yeast two-hybrid screening we observed strong interaction with the Pax2trans-activation domain-interacting protein (PTIP). Finally, we also demonstrated using the model of the glucagon gene promoter that these interactions are functionally active. The expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) containing the human p8 sequence cloned in itsBamHI-HindIII site was used to generate a fusion protein with an amino-terminal histidine tag to the human p8 sequence. The protein was produced and purified on nickel-agarose resin (Qiagen) as previously reported (7Encinar J.A. Mallo G.V. Mizyrycki C. Giono L. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Rico M. Canepa E. Moreno S. Neira J.L. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2742-2751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was named His6-hp8. An approximate 20-μl bed volume of nickel-agarose bound to His6-hp8 was incubated in 100 μl of pull-down buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin as protease inhibitors) together with 100 μg of HeLa cell extract. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, the nickel-agarose beads were washed five times with 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline before elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and p300 was detected with a specific polyclonal antibody that does not cross-react with cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (N-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation about 5 × 106 COS-7 cells, seeded into 15-cm dishes, were transfected with 5 μg of the pCMVbp300-CHA plasmid (9Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) using the FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested 24 h later and lysed in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin on ice for 30 min. After clearing the lysate containing the p300-CHA hybrid protein, one-half was used for immunoprecipitation with 0.5 μg of anti-hemagglutinin antibody (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 4 h at 4 °C in the presence of a 50-μl bed volume of protein G preincubated in cell lysates from non-transfected cells supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. The remaining half of the lysate was used as a control in which the anti-hemagglutinin antibody was omitted. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and once with 2× TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 89 mm sodium borate, 1 mm EDTA). One-tenth of the material bound to the beads was eluted in SDS-loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot using a specific antibody to p300 (N-15) and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Another tenth was used to test its capacity to acetylate His6-hp8 in vitro. The reaction was performed in TBE, 1 mmdithiothreitol buffer, with 0.1 mg/ml protein substrate (as indicated in each case) and 18 μm [1-14C]acetyl-CoA. The standard assay was performed at 25 °C for 30 min and initiated by adding the protein substrate to the mixture containing the acetyltransferase and acetyl-CoA in the relevant buffer. Histone from calf thymus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as a positive control. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and14C-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH Laboratories) was used according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. Using polymerase chain reaction-based strategies, we subcloned the complete coding sequence of the human p8 (3Vasseur S. Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Bodeker H. Canepa E. Moreno S. Iovanna J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) into the BamHI-SalI site of the pGBT9 vector to generate a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BDhp8). That protein was used as bait to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library constructed in the pACT2 vector to generate fusion products with the GAL4 activation domain. This library was also purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories. Yeast cells were initially selected for growth on −His plates. Of the approximately 1 × 106 transformants screened, 23 grew well on −His plates (colonies of >2 mm). Plasmid DNAs were isolated from each one. To identify false positives and self activators, the plasmids were reintroduced into the original yeast strain expressing no BDhp8. Nine independent clones were obtained and sequenced. The sequence corresponded to the human counterpart of the mouse PTIP (10Lechner M.S. Levitan I. Dressler G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). hPTIP cDNA encoding residues 773–1056 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the SalI restriction site of the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs), fusing the maltose-binding protein (MBP) with the carboxyl-terminal region of the hPTIP. The fusion protein, named MBP-hPTIP, was produced following the manufacturer's recommendations. To test the His6-hp8-hPTIP interaction in vitro, we incubated 1 μg of the purified MBP-hPTIP or MBP (as a control) in the presence of 2 μl (about 2 μg) of the His6-hp8 bound to nickel beads or only free nickel beads (as a control) in 25 μl of a binding buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at room temperature. The nickel beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed five times with the binding buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline prior to elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted material was resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and MBP-hPTIP and MBP proteins were detected by Western blotting with a specific anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs).

A minimum of three independent transfections were performed; each of them was carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Because p8 is a nuclear protein (3Vasseur S. Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Bodeker H.

Canepa E. Moreno S. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we began its functional study by examining a relationship with the general co-activator of transcription, p300. In fact, p300 is coupled to the basal transcription machinery and acts as a general co-activator of several transcription factors (13Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). In vitro pull-down analysis was performed by adding His6-hp8 to HeLa extracts containing p300 and monitoring formation of a p8-p300 complex. As shown in Fig.1, a significant binding of p8 to p300 was indeed found. Because p8 is an HMG-I/Y-related protein and HMG-I/Y is acetylated by p300 (14Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D. Science. 2001; 293: 1054-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we examined whether p8 is also acetylated by p300. We therefore tested the ability of p300 to incorporate radioactive acetate into His6-hp8. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the immunoprecipitated recombinant human p300 efficiently acetylates His6-hp8. The acetylation is specific since bovine serum albumin, which also has a high lysine content, was not acetylated (data not shown). Nucleosomal histones served as positive control. The labeling is enzyme-dependent since reaction mixtures containing [1-14C]acetyl-CoA, but lacking enzyme, failed to incorporate acetate into His6-hp8. We conclude that p8 is specifically acetylated by p300 (Fig. 2). The previous suggestion that the p8 protein is a general co-transcription factor was based on the biochemical and biophysical similarities of p8 with HMG-I/Y proteins and its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner. In that context, one should expect that protein factors bind p8 to confer some specificity to the resulting transcription regulation complex. In order to identify such protein factors, a HeLa cell cDNA library was screened with a yeast two-hybrid system, using the complete coding sequence of human p8 as bait. A cDNA fragment, encoding a protein that specifically interacted with p8 in yeast, was isolated. Comparison of its sequence with sequences in the GenBankTM revealed significant similarities with a previously reported mouse cDNA corresponding to PTIP, a BRCT domain-containing gene that interacts with the transcription factor Pax2 (10Lechner M.S. Levitan I. Dressler G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 283-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region of human PTIP showed 89% identity with the mouse counterpart (Fig. 3). The interaction between human PTIP and p8 observed in yeast was confirmed by in vitro studies using a pull-down analysis with the His6-hp8 and the MBP-hPTIP products (Fig.4). As expected, His6-hp8 strongly interacted with recombinant MBP-hPTIP, but not with MBP alone. PTIP interacts with the Pax2 transcription factor, is expressed ubiquitously, and can bind active chromatin (10Lechner M.S. Levitan I. Dressler G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that PTIP is a cofactor of the regulation of transcription by Pax2. Following our observation that PTIP interacts with the HMG-I/Y-related protein p8, we formulated the hypothesis that the resulting PTIP-p8 complex could regulate the trans-activation activity of Pax2. To check that possibility, we transfected the glucagon-producing InRIG9 cells with: (i) a vector harboring the region between nucleotides −138 and +58 of the glucagon promoter, which contains the Pax2-responsive G1 element (12Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Gauthier B. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32708-32715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) driving the CAT reporter gene and (ii) the expression vectors coding for Pax2A and Pax2B. Pax2A and Pax2B stronglytrans-activated the glucagon promoter in the glucagon-producing cell line InRIG9 (Fig.5, A and B) as well as in the non-islet-derived cell line NIH-3T3 (Fig. 5, C andD) as previously reported (12Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Gauthier B. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32708-32715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of the PTIP expression plasmid in InRIG9 cells inhibitedtrans-activation of the reporter gene by Pax2A or Pax2B to 25 and 30% of the full activity, respectively (Fig. 5, Aand B), confirming that PTIP binds the transcription factor Pax2 to inhibit its trans-activation capacity. A similar observation was made in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 5, C andD). However, when either Pax2A or Pax2B was co-transfected with a p8 expression plasmid into InRIG9 cells the effect of PTIP was completely abolished, indicating that p8 binding to PTIP prevents PTIP inhibition of Pax2 activity (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, the effect of p8 was not observed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 5, C and D), suggesting that p8-mediated inhibition of PTIP activity is cell type-specific. These results support the hypothesis that in some cell types p8 can activate Pax2-dependent genes upon binding to the Pax2 inhibitor PTIP. The results presented above demonstrating association of p300 with p8 led us to test whether p300 could influence regulation by p8 of glucagon gene promoter activity. This possibility was tested using the Pax2 responsive region of the glucagon gene promoter as target of the Pax2A and Pax2B transcription factors. Further transfection with vectors expressing p300 and p8 allowed monitoring of the combined influence of these proteins on the activity of the glucagon gene promoter. As expected (12Ritz-Laser B. Estreicher A. Gauthier B. Philippe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32708-32715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), Pax2A and Pax2B strongly trans-activated the glucagon gene promoter (Fig. 6, A andB). p300 enhanced Pax2 trans-activation activity only weakly, but its co-transfection with p8 significantly increased Pax2 capacity, whereas p8 alone had no significant effect. Similar experiments conducted in non-glucagon-producing NIH3T3 fibroblasts showed that expression of p300 also enhanced the Pax2A and Pax2Btrans-activation activities, but expression of the glucagon promoter remained very low as compared with InRIG9 cells, and co-expression with p8 only led to a small increase (Fig. 6,C and D). Altogether, these observations strongly suggest that in glucagon-producing cells p8 in association with p300 is a co-activator of Pax2. In this context, p300 contributes to the glucagon gene promoter activation (15Hussain M.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28950-28957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We found that the HMG-I/Y-related protein p8 interacts with the general co-activator p300 and that p300 acetylates p8. The relationship between the acetylation of p8 and its transcriptional activity remains to be determined. Then, selection by the two-hybrid system allowed us to identify PTIP, a Pax2-binding protein, as another partner of p8. We could demonstrate that PTIP is a strong inhibitor of the Pax2 trans-activation activity on the glucagon gene promoter. We could also demonstrate that p8 binding to the Pax2 inhibitor PTIP prevents inhibition of the glucagon gene promoter. This was observed in glucagon-producing cells only. We suggest that in glucagon-producing cells p8 recruits the p300 cofactor and binds the Pax2-interacting protein PTIP to suppress its inhibitory activity, resulting in Pax2 activation (Fig.7). This is not the first evidence that p8 can regulate the activity of a transcription factor. We reported previously that p8 interacts with Smad proteins after activation by TGF-β. In fact, fibroblasts derived from homozygous p8 knockouts are partially defective in the Smad signaling of the TGF-β pathway, and this defect is corrected by co-transfection with a p8 mammalian expression vector (8Garcia-Montero A. Vasseur S. Giono L. Canepa E. Moreno S. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Smad activity is also, at least in part, p300-dependent (16Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Varga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which p8 enhances the Smad trans-activation activity is not elucidated; yet, we suggest that p8 contributes to the regulation of the transcription of some genes by recruiting p300, which in turn may act as an adapter protein linking activators to the basal transcription machinery. In the particular case of glucagon-producing cells, the p8-p300 complex would in addition relieve inhibition of transcription by PTIP. We thank Dr. R. Eckner for help and comments."

Accordingly, the stimulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the occupation of these receptors is known to be sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin (1Rollet E. Caon A.C. Roberge C.J.

The steps that follow the activation of the G proteins (presumably members of the Gi subfamily) and link them to the modulation of the activity of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases remain undefined despite the critical importance of this knowledge to the development of a complete understanding of G protein-coupled receptor signaling and of the regulation of the functional responsiveness of human neutrophils. The results of a previous study have provided evidence that the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by chemoattractants in human neutrophils was sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)1inhibitor, wortmannin (20Naccache P.H.

The report of the involvement of Btk in thrombin-stimulated platelets (45Laffargue M. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Ragab A. Tuech J. Missy K. Monnereau L. Blank U. Plantavid M. Payrastre B. Raynal P. Chap H.

The present investigation was initiated to examine the possible involvement of Tec family kinases in the responses of human neutrophils to chemotactic factors. The results obtained demonstrate that several Tec family kinases are expressed in mature blood neutrophils (Tec, Btk, Bmx). Stimulation of human neutrophils by chemotactic factors led to the G protein- and PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of multiple members of the Tec family kinases. These results provide evidence for a novel pathway linking chemotactic factor receptors of the G protein-coupled family to downstream tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling events. Anti-Bmx (N-16), anti-Btk (C-20), and anti-Tec (M-20) and immunizing peptides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Tec (06–561), used for immunoprecipitations, and anti-phosphotyrosine (05–321, clone 4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc (Lake Placid, NY). ATP magnesium salt, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), Me2SO, fMet-Leu-Phe, and wortmannin were from Sigma. The enhanced chemiluminescence reagents used for Western blotting were purchased from DuPont Pharmaceuticals (Missisauga, Ontario, Canada). Dextran T-500, glutathione-Sepharose, and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Ficoll-Paque and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution were from Wisent Canadian Laboratories (St. Bruno, Québec, Canada), and pertussis toxin was from List Biologicals (Campbell, CA). CHAPS was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. SAM68-GST (sc-4249) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Venous blood was collected in isocitrate anticoagulant from healthy adult volunteers, and neutrophils were purified sterilely as described previously (47Gaudry M. Roberge C.J. de Médicis R. Lussier A. Poubelle P.E. Naccache P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Neutrophils at 2 × 107 cells/ml were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.6 mm CaCl2 but no magnesium and pretreated with 1 mm DFP for 10 min at room temperature before any additional manipulation. Neutrophil suspensions (250 μl of 2 × 107 cells/ml) were added to an equal volume of boiling 2× Laemmli sample buffer (1× is 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 8.5% glycerol, 2.5 mmorthovanadate, 10 mm paranitrophenylphosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.025% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 7 min. Samples were then subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Bmx (1/1000), anti-Btk (1/1000), and anti-Tec (1/1000) in Tris-buffered saline/Tween with 2% gelatin. After stimulation, neutrophils were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were lysed by adding cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137.2 mm Nacl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.6% CHAPS, 2 mm orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm PMSF, 1.5 mm DFP) for 3 min on ice. The insoluble material was discarded after centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C during 10 min, and the lysate was harvested. The supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysates were then incubated at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-Tec antibodies for 2 h followed by 1 h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were collected and washed three times with cold lysis buffer. Laemmli sample buffer (2×) was added to the beads, which were boiled for 7 min. Neutrophils (2 × 107 cells/ml) were stimulated for 60 s with 10−7m fMet-Leu-Phe. Tec was then immunoprecipitated as described above. The Tec immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended at 4 °C in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mmMnCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmparanitrophenylphosphate, and 50 μm ATP) and transferred at 37 °C for different times. The reactions were stopped by a quick spin in a microcentrifuge, and the beads were washed twice in cold lysis buffer. Laemmli sample buffer (2×) was added to the beads, which were boiled for 7 min. The samples were then electrophoresed and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blotted with the anti-phosphotyrosine or with the anti-Tec antibodies. This assay was carried out exactly like the in vitro autophosphorylation assay described above except that 0.5 μg of SAM68-GST was added to the kinase buffer. The supernatants of the kinase assays were collected and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer in 1:2 proportions with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed twice and boiled for 7 min in Laemmli sample buffer (2×). The samples were then electrophoresed and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blotted with the anti-phosphotyrosine or with the anti-Tec antibodies. Neutrophils (500 μl at 4 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated or not with 200 nm wortmannin for 10 min or 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin for 2 h. The cell suspensions were prewarmed at 37 °C for 5 min and stimulated with 10−7m fMet-Leu-Phe or an equal volume of diluent (Me2SO) for different times. Stimulations were stopped by sonication for 20 s. One ml of cold KCl-HEPES relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 50 mmHEPES, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2.5 mm PMSF, 1 mmDFP, pH 7.2) was added rapidly. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Unbroken cells and nuclei were discarded, and supernatants were then ultracentrifuged for 45 min at 180,000 × g in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge using a TL-100.4 rotor. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of solubilization buffer (250 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 300 mm NaCl, 2.5% SDS, 0.25 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm orthovanadate). 5 μl of each sample was discarded for protein quantification, and 75 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added to each sample and boiled for 7 min. Proteins were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). 10 μg of each condition was subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. As of yet, the only evidence for the expression in granulocytes of Tec family members is that of the mRNA for Bmx, one member of this family of kinases (48Kaukonen J. Lahtinen I. Laine S. Alitalo K. Palotie A. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 94: 455-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Weil D. Power M.-A. Smith S.I. Li C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4332-4340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig.1 illustrate that Tec, Bmx, and Btk are expressed at the protein level in human peripheral blood neutrophils. These immunoblots indicate that specific staining of proteins of the expected apparent molecular weight was seen with the three antibodies and that this staining was displaced by the appropriate immunizing peptides. It should be noted that two isoforms of Tec were detected with apparent molecular masses of 58 and 66 kDa. Alternatively spliced Tec isoforms of these molecular weights have been described previously (31Yang W.C. Collette Y. Nunes Y. Olive D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). One of the characteristic features of the activation of Tec family tyrosine kinases is their stimulated translocation to membrane fractions, an event that is thought to result from high affinity interactions of their PH domains with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (27Kojima T. Fukuda M. Watanabe Y. Hamazato F. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Okoh M.P. Vihinen M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 50Varnai P. Rother K.I. Balla T. J. Biol.

Saraste M. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We had shown previously that the stimulation of human neutrophils by chemotactic factors was associated with the translocation of p110γ to a crude membrane fraction (24Naccache P.H. Levasseur S. Lachance G. Chakravarti S. Bourgoin S.G. McColl S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23636-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the distribution of Tec family kinases in this fraction was altered upon stimulation of neutrophils by fMet-Leu-Phe. The results of these experiments are illustrated in Fig. 2. The chemotactic factor was found to induce a rapid translocation of the 66-kDa isoform of Tec which was evident within 5 s of stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe. Maximal levels of membrane-associated Tec were reached at 10–15 s post-stimulation (Fig. 2, panel A). It should be noted that the 58-kDa isoform of Tec did not appear to be sensitive to stimulation by fMet-Leu-Phe as its distribution in the membrane fraction did not change upon stimulation. Equivalent translocations of Btk and Bmx were also observed (Fig. 2, panels B and C). Preliminary experiments indicated that interleukin-8 also induced a translocation of Tec, Btk, and Bmx to the membrane fraction (data not shown). The translocation of Tec family kinases to the membrane fraction induced by stimulation by fMet-Leu-Phe was sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin (Fig. 3). Preincubation of the cells with the bacterial toxin decreased to a large extent the stimulated increases in the levels of Tec, Bmx, and Btk that could otherwise be detected in the membrane fractions derived from fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated cells. Another index of the activation of tyrosine kinases is their level ofin situ tyrosine phosphorylation. The latter can be increased upon stimulation due to autophosphorylation events or secondarily to transphosphorylation by other tyrosine kinases (31Yang W.C. Collette Y. Nunes Y. Olive D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 4, panel A, indicate that stimulation of human neutrophils by fMet-Leu-Phe led to the in situ phosphorylation of Tec. This phosphorylation was detected within 5–15 s of the addition of fMet-Leu-Phe and was maintained for the next 60 s. A similar increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk was also observed (results not shown). The inability of the available anti-Bmx antibodies to precipitate Bmx (under native or denaturing conditions) prevented us from determining whether the latter was similarly affected upon the stimulation of the cells (data not shown). We examined next whether the translocation of Tec and the stimulation of its in situ levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were associated with an increase in kinase activity. Neutrophils were stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe for 60 s and lysed under native conditions as described under “Materials and Methods,” and Tec was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in kinase buffer, and the kinase activity of Tec was monitored by its ability to phosphorylate itself (Fig. 4, panel B) or an exogenous substrate, SAM68-GST (Fig. 4, panel C). The latter was chosen as it has previously been shown to associate with members of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases (52Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 53Guinamard R. Fougereau M. Seckinger P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1997; 45: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments, illustrated in Fig. 4, panels B and C, show that stimulation of neutrophils by fMet-Leu-Phe increased the activity of Tec toward itself as well as toward SAM68-GST as evidenced by a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. The pertussis toxin sensitivity of the stimulated translocation of Tec, Btk, and Bmx indicated that the recruitment of these kinases was secondary to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. To test whether this response was up- or downstream of the activation of PI 3-kinases, we examined next whether it was affected by preincubation of the cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. In these experiments, neutrophils were pretreated for 10 min with 200 nm wortmannin and then stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe. The effects of wortmannin on the stimulated translocation of Tec are illustrated in Fig. 5, panel A. The results of these experiments demonstrate that wortmannin inhibited to a significant extent the ability of the chemotactic factor to increase the levels of the 66-kDa isoform of Tec associated with membranes. Similar results were obtained with Btk and Bmx (data not shown). Wortmannin also inhibited the increased in situ phosphorylation of Tec as well as thein vitro activity of Tec toward itself and SAM68-GST observed following the addition of fMet-Leu-Phe to neutrophils (Fig. 5, panels B–D, respectively). Tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascades play critical roles in the initiation and regulation of the activation of various cell types including that of peripheral blood human neutrophils. The results of the present investigation provide direct evidence for a participation of Tec family kinases in the initial events leading to the activation of the tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways in human neutrophils. The recruitment and activation of the Tec kinases was also found to be secondary to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins and PI 3-kinases. Various lines of evidence have accumulated during the last decade in support of the role of the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade in the initiation of the functional responsiveness of human neutrophils (see references in the introduction). These include the demonstration of the presence and activation of several classes of tyrosine kinases (54Welch H. Mauran C. Maridonneau-Parini I.I. Methods (Orlando). 1996; 9: 607-618Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and phosphatases (55Kraft A.S. Berkow R.L. Blood. 1987; 70: 356-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) upon the stimulation of neutrophils by a variety of agonists. This results in a transient increase in the overall level of tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells due to the phosphorylation of a large number of substrates, only some of which have been identified. Additional support for the functional relevance of these biochemical responses was derived from the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which dramatically affect several critical neutrophil responses such as adhesion, chemotaxis, superoxide generation, and phagocytosis. Finally, knock-out cell lines have provided further confirmation of the role of various tyrosine kinases in the regulation of neutrophil responsiveness in addition to identifying relevant kinase families and establishing the redundant nature of several of these kinases, and in particular, the members of the Src family. Neutrophil function is critically dependent on their migration to the proper sites (infection, injury). This directed locomotion is dictated by the generation of gradients of a series of chemotactic factors. The latter interact for the most part with members of the G protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane-spanning surface receptors. All of the known neutrophil chemotactic factors stimulate an increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells (1Rollet E. Caon A.C. Roberge C.J. Liao N.W. Malawista S.E. McColl S.R. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 353-363PubMed Google Scholar). This response is known to be mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins as it is inhibited by pertussis toxin. On the other hand, little else is known about the steps that couple the relevant G protein to the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade. Possible clues as to one such coupling mechanism were provided by the observations that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin significantly decreased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe (20Naccache P.H. Caon A.C. Gilbert C. Gaudry M. Roberge C.J. Poubelle P.E. Bourgoin S. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 19-23PubMed Google Scholar), by the recent cloning and characterization of a G protein-linked PI 3-kinase isoform (p110γ) (22Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The present data indicate that several members of the Tec family are expressed in human neutrophils. Immunoblotting revealed the presence of Btk, Bmx, and two isoforms of Tec. Preliminary experiments indicated that Rlk/Txk was not expressed in human neutrophils (data not shown). The presence of Itk in human neutrophils was not investigated. Several indices of activation of Tec kinases by fMet-Leu-Phe were obtained. These include the stimulated translocation to a membrane fraction of all but the low molecular weight Tec isoform (which was constitutively present to a significant extent in this fraction) and the increasedin situ levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitro kinase activity of the high molecular weight isoform of Tec and of Btk (data not shown). Taken together, these data provide strong and direct evidence for an involvement of these kinases in the responses of human neutrophils to chemotactic factors. Of particular relevance to the specific hypothesis tested in this study, wortmannin inhibited all three indices of activation of Tec kinases by fMet-Leu-Phe. These data suggest that the recruitment and stimulation of Tec kinases by fMet-Leu-Phe was secondary to the activation of PI 3-kinases. In view of the facts that Tec kinases are unique among tyrosine kinases in that they contain a PH domain and that the PH domains of Btk (28Okoh M.P. Vihinen M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 50Varnai P. Rother K.I. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and Tec (56Shirai T. Tanaka K. Terada Y. Sawada T. Shirai R. Hashimoto Y. Nagata S. Iwamatsu A.

Acta. 1998; 1402: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) exhibit a high degree of specificity toward PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, it is tempting to speculate that the membrane recruitment of the Tec kinases stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe is a consequence of the activation of PI 3-kinase(s) and the formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. It is noteworthy in this respect to point out that stimulation of human neutrophils causes a very rapid formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (25Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Furthermore, data were recently obtained indicating that, at least within the time frame examined in the present study (i.e. the first 15 s), p110γ was the predominant PI 3-kinase species activated by fMet-Leu-Phe (24Naccache P.H. Levasseur S. Lachance G. Chakravarti S. Bourgoin S.G. McColl S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23636-23641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the activation of p110γ, of the formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, and of the Tec kinases are strikingly similar, and all three of these are close to maximal within 5–10 s of the addition of chemotactic factors. Although not a proof that a direct causal relationship exists between the activation of p110γ and of Tec kinases, these data are nevertheless consistent with such an interpretation. In the absence of specific inhibitors of the different isoforms of PI 3-kinases, additional direct support for this hypothesis is likely to have to rely on the use of dominant negative mutants of the individual PI 3-kinases, a task that is particularly difficult in the terminally differentiated human neutrophils. The above data are consistent with the previously reported inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by PI 3-kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002 (57Siddiqui R.A. English D. Biochim. Biophys.

They suggest that these findings may be accommodated by a model in which Tec kinases play a role downstream from the activation of p110γ. In summary then, the results of the present data provided direct evidence for an involvement of Tec family tyrosine kinases in the responses of human neutrophils to chemotactic factors. The recruitment and activation of Tec kinases was found to be dependent on PI 3-kinase activity. These results shed new light on the link between the activation of G protein-coupled receptors to the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways, a poorly understood element of cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W1980870185,"The Janus-faced atracotoxins (J-ACTXs) are a family of insect-specific excitatory neurotoxins isolated from the venom of Australian funnel web spiders. In addition to a strikingly asymmetric distribution of charged residues, from which their name is derived, these toxins contain an extremely rare vicinal disulfide bond. To shed light on the mechanism of action of these toxins and to enhance their utility as lead compounds for insecticide development, we developed a recombinant expression system for the prototypic family member, J-ACTX-Hv1c, and mapped the key functional residues using site-directed mutagenesis. An alanine scan using a panel of 24 mutants provided the first complete map of the bioactive surface of a spider toxin and revealed that the entire J-ACTX-Hv1c pharmacophore is restricted to seven residues that form a bipartite surface patch on one face of the toxin. However, the primary pharmacophore, or hot spot, is formed by just five residues (Arg8, Pro9, Tyr31, and the Cys13-Cys14 vicinal disulfide). The Arg8–Tyr31 diad in J-ACTX-Hv1c superimposes closely on the Lys–(Tyr/Phe) diad that is spatially conserved across a range of structurally dissimilar K+channel blockers, which leads us to speculate that the J-ACTXs might target an invertebrate K+ channel. The Janus-faced atracotoxins (J-ACTXs) are a family of insect-specific excitatory neurotoxins isolated from the venom of Australian funnel web spiders.

The segment between amino acids 39 and 46 appears to be critical for species-specific compatibility. Amino acid substitutions in this region were tested that caused a reduction of activity of the hamster protein or converted the inactive human protein into a partially active one. Such mutations could be useful in making mice with partial complex I activity as models for mitochondrial diseases. Their potential as dominant negative mutants was explored. More deleterious mutations in theNDUFA1 gene were also characterized. A conservative substitution, R50K, or a short C-terminal deletion makes the protein completely inactive. In the absence of MWFE, no high molecular weight complex was detectable by Blue Native-gel electrophoresis.

The integral membrane subcomplex includes the mitochondrial peptides (ND1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, 5, and 6) and at least 10 nuclear encoded proteins (in higher organisms). A second peripheral domain that may be further fractionated by mild dissociation conditions extends into the mitochondrial matrix. It includes the active site for the substrate NADH, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN), as the hydride acceptor, and several of the non-heme iron sulfur centers (9Dupuis A. Prieur I. Lunardi J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These two subcomplexes are connected by a narrower neck or hinge region (20Grigorieff N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Functionally the subdomain in the matrix is an NADH dehydrogenase, and the connecting fragment is related to multisubunit hydrogenases (8Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Certain combinations of detergents and fractionation techniques appear to cleave the complex into three subcomplexes that may reflect this functional differentiation. There are indications from work inNeurospora crassa that subcomplexes appear to be assembled independently in the matrix and in the inner membrane, respectively, until they are joined to form the complete functional complex (10Schulte U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). From a comparison of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic peptides, ∼29 proteins in the mitochondrial complex have been described as “accessory proteins” with functions yet to be defined (10Schulte U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). They may assist in the assembly of the complex, contribute to its stability, have some role in regulation of activity, and may even carry out biochemical functions such as the acyl carrier protein (22Walker J.E. Arizmendi J.M. Dupuis A. Fearnley I.M. Finel M. Medd S.M. Pilkington S.J. Runswick M.J. Skehel J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1051-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A collection of respiration-deficient Chinese hamster mutant cell lines has been described by our laboratory, including at least three complementation groups of cells with defects in complex I (23Soderberg K. Mascarello J.T. Breen G.A.M. Scheffler I.E. Somatic Cell Genet. 1979; 5: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Breen G.A.M. Scheffler I.E. Somatic Cell Genet. 1979; 5: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All the mutations identified by us were in nuclear genes, and they were all recessive in intra-species hybrids. The mutant CCL16-B2 has recently been shown to be “complemented” by the matrix NADH dehydrogenase of yeast, a single peptide encoded by the NDI1 gene (25Seo B.B. Kitajima-Ihara T. Chan E.K.L. Scheffler I.E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9167-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These experiments established that the complex I defect is the only defect in this mutant. Subsequently it was shown that the hamsterNDUFA1 cDNA complements the mutation (26Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Genomics. 1996; 37: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is a small gene (∼5 kb) with two introns (1.5 and 3 kb) encoding a peptide of 70 amino acids, the MWFE protein. This protein is imported into mitochondria and assembled in complex I without requiring proteolytic processing (22Walker J.E. Arizmendi J.M. Dupuis A. Fearnley I.M. Finel M. Medd S.M. Pilkington S.J. Runswick M.J. Skehel J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1051-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is listed among the ∼29 accessory proteins for which no function has been established so far. Our results had shown that the MWFE protein is essential for a functional complex I in mammalian mitochondria. The growing interest in complex I deficiencies related to human mitochondrial diseases (28Schapira A.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Whereas severe mutations in mitochondrial structural genes can be tolerated in heteroplasmic patients, nuclear gene mutations in patients must be missense mutations causing a partial complex I deficiency. To model complex I deficiencies, for example in the mouse, nuclear genes and specific mutations must be identified that affect complex I activity. In the present communication we have characterized a series of such mutations in the NDUFA1 gene. Complementation of the hamster null mutant CCL16-B2 with such mutant alleles restores partial complex I activity. The parental Chinese hamster cell lines and respiration-deficient mutants (res−) derived from them have been described (see Ref. 35Scheffler I.E. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Co., London1986: 77-109Crossref Google Scholar for a review and Ref. 36Au H.C. Scheffler I.E. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 27-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 mg/ml glucose (DME1-Glu), 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, gentamycin, and fungizone. Under these conditions even the respiration-deficient cell lines grow normally. To distinguish res− from res+ cell lines, the same medium was used with glucose replaced by 1 mg/ml galactose. It is referred to as DME-Gal (37Ditta G.S. Soderberg K. Scheffler I.E. Somatic Cell Genet. 1976; 2: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mouse cell lines (3A-20-4, 4A) with defective ND5 and ND6 mitochondrial genes, respectively, were obtained from Dr. A. Chomyn (18Chomyn A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by trypsinization after one wash with TD buffer (0.3% Tris, 0.8% NaCl, 0.038% KCl, 0.025% Na2HPO4·12H2O, brought to pH 7.4 with HCl). The human NDUFA1 gene was originally cloned and characterized by Zhuchenko et al.(27Zhuchenko O. Wehnert M. Bailey J. Sun Z.S. Lee C.C. Genomics. 1996; 37: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The bovine and mouse sequences had also been published. This has permitted us to clone the corresponding cDNAs from hamster (26Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), rat, and several other primates by an approach based on reverse transcriptase-PCR using conserved oligonucleotide sequences (26Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Crude RNA extracts from fibroblasts of lemur, chimpanzee, and gorilla were obtained from Dr. Oliver Ryder at the San Diego Zoo. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) by T-A overhang cloning. The nucleotide sequence was determined by a multiplex dideoxy chain termination method (University of California, San Diego, Cancer Center). To determine the nature of mutations in cell lines V79-G20 and V79-G14, the NDUFA1 cDNAs were cloned as described above. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using a “megaprimer” PCR method (39Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Science. 1989; 244: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 40Moser S. Schlatter S. Fux C. Rimann M. Bailey J.E. Fussenegger M. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis primers used are as follows: A42, 5′-CACTGGTAACCAAGGCGACCAACT-3′; A41/42, 5′-ACCACTGGTAACCAAAGCGACCAACTCT-3′; A40/44/46, 5′-TTTCCATCAAACTCCAGTGGTAACGAAGGTGACCAACTCT-3′; and U41/42, 5′-CCAGTGATACCGAAGATGAGCAACCCTTTT-3′. The “A” series represent mutations at the corresponding positions in the hamster protein, and the “U” series represent mutations at the indicated positions in the human protein. After cloning into the expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the mutations in the cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing. The A40/44/46 primer yielded only the mutations at positions 40 and 44. As an alternative, a pTRIDENT14 vector ((40); Cistronics Cell Technology GmbH, Zurich, Switzerland) with an EF1α promoter was modified with a neomycin cassette as the third cistron. The neoR gene from the pIRESneo vector (CLONTECH) in anSspI-SmaI fragment (3250 bp) was inserted into the SspI-SwaI fragment from the pTRIDENT-14 vector. The resulting construct was designated as pTRIDENT14-neo vector. The MWFE coding sequences were cloned into the first cistron site, leaving two internal ribosome entry sites between theNDUFA1 and neomycin coding sequences. A PCR-based approach was used to tag the MWFE protein at the C terminus with the HA epitope. The primers used are as follows: HaNDF1 (with EcoRI site), 5′-CCGgaattcAACGGTGCGGAGATG-3′; MWFE.HaR1 (withBglII site), 5′-CAagatctCTAGGATCCGGCGTAGTCAGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTAACTAGTGTCAATGTTCTCCAAGCCCC-3′; and MWFE.HaR2 (with BglII site), 5′-CAagatctTTAGGATCCGGCGTAGTCAGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTAACTGTCAATGTTCTCCAAGCCCTT-3′. The various normal and mutant NDUFA1 cDNAs were PCR-amplified using HaNDF1 and MWFE.HaR1 (for hamster) or MWFE.HaR2 (for mouse and human) and cloned into pTRIDENT14-neo using the uniqueEcoRI site. EcoRI-BglII fragments from PCR were ligated into EcoRI-digested and calf intestinal phosphatase-treated pTRIDENT14-neo for the first linkage; after filling in the ends, blunt ends were ligated to close the circle. The positive clones were screened using SpeI digestion, and the final constructs were verified by sequencing. Northern analysis was performed as described, using a hamsterNDUFA1 cDNA probe (26Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A probe for citrate synthase mRNA was made by reverse transcriptase-PCR with oligonucleotide primers CS.F1 (5′-ATGGCTTTACTTACTGCGGC-3′) and CS.R1 (5′-CACATGGGAAGGCAGAGCTG-3′) which amplify a 453-bp human cDNA beginning with the ATG start codon. The cells were transfected by incubating ∼1–4 × 106 cells per plate with 10 μg of plasmid and polyethyleneimine as carrier as described (41Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5637) Google Scholar). After a 48-h incubation in DME-Glu, G418 (Calbiochem) was added to some plates (selection for neo resistance), and in others the medium was changed to DME-Gal for a direct selection of the res+ phenotype as described (37Ditta G.S. Soderberg K. Scheffler I.E. Somatic Cell Genet. 1976; 2: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The G418-resistant colonies were marked on the plate after about 2 weeks and tested for their res−/res+ phenotype by exposure to DME-Gal (23Soderberg K. Mascarello J.T. Breen G.A.M. Scheffler I.E. Somatic Cell Genet. 1979; 5: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The polycistronic constructs were transfected into cells using SuperFect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The transfection mixture for CCL16-B2 (res−) cells constituted 0.5 μg of DNA and 5 μl of SuperFect; for CCL16-B1 (res+) cells it was 2 μg of DNA and 10 μl of SuperFect. The respiratory chain activities of various cells were measured as described (25Seo B.B. Kitajima-Ihara T. Chan E.K.L. Scheffler I.E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9167-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by trypsinization, collected by centrifugation (350 × g), and resuspended in 1× HSM buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.1, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmMgCl2) at density 2 × 107/ml. The cells were treated with 100 μg/ml digitonin until more than 90% of the cells are stained by trypan blue. After ∼5 min of digitonin treatment at 4 °C, the cell suspension was diluted 10-fold with HSM buffer, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Subsequently, cells were washed once with the same medium and resuspended at 3 × 107 cells/ml. The total protein content was measured by Bradford microassay, and ∼5–6 mg of cell suspension was used per assay. Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically in a 2.2-ml metabolic chamber with a water jacket maintained at 37 °C by using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Substrates, inhibitors, etc. could be added via a capillary opening using microsyringes as described previously (26Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Respiratory activity in 2,4-dinitrophenoluncoupled mitochondria (3–4 mg/assay) was measured essentially as above. Mitochondria were isolated from cells essentially according to Trounce et al. (42Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial fractions were prepared as follows. Approximately 1 × 109 cells (CCL16-B1, CCL16-B2, and NDUAF1-transfected cells) were washed twice with TD buffer and harvested by trypsinization. The pellets were suspended in 5 ml of SM buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA) and homogenized using a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer (30–35 up/down strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 625 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C in order to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 0.1 ml of the SM buffer. This fraction is designated as the mitochondrial fraction. Cells were grown and harvested as above. The lysis of cells was carried out in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture P8340 from Sigma) by 3 cycles of freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen and 3 bursts of sonication. Protein samples (between 50 and 100 mg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (0.45 μm) or polyvinylidene difluoride (0.1 μm) membranes. Anti-MWFE and anti-ERK2 were used at 1:5000 dilution, and the other antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse) were used at 1:5000 dilution, and signals on the immunoblots were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL+Plus from Amersham Biosciences). The antibody against the MWFE protein was generated by immunizing rabbits with two synthetic peptides corresponding to two major segments of the hydrophilic domain of the protein (amino acids 29–40 and 59–70; see Fig. 1A). Affinity-purified antibodies were prepared by a commercial manufacturer (HTI BioProducts, Inc. Ramona, CA). Antibodies specific to bovine complex I subunits (23 (TYKY) and 51 kDa) were generous gifts from Drs. Y. Hatefi and T. Yagi (The Scripps Research Institute) (1Yagi T. Yano T., Di Bernardo S.

Capaldi (Institute of Molecular Biology, Eugene, OR) generously provided mouse monoclonal antibodies against the 39- and 30-kDa subunits of complex I (45Triepels R.H. Hanson B.J. Van den Heuvel L.P.

David (Division of Biology, University of California, San Diego) generously gave anti-ERK2 antibody. Sources of other antibodies were as follows: anti-porin from Calbiochem, anti-cytc from BD PharMingen, anti-HA from Covance Babco, and anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Bio-Rad and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. Blue native-gel electrophoresis of mitochondrial respiratory complexes was performed as described by Schagger (46Schagger H. Pon L.A. Schon E.A. Mitochondria. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 231-244Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pellets equivalent to 400 μg of protein were solubilized with 800 μg of dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Sigma) in 5 mm6-aminohexanoic acid, 50 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.0, and 10% glycerol. To the solubilized samples Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Serva) was added at a dye/detergent ratio of 1:5 g/g. A 3.5–13% acrylamide gradient gel was used for electrophoresis. The histochemical assays on the BN-PAGE gels were performed according to Dabbeni-Sala et al. (47Dabbeni-Sala F., Di Santo S. Franceschini D. Skaper S.D. Giusti P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) by incubating the gel slices with 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml NADH, and 2.5 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) for complex I. Complex V (ATPase) activity was measured by incubating the gel slices overnight in 35 mm Tris, 270 mm glycine, pH 7.8, 14 mm MgSO4, 0.2% Pb(NO3)2, and 8 mm ATP at room temperature. The transfection reagents were polyethyleneimine from Sigma and SuperFect from Qiagen (Germany). All other reagents were of the highest grade available. The MWFE protein from diverse mammalian species, from other vertebrates (Xenopus laevis), and even from plants (rice) is highly conserved (Fig. 1A). In all the species so far examined, the protein is precisely 70 residues long, with two distinct domains. A predicted transmembrane region consisting of the first ∼24 amino acids is followed by a highly charged domain of ∼45 amino acids. Because there is no further processing (22Walker J.E. Arizmendi J.M. Dupuis A. Fearnley I.M. Finel M. Medd S.M. Pilkington S.J. Runswick M.J. Skehel J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1051-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 48Walker J.E.

The negative charge at position 4 is unusual; it is also highly conserved. The orientation of the protein in the membrane has not been firmly established, but preliminary results suggest that the hydrophilic domain of the MWFE protein extends into the intermembrane space. Our previous studies have shown that human NDUFA1 cDNA does not complement the mutation in the hamster gene despite the high degree of sequence conservation in the protein (26Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). When additional primate and rodent sequences were determined and compared, significant differences between amino acids 39 and 46 were found to distinguish primates from rodents. Most notable is the difference in the spacing of the two positive charges in this segment; they are separated by one amino acid in the hamster and by three amino acids in primates. The mouse MWFE protein is missing a positive side chain in this region but mouse cDNA could complement the hamster mutation at a slightly lower efficiency than hamster cDNA (26Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). Differences in almost all other positions represent highly conservative amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic domain. Several mutant alleles of the NDUFA1 gene were isolated during the original mutant selection in tissue culture (CCL16-B2, V79-G14, V79-G20, see Fig. 1B) (37Ditta G.S. Soderberg K. Scheffler I.E. Somatic Cell Genet. 1976; 2: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The CCL16-B2 mutant has been described previously; a large internal deletion in theNDUFA1 gene causes the resulting protein to be severely truncated and altered by frame shifting (26Au H.C. Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Scheffler I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4354-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Another mutant allele in the same complementation group was characterized from the mutant cell line V79-G14. Sequencing of several NDUFA1 cDNAs obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed a small insertion in the last exon; the insertion leads to the formation of a MWFE protein that is slightly shorter (66 amino acids), and the last two amino acids are different from the original sequence. In the V79-G20 mutant a point mutation converted an arginine to a lysine codon. This R50K mutation was originally found in an independently isolated clone of respiration-deficient mutants, V79-G20, that could be complemented with wild type NDUFA1 cDNA. The severe loss of activity from this very conservative amino acid substitution was surprising, but the result was confirmed by making the same mutation in wild type cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. It should be noted that the arginine at position 50 is found in all the proteins sequenced so far, including plants and mammals. The synthetic V79-G20 cDNA also failed to co"
https://openalex.org/W2024459080,"We have previously demonstrated that the biosynthesis of the C7-cyclitol, called valienol (or valienamine), of the α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose starts from the cyclization of sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (Stratmann, A., Mahmud, T., Lee, S., Distler, J., Floss, H. G., and Piepersberg, W. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 10889–10896). Synthesis of the intermediate 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone is catalyzed by the cyclase AcbC encoded in the biosynthetic (acb) gene cluster of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110. The acbCgene lies in a possible transcription unit, acbKLMNOC, cluster encompassing putative biosynthetic genes for cyclitol conversion. All genes were heterologously expressed in strains ofStreptomyces lividans 66 strains 1326, TK23, and TK64. The AcbK protein was identified as the acarbose 7-kinase, which had been described earlier (Drepper, A., and Pape, H. (1996) J. Antibiot. (Tokyo) 49, 664–668). The multistep conversion of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone to the final cyclitol moiety was studied by testing enzymatic mechanisms such as dehydration, reduction, epimerization, and phosphorylation. Thus, a phosphotransferase activity was identified modifying 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone by ATP-dependent phosphorylation. This activity could be attributed to the AcbM protein by verifying this activity inS. lividans strain TK64/pCW4123M, expressing His-tagged AcbM. The His-tagged AcbM protein was purified and subsequently characterized as a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 7-kinase, presumably catalyzing the first enzyme reaction in the biosynthetic route, leading to an activated form of the intermediate 1-epi-valienol. The AcbK protein could not catalyze the same reaction nor convert any of the other C7-cyclitol monomers tested. The 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate was further converted by the AcbO protein to another isomeric and phosphorylated intermediate, which was likely to be the 2-epimer 5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate. The products of both enzyme reactions were characterized by mass spectrometric methods. The product of the AcbM-catalyzed reaction, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate, was purified on a preparative scale and identified by NMR spectroscopy. A biosynthetic pathway for the pseudodisaccharidic acarviosyl moiety of acarbose is proposed on the basis of these data. We have previously demonstrated that the biosynthesis of the C7-cyclitol, called valienol (or valienamine), of the α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose starts from the cyclization of sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate to 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (Stratmann, A., Mahmud, T., Lee, S., Distler, J., Floss, H.

A biosynthetic pathway for the pseudodisaccharidic acarviosyl moiety of acarbose is proposed on the basis of these data. The α-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose (part of the amylostatin complex) (Fig. 1), produced by strains of the genera Actinoplanes and Streptomyces, is a member of an unusual group of bacterial (mainly actinomycete) secondary metabolites, all of which inhibit various α-glucosidases, especially in the intestine (1Truscheit E.

Rossmoore H.W. Novel Microbial Products for Medicine and Agriculture. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1989: 109-116Google Scholar). Acarbose is produced industrially using developed strains of Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110. It is predominantly used in the treatment of diabetes patients, enabling them to better utilize starch- or sucrose-containing diets by slowing down the intestinal release of α-d-glucose. The pseudotetrasaccharide acarbose consists of an unsaturated cyclitol (valienol), a 4-amino-4,6-dideoxyglucose, and maltose. The valienol and 4-amino-4,6-dideoxyglucose are linked via an amino bridge mimicking anN-glycosidic bond. This acarviosyl moiety is primarily responsible for the inhibitory effect on α-glucosidases. Biosynthetically, these compounds resemble aminoglycoside antibiotics (3Piepersberg W. Distler J. Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Biotechnology: Products of Secondary Metabolism. 2nd Ed. 7. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1997: 397-488Google Scholar, 4Piepersberg W. Strohl W.R. Biotechnology of Antibiotics. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 81-163Google Scholar). Dependent on the carbon sources in the fermentation medium, Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 produces also higher homologs of acarbose, which differ in the numbers of glucose residues that are linked to the reducing and nonreducing end of the acarviosyl moiety (Fig. 1). The C7-aminocyclitol units are considered to be similar to other common structural motifs observed in bacterial secondary metabolites (4Piepersberg W. Strohl W.R. Biotechnology of Antibiotics. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 81-163Google Scholar). The transition from primary to secondary metabolism in the cyclitol pathway in Actinoplanes sp. SE50/110 is catalyzed by the AcbC protein. The acbC gene was expressed heterologously in Streptomyces lividans employing the same reaction conditions as used in in vitro studies on dehydroshikimate synthase (dehydroquinate synthase, AroB) proteins. Its product was shown to be a C7-cyclitol synthase usingsedo-heptulose 7-phosphate as substrate for the production of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (5Stratmann A. Mahmud T. Lee S. Distler J. Floss H.G.

Until now, no other intermediate for the biosynthesis of acarbose has been identified. The trehalase inhibitor validamycin A (cf. Fig.1 B) is an antifungal antibiotic used as a crop protectant. Validamycins are produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus ssp.limoneus and consist of two similar C7-cyclitol units, one belonging to the valienol family (valienamine) and the other to a saturated 6-hydroxy derivative thereof (called validamine). In the biosynthetic pathway for validamycin, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone has also been identified as the first precursor for these two cyclitol units. In this pathway, the feeding of various other potential precursors had led to the identification of some intermediates, including 5-epi-valiolone, valienone, and valienamine (cf.Fig. 1) (6Dong H. Mahmud T. Tornus I. Lee S. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2733-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Mahmud T., Xu, J. Choi Y.U. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 5066-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, similar feeding experiments revealed 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone to be the only precursor that was incorporated into acarbose (8Mahmud T. Tornus I. Engelkrout E. Wolf E., Uy, C. Floss H.G. Lee S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 6973-6983Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, fundamental differences in the two pathways leading to the very similar end products are likely to exist. In this study, we show that, during the biosynthesis of acarbose inActinoplanes sp. SE50/110, the cyclitol precursor 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone is phosphorylated, forming the intermediate 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate, by the enzyme AcbM as a first step in its conversion to the valienol moiety. Beyond this, we found that AcbO catalyzed the next conversion step, leading to an isomeric phosphorylated substance with the same molecular mass, most likely the epimerization product of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate to 5-epi-valiolone 7-phosphate. These findings, together with the genetic record from the acb gene cluster, provided evidence for the postulate of a new biosynthetic pathway for the acarviosyl moiety of acarbose, resembling those for activation (by phosphorylation and subsequent nucleotidylation) and modification of hexoses to be incorporated into oligo- or polysaccharides by glycosyl transfer (3Piepersberg W.

Microbiol. 1994; 48: 223-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The fact of 7-O-phosphorylation in addition points to the need of an inactivating protection group already in the cyclitol intermediates and the oligosaccharidic end product(s) inside the producing cell. This requirement is underlined by the existence of a second 7-phosphotransferase gene, acbK, which is localized in the same transcription unit together with theacbM and other putative cyclitol biosynthetic genes and encodes a cytoplasmic acarbose 7-kinase. AcbK introduces a phosphate group into the same position of the cyclitol moiety of the oligosaccharidic end product, but does not use monomeric cyclitol precursors such as 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone as substrates. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The following strains ofS. lividans 66 were used as the hosts in expression experiments for the heterologous production of Acb proteins: strain TK64 for AcbL, AcbM, and AcbO; strain TK23 for AcbK and AcbN; and strain 1326 for AcbC. The recombinant strains were routinely cultured at 28 °C on soya fluor-mannitol-agar (SMA) agar plates (10Distler J. Klier K. Piendl W. Werbitzki O. Böck A. Kresze G. Piepersberg W. FEMS Microbiol.

The general strategy for cloning theacbKLMNO genes into the expression vectors indicated in Table I with an N-terminal His-tagged fusion peptide was as follows. The genes were first amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA ofActinoplanes sp. SE50/110 using the primers listed in TableII. The PCR products were then cut by the restriction enzymes for which recognition sites were designed in the respective primer pairs (see Table II) and subsequently introduced by ligation into cut standard vectors (pUC18 or pBluescript II KS), and the inserts were inserted into pET16bP to create reading frames with N-terminal His-tagged fusions. The resulting plasmids were transformed and propagated in E. coli DH5α. The correctness of the nucleotide sequences of the inserts was controlled by DNA sequencing. The resulting His-tagged fusion cassettes were cut out by the enzyme pairs and further ligated to the streptomycete expression vectors given in Table I for later transformation and expression in S. lividans 66 strains. Automated DNA sequencing was carried out on an A.L.F.-Express machine (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) using the Thermosequenase DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and standard primers.Table IIPrimers for amplification of the acb genes investigatedPrimerNucleotide sequence2-aIntroduced recognition sites for restriction endonucleases are underlined.TargetAcbK15′-CAAGGAGACATATGTCGGAGCAC-3′ acbKstartAcbK25′-GTGGTGAGATCTTCGCCCAGT-3′ acbKstop2775M15′-GCCGGCCATATGAAGCGGC-3′ acbMstartpMJM1E5′-CGGTGCCGGTACCACGATCGCGC-3′ acbMstop2775L15′-TTGGTCGGCATATGAGCCGG-3′ acbLstartpMJL.1E5′-GTACGGAATTCGTCCACCGCCAC-3′ acbLstop2775N15′-AGAGGATCACATATGAGCGGGACTC-3′ acbNstartpMJN.1E5′-GAGCTGGATCCCGTC-3′ acbNstop2775O15′-GGTGCGCATATGACCTGCCG-3′ acbOstartpMJO.1E5′-TACCGTCTCGACAGATCTCAGTCAGCTTCCT-3′ acbOstop2-a Introduced recognition sites for restriction endonucleases are underlined. Open table in a new tab Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.1 volume of disruption buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6), and disrupted by sonication (2–3 min at 60 watts). Cell-free extracts were obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The extracts were dialyzed against 5 liters of disruption buffer overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (5Stratmann A. Mahmud T. Lee S. Distler J. Floss H.G. Piepersberg W. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Generally, the crude extracts as prepared above were tested in assays of 20-μl final volume in a standard buffer system containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, and 10 mm2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (or other substrates that were tested) adjusted to pH 7.6. The coenzymes and/or cosubstrates (ATP, NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH, FAD, or FADH2) were used in final concentrations of 10 mm in the test volumes. The acarbose 7-kinase AcbK was tested as described by Drepper and Pape (18Drepper A. Pape H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1996; 49: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but without NH4Cl in the buffer. AcbM tests were routinely performed in a volume of 15 μl. Each assay contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (or other substrates that were tested) adjusted to pH 7.6, and 12 μl of cell-free extracts. The assays were incubated at 30 °C for 2–12 h. The reaction was monitored by TLC. For radioactive assays, 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (2.0 μCi; Amersham Biosciences) was added, and only 11 μl of cell-free extracts were used. Radioactively labeled spots were visualized after TLC by autoradiography with x-ray films (Hyperfilm, Amersham Biosciences). For assaying the activity of AcbO, a mixture of cells from S. lividans/pCW4123M and S. lividans/pMJO7 (1:1) was used. Cell extracts were prepared as described for the AcbM tests. The test conditions and the detection of the reaction product were also identical as for the analysis of the AcbM-catalyzed reaction. Samples of the enzyme reactions were chromatographed on silica thin-layer sheets (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using solvent I (isobutyric acid and 1 n NH3 in water, 5:3) or solvent II (butanol/ethanol/water, 9:7:4). The substrates were detected as brown spots after heating or as blue spots after development using a cerium- and molybdate-containing reagent (19Drepper A. Peitzmann R. Pape H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 10-ml cell-free extracts from S. lividansTK64/pCW4123M were applied to an Ni2+-HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was first washed with 10–20 ml of starting buffer (20 mmNa3PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol adjusted to pH 7.5) and then washed with a linear gradient of 10–500 mm imidazole in 10 ml of starting buffer and 10 ml of elution buffer (20 mmNa3PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm NH4Cl, 500 mm imidazole, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol adjusted to pH 7.5). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The His-tagged AcbM protein was eluted at ∼200–300 mm imidazole from the column. The partially purified protein was dialyzed for 24 h against 5 liters of dialysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol adjusted to pH 7.6). The enzyme-catalyzed synthesis of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone was performed in a coupled assay using transketolase (EC 2.2.1.1), ribose 5-phosphate, and hydroxypyruvate to synthesize the substrate sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate in situ according to the protocol described previously (20Sprenger G.A. Schörken U. Sprenger G. Sahm H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The cyclization of sedo-heptulose 7-phosphate was performed with cell-free extracts from S. lividans containing the AcbC protein according to the protocol of Stratmann et al. (5Stratmann A. Mahmud T.

The assay contained 2 units of transketolase (Sigma, Munich, Germany), 10 mmhydroxypyruvate (Sigma), 10 mm ribose 5-phosphate (Sigma), 0.5 mm thiamin pyrophosphate (Sigma), 1 mmMgCl2, 0.025 mm CoCl2, 2 mm NaF, pH 7.6, and variable amounts of cell-free extracts from strain S. lividans 1326/pAS8/7 containing overproduced AcbC protein (1Truscheit E. Frommer W. Junge B. Müller L. Schmidt D.D. Wingeder W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1981; 20: 744-761Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The reaction was monitored by TLC. The product of the AcbC reaction had the same R F value (R F = 0.53, solvent II) as the chemically synthesized 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone ((5R,2S,3S,4S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexanone-2,3,4,5-tetrol). The chemical synthesis of racemic 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone was performed according to a new protocol, the details of which will be published elsewhere. 1O. Block and H.-J. Altenbach, unpublished data. 30 ml of the AcbC reaction solution were heated at 90 °C for 5 min, centrifuged (5000 rpm, 20 min), and then applied to an ultrafiltration cell with a YM-10 ultrafiltration membrane (10,000-Da cutoff; Amicon, Witten, Germany). The flow-through was collected. After freeze-drying, ∼250 mg of yellow powder were acquired. The product was dissolved in 3 ml of Milli-Q water and then subjected to anion-exchange chromatography with Dowex 1-X8 (Cl− form, mesh 100–200; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) on an SR25/50 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with water, and the fractions containing 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone were pooled. After lyophilization, 20 mg of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone were obtained as a light-yellow powder. The partially purified AcbM protein was used in phosphorylation assays with 20 mg of purified 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone. The reaction mixture was applied to an Amicon ultrafiltration cell with a YM-10 ultrafiltration membrane (10,000-Da cutoff). The 10-ml flow-through was collected, concentrated to 3 ml by freeze-drying, and then subjected to anion-exchange chromatography with Dowex 1-X8 (Cl− form, mesh 100–200) on a SR25/50 column. The column was washed with plenty of water, and the 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone phosphate was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–600 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The elutions were collected as 2-ml fractions and analyzed by TLC. Fractions containing the desired product (total volume of 48 ml) were pooled and concentrated 10-fold by freeze-drying. Desalting the product was carried out at 4 °C on Sephadex G-10 (5.0 × 81-cm SR25/100 column, Amersham Biosciences). The product was eluted with water at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The fractions containing 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone phosphate were pooled. After lyophilization, 12 mg of 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone phosphate were obtained as a white powder. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ARX 400 spectrometer (400 MHz). In addition to 1H, 13C, and 31P experiments, also COSY (1H-1H, 1H-13C, and 1H-31P) and distortionless enhancement of polarization transfer (DEPT) spectra for the unequivocal correlation of the hydrogen, carbon, and phosphor atoms were recorded. The chemical shifts are given in ppm, related to the solvents as internal standard. The multiplicity is given by the following symbols: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), Ψt (pseudotriplet for unresolved dd), and br (broad). The coupling constant J is given in Hz.

An ovarian cytosolic LH receptor mRNA-binding protein (LRBP) identified in our laboratory binds to a polypyrimidine-rich bipartite sequence in the coding region of LH receptor mRNA. The present studies show a role for LRBP in the regulation of LH receptor mRNA. We demonstrated that increased LH receptor mRNA degradation occurs during hormone-induced LH receptor down-regulation. Furthermore, increased degradation of LH receptor mRNA was seen when partially purified LRBP was included in anin vitro mRNA decay reaction. The LH receptor mRNA binding activity of LRBP measured by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed an inverse relationship to LH receptor mRNA levels during different physiological states. These results suggest that LRBP is a physiological regulator of LHR mRNA expression in the ovary and provides a novel mechanism for the regulation of LH receptor expression in the ovary.

Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the decline in cell surface LHR number seen after hCG administration is paralleled by a specific loss of LHR mRNA (2Hoffman Y.M. Peegel H. Sprock M.J. Zhang Q.Y. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3Peegel H. Randolph J.J. Midgley A.R. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Following the injection of a bolus of hCG in female rat, a rapid decline in the steady-state levels of all four LHR mRNA transcripts (6.7, 4.4, 2.6, and 1.8 kb) is seen in luteal cells within 12 h with a complete loss occurring by 24 h. This selective loss is followed by a recovery of receptor mRNA expression between 24 and 48 h (2Hoffman Y.M. Peegel H. Sprock M.J. Zhang Q.Y. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have shown that the loss of LHR mRNA does not result from decreased transcription but occurs post-transcriptionally with an approximate 3-fold decrease in half-life (4Lu D.L. Peegel H. Mosier S.M. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Additional studies led to the identification of a 50-kDa LHR mRNA-binding protein designated as LRBP in rat and human ovarian cytosolic fractions. During hormone-induced down-regulation of the LHR, the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP was increased. LRBP specifically binds to the coding region of LHR mRNA with an apparent dissociation constant of 10-9m (5Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These studies were carried out to determine the role of LRBP in LHR mRNA degradation in vitro as well as to establish a relationship between LHR mRNA expression and LRBP during ovarian development. Our results show that LHR mRNA expression inversely correlates with the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP during follicular maturation, ovulation, and luteinization. Furthermore, a partially purified LRBP causes accelerated decay of LHR mRNA in an in vitroreconstituted mRNA decay system. Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin was purchased from Calbiochem. Human chorionic gonadotropin was obtained from Sigma. [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA), and [α-32P]UTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets, RNase T1, and Quik spin columns (G-50-Sephadex) for radiolabeled RNA purification were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. mMessage mMachine Kit was a product of Ambion (Austin, TX). RNasin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Macro-prep High S Support column was obtained from Bio-Rad. Centriplus YM-10 and Centricon YM-10 microconcentrators were products of Millipore (Bedford, MA). Pseudopregnancy was induced in 21-day-old Sprague-Dawley female rats by a subcutaneous injection of 50 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin followed by 25 IU of hCG 56 h later. The day of hCG injection is taken as day 0. LH receptor down-regulation was induced by the injection of 50 IU of hCG on the fifth day of pseudopregnancy. Ovaries were collected at the indicated times and were processed immediately. Ovaries from control (pseudopregnant) and hormone-treated (12-h post-hCG-injected) animals were homogenized in solution A (1 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm Mg(Ac)2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6) at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g, the supernatants were layered over a cushion of solution B (solution A containing 30% sucrose) and centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 2.5 h. The polyribosome pellets were resuspended in solution A and stored at −80 °C. Quantitation of polysomes was performed by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Half-life of LHR mRNA was determined by an in vitro decay reaction based on the protocol developed by Ross (7Ross J. Haynes S.R. RNA-Protein Interaction Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 459-476Google Scholar). An A260 of 0.6–1.0 units of polysomes were mixed gently in 25 μl (final volume) of solution A (as described under polysome isolation) supplemented with 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.04 mg/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.1m potassium acetate, 0.1 mm spermine, 0.8 mm Mg(Ac)2, and placental RNase inhibitor (400 units/ml). The in vitro decay reactions were incubated at 16 °C for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Where indicated, total RNA isolated from control pseudopregnant rat ovaries and partially purified LRBP were also included in the reaction. After incubation at intervals shown above, the reactions were stopped, RNA in the reaction tubes was extracted immediately using the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate method as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (8Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar), and LHR mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis as described below. The 6.7-kb LHR mRNA (major transcript) was quantitated in densitometric units using NIH image 1.61 software. The half-life (t12) of LHR mRNA was calculated by plotting the corresponding densitometric units of LHR mRNA versus incubation time. Total RNA was extracted using a previously described procedure (8Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Ovaries were homogenized in a solution of guanidine isothiocyanate, acidified with 2 msodium acetate, pH 4.0, and extracted with water-saturated phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (49:1). RNA was precipitated at −20 °C using three volumes of ethanol and was quantified by UV-absorbance spectroscopy. Northern blot hybridization analysis was performed essentially as described by Maniatis and colleagues (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The LHR cDNA probe used for Northern blot hybridization has been described earlier (4Lu D.L. Peegel H. Mosier S.M. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A 1.7-kb cDNA for human cytochrome P450scc was used as probe for Northern blot analysis (10Golos T.G. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 896-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of LHR and P450scc mRNA was quantified in densitometric units and normalized to 18 S rRNA. Purification of LRBP from rat ovary was performed as described previously (6Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Ovaries were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm KCl and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S-100) was applied to a Macro-Prep High S Support (strong cation exchange support) column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl until the absorbance at 280 nm was <0.02. The proteins were then eluted with Buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. The column eluates were desalted to 50 mm KCl in buffer A containing EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture using Centricon YM-10 microconcentrators, and protein concentrations were determined by BCA (Pierce). The 2.1-kb LHR cDNA containing the full-length LHR coding region was ligated into pBluescript II between XbaI and BamHI sites and was used to generate full-length LHR mRNA. Radiolabeled RNA was prepared from linearized template using mMessage mMachine kit in the presence of 100 μCi of [32P]UTP. Following transcription, RNA was extracted with nuclease-free water-saturated phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from the labeled RNA using Quik spin columns (G-50-Sephadex). RNA was precipitated with equal volume of isopropyl alcohol at -20 °C. Precipitated RNA was then washed with 75% ethanol air-dried and was dissolved in nuclease-free water. Unless otherwise indicated, RNA gel shift analysis was performed as described previously (6Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16889-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein samples were incubated with 1 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled gel-purified RNA in homogenization buffer A described above in the presence of 5 μg of tRNA and 40 units of RNasin at 30 °C for 10 min. Unprotected radiolabeled RNA was then degraded by the addition of 2 units of RNase T1 at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were then incubated with heparin at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml for 10 min on ice to decrease nonspecific binding. The RNA-protein complexes were resolved by 8% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film and visualized by autoradiography. Radiolabeled bands were quantitated in densitometric units using NIH image 1.61 software. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the results presented represent a single experiment. Error bar represents the mean ± S.E. of three separate densitometric scans. The decay of endogenous and exogenously provided LHR mRNA was examined in a cell-free system. The polysomes were isolated from day 5 pseudopregnant rat ovaries when LHR mRNA expression was abundant. The decay of endogenous LHR mRNA associated with polysomes was determined by incubating polysomes in in vitro decay reactions as described under “Materials and Methods.” The incubations were carried out at 16 °C for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. At the end of this incubation period, total RNA was extracted from each fraction, and LHR mRNA was determined by Northern blot using a LHR cDNA probe. The results presented in Fig.1A show all four LHR mRNA transcripts (6.7, 4.4, 2.6, and 1.8 kb) endogenously associated with the polysomes remaining at different time intervals. The loss of all four transcripts occurred concomitantly. The 6.7-kb transcript is the predominant LHR mRNA in rat ovary. Panel C represents the rate of degradation in densitometric units of the 6.7-kb transcript in panel A normalized to 18 S rRNA. The degradation of endogenous LHR mRNA occurred rapidly (t12 = 38 min), and by 120 min, there were minimal detectable levels of LHR mRNA remaining. Panel B shows 18 S rRNA determined by Northern blot hybridization for normalizing RNA loading. The level of 18 S rRNA was not altered during the 120-min incubation period. Because the degradation of endogenously associated LHR mRNA occurred rapidly, in subsequent experiments 15 μg of total RNA extracted from pseudopregnant rat ovaries were included to ensure that RNA was not limiting in the in vitro decay reaction. Because our previous studies have shown that the degradation of LHR mRNA occurs more rapidly during hormone-induced down-regulation (2Hoffman Y.M. Peegel H. Sprock M.J. Zhang Q.Y. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3Peegel H. Randolph J.J. Midgley A.R. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Lu D.L. Peegel H. Mosier S.M. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), attempts were made to examine whether the decay of exogenous LHR mRNA by polysomes from LHR-down-regulated rat ovaries occurred at a rate faster than the degradation of exogenous LHR mRNA by polysomes isolated from control ovaries. For this study, polysomes were isolated from both LHR-down-regulated and control ovaries. Reactions containing polysomes from control and LHR-down-regulated ovaries were then separately incubated with exogenously added total RNA for up to 120 min, and the reactions were terminated at different time intervals as shown in Fig. 2. RNA was extracted, and Northern blot hybridization was performed using LHR cDNA probe.Panel A shows the 6.7-kb LHR mRNA transcript remaining at different time intervals in each group. Panel C shows 18 S rRNA in each fraction. Panel D depicts the densitometric scans of the 6.7-kb transcript (major transcript in rat ovary) inpanel A normalized for 18 S rRNA. The results show that the decay of exogenously added LHR mRNA occurred with at12 of 46 min when incubated in decay reactions using polysomes isolated from control ovaries. The decay of exogenous LHR mRNA proceeded at a markedly faster rate with at12 of ∼10 min in the decay reactions with polysomes isolated from hormone-induced LHR-down-regulated rat ovaries. To determine whether this rapid degradation of LHR mRNA by polysomes from LHR-down-regulated rat ovaries was selective for LHR mRNA, we examined the degradation of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme cytochrome P450scc mRNA by stripping the same blot and rehybridizing with [32P]cytochrome P450scc cDNA probe as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig.2B shows the cytochrome P450scc mRNA remaining at different time intervals of the in vitro degradation reaction in each group. Panel D depicts the rate of degradation in densitometric units of cytochrome P450scc in panel B normalized to 18 S rRNA (panel C) for the difference, if any, in RNA loading. There was no discernible difference in the rate of degradation of cytochrome P450scc between control and LHR-down-regulated groups. This finding indicates that the LHR mRNA degradation by polysomes from LH receptor-down-regulated rat ovaries is selective for LHR mRNA. To determine whether the partially purified LHR mRNA-binding protein LRBP induces accelerated decay of LHR mRNAin vitro, polysomes isolated from control ovaries were incubated with exogenously added LHR mRNA and partially purified LRBP. The assays were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Aliquots of decay reactions were incubated for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at 16 °C, and LHR mRNA content was detected by Northern hybridization analysis (Fig.3A). An addition of partially purified LRBP (70 μg) increased the degradation of LHR mRNA when compared with incubations with no LRBP. The decay of LHR mRNA was so rapid that there was an undetectable level of the 6.7-kb transcript at 120 min. Half-lives of LHR mRNA were calculated from the densitometric scans of the 6.7-kb transcript in decay reactions performed in the presence of LRBP or with equal volume of buffer as shown in Fig. 3B. The t12 of exogenously added LHR mRNA was reduced to 26 min in the presence of partially purified LRBP. The t12 of LHR mRNA in control reactions was 38 min. To address whether the degradation of LHR mRNA is dependent on LRBP concentration, in vitro decay reactions with control polysomes and exogenously added LHR mRNA were performed with different concentrations (9.6, 19.2, 38.5, and 77 μg) of partially purified LRBP at 16 °C for 60 min. As shown in Fig. 4, an increased degradation of LHR mRNA was observed by increasing the LRBP concentration in the decay reactions when compared with that seen in its absence. These data indicate that LRBP, which binds to the coding region of LHR mRNA, causes an accelerated and concentration-dependent degradation of the mRNA.FIG. 4LRBP dose response on LHR mRNA decayin vitro.In vitro decay reactions were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Aliquots of the decay reactions were incubated for 60 min in the absence of added protein (C) and in the presence of increasing concentrations of LRBP (9.6–77 μg). LHR mRNA content was assayed by Northern blot analysis, quantitated by densitometric scanning, and normalized for 18 S rRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Experiments were then conducted to determine whether LHR mRNA binding activity of the LRBP present in the ovarian S-100 fractions bears any relationship to the steady-state levels of LHR mRNA. First, the changes in LHR mRNA binding activity of the LRBP and LHR mRNA expression were determined after hormone treatment. 21-day-old rats were treated with 50 IU of PMSG to induce follicular maturation, and ovaries were collected 56 h later. LHR mRNA expression was examined by Northern blot analysis and the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using the S-100 fractions isolated from the ovaries. The results (Fig.5, A, C, and D) show that expression of LHR mRNA increased slightly 56 h after PMSG injection, but LRBP activity in the S-100 fraction showed a decline at this time interval compared with the pretreatment level. The PMSG-treated animals were then treated with 25 IU of hCG to induce ovulation and corpus luteum formation. Ovaries were collected at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after hCG injection to determine LHR mRNA expression and the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP. Upon treatment with hCG, as expected, the levels of LHR mRNA started to decline by 6 h and reached the lowest level by 12 h. The LHR mRNA expression started to increase by 24 h and further increased by 72 h (Fig. 5, A and D) following hCG treatment. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed in S-100 fractions prepared from ovaries collected at the same time intervals as those used for determining LHR mRNA levels. The intensities of the ribonucleoprotein complexes formed (Fig.5C) were quantitated by densitometric scanning (Fig.5D). The results show that following hCG injection, the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP showed an increase at 6 and 12 h. The LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP in the S-100 fractions started to decrease by 24 h after hCG injection. This finding is in sharp contrast to the pattern of LHR mRNA expression seen at different time intervals following hCG treatment. The results show that in all instances the expression of LHR mRNA inversely correlated with the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP. Because the corpus luteum has a defined life span and the expression of LHR mRNA shows marked changes during this period, both LHR mRNA levels and the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP were assayed to examine whether a correlation exists between the two. Pseudopregnancy was induced by a subcutaneous injection of 50 IU of PMSG to 21-day-old rats followed by treatment with 25 IU of hCG 56 h later. The day of hCG injection was taken as day 0 of pseudopregnancy. Ovaries were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 days of pseudopregnancy for LHR mRNA expression and RNA electrophoretic mobility shift studies as described in earlier experiments and under “Materials and Methods.” Fig.6A represents the Northern blot showing the expression of LHR mRNA at different days of pseudopregnancy. Following a steady increase in LHR mRNA expression culminating in maximum expression on day 8, a sharp decline was seen after day 8 of pseudopregnancy extending to day 14. The LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP in ovarian S-100 fractions at the same time interval is shown in Fig. 6C, and the intensities of these ribonucleoprotein complexes were quantitated densitometrically (Fig.6D). The results show that the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP increased from days 4–10 of pseudopregnancy. The maximum binding activity of LRBP was observed on day 10 of pseudopregnancy. The binding activity of LRBP started decreasing from day 10 but remained higher than the levels seen on days 6 and 8. Taken together, these results show that the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP is inversely related to LHR mRNA expression. Differences in expression of the LH receptor observed during follicular development, ovulation, and luteinization involve concomitant changes in the steady-state levels of LH receptor mRNA (1LaPolt P.S.

Commun. 1990; 172: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that during hCG-induced down-regulation of the LH receptor, the steady-state levels of LHR mRNA show a dramatic decline (2Hoffman Y.M. Peegel H. Sprock M.J. Zhang Q.Y. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the selective loss of LH receptor mRNA is because of increased mRNA degradation rather than decreased transcription (4Lu D.L. Peegel H. Mosier S.M. Menon K.M.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a 50-kDa LHR mRNA-binding protein on native acrylamide gel designated as LRBP that is induced during down-regulation of the LH receptor (5Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The present studies have examined the role of LRBP in LHR mRNA degradation during hCG-induced down-regulation of LH receptor. We have used an in vitro mRNA decay system to determine the effect of LRBP on the stability of LHR mRNA. In general, cell-free mRNA turnover systems afford many benefits for studying mRNA degradation. Although decay rates of mRNA in vitro generally occur at slower rates than in intact cells, the relative rates of turnover of different mRNAs are maintained. Moreover, the rates of mRNA degradation can be measured without the necessity of transcriptional repressing agents, which are generally nonspecific and cytotoxic. Thein vitro mRNA decay reactions performed with polysomes isolated from control and hCG-induced LHR-down-regulated ovaries permit reconstitution of LHR mRNA-degradative activity in a cell-free system. The accelerated degradation of LHR mRNA in the presence of partially purified LRBP in vitro presented in this report indicates that LRBP acts as a trans-acting factor to induce the decay of LHR mRNA. Earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that the LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP in the ovarian S-100 fraction increases during hCG-induced down-regulation of LH receptor (5Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hormonal manipulation of rats has been shown to cause changes in LHR mRNA expression (1LaPolt P.S. Oikawa M. Jia X.C. Dargan C. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 3277-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Hoffman Y.M. Peegel H. Sprock M.J. Zhang Q.Y. Menon K.M.J.

Commun. 1990; 172: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using this paradigm, we have examined the relationship between LRBP activity and LHR mRNA expression. The data presented in this report (Figs. 5 and 6) clearly show that when the expression of LHR mRNA is low, the ovarian S-100 fractions yields higher levels of ribonucleoprotein complexes, establishing an inverse relationship between LHR mRNA expression and LHR mRNA binding activity of LRBP. This inverse relationship suggests that LRBP might play a role in the accelerated degradation of LHR mRNA in vivo. This possibility is supported by the observation that LHR mRNA degradation is accelerated by the addition of LRBP in the in vitro decay assay (Figs. 3 and 4). We have found that LRBP binds to a polypyrimidine-rich bipartite sequence in the coding region of LHR mRNA (5′-202UCUCX7UC UUCCU220-3′) with an apparent dissociation constant of 10−9m (5Kash J.C. Menon K.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10658-10664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). LRBP could function by targeting an endonuclease to LHR mRNA either by direct interaction or by targeting the receptor mRNA to a particular location in the cytoplasm where mRNA degradation occurs. The increased LHR mRNA decay activity seen under in vitro conditions in the presence of LRBP is an indication that LRBP is one of thetrans-acting factors involved in LHR mRNA degradation. It is possible that other proteins associated with the ribosomes might also participate in the decay process. A number of cytoplasmic proteins, some of which shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm, have been identified as either RNA-stabilizing or destabilizing trans-acting factors (14Peng S.S.-Y.

For example, the post-transcriptional regulation of tropoelastin mRNA in response to transforming growth factor β1 is very similar to the LHR mRNA regulation that we describe in this report. Similar to our system, tropoelastin mRNA contains an 18-nucleotide cis-acting motif near the 5′ end of the coding region, and a 50-kDa cytosolic protein interacts with this cis-acting motif causing destabilization of the mRNA (24Zang M.

The present studies clearly show that the LHR mRNA-binding protein LRBP, which binds to a region between nucleotides 188 and 228 in the open reading frame of LHR mRNA, plays a crucial role in the hormonal control of LHR mRNA stability. The mechanisms, which regulate the degradation of LHR mRNAs, are not clearly understood, although several mechanisms that involve deadenylation, decapping, and exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic degradation of eukaryotic mRNAs have been proposed (18Decker C.J. Parker R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sachs A.

Regulated degradation of mRNA allows rapid cessation of protein synthesis without the need to alter transcription rates. The ability to regulate receptor protein expression at the level of mRNA degradation not involving changes in rate of transcription as demonstrated here provides a novel strategy for the control of gene expression under selective physiological or pharmacological states. The present study provides for the first time a novel mechanism by which LHR mRNA is regulated by altering the rate of mRNA degradation."

Their biological effects are transmitted via binding to and activation of their type I receptor. The stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates like insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS-1 and -2). This tyrosine phosphorylation allows binding to proteins containing SH2 domains that initiate activation of such pathways as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling pathways. Since PI 3-kinase activity is essential for the mitogenic signaling of IGF-I in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (3Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen A.A.M. van Schaik F.M.A. van der Burg B.

The CHO-IR cell line (16Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M. Bertrand F. Caron M. Atfi A. Cherqui G. Capeau J.

For 16–24 h before each experiment, cells were starved in their respective medium without serum. First, cells were incubated without or stimulated with 3 nm IGF-I, des(1–3)IGF-I or [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I for periods up to 30 min. After the first 5 min of each period, cells were further incubated for the remaining times at 37 °C with or without different concentrations of IGFBP-3 or with 10 nmIGFBP-1 or IGFBP-5. The cells were then solubilized in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvylinidene difluoride sheets. These were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times (10 min each) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Thereafter, they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibodies and washed as above before being incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 125I-protein-A (5 × 105 cpm/ml blocking buffer) and washed as above. Incorporated radioactivity was quantified using a Storm Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates obtained from cells treated as above were used to measure MAPK activity.

Lysates from cells treated as above were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies to IRS-1 or to the PI 3-kinase 85-kDa subunit coupled to protein-A-Sepharose beads. Thereafter, immune pellets were washed twice with each of the three following buffers: (a) phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 200 μm Na3VO4; (b) 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m LiCl, 200 μm Na3VO4; and (c) 10 mm Tris,pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 200 μm Na3VO4. Immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase activity was measured in the immune pellets by in vitro phosphorylation of PI (18Heydrick S.J. Jullien D. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Clin.

After autoradiography, PI 3-kinase activity was quantified by Cerenkov analysis of the spots corresponding to PI 3-P. MCF-7 cells were incubated with or without IGFBP-3 or -5 and PTPase activity measured using a kit purchased from Sigma. Briefly, cells were solubilized for 20 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. Then, cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm and applied to a Sephadex G-25 column to remove phosphate salts. An aliquot of the eluate was used to measure PTPase activity by the dephosphorylation of provided tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides in a buffer comprising: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The inorganic phosphate formed during the reaction complexes with Malachite Green/ammonium molybdate to generate a colored product quantified by spectrophotometry at 620 nm (using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader). MCF-7 cells in 100-mm culture dishes were stimulated for 10 min at 37 °C with 6.7 nm IGF-I. Cells were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g and supernatants immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies to IRS-1 coupled to protein-A-Sepharose beads. Immune pellets were washed twice with phosphatase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were incubated with or without 10 nm IGFBP-3 or with IGFBP-1 or IGFBP-5 for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were scraped into the phosphatase buffer described above and homogenized with a Dounce Potter homogenizer (20 strokes). Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 ×g and the supernatants incubated with immune pellets for 10 min at room temperature. In some samples, 1 mmZnCl2 was added to the incubation medium. To stop the reaction, immune pellets were washed three times with ice-cold buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Pellets were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 was quantified as described above. Having previously demonstrated that preincubation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with IGFBP-3 dose-dependently inhibits subsequent IGF-IR activation by its ligand (13Ricort J.-M. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether or not IGFBP-3 could reverse this activation. MCF-7 cells were incubated with 3 nm des(1–3)IGF-I for 6 min, with or without increasing concentrations of IGFBP-3 for the last 3 min of incubation. After solubilization of the cells, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunodetected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As can be seen in Fig. 1, there was little phosphotyrosine in either IGF-IR or IRS-1 under basal conditions. Des(1–3)IGF-I stimulated IGF-IR autophosphorylation and its tyrosine kinase activity, as visualized by the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Addition of IGFBP-3 to the culture medium dose-dependently decreased the des(1–3)IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both IGF-IR and IRS-1. Time course experiments were performed to analyze the effects of IGFBP-3 in more detail. MCF-7 cells were incubated for varying periods with 3 nm des(1–3)IGF-I, in each case 10 nmrh-IGFBP-3 being added after 5 min. After solubilization of the cells, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunodetected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Des(1–3)IGF-I induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR and IRS-1 within 2 min (Fig. 2). Stimulation of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation peaked after 6 min and remained at a plateau up to 15 min, with a slight decrease after 30 min. The time course of des-1–3-IGF-I-induced IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation was slightly different, with a progressive increase up to 30 min of stimulation. When 10 nm IGFBP-3 was added to the culture media after 5 min of des(1–3)IGF-I stimulation, phosphotyrosine was rapidly dephosphorylated in both IGF-IR and IRS-1, the effect being significant after only 1 min of incubation with IGFBP-3. With a view to demonstrating that the effect of IGFBP-3 was unrelated to its ability to bind des(1–3)IGF-I for which it has weak affinity, the same experiments were performed using [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I, which has virtually no affinity for IGFBP-3. As in the case of des(1–3)IGF-I, IGFBP-3 proved capable of reversing [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both IGF-IR and IRS-1 (Fig. 3). Since addition of IGFBP-3 decreased the IGF-IR autophosphorylation induced by IGF-I analogues, subsequent inhibition could be expected of the two major signaling pathways initiated by IGF-IR, i.e. the PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase signaling pathways. MCF-7 cells were incubated with des(1–3)IGF-I for different periods of time and, as described above, incubated with or without IGFBP-3. Des(1–3)IGF-I stimulated the phosphorylation of p42MAPK as shown by its reduced electrophoretic mobility, and addition of 10 nm IGFBP-3 inhibited this phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Similarly, as shown by PI 3-kinase measurement in immune pellets obtained with antibodies to IRS-1 (Fig. 5A) or the PI 3-kinase p85 subunit (Fig. 5B), des(1–3)IGF-I stimulated both PI 3-kinase association with IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase activation, and addition of 10 nm IGFBP-3 induced significant inhibition of both activities.Figure 5IGFBP-3 reverses des(1–3)IGF-I-induced PI-3 kinase association with IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase activation.

The bands corresponding to the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, IRS-1 and IGF-IR, were quantified using a Storm Imager (Amersham Biosciences).

Open table in a new tab MCF-7 cells were stimulated for different time periods with 3 nm des(1–3)IGF-I and, in each case after 5 min of stimulation, treated with or without 10 nm IGFBP-1 or IGFBP-5, then treated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The bands corresponding to the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, IRS-1 and IGF-IR, were quantified using a Storm Imager (Amersham Biosciences). The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation are expressed as percentages of that measured in des(1–3)IGF-I-stimulated cells without IGFBP-1 or IGFBP-5 and represent the means ± S.E. for three separate experiments. The state of tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein depends upon the fine balance between tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases. We therefore sought to determine whether the dephosphorylation provoked by IGFBP-3 results from inhibition of a tyrosine kinase activity or stimulation of a tyrosine phosphatase activity. PTPase activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” MCF-7 cells were incubated at 37 °C with or without different concentrations of IGFBP-3 or 30 nm IGFBP-5 for different periods of time, and PTPase activity was measured in cell lysates. IGFBP-3 activated a PTPase capable of dephosphorylating synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. PTPase activity was maximal with 10–20 nmIGFBP-3, although significant stimulation was achieved with 5 nm (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B, IGFBP-3-induced PTPase activity increased rapidly to a maximum within 15 min (3.3-fold over basal), then plateaued for a further 15 min. Predictably on the basis of the previous experiments, IGFBP-5 had no effect, even used at 30 nm (the dosage of IGFBP-3 that induced the maximal response). Moreover, glycosylated IGFBP-3 had the same effect as the non-glycosylated form, indicating no effect of the state of IGFBP-3 glycosylation in stimulating this PTPase activity (data not shown). Reconstitution experiments were performed to assess the specificity of the PTPase activity to the IGF-I signaling pathway. Lysates from MCF-7 cells treated or not (control) with 10 nm IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-1 were incubated with immunopurified tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 7, neither phosphatase buffer (0) nor lysates from control cells dephosphorylated IRS-1, but lysates from IGFBP-3-treated MCF-7 cells did so, indicating that IGFBP-3 stimulated a PTPase activity that could be inhibited by ZnCl2. The effect was specific to IGFBP-3, since IGFBP-1-treated cells failed to dephosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1. Addition of IGFBP-3 directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 did not change its state of tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that IGFBP-3 had no PTPase activity per se (data not shown). To assess the cell type specificity of IGFBP-3-stimulated PTPase activity, we measured PTPase activity in different cell lines that respond to IGF-I in terms of IGF-IR autophosphorylation and activation of its tyrosine kinase activity. As shown previously, IGFBP-3 stimulated PTPase activity in MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/A) and also in T47D human breast carcinoma and CHO-IR Chinese hamster ovary cells. The same stimulation was seen in another MCF-7 cell line that differs from the first at least in its ability endogenously to secrete low levels of IGFBP-3 (MCF-7/B) (Fig. 8). In contrast, no PTPase activity was detected in IGFBP-3-treated MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells or CCL39 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (Fig. 8). Reconstitution experiments confirmed these findings; lysates from IGFBP-3-treated MCF-7/B, T47D, and CHO-IR cells dephosphorylated IRS-1, whereas lysates from IGFBP-3-treated MDA-MB-231 cells did not (Fig. 9).Figure 9IGFBP-3 activates a PTPase in different cell lines. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 immunopurified from IGF-I-stimulated MCF-7 cells was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with lysates of different cell lines incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with or without 10 nm IGFBP-3. Immune pellets were treated as described under “Materials and Methods” and tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 visualized by Western immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and revealed by autoradiography.

Following activation of the IGF-I-IR by its ligand, which results in its autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, addition of IGFBP-3 rapidly provoked dephosphorylation of the two proteins. The tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-IR and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 are crucial steps in activating downstream signaling pathways (20White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and IGFBP-3 was shown also to inhibit the two major pathways induced by IGF-I, the PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase pathways. The regulatory mechanism induced by IGFBP-3 therefore has physiological implications, since it affects both the early and the later steps in the IGF-I signaling pathway. PI 3-kinase activity is crucial for the mitogenic signaling of IGF-I in MCF-7 cells (3Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen A.A.M. van Schaik F.M.A. van der Burg B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and it seems significant that IGFBP-3 inhibits IGF-I-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in the same cells. Interestingly, in our MCF-7 cells, PI 3-kinase association with IRS-1 and activation of the enzyme (as measured in immunoprecipitation experiments using IRS-1 or p85 subunit antibodies, respectively) exhibited different kinetics. Association with IRS-1 was transient, whereas activation persisted for 30 min, indicating that PI 3-kinase remains active beyond its period of association with IRS-1. Activation of the IGF-I signaling pathway was achieved using the IGF-I analogues, des(1–3)IGF-I and [Gln3,Ala4,Tyr15,Leu16]IGF-I, with 80–100 and 1000 times weaker affinity for IGFBP-3 than IGF-I itself (14Mohseni-Zadeh S. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5645-5648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Oh Y. Müller H.L. Lee D.-Y. Fielder P.J. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This meant that the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 was unrelated to its IGF-binding capacity. In addition, the inhibition seemed to be specific to IGFBP-3, in terms of the IGFBPs, since neither IGFBP-5 (structurally the closest to IGFBP-3) nor IGFBP-1 had any such effect. It would therefore seem reasonable to hypothesize that the region of IGFBP-3 responsible for its stimulation of PTPase activity would be centrally situated in the domain of the protein that is the least conserved among the IGFBPs. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein reflects the fine equilibrium between the activities of tyrosine kinases and phosphotyrosine phosphatases. Several mechanisms could therefore account for the down-regulation of the IGF-I signaling pathway by IGFBP-3. In one, IGFBP-3 would block the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-IR, after which endogenous tyrosine phosphatases could dephosphorylate IGF-IR and IRS-1. This seemed a likely mechanism, since we had recently shown IGFBP-3 to affect IGF-IR, but not the insulin receptor. Preincubation of MCF-7 cells with IGFBP-3 was found to inhibit IGF-IR activation independently of IGFBP-3's ability to bind IGFs (13Ricort J.-M. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and possibly involving conformational changes (14Mohseni-Zadeh S. Binoux M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5645-5648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 could also alter IRS-1 phosphorylation, as shown in other systems where serine/threonine phosphorylation inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin, hence down-regulating subsequent insulin signaling (21Tanti J.-F. Grémeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19814-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, this appeared unlikely, since serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 results in an increase of its molecular mass, which is visible in SDS-PAGE, but which did not occur in our experiments. In another scenario, IGFBP-3 would stimulate phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity capable of down-regulating the early steps of the IGF-I signaling pathway by dephosphorylating IGF-IR and IRS-1. Direct measurement of PTPase activity and the reconstitution experiments showed that IGFBP-3 did indeed activate a PTPase in MCF-7 cells, which dephosphorylated synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides and the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 protein used as a substrate in vitro. The persistence of the activation of this PTPase for at least 30 min, which corresponds to the duration of activation by IGF-I of PI 3-kinase and the MAP kinases, suggests that IGFBP-3 is implicated in regulating the IGF-I signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells. This may account for the so-called IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-3, such as its induction of apoptosis (12Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), and would imply IGFBP-3 interaction with specific cell surface proteins, as identified in other cell systems (23Oh Y. Muller H.L. Pham H. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Leal S.M. Liu Q. Shian Huang S. San Huang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20572-20576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 25Leal S.M. Shian Huang S. San Huang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6711-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In view of the extremely rapid activation of PTPase in MCF-7 cells, it seems unlikely that the mechanism of action of IGFBP-3 necessitates an internalization step. It would therefore be plausible that IGFBP-3 may either bind to and activate cell surface receptors with tyrosine phosphatase activity or stimulate an intracellular tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates the proteins required in the initial steps of the IGF-I signaling pathway. These include IRS-1, which was used as tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate in our reconstitution experiments. They would also include IGF-IR, the tyrosine phosphorylation of which is decreased after addition of IGFBP-3. IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity is closely related to the extent of its tyrosine autophosphorylation, and it could be expected that such tyrosine dephosphorylation would lead to depressed tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF receptor. This phosphatase-related mechanism of action of IGFBP-3 would be complementary to the well established extracellular mechanism of IGF sequestration. Our study also showed that tyrosine phosphatase activation by IGFBP-3 is not peculiar to MCF-7 cells, since T47D human breast carcinoma and CHO-IR Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited the same activation. Nevertheless, it does appear to be cell type-specific, since it did not occur in MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma or CCL39 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells. It would therefore seem that expression of either the IGFBP-3 receptor or the proteins activated by IGFBP-3 (in the present case, the PTPase enzyme) is cell type-specific and that one or more are either not expressed or not functional in all cells. Nevertheless, earlier work on the IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-3 indicated IGFBP-3 binding to the cell surface of MDA-MB-231 cells (26Oh Y. Muller H., Ng, L. Rosenfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,27Gucev Z., Oh, Y. Kelley K. Rosenfeld R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the IGFBP-3 receptor exists in this cell type, but that binding to an IGFBP-3-activated PTPase does not occur. The fact that human IGFBP-3 activated a PTPase in Chinese hamster ovary cells would mean that there may be inter-species cross-reactivity between human IGFBP-3 and the Chinese hamster IGFBP-3 receptor. This would suggest that the peptide sequence of IGFBP-3, which to our knowledge is still unknown in Chinese hamster, and its receptor must be very similar to the human forms. The observation that IGFBP-3 also activated PTPase activity in a MCF-7 cell line that endogenously secretes low levels of IGFBP-3 may seem surprising. In fact, long term contact between agonist and cell frequently elicits subsequent resistance to the agonist via a down-regulatory mechanism. The basal expression level of IGFBP-3 may therefore not be sufficient in this line to down-regulate the IGFBP-3 signaling pathway. In addition, in the course of our experiments there are numerous and repeated washing steps to reduce IGFBP-3 in the reaction medium and avoid such down-regulation. The nature of the PTPase activated by IGFBP-3 in MCF-7 cells remains to be determined. A possible candidate would be PTPase 1B, shown to be a negative regulator of IGF-I-stimulated signaling via dephosphorylation of both IGF-IR and IRS-1 (28Kenner K. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). We were nevertheless able to establish that the IGFBP-3-activated PTPase is inhibited by phenylarsine oxide (data not shown) and Zn2+, which act by targeting the active cysteine site. The activation of a PTPase by IGFBP-3 to inhibit the IGF signaling pathway is functionally significant. Some PTPases may be capable of dephosphorylating critical substrates involved in the transformation process, and they may represent a family of tumor-suppressor enzymes (29Cool D. Fischer E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is possible that PTPases function as anti-oncogenes, in that the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation seen in some transformed cells may result from inactivation of a PTPase rather than activation of a phosphotyrosine kinase. For instance, PTEN, whose sequence bears homology with protein tyrosine phosphatases and whose gene is mutated in a wide range of cancers, appears to be a tumor suppressor negatively regulating tyrosine kinase activities (30Tamura M., Gu, J. Tran H. Yamada K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1820-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Interestingly, vanadate treatment of NRK-1 cells enhances intracellular phosphotyrosine levels and leads to production of transformed morphology (31Klarlund J. Cell. 1985; 41: 707-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). PTPases could potentially be important targets for proteins like IGFBP-3 in regulating the phosphotyrosine kinase signaling pathways. We are grateful to C. Desbois-Mouthon and M. Caron for their gift of CHO-IR cells and particularly to Dr R.-A. Toillon for providing us with IGFBP-3-secreting MCF-7 cells and the T47D and MDA-MB 231 cell lines."

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 39: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These parasites have a digenetic life cycle, with two main stages: the bloodstream form (BF)1 that lives in the bloodstream of its mammalian host and the procyclic form (PF) that lives in the insect vector (tsetse fly). Purines are essential for the growth, multiplication, and survival of these organisms because the parasites are incapable of synthesizing the purine ring de novo (2Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, New York1995: 89-117Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, nucleoside/nucleobase transporters are of considerable pharmacological importance, because both purine analogs and non-purine analog drugs are taken up by some of these permeases, and loss of permease function can lead to drug resistance (4Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5de Koning H. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1162-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Two different nucleoside transport systems have been characterized in intact Trypanosoma brucei cells. The P1 type system mediates the uptake of purine nucleosides (adenosine, inosine, and guanosine) and is detected in both BF and PF life cycle stages, and the P2 type system mediates the uptake of adenosine and adenine, as well as several anti-trypanosomal drugs, and is detected only in the BF (6Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7de Koning H. Watson C.J. Jarvis S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9486-9494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) parasites. In addition, four nucleobase transport activities have also been identified. H1, H2, and H3 mediate the transport of hypoxanthine, guanine, and adenine (8de Koning H. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9de Koning H. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). H1 activity is found in PF, and H2 and H3 activities are found in BF. In addition, the U1 activity mediates the transport of uracil in PFs (10de Koning H. Jarvis S.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 853-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, meticulous functional and biochemical characterization of these transporters at the molecular level is needed to understand the biological role of purine transporters in survival and adaptation of T. brucei to different environments during its life cycle and to provide information about drug delivery and drug resistance phenotypes associated with purine transporters (11Carter N.S. Berger B.J. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28153-28157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Previously we cloned and characterized the T. bruceinucleoside transporter 2 gene, TbNT2, which encodes a P1 type transporter expressed only in the BFs (12Sanchez M.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30244-30249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that TbNT2 is a member of a multigene family. In the reference strain TREU 927 used for the T. brucei genome project (parsun1.path.cam.ac.uk/index.html), this family encodes six similar but distinct transporters, denominated TbNT2/927 to TbNT7 (the designation TbNT2/927 is used to distinguish this gene from the closely related but nonetheless distinct TbNT2 gene that was derived originally from T. brucei strain EATRO 110 (12Sanchez M.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30244-30249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). All of the family members are clustered together in chromosome number II and are separated by ∼9-kb intergenic regions. Functional expression of TbNT2/927 through TbNT7 inXenopus oocytes revealed that TbNT2/927, TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7 transport purine nucleosides with similar affinities in the low micromolar range. Of note, TbNT5, and to a lesser extent TbNT6 and TbNT7, also show significant hypoxanthine transport activity. Moreover, ribonuclease protection assays indicate that the mRNAs from all six genes are expressed in BF parasites, but only TbNT2/927 and TbNT5 mRNAs are expressed at detectable levels in both BFs and PFs. Consequently, members of this nucleoside transporter family are differentially regulated during the parasite life cycle and mediate the uptake of purine nucleosides and in some cases also the nucleobase hypoxanthine. The presence of several P1 type transporters with similar but distinct biochemical properties and divergent regulation of expression suggests that the purine transport process in T. brucei is much more complex than was assumed on the basis of previous studies with whole parasites. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci mmol−1), [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci mmol−1), [2,8,5′-3H]adenosine (54.4 Ci mmol−1), and [2,8-3H]adenine (28.8 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; [2,8-3H]inosine (34 Ci mmol−1) and [8-3H]guanine (15 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.; and [2,8-3H]hypoxanthine (24.5 Ci mmol−1) and [8-3H]guanosine (5 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from Movarek Biochemicals. All of the other chemicals were of the highest commercial quality available. Procyclic forms of T. brucei strain TREU 927 (13van Deursen F.J. Shashi S.K. Turner C.M.R. Hartmann C. Guerra-Giraldez C.

Protozool. 1977; 24: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The bloodstream forms of T. brucei strain TREU 927 from frozen stocks were grown in Wistar rats, and blood was collected through exsanguination. BFs were separated from blood cells on a DE52 (Whatman) anion exchange column as described (15Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). The nucleic acids were purified from trypanosomes following established procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An RPCI-93 BAC (library 93 made at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Buffalo, NY) clone designated 36E18 (EMBL/GenBankTM accession number AC007866) containing theTbNT family cluster was identified by a BLAST search (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lippr D.J. J. Mol.

To subclone each gene from the BAC clone 36E18, 100 ng of BAC DNA was used as template for six independent PCR amplifications. The oligonucleotide O1 (5′-GGGGTACCACCATGGCAATGCTTGGT-3′), representing the first five identical amino acids of theTbNT family including a KpnI restriction site (underlined) and a consensus Kozak sequence (18Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar) (italics), was used as forward primer, and a specific oligonucleotide, representing the complement of the sequence within the 3′-untranslated region of eachTbNT ORF, was used as reverse primer. PCR amplification was performed using Pfu TurboTM polymerase (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Amplified DNA fragments were subcloned using the Zero BluntTM TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). The clones were further characterized by restriction mapping and sequencing of the entire ORF. Oligonucleotide synthesis and automatic sequencing were performed by the Core Facility of the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Oregon Health and Science University using a model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI model 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA and deduced amino acid sequence analysis were performed by using the MacVector software (Intelligenetics). Transmembrane segments were predicted using the TMPRED software (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html). TheTbNT2/927 gene family ORFs were subcloned into theEcoRI site of the Xenopus expression vector pL2-5 (19Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A., Wu, Y.-N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15329-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), linearized, and in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in the presence of CAP analog (AmershamBiosciences) as described previously (20Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stage V–VIXenopus oocytes were injected with 23 nl of cRNA (∼10 ng), incubated in ND96 buffer for 3 days at 16 °C as described (20Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and used for uptake assays. Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA or water as control were incubated for 3 days after injection. Prior to the assay, the oocytes were incubated for 30 min in ND96 buffer at room temperature. Uptake of [3H]adenosine, [3H]inosine, [3H]guanosine, [3H]hypoxanthine, [3H]guanine, and [3H]adenine was assayed by incubating oocytes with radiolabeled substrates for the indicated times, followed by three quick washes in cold ND96 buffer, and the samples were prepared for liquid scintillation counting as described previously (12Sanchez M.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30244-30249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For each data point, the number of picomoles of labeled substrate transported were calculated and plotted as a function of incubation time. These data were fitted to a straight line by a linear regression analysis with CA-Cricket Graph III software (Computer Associates International Inc.). To perform substrate saturation curves, cRNA-injected oocytes were incubated for 60 min in the presence of different concentrations of substrate at room temperature. Control experiments demonstrated that the uptake of substrate was linear over 60 min over the range of concentrations tested. The Km values were estimated by fitting the substrate saturation curves to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using the KaleidaGraph program (Synergy Software). To explore the expression of the TbNT2/927 family members, a ribonuclease protection assay was performed by using the RPA IIITM ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion), following the protocols recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA from TREU 927 PF or BF were hybridized against specific antisense 32P-labeled riboprobes, generated by the MAXIscriptTM T7 in vitro transcription kit (Ambion), representing the complement of the sequence within the 3′-untranslated region of each TbNT∼150 bp downstream from the 3′ end of each ORF. α-Tubulin was used as a control gene that is expressed at similar levels in BFs and PFs. After RNase A/T1 treatment and ethanol precipitation, protected RNA was resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by exposing the gel to x-ray film (Kodak OMAT-AR) or to a PhosphorImager screen. Biochemical characterization of purine nucleoside transport in intact T. brucei parasites indicated the presence of P1 type transport that mediates the uptake of adenosine and inosine in both PFs and BFs (6Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In previous studies (12Sanchez M.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30244-30249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we have cloned a P1 type transporter gene from T. brucei strain EATRO 110, called TbNT2, that is a high affinity adenosine/inosine transporter whose RNA is detectable only in BFs. Genomic Southern blots hybridized with the TbNT2 ORF indicated the presence of a multigene family, raising the possibility that some of these TbNT2-like genes might encode other P1 type transporters. To clone TbNT2-like genes, we first BLAST searched the T. brucei genome data base using the TbNT2 amino acid sequence as a query, and six ORFs were identified. All of the six ORFs were contained in the same RPCI-93 BAC clone 36E18, which contains a genomic DNA insert from chromosome number II of T. bruceistrain TREU 927 (www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb/progress.html), and the predicted amino acid sequences showed high identity to TbNT2 (81–96% identity). The gene that predicted a protein with the highest identity (96%) to the original TbNT2 was designated TbNT2/927(T. brucei nucleoside transporter 2/927). Moreover, TbNT2/927 is the first gene in the array of the locus according to the predicted transcription direction (Fig.1). The other P1 type genes were designated TbNT3 through TbNT7. All genes were cloned using a PCR strategy and sequenced to determine the identity of each one by comparing the DNA and predicted amino acid sequences with those obtained from the T. brucei data base. In addition, we identified five copies of an interspersed unrelated gene within the TbNT array, encoding a putative isopenicillium-N-synthase gene (INS in Fig. 1). Gene multiplicity is a common feature in kinetoplastid protozoa (21Landfear S.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Wirth D.F. Mol. Cell.

U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in some examples, gene families encode similar but not identical proteins (23Burchmore R.J.S. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29118-29126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,24Bringaud F. Baltz T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 220-230PubMed Google Scholar). The six predicted TbNT proteins were very similar along the entire amino acid sequences (Fig. 2), suggesting that they are nucleoside transporter isoforms. Moreover, the predicted topology indicated 11 TMDs for all six proteins, similar to the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), whose topology was recently experimentally elucidated by Sundaram et al. (25Sundaram M. Yao S.Y.M. Ingram J.C. Berry Z.A. Adibi F. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45270-45275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The 11 TMDs shown in Fig. 2 are those predicted for TbNT2/927. The overall comparison showed four regions of major divergence between the six protein sequences. Those regions are limited to the extracellular loops between TMD1 and TMD2, TMD5 and TMD6, and TMD7 and TMD8 and the large intracellular loop between TMD6 and TMD7. To identify the substrate specificity of theTbNT2/927 family members, we tested the ability of oocytes expressing TbNT2/927 through TbNT7 to mediate the uptake of purine nucleosides. Initial experiments indicated thatTbNT2/927, TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7 cRNA-injected oocytes were able to transport adenosine, inosine, and guanosine at significantly higher rates than the control water-injected oocytes (Fig.3A). However, TbNT3and TbNT4 cRNA-injected oocytes did not mediate the uptake of any purine nucleosides compared with the control water-injected oocytes (data not shown). To characterize the affinity of these transporters for adenosine and inosine, the Kmvalues were calculated from substrate saturation curves (Fig.3B), revealing that TbNT2/927, TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7 were high affinity adenosine/inosine transporters (Table I) with Km values of <5 μm.Table IKm values for adenosine and inosine in TbNT2/927 through TbNT7 cRNA injected Xenopus oocyteKmAdenosineInosineμmTbNT2/9272.0 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.7TbNT3NDNDTbNT4NDNDTbNT52.0 ± 0.62.2 ± 0.7TbNT61.4 ± 0.34.3 ± 2.8TbNT70.3 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab To test for potential functional differences between the distinct proteins, we also examined the ability of TbNT2/927 through TbNT7 to mediate the transport of purine nucleobases. InterestinglyTbNT5 cRNA-injected oocytes were able to mediate the uptake of hypoxanthine at a significantly higher level than the control water-injected oocytes (Fig. 4). Moreover, saturation curves for TbNT5 revealed a Kmvalue of 49.4 ± 13.3 μm (mean ± S.D., n = 3) for hypoxanthine. In contrast TbNT6 and TbNT7 showed limited but still significant hypoxanthine transport activity, whereas TbNT2/927, TbNT3, and TbNT4 did not show any ability to transport this nucleobase. Additional experiments were conducted to test the transport of guanine and adenine, but none of the six permeases transported these purines (data not shown). In summary, there are clear differences in substrate specificity among members of the TbNT2/927 family. TbNT2/927 is a purine nucleoside transporter, TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7 transport hypoxanthine in addition to the purine nucleosides, and TbNT3 and TbNT4 have not exhibited any clear transport activity for the substrates tested here including adenosine, inosine, guanosine, xanthosine, adenine, hypoxanthine, guanine, xanthine, cytosine, uracil, thymine, cytidine, thymidine, uridine, S-adenosylmethionine, spermidine, putrescine, and AMP. In intact T. brucei parasites, transport of nucleosides (7de Koning H. Watson C.J. Jarvis S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9486-9494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and nucleobases (8de Koning H. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) has been shown to be dependent upon the transmembrane proton motive force, strongly suggesting that these permeases are active proton symporters. Indeed, uptake of adenosine byTbNT2/927, TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7 cRNA-injected oocytes was significantly inhibited by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone or 2,4-dinitrophenol (data not shown), suggesting that the adenosine uptake by these permeases is coupled to proton translocation. To explore the expression of each member of theTbNT2/927 family in the two major life cycle stages of T. brucei, a ribonuclease protection assay was performed employing specific antisense 32P-labeled riboprobes from the 3′-untranslated region of each gene. Ribonuclease protection assay experiments revealed that RNA from all of the members of the family was detected in the BFs (Fig. 5). In addition, RNA from TbNT2/927 and TbNT5 was also detected in the PFs. However, TbNT2/927 expression was similar in both BF and PF life cycle stages, whereas TbNT5expression was up-regulated in the BF stage. α-Tubulin riboprobe was used as a control for an RNA that is expressed at similar levels in both the BF and PF life cycle stages of T. brucei. In T. brucei, purine nucleoside and nucleobase transporters have been extensively studied at the biochemical level (6Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar,8de Koning H. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9de Koning H. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and shown to play important roles in the biochemistry and pharmacology of these parasites. More recently, studies at the molecular level began with the cloning of the TbAT1 (P2 type nucleoside transporter) (26Mäser P. Süterlling C. Kralli A. Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and of the TbNT2 (a P1 type nucleoside transporter) (12Sanchez M.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30244-30249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) genes. Thus, TbAT1 and TbNT2 function correlated with many of the biochemical features of nucleoside transport in intact parasites. However, the original TbNT2gene (EATRO 110 strain) encoding a P1 type transporter was expressed only in BF parasites, whereas P1 activity could be detected in both BFs and PFs (6Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These results, along with the observation of multiple fragments on genomic Southern blots that hybridized to aTbNT2 probe (12Sanchez M.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30244-30249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggested that other P1 type transporters were likely to exist. In this study, we report the functional expression and characterization of the TbNT2/927 gene family, four members of which encode high affinity adenosine, inosine, guanosine transporters, placing them within the P1 type of nucleoside transporters previously defined at the biochemical level (6Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 12Sanchez M.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30244-30249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7 were also able to mediate the uptake of hypoxanthine, a nucleobase that plays a central role in the purine salvage pathway of these parasites (3Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press, New York1995: 89-117Crossref Google Scholar). This result is consistent with previous observations that some other ENT family members, specifically TbAT1 (26Mäser P. Süterlling C. Kralli A. Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), human ENT2 (27Griffiths M. Yao S.Y.M. Abidi F. Phillips S.E.V. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and PfNT1 (28Parker M.D. Hyde R.J. Yao S.Y.M. McRobert L. Cass C.E. Young J.D. McConkey G.A. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), are able to transport some nucleobases, most often with substantially higher Kmvalues than for nucleosides. It will be interesting to determine what specific molecular determinants confer hypoxanthine transport function upon TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7. Examination of the multi-alignment (Fig. 2) reveals that there are five amino acids (Val47, Lys48, Lys52, Pro55, and Val78 in TbNT5) that are conserved in these three permeases but that are different in TbNT2/927, TbNT3, and TbNT4. The first four of these residues are located in the extracellular loop between predicted TMD1 and TMD2, and Val78 is located within predicted TMD2. It is possible that some of these residues confer hypoxanthine transport capacity upon TbNT5, TbNT6, and TbNT7. It is noteworthy that we have not been able to identify any substrates for TbNT3 or TbNT4 in the Xenopus oocytes expression system. One possibility is that TbNT3 and TbNT4 are not functional transporters. Alternatively, the two permeases may transport some substrate that we have not tested. Compounds that we have examined as potential substrates for TbNT3 and TbNT4 include purine nucleosides and nucleobases, pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleobases, S-adenosylmethionine, polyamines, and AMP, but none of these solutes are substrates. We have also considered the possibility that TbNT3 and TbNT4 could form functional hetero-oligomers. However, coinjection of TbNT3 and TbNT4 cRNAs into oocytes did not elicit any transport function for any of the compounds listed above. Still another possible explanation for the failure of these proteins to mediate purine transport is that they require for function other subunits that are not present in the oocytes. The requirement for multiple subunits has been observed for several amino acid transporters (29Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). There is ample precedent for the existence of multiple isoforms of various transporters in both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes (30Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Lin R. Vera J.C. Chaganti R.S.K. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28959-28965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In multicellular organisms, distinct isoforms may be expressed in different tissues where they subserve the physiological needs of each cell type (32Devés R. Boyd C.A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The TbNT2/927 family encompasses six permeases whose sequences are distinct but closely related. It is possible that each permease has unique properties that collectively promote the viability of the parasite in its natural environment. Thus, examination of substrate specificity for each permease has revealed differences that could in part explain the distinct roles of different family members. Furthermore all six mRNAs are expressed in BF parasites, but only TbNT2 and TbNT5 mRNAs are also expressed in PF parasites. This observation raises the possibility that different purine permeases could be differentially regulated to accommodate the potentially distinct nucleoside composition of the mammalian bloodstream and the tsetse fly gut. Finally, it is possible that different members of this family are targeted to discrete subcellular locations where they might subserve unique functions. Ultimately, it will be important to define the potentially unique biological roles of each member of the TbNT2/927 family. A substantial amount of the T. brucei genome has been sequenced as genome survey sequence clones (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_brucei/), raising the likelihood that many of the T. brucei genes encoding nucleoside or nucleobase transporters that are members of the ENT family have been at least partially sequenced and can be identified by BLAST searches. Using such “data base mining” approaches, we have identified two new ENT family members designated TbNT8 and TbNT9. 2M. A. Sanchez, C. Henriques, M. van Ampting, and S. M. Landfear, unpublished data. There are multipleTbNT8 genes arranged in a tandem cluster representing very closely related ORFs, whereas TbNT9 appears to be a single copy gene. Functional expression of both of these genes inXenopus oocytes reveals transport activity for both nucleobases and nucleosides. However, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that other nucleoside/nucleobase transporters exist that exhibit low homology to the currently identified permeases or that are members of different transporter families."

Tetrahedron Organic Chemistry Series Volume 12. Pergamon Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA technology has increased the availability of useful enzymes, and technologies such as phage display and directed evolution are also being applied toward the discovery of novel bio-catalysts (3Marrs B. Delagrave S. Murphy D. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The exciting prospect exists that, guided by structural and mechanistic understanding, we can rationally design enzyme activity for the most complex of chemical syntheses. With this long term goal in mind we have undertaken to characterize the structure-activity relationships in metal-dependent aldolases, which are particularly attractive for use in biotransformation chemistry and indeed have already contributed to the synthesis of rare sugars (4von der Osten C.H. Sinskey A.J. Barbas C.F. Pederson R.L. Wang Y.-F. Wong C.-H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3924-3927Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The most studied aldolases are the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases (FBPA),1 which participate in two metabolic pathways. FBPA catalyzes the aldol condensation of a ketose, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (glycerone-P or DHAP), and an aldose, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) to form fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) in gluconeogenesis (see Fig. 1 below). In glycolysis FBPA catalyzes the reverse cleavage. FBP-aldolases are multimers of (α/β)8-barrel subunits and are divided into class I and II enzymes on the basis of mechanism. The type I enzymes utilize a lysine in Schiff base formation during catalysis and are mainly found in higher order organisms as homotetramers of molecular mass around 160 kDa (5Gefflaut T. Blonski C. Perie J. Willson M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 301-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6Blom N. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The class II enzymes, found in yeast, bacteria, fungi, and blue-green algae, are most often dimeric and utilize a divalent metal ion, usually Zn2+, in catalysis and, because they are more stable than their class I counterparts, are preferred for use in biotransformation chemistry (4von der Osten C.H.

Structure-activity studies of Escherichia coli class II FBPA have served to delineate some details of the aldol condensation (8Hall D.R. Leonard G.A. Reed C.D. Watt I. Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Mol.

Plater A.R. Bates M.A. Thomson G.J. Berry A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Of particular value is the structure of FBPA complexed to phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH), which mimics the ene-diolate formed from DHAP (15Collins K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the EH·DHAP(C−) structure (stage II in Fig. 1). Two critical steps in the aldol condensation are: first, the formation of an activated carbon from which a proton is abstracted to produce an enolate and, second, the formation of a new C–C bond. During catalysis, direct coordination of DHAP to Zn2+ aligns the substrate allowing the divalent cation to function as a Lewis acid and to polarize the carbonyl bond of the ketose ready for a reaction that involves three major covalency changes (see Fig. 1). The first covalency change follows abstraction of the1-proS proton of DHAP to produce the ene-diolate, the second is carbon–carbon bond formation to covalently link DHAP C1 with G3P C1 and so form the new C3–C4 bond of a hexose bisphosphate. The substrate oxygen ligands are syn to the enolate bond, and this restricts access of the electrophilic G3P to the Si face of DHAP as the C3–C4 bond is formed. In the third covalency change, a second proton transfer converts the C4 carbonyl to a hydroxyl group and so completes the hexose synthesis. Despite some progress in understanding class II aldolases, there remain aspects of aldolase reactivity that require clarification. We have carried out studies on tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (TBPA), a tetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of DHAP with the natural substrate G3P to form tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate (TBP) (9Zgiby S.M.

Microbiology. 1996; 142: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) a diastereoisomer of FBP (Fig. 1). The reactions catalyzed by TBPA and FBPA (Fig. 1) are similar, and because there is significant conservation of sequence (9Zgiby S.M. Thomson G.J. Qamar S. Berry A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and structure (this work) a comparison provides insight into class II aldolase mechanism and specificity. The major products of the condensations catalyzed by TBPA and FBPA are distinct in their chirality at C4 (Fig.1). On the basis ofkcat/Km values, FBPA prefers FBP around 1500-fold over TBP so that the overall discrimination between the two substrates is nearly 5 × 105 (9Zgiby S.M. Thomson G.J. Qamar S. Berry A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). FBPA and TBPA, therefore, represent an excellent model system to investigate the molecular basis of chiral discrimination. We now report the high resolution crystal structure of recombinant E. coli TBPA, which encoded by theagaY gene and complexed to PGH, and a detailed comparison with the structure of recombinant E. coli FBPA also complexed with PGH (8Hall D.R. Leonard G.A. Reed C.D. Watt I. Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although, to date, we have been unable to obtain crystal structures of complexes with a hexose substrate or analogue, we have carried out modeling to generate templates for the TBPA·TBP and FBPA·FBP complexes based on the experimentally derived structures. Established protocols provided the enzyme (9Zgiby S.M. Thomson G.J. Qamar S. Berry A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and PGH (8Hall D.R. Leonard G.A.

The enzyme (6.5 mg ml−1 in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 mm PGH and crystallization achieved in hanging drops of 5 μl of enzyme·PGH complex mixed with 5 μl of reservoir comprising 7–12% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 10 mm ZnCl2, 42 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.4. Orthorhombic crystals attained dimensions of 0.20 × 0.25 × 0.30 mm after 3 weeks at 20 °C. The space group is I222 with unit cell lengths ofa = 72.6, b = 100.5, c= 206.7 Å and two TBPA subunits per asymmetric unit. All diffraction measurements were carried out on crystals cryoprotected with ethylene glycol and cooled to −173 °C in a stream of nitrogen gas. Data were first measured in-house using a Rigaku rotating anode (CuKα) and RAXIS IV image plate detector, then at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility stations BM14 and ID14-EH2, for a four-wavelength MAD experiment and the high resolution data, respectively, using MAR charge-coupled device detectors. Wavelengths for the MAD experiment (peak λ1, inflection point λ2, and remote data λ3, λ4) were derived from an x-ray near edge absorption scan (XANES) of the zinc K-edge and selected to maximize the anomalous differences, f″ (λ1), provide the minimum f′ (λ2), and two remote wavelengths (λ3, λ4) to maximize dispersive differences (λ3 − λ2, λ4 − λ2). All data were processed using HKL (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276A: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

It was then refined using the 1.45-Å data set first with rigid body refinement to account for the lack of isomorphism (Riso 0.26) with the MAD data set. Restrained anisotropic refinement without noncrystallographic symmetry restraints was implemented first with CNS (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

The final model consists of residues 2–139 and 151–285 of subunit A and 2–141 and 150–284 of subunit B, two Zn2+ ions, two Na+ ions, 658 waters, and 14 ethylene glycol molecules. Fifteen side chains were modeled in dual conformations, and ten, with poorly defined electron density, were given zero occupancy. There are no Ramachandran outliers, and further details are presented in Table II. The structure and interactions with ligands are well conserved among the two subunits, for example, the 272 Cα atoms common to each overlay with an root mean square deviation of 0.31 Å, and it is therefore appropriate to only detail one active site.Table IIRefinement and model geometry statisticsProtein residues/atoms548/4259PGH atoms/ions/solvents20/2 Zn2+, 2 Na+/658 waters, 14 ethylene glycolsR-work/No. of observations0.13/124,490R-free/No. of observations0.17/6,592Wilson B(Å2)16.2Average isotropic thermal parameters (Å2)Subunit A/B overall18.0/20.6Main chain/side chain16.4/22.4Solvents/PGH/ethylene glycol35.2/17.5/43.4Residues in dual conformations2-aThe single-letter amino acid code, the residue number, and subunit assignment A or B.134A, S39A, R42A, I57A, R91A, V98A, E159A, K7B, I57B, R91B, V98B, R162B, R198B, R272B, V277BResidues for which there is no convincing electron density at the side chain2-aThe single-letter amino acid code, the residue number, and subunit assignment A or B.S151A, K185A, K188A, R257A, S285A, E150B, S151B, K185B, K188B, E216Br.m.s. bond lengths (Å)0.018r.m.s. bond angle associated distances (Å)0.030r.m.s. planarity (Å)0.0252-a The single-letter amino acid code, the residue number, and subunit assignment A or B.

Receptor models for TBP aldolase and FBP aldolase were derived from the complexes with PGH with all water molecules removed. In addition, for FBPA the side chain of Glu182 was deleted to allow access to Arg331, which has been shown to interact with the G3P phosphate of the substrate (12Qamar S. Marshal K. Berry A. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and to be consistent with TBPA for which the corresponding residue Glu142 is disordered and missing from the model. Suitable parameters for the Zn2+, Na+, and substrate atoms were derived by reference to literature values (28Erion M.D. Reddy M.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and systematic variation to reproduce the position of PGH observed in the experimentally derived crystal structures. Coordinates for the hexose substrates were prepared using Chem3D (CambridgeSoft) and PRODRG (29van Aalten D.M. Bywater R. Findlay J.B. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The 2–3 bonds (Fig. 1) were fixed, and torsional freedom was allowed in all other 11 torsion angles. Consistent results were achieved using the genetic algorithm with 40 trials and a maximum of 1400 generations. The TBPA subunit comprises 285 residues folded into an (α/β)8barrel carrying three additional helical segments. The secondary structure is mapped onto the amino acid sequence and the three-dimensional arrangement shown in Fig.2. The elements of secondary structure that create the barrel are β1-α2-β2-α4-β3-α5-β4-α6-β5-α7-β6-α8-β7-α9-β8-α10. Helix α1 caps the N-terminal section of the barrel, and α3 comprises two turns of helix linking β2 with α4. Helix α11 is closely associated with α10 and together with the intervening loop forms an “arm” protruding away from the barrel (Figs. 2Band 3A), which provides an important component for subunit·subunit interactions.FIG. 3A, the functional TBPA tetramer with each subunit given a different color and labeledA to D. PGH and cations are included as in Fig.2. The orientation of the subunit shown in Fig. 2 is approximately perpendicular to subunit C in this figure.

FIG. 3, FIG. 4, FIG. 5 were generated using MOLSCRIPT (34Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER-3D (35Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. P Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The TBPA and FBPA monomers have similar dimensions (Fig.3), but a noteworthy difference is that the α10-loop-α11 arm is ∼12 Å shorter in the former. On the basis of a structural alignment the E. coli class II FBPA and the agaY-encoded TBPA enzymes share ∼23% sequence identity (Fig. 2) and 268 Cα atoms from each subunit overlay with an r.m.s.d of 1.56 Å (not shown). However, the quaternary structure differs between the dimeric FBPA and the tetrameric TBPA. The functional TBPA tetramer (subunits A, B, C, and D arranged with 222 point group symmetry) is a rectangular block with approximate dimensions of 92 × 85 × 38 Å (Fig. 3A). The A-B and A-C associations represent two distinct subunit-subunit interfaces. The A-B interface involves the interaction of residues at the N-terminal region of α1 with the turn linking α6 and β5 of an adjacent subunit, resulting in the N-terminal portion of the two (α/β)8 barrels abutting each other in the dimer and the point group symmetry positioning an active site at each corner of the rectangular-shaped tetramer. The two subunits of the TBPA asymmetric unit (A and B) give an arrangement distinct from that observed for functional FBPA. Rather it is the combination of TBPA subunits A and C (or B and D) that forms a dimer similar to FBPA (Fig. 3). This interaction between subunits A and C covers a larger area than the other type of interface (A-B) and is essential to complete the TBPA active site. The A-C interface is formed by the anti-parallel alignment of helices α4 together with interactions from residues at the C-terminal region of the short α3 helix with residues on helices α2 and α4 of the partner subunit. Of particular note is the packing of hydrophobic residues carried on one α10-loop-α11 arm with that of the partner subunit in a manner similar to that observed in FBPA, although this loop is truncated by ∼12 residues in TBPA. Dimer formation by subunits A and C directs the side chain of Arg257 into the active site of the partner subunit in similar fashion to that observed for the C6P binding residue, Arg331 of FBPA (13Cooper S.J. Leonard G.A. McSweeney S.M. Thompson A.W. Naismith J.H. Qamar S. Plater A. Berry A. Hunter W.N. Structure. 1996; 4: 1303-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The catalytic center is located in a deep, polar cavity at the C-terminal end of the (α/β)8-barrel (Fig.4), and a complex network of hydrogen bonds organize the positions of key functional groups and metal ion ligands. The active site can be divided into a monovalent cation binding site, a divalent cation binding site, the PGH (DHAP) binding site, and the G3P site. TBPA has, like FBPA, a well-defined monovalent cation (Na+) binding site, ∼8.5 Å from the catalytic Zn2+, which serves to create a phosphate binding site and tethers PGH, and by inference the natural substrate DHAP, in the active site. The Na+ coordinates the carbonyl oxygens of four residues (Ala179, Gly181, Gly209, and Ser211) together with a PGH phosphate oxygen. The Na+ O distances fall in the range 2.3–2.6 Å. In FBPA the octahedral Na+ coordination sphere is completed by a water, but in TBPA an uncommon π-cation interaction involving the side chain of Tyr183 is observed (Fig. 4). A similar π-cation interaction involving a Na+·tryptophan association has been observed in lysozyme (30Wouters J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2472-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but such a mode of metal binding has, to the best of our knowledge, not been observed before in an enzyme active site. Although the sequence of E. coliFBPA carries a tyrosine (Tyr229) at the same place in the structure as Tyr183 in TBPA, it adopts a different orientation at the surface of FBPA. The differences observed in the FBPA main chain are due to interactions with the extremity of the partner subunit α10-loop-α11 arm, interactions that are absent in TBPA because the arm is truncated as described earlier. The Na+ binding site in TBPA is important for the formation of the PGH/DHAP phosphate binding site and in addition helps to position His180 to coordinate the catalytic Zn2+. The PGH phosphate binds in a site created by strands β7, β8, the loop linking β6 with α8, and the N-terminal region of α10. The latter provides a helix dipole to assist phosphate binding whereas the β8 strand runs close to the inhibitor and imposes steric restrictions at the methylene group of PGH, and by implication C3 on DHAP. In addition to the direct coordination to Na+, the phosphate has two bifurcated hydrogen bond interactions with the main chain amides of Gly181 and Thr233, single hydrogen bonds accepted from the amides of Ser211 and Ala232, the side chain hydroxyls of Ser211 and Thr233 (Fig. 4), and with a water (not shown). The PGH enolate (O1) and hydroxyl (O2) groups chelate the catalytic Zn2+, and a trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere is completed by three histidines (His83 Nε2, His180 Nε2, and His208 Nδ1, Fig. 4). The metal-ligand distances fall in the range 2.0–2.4 Å. The Zn2+ binding site is well-ordered by a complex network of hydrogen bonding interactions. His83 and His208are held in place by hydrogen bonds donated to the side chain of Asp104 and Glu132 (not shown), respectively. Glu132 also participates in a buried salt bridge with Lys228, which in turn hydrogen bonds to and orients the side chain of Asn230. The side chain of Asn230forms part of the active site floor and donates a weak hydrogen bond of length 3.3 Å to PGH O4. Asn230 is structurally conserved and corresponds to Asn286 in FBPA. In both enzymes the amino group is positioned just under the substrate analogue and serves both to restrict the stereospecificity of the catalytic reaction at DHAP C1 and to assist carbanion formation during catalysis (8Hall D.R. Leonard G.A. Reed C.D. Watt I. Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An asparagine at this position is critical for FBPA, because site-directed mutagenesis of Asn286 to aspartate or alanine greatly reduces kcat by up to 8000-fold (10Plater A. Zgiby S.M. Thomson G.J. Qamar S. Wharton C.W. Berry A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 843-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PGH O1, in addition to coordinating Zn2+, accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide of Gly209 while PGH O2 donates a hydrogen bond to the carboxylate group of Asp82. At this point we note that the residue types and their interactions with each other as described above are conserved between FBPA and TBPA. This strongly implies a conservation of substrate recognition between FBPA and TBPA for DHAP and the enzyme mechanism. Both TBPA and FBPA require deprotonation of DHAP and carbanion formation to produce the unsaturated linkage where the aldol condensation occurs (Fig. 1). There are only a few residues in the active sites that provide a basic group to abstract the acidic1-proS α-H. In FBPA these are Glu182, Asp109, Asp288, and then Asp329from the partner subunit. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that the aspartates do not abstract the proton from DHAP and implied that Glu182 could be responsible (10Plater A. Zgiby S.M. Thomson G.J. Qamar S. Wharton C.W. Berry A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 843-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutagenesis of Glu182 to alanine and kinetic analysis of the altered protein showed that proton abstraction became rate-limiting, clearly identifying a role in deprotonation (14Zgiby S. Plater A.R. Bates M.A. Thomson G.J. Berry A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Glu182 is positioned on a flexible loop (8Hall D.R. Leonard G.A. Reed C.D. Watt I. Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) about 6.8 Å from the PGH N2 and a conformational alteration would be required to position the side chain where direct abstraction of a proton from DHAP C1 would be feasible. Glu182 of FBPA corresponds to Glu142 in TBPA, which is also positioned on a glycine-rich loop. Due to the lack of reliable electron density, this residue has not been included in the TBPA model and it is presumed to be flexible and disordered. The sequence conservation of this loop in TBPA and FBPA is high (Fig. 2), which implies that Glu142 could adopt a similar position and contribute the same function as Glu182 in FBPA. We would therefore predict that mutagenesis of Glu142 in TBPA would have the same effect as seen for Glu182 in FBPA. An alternative hypothesis, which would still involve Glu182/Glu142, to explain proton abstraction from DHAP C1 involves the use of activated water. In both the FBPA and TBPA·PGH complex structures there is a well-defined water molecule within hydrogen bonding distance of the PGH N2 and correctly positioned to interact with the 1-proS α-H of these class II aldolase·DHAP complexes (Fig. 4). This water therefore represents a potential base for the proton abstraction. In FBPA and TBPA the water is hydrogen bonded to other solvents in the active site and in the former a hydrogen bond network extends up to Glu182 (8Hall D.R. Leonard G.A. Reed C.D. Watt I. Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the absence of PGH the catalytic Zn2+ of FBPA is five-coordinate, using three histidines and two water molecules (11Blom N. Tetreault S. Coulombe R. Sygusch J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 856-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The water ligands are replaced by PGH and, by implication, DHAP during catalysis (8Hall D.R. Leonard G.A. Reed C.D. Watt I. Berry A. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The replacement of such cation-binding solvent by hydroxamates is common to other zinc enzyme inhibitor complexes (31Chevrier B. D'orchymont H. Schalk C. Tarnus C. Moras D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and a possibility is that the Zn2+ contributes to activating a water. We note that details of a similar proton abstraction step in class I aldolases has proven difficult to explain. However, the recent work of Heine et al. (32Heine A. DeSantis G. Luz J.G. Mitchell M. Wong C.-H. Wilson I.A. Science. 2001; 294: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) has indicated that for d-2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase a proton relay system activates an active site water, which then mediates proton transfer. Our analysis does not unambiguously explain the details of proton abstraction in the class II aldolase system but does suggest that the potential role of activated water should be investigated. The major differences between the TBPA and FBPA active sites are localized to that region where G3P has to bind, and, although the main chain of the enzymes overlay well, we note two sequence changes that alter side chain contributions to the active sites (Fig.5). Gln59 and Asp288 of FBPA correspond to Ala48 and Ala232, respectively, in TBPA. This results in more space on one side of the TBPA active site and influences the side-chain orientation of a conserved asparagine (Asn35 in FBPA; Asn24 in TBPA). The asparagine Nδ2 groups are structurally conserved when the TBPA and FBPA models are overlaid (not shown) as is the hydrogen bond formed with another conserved residue: Asp109 in FBPA and Asp82 in TBPA. In FBPA, Asn35 Oδ1 is held in place by accepting a hydrogen bond from Gln59 Nε2 whereas Asn35 Nδ2 donates a hydrogen bond to Asp288. In TBPA, however, the loss of functional groups and side-chain atoms results in more space in the TBPA active site. The side chain of TBPA Asn24 adopts a different conformer, and the Oδ1 group alters position with respect to that seen in FBPA. The result is that, although Nδ2 of Asn35 FBPA and Asn25 TBPA occupy the same relative position, the Oδ1 groups occupy different locations in the active site. The complexes with PGH mimic the ene-diolate enzyme structures (stages I through II in Fig. 1) formed from DHAP. We previously modeled the other reactant, G3P into the active site of FBPA on the basis of simple graphical considerations (stage III, 8) but have now used computational chemistry methods to position FBP and TBP in the active sites of their cognate enzymes, in effect to model stage IV (Fig. 1) for each aldolase. Although crude, these models serve to identify possible interactions of relevance to enzyme mechanism and specificity. The lowest energy FBP models in the active site of FBPA, of which one is shown in Fig. 4, placed the C6 phosphate to interact with Arg331 of the partner subunit and Ser61. These residues are conserved in the class II FBP-aldolases, and the model is consistent with the kinetic analysis of mutant enzymes in which these two residues have been altered (9Zgiby S.M. Thomson G.J. Qamar S. Berry A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Qamar S. Marshal K. Berry A. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The C4 hydroxyl of FBP is positioned about 4 Å from Asn35 and 3 Å from the carboxylate side chain of Asp109. Mutagenesis of the asparagine in FBPA to alanine produced an enzyme with ∼1.5% of the activity of wild-type protein (9Zgiby S.M. Thomson G.J. Qamar S. Berry A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the FBPA·FBP model suggests a role in binding the C4 OH. Asp109 has previously been shown to be responsible for the protonation of the incoming C4 carbonyl group (Fig. 1, stage III, 10). The docking of TBP into the active site of TBPA did not produce a set of closely clustered models as observed for the FBPA·FBP combination but indicated that a range of conformations of the G3P component are accessible. This suggests that the TBPA active site allows the substrate more conformational freedom than is the case for FBPA. We present one of the TBP·TBPA models in Fig. 5, which, like the others, suggests that the G3P phosphate interacts with a basic patch, including His26, Lys236, and from the partner subunit Arg257, which corresponds to Arg331 in FBPA discussed above. In addition the phosphate is placed near Thr50, which corresponds to Ser61 in FBPA. His26 and Lys236 are altered in FBPA to Val37 and Gln292, respectively (Fig. 5). The C4 OH group of TBP is directed into the space between the side chains of Ala232 and Asp82 and in position to interact with Asn24. Asp82 corresponds to Asp109 in FBPA and, by analogy with FBPA, we judge it likely that this residue is responsible for the protonation of the C4 carbonyl of during the aldol condensation to produce TBP. An overlap of both enzyme active sites and substrate models (not shown) suggests that there would be a significant steric clash between the G3P of TBP with Asp288 of FBPA in addition to the electrostatic repulsion of anionic groups. Such interactions are likely a contributory discriminating factor in the specificity of FBPA. Superposition of FBP models in the active site of TBPA does not predict any major steric clash. In contrast to FBPA, TBPA displays poor stereochemical control with nearly 10% of the l-erythro configuration being observed and about 90% of the d-threo. In addition, TBPA can utilize glycoaldehyde, l-glyceraldehyde, acetaldehyde, and isobutyraldehyde as the DHAP partner (16Reizer J. Ramseier T.M. Reizer A. Charbit A. Saier M.H.J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This lack of specificity can be explained by the availability of space in that part of the active site where the aldehyde binds. It appears that FBPA has an active site that is complementary to and highly specific for its cognate substrates. TBPA on the other hand is less specific due to the conformational freedom afforded its range of substrates. We conclude that the overall discrimination between the two systems is dominated by the strict specificity of FBPA, and, therefore, TBPA might be the better choice of enzyme to serve as the framework onto which new catalytic activities could be constructed. We thank European Synchrotron Radiation Facility for access and our colleagues for encouragement and excellent support in particular Drs. Graeme Thomson and Shaza Zgiby for help in the preparation of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2016935847,"Several hyperthermophilic organisms contain an unusual phosphatase that has dual activity toward inositol monophosphates and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The structure of the second member of this family, an FBPase/IMPase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AF2372), has been solved. This enzyme shares many kinetic and structural similarities with that of a previously solved enzyme from Methanococcus jannaschii (MJ0109). It also shows some kinetic differences in divalent metal ion binding as well as structural variations at the dimer interface that correlate with decreased thermal stability. The availability of different crystal forms allowed us to investigate the effect of the presence of ligands on the conformation of a mobile catalytic loop independently of the crystal packing. This conformational variability in AF2372 is compared with that observed in other members of this structural family that are sensitive or insensitive to submillimolar concentrations of Li(+). This analysis provides support for the previously proposed mechanism of catalysis involving three metal ions. A direct correlation of the loop conformation with strength of Li(+) inhibition provides a useful system of classification for this extended family of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1839100929,"Brown fat differentiation in mice is fully achieved in fetuses at term and entails the acquisition of not only adipogenic but also thermogenic and oxidative mitochondrial capacities. The present study of the mice homozygous for a deletion in the gene for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα-null mice) demonstrates that C/EBPα is essential for all of these processes. Developing brown fat from C/EBPα-null mice showed a lack of uncoupling protein-1 expression, impaired adipogenesis, and reduced size and number of mitochondria per cell when compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, immature mitochondrial morphology was found in brown fat, but not in liver or heart, from C/EBPα-null mice. Concordantly, expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genome-encoded genes for mitochondrial proteins was reduced in C/EBPα-null brown fat, although expression of mitochondrial rRNA and mitochondrial DNA content were unaltered. Expression of nuclear respiratory factor-2, thyroid hormone nuclear receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1, was delayed in C/EBPα-null brown fat. Iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase activity and thyroid hormone content were also reduced in brown fat from C/EBPα-null mice, indicating for the first time a crucial role for C/EBPα in controlling thyroid status in developing brown fat, which may contribute to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and cell differentiation. When survival of C/EBPα-null mice was achieved by transgenically expressing C/EBPα only in the liver, a substantial recovery in brown fat differentiation was found by day 7 of postnatal age, which is associated with a compensatory overexpression of C/EBPδ and C/EBPβ. Brown fat differentiation in mice is fully achieved in fetuses at term and entails the acquisition of not only adipogenic but also thermogenic and oxidative mitochondrial capacities. The present study of the mice homozygous for a deletion in the gene for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα-null mice) demonstrates that C/EBPα is essential for all of these processes. Developing brown fat from C/EBPα-null mice showed a lack of uncoupling protein-1 expression, impaired adipogenesis, and reduced size and number of mitochondria per cell when compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, immature mitochondrial morphology was found in brown fat, but not in liver or heart, from C/EBPα-null mice. Concordantly, expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genome-encoded genes for mitochondrial proteins was reduced in C/EBPα-null brown fat, although expression of mitochondrial rRNA and mitochondrial DNA content were unaltered. Expression of nuclear respiratory factor-2, thyroid hormone nuclear receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1, was delayed in C/EBPα-null brown fat.

Its thermogenic capacity is due to the presence of the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial protein that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from the respiratory chain, causing energy dissipation as heat (1Nicholls D.G. Cunningham S.A. Rial E. Trayhurn P. Nicholls D.G. Brown Adipose Tissue. Edward Arnold Publishers, London1986: 52-85Google Scholar). UCP1 is uniquely expressed in BAT and thus constitutes the unequivocal molecular marker of differentiated brown adipocytes. The development of BAT in rodents occurs during the perinatal period (2Nedergaard J. Connolly E. Cannon B. Trayhurn P. Nicholls D.G. Brown Adipose Tissue. Edward Arnold Publishers, London1986: 152-213Google Scholar) and mainly relies on three differentiation programs: (i) the thermogenic program related to the specific induction of UCP1; (ii) the adipogenic program related to lipid synthesis, uptake, and multilocular fat droplet accumulation but also to lipid catabolism to provide the main fuel for thermogenic activity; and (iii) the mitochondrial biogenesis program related to the acquisition of a large content of highly respiratory active mitochondria. All of these processes take place before birth, thus providing fully functional tissue able to respond to the thermal stress associated with birth (3Giralt M. Martı́n I. Iglesias R. Viñas O. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The thermogenic activity of BAT and UCP1 gene expression are mainly regulated by the sympathetic nervous system innervating the tissue (4Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Gelly C. Fox N. Schrementi J. Raimbault S. Klaus S. Forest C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 5Yubero P. Barberà M.J. Alvarez R. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since innervation is not fully developed in the fetus (2Nedergaard J. Connolly E. Cannon B. Trayhurn P. Nicholls D.G. Brown Adipose Tissue. Edward Arnold Publishers, London1986: 152-213Google Scholar, 3Giralt M. Martı́n I. Iglesias R. Viñas O. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), other biological factors are expected to be involved in determining brown fat differentiation, including the onset of UCP1 gene transcription. Potential candidates as regulatory factors are thyroid hormones, since complete maturation of BAT thyroid status is achieved during late fetal development (6Tuca A. Giralt M. Villarroya F. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), due to a high activity of type 2 iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase (D2) necessary for local generation of active thyroid hormone T3 (7Giralt M.

Calvo R. Escobar del Rey F. Morreale de Escobar G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E625-E631PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, there is general agreement on the involvement of T3 in controlling mitochondrial biogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms responsible are not well characterized (9Pillar T.M. Seitz H.J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that endogenous T3 is required for BAT optimal thermogenic function (10Bianco A.C. Silva J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), including T3 action through nuclear thyroid receptors (T3R) to up-regulate UCP1 gene expression (11Rabelo R. Schifman A. Rubio A. Sheng X. Silva J.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Other nuclear receptor-mediated pathways have also been implicated in the regulation of UCP1 gene transcription, such as retinoic acid receptors (12Alvarez R. de Andrés J. Yubero P. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Giralt M. Villarroya F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ (PPARα and -γ) (13Barberà M.J. Schlüter A. Pedraza N. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1486-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and also in promoting brown fat adipogenesis, such as PPARγ (14Tai T.A.C. Jennermann C. Brown K.K. Oliver B.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Wilkison W.O. Brown H.R. Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Morris D.C. Graves R.A. J. Biol.

The PPARγ coactivator-1 (PGC-1), which is highly expressed in brown but not in white fat, is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and it activates UCP1 gene transcription probably by co-activating nuclear receptors (13Barberà M.J.

Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors has also been described to induce transcription of the UCP1 gene (16Yubero P. Manchado C. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Mampel T. Viñas O. Iglesias R. Giralt M. Villarroya F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and is suggested to play an important role in the development of BAT (17Manchado C. Yubero P. Viñas O. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Giralt M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). C/EBP are transcription factors of the basic leucine zipper family. Several members of the C/EBP family (such as C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ) have been described to have tissue-restricted expression patterns and to display similar dimerization specificities and to recognize a common DNA-binding element (18Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 19Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). C/EBPα is most abundantly expressed in brown and white adipose tissues, placenta, and liver (20Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence in cell culture systems led to the consideration that C/EBPα is a master regulator of white adipose tissue (WAT) development (19Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Thus, C/EBPα overexpression in cultured cells caused adipose differentiation (21Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 22Lin F.T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and the expression of C/EBPα antisense RNA blocked this process (23Lin F.T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, since cell lines differentiate almost exclusively to WAT, little is known about brown adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, it is not known to what extent the observations on adipogenic transcription factor activation in cultured cells are relevant to adipocyte differentiation in vivo. Mice with targeted disruption of transcription factor genes are unique tools to dissect their role on adipose tissue ontogenesis. Mice with a deletion in the gene for C/EBPα die shortly after birth due to severe hypoglycemia and defective hepatic glycogen storage and gluconeogenesis (24Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A., Ou, C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Knockout mice lacking C/EBPα do not have discernible WAT (24Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A., Ou, C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 25Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The first histological analysis of BAT in the C/EBPα-deficient neonates showed a great reduction of fat depots, together with impairment of UCP1 mRNA expression (24Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A., Ou, C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Late fetal development of BAT constitutes a unique model to study brown adipocyte differentiation in vivo. The aim of the present study was to establish the role of C/EBPα in this process by transmission electronic microscopy and gene expression analyses in homozygous C/EBPα-null mice and in a transgenic C/EBPα-knockout line expressing C/EBPα only in the liver (26Linhart H.G. Ishimura-Oka K., De Mayo F. Kibe T. Repka D. Poindexter B. Bick R.J. Darlington G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The care and use of mice were in accordance with the European Community Council Directive 86/609/EEC and approved by the Comitè Ètic d'Experimentació Animal of the University of Barcelona. Heterozygous female mice with a targeted deletion in the gene for C/EBPα (24Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A., Ou, C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) were mated with heterozygous males, and the day of pregnancy was determined by the presence of a vaginal plug (day 0). For studies in fetuses, cesarean sections of pregnant mice were performed on day 16, 17, or 18 of gestation. For studies in neonates, pups were studied at 2–4 h after birth. Mice were killed by decapitation and genotyped by Southern blot (24Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A., Ou, C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). BAT was collected from the interscapular region. BAT, liver, and heart were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until RNA or proteins were isolated for analysis. Wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice were taken from the same litter in each experiment. When possible, samples from two or three pups were pooled for each experimental situation. At least three different litters were analyzed independently for each developmental age. Transgenic mice that express C/EBPα under the control of the albumin enhancer/promoter were generated as described (26Linhart H.G. Ishimura-Oka K., De Mayo F. Kibe T. Repka D. Poindexter B. Bick R.J. Darlington G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This line was bred into the C/EBPα knockout strain to generate mice that express C/EBPα in the liver but in no other tissue. Pups were studied on day 2 or 7 after birth and genotyped as described previously (26Linhart H.G. Ishimura-Oka K., De Mayo F. Kibe T. Repka D. Poindexter B. Bick R.J. Darlington G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Transgenic wild-type (TG+, C/EBPα+/+) and homozygous (TG+, C/EBPα−/−) mice were taken from the same litter in each experiment, and at least three different litters were analyzed independently for each postnatal age. BAT, heart, and liver samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.8% FeCNK in phosphate buffer. After dehydration in a graded acetone series, tissue samples were embedded in Spurr resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Hitachi H600AB transmission electron microscopy at 75 kV. Two mice were analyzed for each developmental age and genotype. BAT was sliced to obtain a reference horizontal plane. Subsamples from first slicing were systematically rotated before postfixation and inclusion in Spurr resin as above. For each experimental condition, at least three sections from each of three different blocks from each tissue sample were systematically assessed. The percentage of mitochondrial volume in relation to cell volume (Volmit/Volcell) was estimated following the volume density method (27Weibel E.R. Stereological Methods. 1. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 23-57Google Scholar), and surface density (Sv) was estimated following the vertical sections method (28Baddeley A.J. Gundersen H.J.G. Cruz-Orive L.M. J. Microsc. 1986; 142: 259-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). After estimation of Sv of both inner and external mitochondrial membrane in relation to mitochondrial volume, the surface ratio between membranes was calculated as follows:SIMM/SEMM = SV IMM/Volmit × (SV EMM/Volmit)−1. The surface density of inner mitochondrial membrane per cell was calculated usingSV IMM/Volmit and Volmit/Volcell parameters. Total RNA was extracted using the Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For Northern blot analysis, 10–15 μg of total RNA was denatured, electrophoresed on 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (N+; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equal loading of gels was checked by ethidium bromide staining and hybridization with an 18 S rRNA probe. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out as described (29Valmaseda A. Carmona M.C. Barberà M.J. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Blots were stripped and rehybridized sequentially as required in each case. Autoradiographs were quantified by densitometric analysis (Phoretics; Millipore Corp.). BAT was homogenized in buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 0.2 msucrose (17Manchado C. Yubero P. Viñas O. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Mampel T. Giralt M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (nuclear extract), and supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 8500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (mitochondrial extract). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the micromethod of Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For Western blot analysis, samples containing 40 μg of nuclear or mitochondrial protein were mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS loading buffer, incubated at 90 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on SDS/12% (nuclear) or 15% (mitochondrial) polyacrylamide gels. Coomassie Blue staining of gels was performed systematically and showed similar patterns of major nuclear or mitochondrial proteins in the different extracts, thus indicating similar overall quality. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.), and immunological detection was performed using the following antisera: rabbit antiserum for C/EBPα, kindly provided by Dr. S. L. McKnight; antiserum against C/EBPβ (C-19) or C/EBPδ (C-22) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; monoclonal antibodies specific for cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (A-6409) and subunit I (A-6403) from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR); and rabbit antiserum specific for UCP1, kindly provided by Dr. E. Rial. Immunoreactive material was detected using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiographs were quantified by densitometric analysis (Phoretics; Millipore). According to previously established procedures, total DNA from interscapular BAT was prepared, and, after digestion with EcoRI endonuclease, 20 μg of DNA was subjected to Southern blot analysis, using the DNA for the 16 S rRNA as labeled probe (30Martin I. Giralt M. Viñas O. Iglesias R. Mampel T. Villarroya F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For nuclear DNA, the blot was hybridized with the murine C/EBPβ genomic probe (31Screpanti I. Romani L. Musiani P. Modesti A. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Sellitto C. Scarpa S. Bellavia D. Lattanzio G. Bistoni F. Frati L. Cortese R. Gulino A. Ciliberto G. Costantini F. Poli V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1932-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Determination of tissue T3 content and iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase activity were carried out as previously described (8Obregón M.J. Ruiz de Oña C. Hernández A. Calvo R. Escobar del Rey F. Morreale de Escobar G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E625-E631PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the small amount of interscapular BAT during fetal life, determination of T3 content required pools of 2–4 tissues/sample. Thyroid hormone concentration was determined in chloroform/methanol-purified tissue extracts using a specific and highly sensitive radioimmunoassay for T3 (8Obregón M.J. Ruiz de Oña C. Hernández A. Calvo R. Escobar del Rey F. Morreale de Escobar G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E625-E631PubMed Google Scholar). Activity of iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase was assayed in BAT homogenates by quantifying the 125I− released from [125I]T4 (8Obregón M.J. Ruiz de Oña C. Hernández A. Calvo R. Escobar del Rey F. Morreale de Escobar G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: E625-E631PubMed Google Scholar). Where appropriate, statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test, and significance is indicated. To study whether lack of C/EBPα affects differentiation of brown adipocytes in vivo, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of developing BAT from C/EBPα-null mice was performed and compared with their wild-type and heterozygous littermates (see Fig.1). In heterozygous mice, BAT morphology, as well as further results analyzed in the present work, were similar to the wild-type ones (data not shown). BAT section of wild-type mice at birth showed the characteristic ultrastructural morphology of mature brown adipocytes, which is multilocular lipid droplets; abundant clusters of glycogen; and high number, size, and mature morphology of mitochondria that fully filled the rest of cytoplasm. This morphological terminal differentiation of BAT cells occurred rapidly from day 17 of fetal life. At this stage, cells were smaller, with a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, small lipid droplets and clusters of glycogen and reduced size and number of mitochondria. When comparing with BAT sections of C/EBPα-null littermates, an impaired morphological differentiation was observed at any stage; cells were smaller (cellular area was less than 50% that of the wild-type one, at any stage) and with high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. C/EBPα-null cells also failed to accumulate fat and had reduced clusters of glycogen and number of mitochondria. Furthermore, as described below, C/EBPα-null mitochondria had reduced size and immature morphology. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the impaired morphological differentiation of C/EBPα-null BAT, we first examined the expression of genes whose functions are related to thermogenesis and adipose metabolism. As depicted in Fig.2A, the pattern of mRNA expression for UCP1 increased abruptly from day 17 of fetal life, just when it started as we previously described (32Carmona M.C., A. Valmaseda A. Brun S. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Giralt M. Villarroya F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In C/EBPα-null mice, expression of UCP1 mRNA was absent in fetal BAT and only minimal in neonatal BAT. Concordant data were obtained by immunoblot analysis of UCP1 protein levels in mitochondria isolated from developing BAT (data not shown). The expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene, a key enzyme in glyceroneogenesis and also target gene for C/EBPα transactivation (33Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), was impaired in fetal C/EBPα-null BAT but recovered by nearly 50% of wild type in neonates. The expression of other adipogenic markers such as adipocyte-fatty acid-binding protein, lipoprotein lipase, and glucose transporter-4 genes was delayed in C/EBPα-null fetuses but recovered in neonates. In contrast, β-actin mRNA expression was unaltered in the C/EBPα-null mice. Thus, differentiation-dependent expression of genes involved in thermogenic and adipogenic BAT function was either impaired or delayed in the absence of C/EBPα. We next analyzed whether the expression of other transcription regulators involved in adipocyte differentiation was affected by lack of C/EBPα. As shown in Fig. 2B, mRNA levels of PPARγ and of adipocyte determination and differentiation-dependent factor-1 (also called sterol regulatory binding protein-1) were reduced in fetal C/EBPα-null BAT but recovered at birth. A similar profile of expression was observed for the PPARα gene, high expression of which is a differential feature of BAT with respect to WAT and related to its high capacity of lipid oxidation (29Valmaseda A. Carmona M.C. Barberà M.J. Viñas O. Mampel T. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Giralt M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 154: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, ubiquitously expressed PPARδ/β mRNA was unchanged in C/EBPα-null BAT. Taken together, the present findings indicate that besides a direct role of C/EBPα in regulating brown adipocyte gene expression, an indirect effect through its regulation upon expression of other adipogenic transcription factors can also be involved. As indicated above, TEM analyses of developing BAT sections showed defective mitochondrial maturation in C/EBPα-null mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, mitochondrial maturation during perinatal development was observed in wild-type BAT: mitochondrial size increased, and internal membranes (cristae) were more developed and acquired their characteristic parallel orientation. The stereological quantitation of the surface density of inner mitochondrial membrane per cell, an index of oxidative capacity, showed a significant increase from late fetal to neonatal stage (see Table I). In contrast, not only the percentage of cytoplasm occupied by mitochondria was significantly lower in C/EBPα-null BAT (Table I), but further, mitochondrial morphology was defective, with few and randomly oriented cristae (Fig. 3A). C/EBPα-null mitochondria had significantly lower surface density of inner membrane both per external membrane (index of mitochondrial maturation) and per cell volume (index of cell oxidative capacity) when compared with wild-type values at any developmental stage (Table I).Table IStereological analysis of BAT during perinatal development of wild-type (+/+) and C/EBP α-null (−/−) miceDevelopmental stageGenotypeVolmin/Volcell1-aVolmin/Volcell, percentage of cell volume occupied by mitochondria.Surface ratioSIMM/SEMM1-bSIMM / SEMM, surface of inner mitochondrial membrane with respect to surface of external mitochondrial membrane.Surface density SIMM/Volcell1-cSIMM / Volcell, surface density of inner mitochondrial membrane per cell.%μm2/μm2μm2/μm3Fetus day 17+/+54 ± 27.88 ± 0.384.14 ± 0.24Fetus day 17−/−15 ± 1***2.73 ± 0.13***0.38 ± 0.02***At birth+/+63 ± 1##9.05 ± 0.655.52 ± 0.39#At birth−/−43 ± 2***###2.88 ± 0.27***1.48 ± 0.20***###1-a Volmin/Volcell, percentage of cell volume occupied by mitochondria.1-b SIMM / SEMM, surface of inner mitochondrial membrane with respect to surface of external mitochondrial membrane.1-c SIMM / Volcell, surface density of inner mitochondrial membrane per cell.

Mature mitochondrial morphology was observed in heart of both genotypes (Fig.3B). In liver, and despite its immature morphology of mitochondria, no obvious differences between genotypes were observed (Fig. 3B). Thus, mitochondrial biogenesis impairment appears to be specific to BAT development. As a second experimental approach to assess the role of C/EBPα on mitochondrial biogenesis in developing BAT, we performed Northern and Western blot analyses of gene expression for components of the respiratory chain/oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Cytochrome oxidase subunits were used as markers of OXPHOS capacity as well as of nuclear versusmitochondrial genome-encoded genes for mitochondrial proteins. As seen in Fig. 4A (left), mRNA expression of both the nuclear encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COIV) and the mitochondrial encoded subunit I (COI) was delayed in C/EBPα-null BAT. Fur"

We have shown previously that lithium is highly toxic to yeast when grown in galactose medium mainly due to inhibition of phosphoglucomutase, an enzyme responsible for the entry of galactose into glycolysis. We show that conditions that revert inhibition of phosphoglucomutase also revert inhibition of protein synthesis. Interestingly, glucose starvation leads to loss of polysomes but not to dissociation of eIF4A from the preinitiation complexes.

Lithium is a drug that has been used for the last 5 decades to treat manic-depressive disorder (1Schou M. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1997; 4: 9-13Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Yeast cells adapt to high osmolarity by changing the protein expression patterns (2Rep M. Krantz M. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. J. Biol.

We have observed previously that lithium toxicity is dependent on the carbohydrate source used for growth (5Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholar). Lithium toxicity in galactose medium is not related to osmotic stress because concentrations as low as 15 mm are lethal. Galactose is metabolized in yeast, as in humans, by the Leloir pathway during glycolysis. We have shown that one of the main targets of lithium toxicity in galactose is phosphoglucomutase, the enzyme that converts reversibly glucose-1-P to glucose-6-P (6Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholar). Because phosphoglucomutase is an essential protein for galactose metabolism, its inhibition impairs glycolysis and leads to cell death. In glucose-grown cells inhibition of phosphoglucomutase by lithium reduces the levels of UDP-glucose, and consequently, the biosynthetic pathways that use this key metabolite are impaired (6Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholar). We have recently cloned the Ser-Thr phosphatase, SIT4, that when overexpressed confers lithium tolerance in galactose medium. We have observed that SIT4 acts in a parallel pathway not involving induction of transcription of the Na+ transporterENA1; it does not involve extrusion of lithium from the cells but alters the monovalent cation homeostasis and internal pH (5Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this work we have cloned another gene, TIF2, that when overexpressed confers lithium tolerance in galactose medium.TIF2 encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in the initiation of protein synthesis, homologous to mammalian eIF4A1 (7Linder P. Slonimski P.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Linder P. Slonimski P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1989; 86: 6043-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and here will be referred to as eIF4A. Protein synthesis is metabolically important for cell growth and division. This process responds to the nutritional state of the cell and to stress signals (10Rohde J. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Several pathways transduce these signals and modify the protein synthesis machinery. Protein synthesis can be divided into the following three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. The initiation step is specifically regulated, and the main targets are the initiation factors eIF2α and eIF4E (11Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF2α is a subunit of the factor eIF2 that binds to Met-tRNA and GTP. GTP is hydrolyzed upon formation of the 43 S preinitiation complex and recognition of the initiation codon in the mRNA. The eIF2α-GDP complex is recycled to eIF2α-GTP by eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by amino acid starvation leads to inhibition of protein synthesis, and GTP is not recycled (11Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4 proteins are involved in unwinding of the secondary structure of mRNA and thus facilitate its binding to the 43 S preinitiation complex (12Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). The proteins required for this event are eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B. eIF4F is composed of three subunits as follows: p220 (eIF4G), p46 (eIF4A), and p24 (eIF4E). eIF4E phosphorylation up-regulates protein synthesis (11Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4A is a 46-kDa protein that belongs to the DEAD/DEHX box family of helicases (12Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown (13Yoder-Hill J. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5566-5573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that eIF4A coexists in the free form and bound to eIF4F. Activity of eIF4A is stimulated by eIF4H and by increasing mRNA binding, and eIF4B stimulates its helicase activity (14Rogers G.W., Jr. Richter N.J. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30914-30922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In yeast cells two homologues of eIF4A have been cloned, TIF1 and TIF2. These two are identical at the protein level, and deletion of both is lethal to the cell (7Linder P. Slonimski P.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this work we show a novel regulation of protein synthesis by induction of expression eIF4A. We show that lithium inhibits protein synthesis and that overexpression of eIF4A reverts this inhibition. This effect is related to phosphoglucomutase inhibition and to the Ser-Thr phosphatase SIT4. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue was used for plasmid construction. S. cerevisiae strainsR757 (MATα, his 4-15, ura 3-52, lys 9, hol1), and FY833 (MATa, his3Δ200, ura3-52, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202, trp1Δ63, GAL2+) that were kindly provided by Dr. M. Ghislain were used. Strains JF291-PGM2 (Matα, leu2,3-112, his3-1, ura3-52, PGM1, PGM2,pGAL-PGM2) and FY833-SIT4 (MATa, his3Δ200, ura3-52, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202, trp1Δ63, GAL2+, pGAL-SIT4) were described previously (5Masuda C.A.

Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholar). FY833-TIF2 (MATa, his3Δ200, ura3-52, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202, trp1Δ63, GAL2+, pGAL-TIF2) was constructed by transforming strain FY833 with plasmid pRN93-TIF2 as described below. Wild type strain R757 was transformed with an expression cDNA library under control of a galactose-inducible promoter (15Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed cells were plated in minimal medium (YNB-gal) containing the following: YNB 6.7 g/liter, galactose 2%, his, ura, lys, and methionine 0.003%, and 30 mm LiSO4. Only six recombinants expressing a protein conferring lithium resistance were able to overcome the lithium stress. The plasmid from the selected colonies was isolated, and the DNA insert was subcloned in pBlueScript SK+ and sequenced using AutoRead Sequencing Kit and ALF DNA Sequencer (AmershamBiosciences). The sequence was compared with the known open reading frames from the SG database. The DNA insert of the selected clone was subcloned in the expression vector pRN93 (kindly donated by Dr. C. W. Slayman from Yale University), which contains a GAL1 promoter and the URA3 gene marker. This plasmid was named pRN93-TIF2. This plasmid was used to transform strain FY833 by the lithium acetate method (16Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 1.0) on YP-galactose medium and incubated with 6 mm LiCl. An aliquot of 0.1 ml was withdrawn, and 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine (200 Ci/mmol) was added. Incorporation was stopped with 1 n NaOH and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% was added together with 2% bovine serum albumin. The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration using Whatman GF/A glass fiber filters. For determination of incorporation the filter was counted on a Packard 1600CA counter using scintillation mixture. Yeast cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 1.0) on YP-galactose medium and incubated with 6 mm LiCl. An aliquot of 3 ml was collected and washed twice with 2% galactose. Cells were resuspended in 700 μl of 2% galactose plus 20 μm [35S]methionine (6000 cpm/nmol) at 30 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn after 3, 6, or 10 min of incubation and diluted in 1 ml of 20 mm ice-cold methionine. Cells were collected by vacuum filtration using 0.45 μm HA Millipore filters. For determination of uptake the filter was counted on a Packard 1600CA counter using scintillation mixture. Polyclonal antiserum was raised against GST-eIF4A, a fusion of glutathione S-transferase protein and the first 40 amino acids encoded by the TIF2gene. These first 40 amino acids are the most variable among yeast RNA helicases but are identical to TIF1 gene. To obtain the 5′ end of the TIF2, genomic DNA was amplified using the following primers. The upstream primer was 5′ cg gga tcc atg tct gaa ggt att act gat 3′, which introduces a BamHI site shown in italics, and the downstream primer 5′cg ctc gag tta acc gaa aac acc tct taa 3′, which introduces an XhoI site shown in italics and a termination codon. The PCR product was subcloned in pBluescript II SK (Stratagene) for sequencing using the Auto Read Sequencing kit and the ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). After confirming the sequence, the PCR product was subcloned into plasmid pGEX 4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) into the BamHI and XhoI sites, and the E. coli strain XL1-Blue was transformed. Expression of the protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified in a glutathione-agarose column as indicated by the manufacturer. A first subcutaneous injection of 200 μg of purified protein was given to a New Zealand rabbit, accompanied by complete Freund's adjuvant. Other boosts at 3-week intervals were given with an equal amount of GST-eIF4A protein and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The rabbit was sacrificed, and the serum was tested in immunoblot using a dilution of 1:10,000. The serum recognizes a unique band of ∼45 kDa in a total yeast extract as expected for eIF4A. As a control, pre-immune serum was used and did not recognize this band. Samples were separated in a 7.5% SDS-acrylamide gel (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) using the Mini-Protean II (Bio-Rad). Electrotransfer of protein from the gel to Immobilon-P was performed for 15 min at 250 mA per gel in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 5% methanol using a Trans-Blot SD apparatus from Bio-Rad. Membranes were blocked with 3% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight with eIF4A antibody (1:10,000 dilution). The membranes were washed, and blots were revealed with ECL as indicated by the manufacturer. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Yeast cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase. Fifteen minutes before harvesting the cells, cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml, and the polysome profile was analyzed in a 15–45% sucrose gradient as reported previously (19Tuite J.F. Stansfield I. Planta R.J. Methods Microbiol. 1988; 26: 351-373Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Lithium is toxic to S. cerevisiae at concentrations as low as 10 mm when grown in galactose but not to yeast grown in other carbon sources such as glucose, sucrose, ethanol, or glycerol (6Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholar). In a previous work (5Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) we have screened a cDNA expression library under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter for clones that conferred lithium resistance in YNB galactose medium. We have reported the isolation of the gene SIT4 and partially characterized its involvement in lithium resistance. In this work we show the characterization of a second clone isolated from the same screen that after sequencing was identified as TIF2. This gene encodes the translation initiation factor known in mammals as eIF4A. As shown in Fig.1A, overexpression ofTIF2 confers resistance to low lithium concentrations. The involvement of a translation initiation factor on lithium stress led us to study the effect of lithium on protein synthesis. In Fig. 1B we show that incorporation of [35S]methionine into acid-precipitable protein was inhibited by addition of 6 mmlithium in a time-dependent manner. After 2 h of lithium incubation, [35S]methionine incorporation is 90% inhibited. Overexpression of TIF2 partially reverts this inhibition to 65%. In contrast to galactose, [35S]methionine incorporation in glucose-grown cells is not inhibited by addition of 50 mm LiCl (Fig.1B). It is important to point out that inhibition of [35S]methionine incorporation could also be due to a reduction of the total methionine pool. We measured [35S]methionine uptake, and our results show that incubation of cells for 2 h in 6 mm lithium leads to a reduction of [35S]methionine uptake from an initial rate of 0.613 ± 0.094 to 0.323 ± 0.071 nmol/min/mg dry weight (n = 3). Although [35S]methionine uptake is inhibited by lithium (50% inhibition), incorporation is much more affected (90% inhibition) under the same experimental condition (Fig.1B) indicating that lithium inhibits protein synthesis at another step. We studied by polysome analysis the step at which translation is inhibited by lithium. When the wild type strain was grown in galactose and incubated for 4 h in 30 mm lithium, there was a marked increase in the level of 80 S ribosomes and a decline in the level of translating polysomes indicating that it is inhibited at the initiation step (Fig. 2). This effect is not seen even by the addition of a lethal dose of LiCl (250 mm) to glucose-grown cells (Fig. 2) confirming the result of methionine incorporation. Yeast was incubated with a sub-lethal dose of lithium (6 mm), and the effect of eIF4A overexpression and its localization were studied (Fig.3). Analysis of the polysome profile of eIF4A-overexpressing cells shows that increasing the amount of eIF4A reverts partially the accumulation of monosomes and increases the amount of polysomes (Fig. 3C) in comparison with the wild type cells treated with lithium (Fig. 3B). To determine the association of eIF4A to preinitiation complex, the fractions of the sucrose gradient were analyzed by immunoblot using an antibody raised against yeast eIF4A. Interestingly, we show that eIF4A in wild type yeast growing in the absence of lithium sedimented at the same position as ribosomal subunits (fractions 1–10, Fig. 3A) indicating association with the preinitiation complex. However, upon incubation with lithium it is only present in the top of the gradient (fractions 1–4, Fig. 3B). These results suggest that lithium induces eIF4A dissociation from the preinitiation complex. In Fig.3C we show that upon overexpression of eIF4A this effect is reverted. Even in the presence of lithium, eIF4A is present on the first 10 fractions as shown for the wild type cells grown in the absence of lithium and in higher amounts. These results suggest that the increase in the amount of eIF4A is an important factor in regulation of protein synthesis. Induction of transcripts involved in protein synthesis is a response of yeast to high salinity (4Yale J. Bohnert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15996-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We determined by Western blot whether expression of eIF4A is regulated by lithium stress (Fig.4). eIF4A was induced by sublethal concentrations of lithium (6 and 15 mm). The induction of expression of eIF4A is time- and dose-dependent (Fig.4B). These results suggest that overexpression of eIF4A might be a physiological response to lithium stress in galactose medium. Inhibition of protein synthesis at the initiation step has been show to occur after depletion of glucose or fructose (20Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Ashe M.P., De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In a previous report (6Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholar) we have shown that lithium inhibits with high affinity phosphoglucomutase, an essential enzyme for galactose metabolism. We tested whether inhibition of protein synthesis by lithium is linked to inhibition of phosphoglucomutase and, thus, to reduced glycolytic flux. In vivo inhibition of phosphoglucomutase by lithium is reverted by overexpression ofPGM2 or addition of high concentrations of Mg2+to the medium (6Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholar). We treated wild type yeast cells on the presence of 100 mm Mg2+ or yeast overexpressingPGM2 with 6 mm lithium. After different time intervals cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and incorporation into acid-precipitable material was measured. Results show that inhibition of protein synthesis was reverted in these conditions (Fig. 5A). Polysome analysis (Fig. 5B) shows that the polysome profile is normal in cells treated with lithium in the presence of 100 mmMgCl2. These results clearly show that inhibition of protein synthesis is linked to inhibition of phosphoglucomutase activity by lithium. As a control, we tested whether the effect of overexpression ofTIF2 on protein synthesis is due to protection of glycolysis (Table I). InTIF2-overexpressing and in wild type cells the production of ethanol was inhibited ∼65%. These results indicate that overexpression of TIF2 interferes with the effect of lithium only on the rate of protein synthesis but not on fermentation.Table ILithium inhibits fermentation in galactose grown cellsStrainFermentation rateControl+ 6 mm LiClnmol ethanol/10 min/mg dry weightFY8331.65 ± 0.400.52 ± 0.23FY833-TIF21.29 ± 0.400.44 ± 0.07FY833-SIT41.42 ± 0.420.52 ± 0.19 Open table in a new tab SIT4, a type 1/type 2A-related protein phosphatase, is involved in the response to nitrogen starvation (22Di Como C.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34441-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Overexpression ofSIT4 confers lithium resistance in galactose medium (5Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We tested whether this lithium resistance is linked to protection of the inhibition of protein synthesis. Overexpression of SIT4partially protects protein synthesis from lithium inhibition. This is shown by measuring incorporation of [35S]methionine into acid-precipitable material (Fig.6A) or by polysome analysis (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of the polysome fractions shows that eIF4A sediments with ribosomal subunit fractions even in the presence of lithium in SIT4overexpressing strain. Our results show that overexpression ofSIT4 stimulates sedimentation of eIF4A with preinitiation complex. SIT4 could enhance protein synthesis by overcoming inhibition of the glycolytic flux by lithium. However, data in Table Ishow that this is not the case because the glycolytic flux of cells overexpressing SIT4 is also inhibited 65% as shown above for the wild type strain. These results indicate that overexpression ofSIT4 does not revert inhibition of glycolysis by lithium but is probably involved on the signaling pathway controlling protein synthesis. Lithium treatment in galactose-grown cells leads to inhibition of protein synthesis as has been shown for glucose starvation (20Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Ashe M.P., De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In order to test if these two treatments lead to the dissociation of eIF4A from the preinitiation complexes, we have imposed glucose starvation in the absence of lithium by shifting cells to 0.05% glucose (Fig.7). Interestingly, glucose starvation leads to a loss of polysomes but not to dissociation of eIF4A from the preinitiation complexes. At this condition eIF4A is accumulated on the fractions corresponding to the monosome (80 S) peak (Fig 7B). This result shows that the translational response to lithium treatment in galactose-grown cells is different from the response to glucose starvation. Furthermore we show that neither overexpression of SIT4 (Fig. 7C) nor eIF4A (Fig.7D) reverts inhibition of initiation of translation under glucose starvation. Besides the beneficial therapeutic effects of lithium, toxic effects have also been studied. In fact, the first studies on lithium action were on phenotypic effects on development. LiCl induces vegetalization in sea urchin embryos (26Berg W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 50: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and inhibits the formation of the dorsal-ventral axis in Xenopus laevis embryos (27Kao K.R. Masui Y. Elinson R.P. Nature. 1986; 322: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and the cell fate determination in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Wolcott (28Wolcott D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 137: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) demonstrated that vegetalization was induced only to impaired protein synthesis and not to mRNA degradation. Developmental defects have also been related to the inhibition ofGSK-3β, a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase implicated in cell-fate determination and hormonal signaling (29Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we have shown that lithium inhibits translation initiation in cells grown in galactose and that overexpression of eIF4A partially reverts this effect and confers lithium resistance (Figs. 1 and 2). Inhibition of translation is not observed in glucose-growing cells even at a lethal dose of lithium (Fig. 2). These results suggest that lithium is not inhibiting directly an enzyme of the protein synthesis machinery. Inhibition must be due to an indirect effect of lithium. We have shown that lithium inhibits phosphoglucomutase activity and the glycolytic flux when galactose is used as the carbon source (see Ref. 6Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholarand this work). We have shown that overexpression of phosphoglucomutase activity or reversion of its inhibition by high MgCl2concentrations protected protein synthesis from lithium inhibition (Fig. 5). These findings suggest that inhibition of protein synthesis by lithium is linked to the inhibition of glycolysis. We have also shown that the two genes we have cloned, TIF2 and SIT4, that confer lithium resistance do not stimulate glycolysis but stimulate protein synthesis (Figs. 2 and 6 and Table I). The process by which eIF4A regulates the rate of protein synthesis is not clear yet. In mammalian cells eIF4A is found in the free form and associated to eIF4F (12Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that it interacts directly with eIF4G (30Dominguez D. Altmann M. Benz J. Baumann U. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26720-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two different modes of regulation of eIF4F complex have been described in yeast. The first one involves the yeast eIF4E-binding protein p20 (4E-BP) that binds to eIF4E, displaces eIF4G, and therefore dissociates the eIF4F factor (31Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The second involves proteolysis of eIF4G that depends on the TOR pathway (32Berset C. Trachsel H. Altmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4264-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our results show that eIF4A is normally distributed along the sucrose gradient on fractions that contain the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits and on top of the gradient where no ribosomal RNA is present. Upon lithium addition, it is only found on the top of the gradient (Fig. 3, A and B). This result suggests that the fraction of eIF4A associated to preinitiation complexes disappears. Upon induction of eIF4A expression the dissociation is reverted, and inhibition of protein synthesis is partially restored. Therefore, another factor that might regulate initiation of protein synthesis is the induction of expression of eIF4A. In mouse two eIF4A proteins are expressed, eIF4AI and eIF4AII. The ratio of mRNA levels that encode for these two proteins varies among tissues, and it has been postulated that its concentration could influence the initiation process (33Nielsen P.J. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2097-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). RNA helicase activity is also induced by binding of eIF4A to eIF4F (14Rogers G.W., Jr. Richter N.J. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30914-30922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 34Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), eIF4B, and eIF4H (14Rogers G.W., Jr. Richter N.J. Lima W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30914-30922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Our results show that cells physiologically respond to lithium stress up-regulating expression of eIF4A. This might be important for protein synthesis regulation becauseTIF2/eIF4A overexpression confers lithium tolerance (Fig.4). However, the induction pathway involved in this up-regulation is not known. Here we present evidence that SIT4, a component of the TOR pathway, is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis in response to lithium stress. SIT4 overexpression confers lithium resistance in galactose medium (5Masuda C.A. Ramirez J. Peña A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30957-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and protects translation initiation from inhibition (Fig. 6). Sit4p associates with several regulatory subunits. Association with Tap42p (22Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 35Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) regulates initiation of protein synthesis signaled by the TOR kinase pathway. Sit4p-Tap42p complex is dissociated when cells are deprived of amino acids or when treated with the drug rapamycin, leading to inhibition of translation (24Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SIT4 or mutation of TAP42(tap42-11) confer resistance to rapamycin by maintaining its association (24Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The regulation of protein synthesis downstream of Sit4p-Tap42p is not well understood, but it was shown that rapamycin treatment leads to degradation of the initiation factor eIF4G (32Berset C. Trachsel H. Altmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4264-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here we show that localization of eIF4A is modulated bySIT4. Overexpression of SIT4 leads to eIF4A association to preinitiation complexes even in the presence of lithium (Fig. 6). These results suggests that the dissociation of eIF4A from preinitiation complex induced by lithium might involve eIF4G degradation. In S. cerevisiae different signals have been reported to inhibit protein synthesis such as amino acid deprivation, depletion of purine (36Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 37Rolfes R.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5099-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and depletion of glucose (20Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Ashe M.P., De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Here we show that protein synthesis is also inhibited when glycolysis is halted at the step catalyzed by phosphoglucomutase in galactose-growing cells. We have tested whether glucose starvation leads to dissociation of eIF4A from the preinitiation complexes as shown for lithium. Surprisingly, glucose starvation leads to polysome loss but not dissociation of eIF4A (Fig. 7). In fact eIF4A accumulates in the monosome fraction during glucose starvation. This result suggests that initiation complex is not dissociated during glucose starvation, whereas lithium dissociates eIF4A. Glucose sensing involves several well characterized pathways; however, it is difficult to differentiate between the mechanisms exerted by extracellular glucose or by intermediate metabolites of glycolysis (reviewed in Refs. 38Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar and 39Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Ashe et al. (21Ashe M.P., De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) has related three signaling pathways to inhibition of protein synthesis derived from glucose depletion, cAMP, SNF1, and SNF/RGT2, because mutations within these pathways overcome inhibition of protein synthesis. They also show that the TOR pathway is not involved in the response to glucose starvation. They have used the tap42-11mutant (resistant to rapamycin) and showed that this mutant does not protect from loss of polyribosomes upon glucose removal. Our results contrast with those published by Ashe et al. (21Ashe M.P., De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) because overexpression of SIT4 protects from loss of polyribosomes when glycolysis is blocked by lithium. These results clearly show that there is a distinction between glucose depletion versus the intracellular block to glycolysis caused by lithium and that only the latter is mediated by SIT4. This difference could be due to the existence of extracellular galactose during the block of glycolysis by lithium, accumulation of metabolites such as galactose 1-phosphate at this same condition (6Masuda C.A. Xavier M.A. Mattos K.A. Galina A. Montero-Lomelı́ M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37704-37801Google Scholar), or caused by differences between glucose and galactose sensing by yeast cells. Our data present growing evidence that there is a cross-talk between lithium stress, deprivation of nutrients, and initiation of protein synthesis. We identified TIF2 as a new gene involved in this mechanism. We thank the Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular for help in performing DNA sequencing and cloning."

The RGS in yeast, Sst2, can inhibit a G protein signal leading to mating. In addition, some RGS proteins contain an N-terminal domain of unknown function. Here we use complementary whole genome analysis methods to investigate the function of the N-terminal Sst2 domain. To identify a signaling pathway regulated by N-Sst2, we performed genome-wide transcription profiling of cells expressing this fragment alone and found differences in 53 transcripts. Of these, 40 are induced by N-Sst2, and nearly all contain a stress response element (STRE) in the promoter region. To identify components of a signaling pathway leading from N-Sst2 to STREs, we performed a genome-wide two-hybrid analysis using N-Sst2 as bait and found 17 interacting proteins. To identify the functionally relevant interacting proteins, we analyzed all of the available gene deletion mutants and found three (vps36Δ, pep12Δ, and tlg2Δ) that induce STRE and also repress pheromone-dependent transcription. We selectedVPS36 for further characterization. A vps36Δ mutation diminishes signaling by pheromone as well as by downstream components including the G protein, effector kinase (Ste11), and transcription factor (Ste12). Conversely, overexpression of Vps36 enhances the pheromone response in sst2Δ cells but not in wild type. These findings indicate that Vps36 and Sst2 have opposite and opposing effects on the pheromone and stress response pathways, with Vps36 acting downstream of the G protein and independently of Sst2 RGS activity.

In many cases, signal detection occurs through cell surface receptors coupled to G proteins. One particularly well characterized example is the pheromone response pathway in yeast (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In this case, haploid a and α cell types each secrete a peptide pheromone that binds to receptors on cells of the opposite type. Pheromone stimulation leads to activation of a G protein, which entails GTP binding and dissociation of the Gα and βγ subunits. The Gβγ moiety activates downstream signaling events required for mating, including alterations in gene transcription, morphological and cytoskeletal changes, and cell cycle arrest in G1. Among the induced genes is SST2, which encodes a feedback regulator that stimulates G protein GTPase activity and G protein inactivation (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Over the past 5 years, an extensive family of Sst2-related proteins has been identified in higher eukaryotes (2Burchett S.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1335-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In every instance examined, the region of core-RGS1homology is both necessary and sufficient for G protein GTPase activating function (3Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The RGS protein p115RhoGEF has one domain that acts as a GTPase-accelerating protein for G13α and a second domain that acts as a GDP-GTP exchange factor for RhoA (14Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T.

Other RGS proteins including Egl-10, Eat-16, RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, RGS11, and FlbA, have large N-terminal segments containing a conserved Dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin (DEP) domain (16Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Sst2 has two such DEP regions, composed of residues 50–135 and 279–358. The function of the RGS DEP domains is not known, but in at least two cases (Egl-10, Sst2) they appear necessary and sufficient for membrane localization (17Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar,18Hoffman G.A. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol.

In the case of Sst2, the N-terminal domain can be expressed as a separate entity, the result of an endoproteolytic processing eventin vivo (18Hoffman G.A. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol.

Our objective here was to establish a signaling function for the DEP domain of Sst2, designated N-Sst2. With the completion of the yeast genome sequence, approaches to the identification of new signaling pathways have changed dramatically. Analysis of gene function has become more comprehensive and systematic and can occur at several levels. First, closely related protein isoforms can be identified through sequence similarity analysis or through complementation of gene mutations by functionally similar genes. Second, transcriptional changes can be monitored under various physiological conditions, through the use of RNA hybridization arrays (19Lockhart D.J. Winzeler E.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). Third, signaling complexes can be identified through the use of two-hybrid screens (20Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A., Li, Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M.

Mann M. Hogue C.W. Figeys D. Tyers M. Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar). Fourth, the functional significance of each signaling component can be determined through gene disruption mutations (27Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W., El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). There are, however, limitations to each of these methods. For instance, transcription analysis can reveal how different physiological conditions affect a particular signaling pathway but cannot be used to identify the components of that pathway. Two-hybrid analysis can reveal the components of a pathway, but it cannot be used to determine how physiological changes affect the interactions of each component. Thus, a combined analysis, encompassing multiple whole genome approaches, can provide highly complementary information about any cellular process. For instance, a combination of two different high throughput methods, protein interaction mapping and large scale phenotypic analysis, was recently used to identify novel DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint pathway components in Caenorhabditis elegans (28Boulton S.J. Gartner A. Reboul J. Vaglio P. Dyson N. Hill D.E. Vidal M. Science. 2002; 295: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Here we have used a combination of transcription profiling, protein interaction mapping, and phenotypic analysis of gene disruption mutants to investigate signaling by the N-terminal Sst2 domain. Our findings indicate that N-Sst2 modulates the stress response and does so through proteins not previously recognized to participate in the mating or stress pathways. Standard methods for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria and for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout (29-Google Scholar).

Primers used were 5′-GTG TGT TTT GAA AGT CAT TCT-3′ and 5′-ACG AGC AGG TAA TCA AAC CA-3′ (for VPS36) and 5′-GAA TTG TCT TGT TCA CCA AGG-3′ and 5′-CTG GCC CGC ATT TTT AAT TC-3′ (for STE12). pRS423-HSP12-lacZ was constructed by replacing the FUS1promoter (BamHI-EagI fragment) of pRS423-FUS1-lacZ with the HSP12 promoter (608 bp immediately preceding the initiator AUG), which was isolated through PCR amplification of genomic yeast DNA. The primers used were HSP12F (5′-AAT AAT CGG CCG ATC CCA CTA ACG GCC CAG CC-3′) containing a synthetic EagI site (indicated in boldface type) and HSP12R (5′-G CGC GGA TCC CCA CTT TCT TTA GCC AT TCT TGT TGT ATT TAG TTT TTT TT-3′) containing a syntheticBamHI site, an idealized translation initiation sequence (AXA preceding the initiation codon), and the first five codons of CYC7 (indicated by underlining) fused in frame with codon 10 of the lacZ gene. Oligonucleotides were designed to PCR-amplify the N-terminal portion (amino acids 1–392) of Sst2, using pRS316-ADH-Sst2 as the template, the forward primer (5′-CCG GAA TTC ATG GTG GAT AAA AAT AGG ACG-3′, containing a synthetic EcoRI site, indicated in boldface type), and the reverse primer (5′-GTA CCC ATG GTT ACA TAT GAC CCC TTA ATG TGA A-3′, containing a syntheticNcoI site, indicated in boldface type). The 0.9-kbp product was cloned in frame downstream of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain contained in the yeast two-hybrid bait vector pOBD2 (35Cagney G. Uetz P. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from yeast strains using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and stored at −80 °C. Genomic DNA was removed by DNase digestion of 10 μg of total RNA for 30 min at 37 °C in a 100-μl reaction containing DNase I (1.4 units; Invitrogen), RNase inhibitor (0.1 units; Invitrogen), and dithiothreitol (1 mm) in 1× PCR buffer I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNase was removed by passage through an RNeasy column (Qiagen). Amplified, biotin-labeled cRNA was produced from total RNA as described (36Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M., Ho, M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was incubated for 10 min at 70 °C with a high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site (5′-GGC CAG TGA ATT GTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGG CGG T-3′; from GENSET Inc., La Jolla, CA). Following priming, cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript II cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with the following conditions: 65 min at 50 °C for first strand synthesis with Superscript II reverse transcriptase, followed by 150 min at 16 °C for second strand synthesis with Escherichia coli ligase,E. coli polymerase, and RNase H. cDNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by removal of the organic fraction using Phase Lock Gel I tubes (5 Prime to 3 Prime Inc., Boulder, CO). Biotin-labeled cRNA was transcribed in an in vitro transcription reaction mixture containing T7 RNA polymerase (Epicenter, Madison, WI), bio-11-CTP, and bio-11-UTP (Enzo Laboratories, Farmingdale, NY) for 16 h at 37 °C. The cRNA product was purified by RNeasy column and then quantitated by UV absorbance at 260 nm. 15 μg of cRNA was fragmented for 35 min at 95 °C and then added to a 300-μl hybridization mixture containing bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) and herring sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml; Promega, Madison, WI) in 1× MES. To estimate the sensitivity of the oligonucleotide arrays, we included 11 in vitrosynthesized transcripts (spiked transcripts) in each hybridization (37Hill A.A. Hunter C.P. Tsung B.T. Tucker-Kellogg G. Brown E.L. Science. 2000; 290: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). 200 μl of hybridization mixture was applied to a Ye6100 subA GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and hybridization was allowed to proceed for 20 h at 45 °C on a rotisserie. The sample was then hybridized sequentially to the Ye6100 subB, subC, and subD designs, comprising ∼6400 yeast genes and open reading frames. When hybridization was complete, arrays were stained with streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described (36Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M., Ho, M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was quantitated using the Affymetrix GeneChip laser scanner. The resulting array images were captured in the GeneChip version 3.3 software package and reduced to relative expression values (average difference values) for each transcript. The spiked transcripts were used to generate a standard curve of concentration versustheir average difference values. The abundance of each transcript (stated in terms of control transcripts per total transcripts) ranged from 1:300,000 to 1:1,000, calculated by assuming an average RNA size of 1,000 ribonucleotides. This standard curve was then used to determine the absolute expression level of the yeast transcripts and is presented as RNA copies per million total transcripts. Based on the signal response from these control transcripts, the sensitivity of the arrays ranged between 1:100,000 and 1:200,000. Consequently, expression values below 10 RNA copies per million total transcripts are considered below the limit of accuracy. Final data analysis was performed using Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Pairwise comparisons generated -fold change values. -Fold change values of >4 were considered to be significant. The arrays include probe sets representing the 5′ and 3′ regions of the β-actin transcript. The 5′ to 3′ signal ratios were >0.7 across all arrays, indicating that the source RNA was of suitable quality. Transformants containing the N-Sst2-Gal4 fusion plasmid were mated to a set of ∼6,000 colonies, each expressing a unique full-length open reading frame fused to the Gal4 activation domain, as described previously (20Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A., Li, Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting diploids were transferred to selective plates deficient in histidine and monitored after 10 days. Proteins identified in two independent screens were analyzed further. For NaCl-dependent growth inhibition, saturated cultures were diluted to A 600 ∼ 0.2 and grown toA 600 ∼ 0.8 and then treated with either water or 10 μm α-factor (final concentration) for 2 h. 10 μl of cells were spotted onto solid medium containing 0.75m NaCl (where indicated) either without dilution or diluted 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000, and 1:100,000 with water or with 10 μm α-factor (where indicated). For the pheromone-dependent growth inhibition assay (halo assay), overnight cultures were grown in selective media, and 100 μl was diluted with 2 ml of sterile water, followed by the addition of an equal volume of 1% (w/v) dissolved agar (55 °C), and poured onto an agar plate containing the same medium. Sterile filter discs were spotted with synthetic α-factor pheromone and placed onto the nascent lawn to induce growth arrest. The resulting zone of growth-arrested cells was documented after 2 days. For pheromone-dependent reporter transcription assays (29-Google Scholar), strains were grown for 36 h in standard dextrose-selective medium and then diluted in selective medium containing galactose to induce expression of Vps36, Ste4, or Ste12. Mid-log phase cells were then aliquoted (90 μl) to a 96-well plate and mixed with 10 μl of α-factor for 90 min in quadruplicate. For HSP12 reporter transcription assays, strains were grown in selective medium to mid-log phase and then aliquoted (85 μl) to a 96-well plate and mixed with 15 μl of 5 m NaCl for 10 min in triplicate. Cells to be treated with NaCl were maintained at room temperature instead of 30 °C to reduce basal activity of the stress response promoter. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by adding 20 μl of a freshly prepared solution of 83 μm fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside (Molecular Probes, Inc.; 10 mm stock in Me2SO), 137.5 mmPIPES, pH 7.2, 2.5% Triton X-100, and incubating for 90 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1m Na2CO3, and the resulting fluorescence activity was measured at 485-nm excitation, 530-nm emission. For Hog1 phosphorylation assays, saturated cultures were diluted toA 600 ∼ 0.4, grown for an additional 3–4 h, and treated with 0.75 m NaCl (final concentration) for 10 min, as indicated. Cells were treated with 10 mmNaN3 , chilled briefly on ice, and harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended (1.5 × 106 cells/μl) in 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 10 min. The cells were disrupted by glass bead vortex homogenization for 4 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C. Lysates were reheated at 37 °C for 20 min before SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody (05-321; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 1:1,000 dilution and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) at 1:3,000 dilution, carried out as described (29-Google Scholar). For each gene demonstrated to be differentially expressed in the microarray analysis, a region upstream of the translation start site (to the nearest stop codon, up to 500 bp) was analyzed for sequence motifs representing possible promoter regulatory elements. Most regulatory elements in yeast are found within this region (38Moskvina E. Schuller C. Maurer C.T. Mager W.H. Ruis H. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Alignace was used to search for conserved motifs (39Roth F.P. Hughes J.D. Estep P.W. Church G.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Genespring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) was used to identify predefined motifs. Genespring was also used for statistical analysis, comparing the frequency of a motif in a gene list with the upstream regions of all yeast genes. The Transfac data base (Biobase, Braunschweig, Germany) was used to search for previously identified transcription factor binding sites. A number of Vps36 protein homologues were identified from the nonredundant GenBankTM data base using the advanced BLAST algorithm and the full-length Vps36 protein sequence as the query. PSI-BLAST was used to detect weaker, but nonetheless biologically significant, homologues to Vps36 (40Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments of all the Vps36 homologues were performed with ClustalW (41Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar). The alignment was formatted in Phylip and imported into TREEVIEW for visualization of the Vps36 family (42Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Classical basic nuclear localization signals were identified using the World Wide Web version of PSORT II (43Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The more sensitive hidden Markov model algorithm utilized in the SMART data base was used to detect additional signaling domains and motifs within Vps36 and its homologues (16Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). All signaling pathways regulate gene expression. For instance, in yeast, G protein activation leads to the induction of genes with a pheromone response element (PRE) in their promoter region. One of the induced genes encodes Sst2, which is well known to attenuate G protein signaling through its GTPase accelerating function (44Apanovitch D.M. Slep K.C. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Regulation of the G protein requires the C-terminal RGS domain, C-Sst2 (18Hoffman G.A. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37533-37541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Dohlman H.G. Song J., Ma, D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the N-terminal domain is not known. Our aim was to determine whether N-Sst2 regulates a distinct signaling pathway, perhaps independently of the G protein. To this end, we sought to identify genes whose expression changed substantially in cells containing just the N-Sst2 domain. Our approach was to use oligonucleotide probe microarrays to monitor the mRNA levels of all yeast genes, comparing cells that express N-Sst2 with cells that lack the N-Sst2 domain (express C-Sst2 alone). An sst2Δ mutant strain was transformed with plasmids containing either the N-Sst2 segment (residues 1–392 plus a Myc epitope tag) or the C-Sst2 segment (residues 411–698), as described previously (18Hoffman G.A. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37533-37541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression was verified by immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc and anti-Sst2 antibodies, as well as by in vivo complementation of the sst2Δ mutation, which requires co-expression of both N-Sst2 and C-Sst2. To provide uniform expression under various growth conditions, a constitutive promoter from ADH1 was used in place of the native (PRE-containing) promoter from SST2. Cultures in mid-log phase were collected, and total RNA was isolated. Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared and hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip set"

Signaling kinetics of events originating from serial TCR triggering and its relation to antigen dose was investigated. In this study we documented incremental accumulation of short-lived intermediates of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) family, produced during successive TCR triggering. The rate and extent of the intermediate accumulation are essentially determined by the level of TCR engagement and are augmented by costimulation. ERK-1 and ERK-2 exhibit different rates of accumulation following serial receptor triggering. The data indicate that the quantitative kinetic differences in downstream signaling pathways induce qualitatively distinct biological outcomes. Although CD69, interleukin-2, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were primarily produced by high antigen doses that supported high MAPK phosphorylation, maximal interleukin-5 expression is induced by low and intermediate stimulus doses that do not support significant accumulation of activated ERK. We further demonstrated that the rate of phosphorylated ERK accumulation correlates with the duration of delay between T cell stimulation and the onset of IFN-γ response, with stronger stimuli giving a more rapid IFN-γ response. This delay might reflect the time required for the accumulation of signaling intermediates up to a threshold level that is necessary for activation. Thus, the data suggest that signaling events originating from serially triggered TCR are not simply sustained but are gradually accumulated and are integrated in a corresponding response.

Muller S. Cella M. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1995; 375: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this “antigenic efficiency,” relatively small numbers of peptide-MHC complexes on APC surfaces can trigger the threshold numbers of TCRs that are required for T cell activation (2Harding C.V. Unanue E.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 574-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This intriguing feature of the T cell activation process makes physiological sense, in face of the antigenic complexity, as well as the consequent low frequency of any particular antigen, on the surface of any given APC in vivo. Any explanation of how serially receptor triggering leads to T cell activation must reconcile two opposing kinetic features. On the one hand, the signal emanating from each triggered TCR is short-lived and, in the absence of a continuous TCR triggering, the signal will stop. This point has been established by the demonstration that interference with continuous TCR engagement by peptide-MHC complexes can terminate signaling within minutes (3Valitutti S. Dessing M. Aktories K. Gallati H. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 4Beeson C. Rabinowitz J. Tate K. Gutgemann I. Chien Y.H. Jones P.P. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, productive TCR engagement results in rapid TCR internalization and degradation (reviewed in Ref.5Alcover A. Alarcon B. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 325-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, on the other hand, prolonged intracellular signaling over several hours is required for T cell activation (6Weiss A. Shields R. Newton M. Manger B. Imboden J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2169-2176PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling events underlying the serial triggering phenomenon are of considerable interest. The binding of TCR to a specific peptide-MHC complex initiates intracellular signaling cascade in the T cell (reviewed in Ref. 7Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). The earliest known step in this cascade is the induction of protein-tyrosine kinase activity, followed by downstream events, which include, among others, activation of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families (reviewed in Ref. 8Hardy K. Chaudhri G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 528-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the increase in the level of intracellular calcium. Experiments that followed calcium response in individual cells using calcium imaging have revealed that there is a delay between the TCR triggering (T cell-APC or antibody-coated bead contact) and the onset of the calcium signal. The duration of this delay decreased with increasing anti-CD3 mAb density on beads or with increasing stimuli strength (i.e. different combinations of agonist and antagonist ligands) (9Wulfing C. Rabinowitz J.D. Beeson C. Sjaastad M.D. McConnell H.M. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1815-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Wei X. Tromberg B.J. Cahalan M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8471-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the suggestion that the delay in calcium and other T cell responses are a consequence of the requirement for the accumulation of a threshold level of intracellular signaling complexes or events with a half-life of a few minutes (9Wulfing C. Rabinowitz J.D. Beeson C. Sjaastad M.D. McConnell H.M. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1815-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, a pivotal aspect of T cell activation by serially triggered receptors is the accumulation of transient signaling events over the time required for activation. Studies on the mechanisms of serial TCR triggering and sustained signaling have for the most part been performed on T cells stimulated with high, saturating stimuli doses. Although informative, such studies failed to follow the level of signaling intermediates at the initial steps of T cell activation. In the present study, we have explored the kinetics of TCR-induced signaling events and their relationships to functional responses using human T cells stimulated by a wide range of stimuli doses. We primarily followed the activation of the MAPK cascade, which consists of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK-1 and ERK-2), and demonstrated that TCR-evoked signaling events are gradually accumulating rather than being sustained over the period of time following T cell-APC interaction and T cell activation. This incremental accumulation of ERK-1/2, which depended on the nature of the antigen and its dose, is especially evident in low (physiological) stimuli concentrations. Interestingly, despite their similar activation threshold (11Gong Q. Cheng A.M. Akk A.M. Alberola-Ila J. Gong G. Pawson T. Chan A.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we found that ERK-1 and ERK-2 differ in both the extent and rate of accumulation upon serial receptor triggering. In addition, in view of the distinct role played by ERK in the activation of CD69, IFN-γ, and IL-2 as opposed to IL-4 and IL-5 (12Dumont F.J. Staruch M.J. Fischer P. DaSilva C. Camacho R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2579-2589PubMed Google Scholar), we correlated the degree of ERK accumulation with the level of production of individual cytokines, and ERK's accumulation rate with the onset of IFN-γ response. In aggregate, the interpretation of the results suggest that signaling events originating from serially triggered TCRs are not simply sustained for the duration of time required for activation, but are gradually accumulated up to a threshold required for activation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from the venous blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation as described (13Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As a source of APCs, monocytes were isolated from mononuclear cell populations by adherence to plastic. PBMCs (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in serum-free medium for one h at 37 °C. The adherent cells were washed extensively with medium to remove any residual nonadherent cells, and fresh complete medium was added. Adherent monocytes were removed by gentle scraping with a plastic cell scraper. Cell viability was >80% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were washed with medium and resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml and then loaded with the staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) SEA or SEB at the indicated concentrations for 2 h at 4 °C. The loaded cells were then washed three times with medium and diluted to 1 × 106cells/ml and incubated in culture medium at 37 °C for 20 min before adding them to cultures. CD4+ T cells were isolated from the PBMC pool by first depleting monocytes by adherence to tissue culture flasks, as described above, and then further purifying the nonadherent cells by positive selection of CD4+ T cells using magnetic cell isolation system (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Biological Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biological Industries), 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The Jurkat cell line was obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was maintained in the above medium. To stimulate cells with anti-CD3 mAbs (OKT3), cells (0.25 × 106 cells) were incubated for varying times with either soluble anti-CD3 mAb or were plated into wells (50 μl/well) of a 96-well plate, which were pre-coated with various concentrations of OKT3 at 4 °C for 16 h, and then washed. In other experiments, monocytes were preloaded with various concentrations of superantigens. These monocytes were combined with CD4+ T cells, centrifuged, and incubated at 37 °C for varying times. Cells were quickly sedimented and lysed for 30 min on ice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, as previously described (14Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Western immunoblotting was performed as described (13Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-MAPK dually phosphorylated mAb (Sigma). T cells and monocytes incubated separately or T cells stimulated with unloaded monocytes were used as controls. For CD3 down-modulation, cells were stimulated with various concentrations of plate-bound OKT3. Following stimulation the cells were collected, washed, and incubated on ice with OKT3 (1 μg/ml). The primary antibody was detected by Alexa 488 F(ab)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For quantitative analysis of TCR expression, CD4+ T cells, which were stimulated by either SEA- or SEB-pulsed monocytes, were stained directly with either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Vβ5 or phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Vβ17 (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Cells (104) were analyzed using FACScalibur and Cell Quest Analysis software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The data were calculated using the mean fluorescence values of the cell. Cultures containing 106peripheral blood CD4+ T cells and 106pre-activated monocytes loaded with the various concentrations of superantigens were plated in 1 ml of RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum in individual wells of a 24-well culture plate. Cells were stimulated for the indicated times, and conditioned media were collected. IL-2, IL-5, and IFN-γ levels in the conditioned media were assayed by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). To fully activate T cells, antigen-stimulated TCR signaling needs to be sustained for up to several hours (6Weiss A. Shields R. Newton M. Manger B. Imboden J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2169-2176PubMed Google Scholar). As the signaling evoked by individual TCR is short-lived, sustained signaling results from ongoing TCR triggering. Surface-attached antibodies were shown to be more effective than soluble Ab in sustaining signaling (15Hashemi B.B. Slattery J.P. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3660-3667PubMed Google Scholar, 16Berg N.N. Puente L.G. Dawicki W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2919-2924PubMed Google Scholar). For example, for sustained tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation, an immobilized stimulus is required, whereas stimulation with soluble cross-linked anti-CD3 results in only a transient response (16Berg N.N. Puente L.G. Dawicki W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2919-2924PubMed Google Scholar). We first compared the kinetics of TCR down-modulation induced by the two-stimulation method. Toward this end, Jurkat cells were stimulated either with soluble or with immobilized OKT3 for varying times and were then assessed for receptor down-modulation by indirect CD3 immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis. Stimulation of Jurkat cells with immobilized Ab induced a prolonged TCR-down-modulation that lasted up to 1 h (Fig.1A, upper panel). The extent and frequency of TCR down-modulation correlated with the concentration of the immobilized anti-CD3 used. Stimulation with soluble anti-CD3 mAbs, on the other hand, resulted in TCR down-modulation that lasted only 15 min following stimulation, with no further receptor down-modulation at later times (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Actin cytoskeleton was shown to be the major motor for sustained signaling that results from prolonged TCR triggering (3Valitutti S. Dessing M. Aktories K. Gallati H. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Actin cytoskeleton disruption by the drug cytochalasin E inhibits signaling induced by immobilized Ab but not by cross-linked soluble anti-CD3 stimulus (16Berg N.N. Puente L.G. Dawicki W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2919-2924PubMed Google Scholar). In our hands, 4 μm cytochalasin E abolished TCR down-modulation induced by immobilized antibodies (data not shown). These observations are consistent with the idea that, upon incubation with soluble Ab, there is a uniform distribution of Ab on the cell surface with most receptors engaged at once, and this therefore does not enable continuous receptor triggering and sustained signaling. On the other hand, stimulation with immobilized Ab provides conditions that favor receptor redistribution and serial association of TCRs with the surface-bound antibody, which leads to prolonged TCR engagements and sustained signaling. To study the kinetics of early signaling intermediates, Jurkat cells were stimulated with various concentrations of soluble anti-CD3 mAbs, and whole cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and with anti-dually phosphorylated MAPK mAbs. Following stimulation with soluble Ab (1000 ng/ml), a transient phosphotyrosine response was evident between 1 and 15 min, which gradually declined thereafter (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Comparable kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation was observed when cells were treated with 100 and 10 ng/ml anti-CD3 mAb (data not shown). The same membranes were re-probed with a specific Ab for the dually phosphorylated active form of the MAPK family members, ERK-1 and ERK-2 (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Interestingly, although MAPK phosphorylation is a relatively distal event in the TCR signaling cascade, its activation followed a time course similar to that for total tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lower panel). This is in agreement with the results previously shown by Berg et al. (16Berg N.N. Puente L.G. Dawicki W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2919-2924PubMed Google Scholar)). As can be seen in Fig.1B (lower panel), increasing the soluble anti-CD3 concentration from 10 to 1000 ng/ml produced higher levels of phosphorylated MAPK. However, even a 100-fold increase in anti-CD3 concentration did not significantly change the time course of the signal, which peaked at the same time interval at all concentrations and declined thereafter. In parallel experiments, plate-bound antibodies were used as stimulators (Fig. 1C). As was seen with soluble Ab stimulation (Fig. 1B), the maximal level of MAPK phosphorylation increased with increasing the dose of anti-CD3, and this was most pronounced when antibody dose was raised from 100 to 1000 ng/ml. However, in contrast to soluble Ab, alterations in antibody concentrations resulted in marked differences in the signaling kinetic. More specifically, MAPK phosphorylation levels rapidly increased during the initial period of time following stimulation with high anti-CD3 dose (1000 ng/ml), reaching its maximum by 7.5–15 min, and was sustained for ∼30 min. The decrease seen at a later time point (60 min) is probably the result of inactivation and degradation of kinases, such as Lck, following extensive and persistent TCR triggering (17Lee J.E. Cossoy M.B. Chau L.A. Singh B. Madrenas J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 61-69PubMed Google Scholar, 18Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1999; 283: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Significantly, the level of MAPK phosphorylation gradually increased during the 60 min tested when 10–100 ng/ml anti-CD3 were used, and the response latency was inversely correlated to the anti-CD3 mAb dose. MAPK activation was hardly detected at all time points in cells stimulated with 1 ng/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 (data not shown). To test whether the results shown above present a general phenomenon, subsequent experiments employed peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in place of Jurkat cells as responders. Stimulation of CD4+ T cells with soluble anti-CD3 resulted in a rapid accumulation of MAPK activation within 15 min, which declines thereafter (Fig. 1D, upper panel). On the other hand, when CD4+ T cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 mAbs, gradual accumulation of signaling events was observed (Fig. 1D, lower panel). The detection of MAPK activation in CD4+ T cells stimulated by soluble or plate bound anti-CD3 required significantly higher concentrations of Ab as compared with Jurkat cells. The results demonstrate that cells triggered by immobilized antibodies gradually accumulate signaling events over time in an antibody dose-dependent manner and in correlation with the frequency of TCR occupancy. These findings are compatible with the notion that a minimum rate of TCR triggering is required for the accumulation of sufficient concentrations of signaling events. The high affinity binding between Ab and the TCR·CD3 complex makes antibodies less efficient for serial TCR triggering compared with the peptide-MHC complex, which binds the TCR with low affinity, thus allowing dissociation following triggering. On the other hand, TCR recognition by superantigens mimics more closely that of peptide-MHC complex, as evident by a similar kinetic pattern of activation (19Viola A. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1996; 273: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 20Redpath S. Alam S.M. Lin C.M. O'Rourke A.M. Gascoigne N.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6-10PubMed Google Scholar). This is most likely because of their activity being dependent on MHC binding and to the rapid dissociation of the superantigen-TCR complex, which leads to high frequency of serial TCR triggering. We therefore followed the kinetics of MAPK activation in T cells stimulated with superantigens, which were presented by autologous monocytes, as accessory cells. It is known that interaction of ligands on the accessory cell with other T cell receptors such as the B7-CD28 interactions contribute to T cell activation. Furthermore, it was previously shown that freshly isolated monocytes have a low level of cell surface B7 expression and hence very little costimulatory activity, whereas monocytes incubated for 24 h at 37 °C provide good costimulation, which correlates with higher levels of B7 and ICAM-1 expression on their surface (Fig.2A and Refs. 13Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 21Ding L. Linsley P.S. Huang L.Y. Germain R.N. Shevach E.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1224-1234PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, these incubation conditions have little effect on MHC class II expression, in contrast to the commonly used IFN-γ treatment for accessory cell stimulation (21Ding L. Linsley P.S. Huang L.Y. Germain R.N. Shevach E.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1224-1234PubMed Google Scholar). To study the kinetics of TCR-induced intracellular signaling, and the contribution of accessory receptors to this process, we compared MAPK activation in T cells stimulated with various concentrations of the superantigen SEB presented by either freshly isolated or pre-incubated monocytes (Fig.2, B and C). T cells stimulated with pre-incubated monocytes (Fig. 2C) had considerably higher levels of MAPK phosphorylation compared with T cells stimulated with freshly isolated monocytes loaded with the same concentrations of SEB (Fig. 2B). Significantly, both the latency of the response and the time required to reach a maximal signal in each SEB concentration were greatly reduced in T cells stimulated with the pre-incubated monocytes. T cells incubated separately or with unloaded monocytes were used as controls and demonstrated insignificant levels of MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). Various SEs such as SEB and SEA, through interaction with different T cell receptor Vβ chain, can activate distinct populations of T cells. We compared the ability of superantigens SEB and SEA to activate MAPK, using Western blotting analysis as described above. We found that both SEA and SEB induced MAPK phosphorylation, which gradually accumulated over time, reaching approximately the same maximal levels (Fig. 2, C and D). However, SEA induced significant levels of MAPK phosphorylation at earlier time points, compared with stimulation with SEB, and required considerably lower concentrations. These differences in the effective stimulatory concentrations of SEA and SEB might reflect their respective affinities for the MHC class II molecules (22Mollick J.A. Chintagumpala M. Cook R.G. Rich R.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the present study, the superantigens were loaded onto the monocytes at 4 °C; at this temperature, no significant differences in the binding affinities of the two superantigens to class II were observed (22Mollick J.A. Chintagumpala M. Cook R.G. Rich R.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that other factors contribute to the observed differences between SEA and SEB activity. One such factor could be differences in the affinities of the two SEs to the TCR, which lead to different frequencies of receptor engagement. In fact, several studies have indicated a relationship between the overall extent of TCR down-modulation and ligand potency (1Valitutti S. Muller S. Cella M. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1995; 375: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 23Bachmann M.F. Oxenius A. Speiser D.E. Mariathasan S. Hengartner H. Zinkernagel R.M. Ohashi P.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Hemmer B. Stefanova I. Vergelli M. Germain R.N. Martin R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5807-5814PubMed Google Scholar, 25Itoh Y. Hemmer B. Martin R. Germain R.N. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2073-2080PubMed Google Scholar). To establish the extent of TCR occupancy achieved by the two superantigens, T cells were incubated with APCs bearing various doses of either SEA or SEB and then stained for surface TCR-Vβ5 or -Vβ17, respectively. The maximal level of TCR down-modulation was similar in both SEA- and SEB-stimulated cells. However, in agreement with expectations, SEA was much better in inducing TCR down-modulation as compared with SEB, at the lower antigen dosage (Fig. 2F). Although no Vβ17 down-modulation was induced by 0.1–1 ng/ml SEB, a total of 10–20% of Vβ5 TCR are down-modulated when cells are stimulated with the same concentrations of SEA. Thus, the level of MAPK phosphorylation induced by serially triggered TCRs increased over a relatively long period of time, and the rate of this increase correlated with the extent of TCR engagement as measured by receptor down-modulation. Both the extent of TCR engagement and the corresponding signaling depended on the nature of the antigen and its dose. Furthermore, costimulation amplified receptor signaling and facilitated its accumulation in the face of a fixed antigen dose. In light of the results presented above, we hypothesized that the quantitative differences in strength and duration of downstream signaling pathways can induce qualitatively distinct biological outcomes. Dumont et al. (26Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar, 27Alessi D.R. Cuenda A.

The authors have disrupted ERK-1/2 activation by using PD98059, a selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1 (26Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar, 27Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). Treatment of stimulated T cells with PD98059 resulted in marked inhibition of CD69, IL-2, and IFN-γ expression. However, even at high concentrations, PD98059 not only failed to suppress IL-4 and IL-5, but it significantly augmented their production (12Dumont F.J. Staruch M.J. Fischer P. DaSilva C. Camacho R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2579-2589PubMed Google Scholar). In view of ERK's unique role in regulating distinct T cell responses, we sought to correlate the rate of accumulation of activated ERK, resulting from increasing doses of the SEB and SEA stimulators, with the level of production of individual cytokines. T cells were combined with monocytes that were preloaded with various concentrations of either SEB or SEA. After 48 h of culture, the level of CD69 expression on the cell surface was measured by flow cytometric analysis, and the level of cytokines secreted to the medium was determined by ELISA. The results revealed that CD69 expression by individual cells as well as IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion to the culture media increased with increasing SEB concentrations. IL-5 secretion, on the other hand, peaked at 100-fold lower SEB concentration (10 ng/ml) and decreased at higher doses (Fig. 3). Giving the differential role ERK activation plays in the expression of these proteins, their levels of expression correlated with the extent of phosphorylated ERK accumulation at each antigen dose. Likewise, SEA with its capacity to induce rapid ERK-1/2 activation at lower stimuli doses, as compared with SEB (i.e. 0.1–10 ng/ml), induced significant levels of CD69 and IFN-γ at these doses, whereas only marginal levels of these proteins were detected in SEB-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). The levels of IL-5 were relatively low when SEA was used as stimulator at all doses except for a peak at 0.1 ng/ml, consistent with its ability to induce significant ERK phosphorylation even at the intermediate dosage range. Of note, the levels of IL-4 detected in the culture supernatants under the conditions used in these experiments were too low to permit reliable measurements. In aggregate, there is a correlation between t"

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. We investigated if tumor necrosis factor-stimulated airway smooth muscle produced reactive oxygen species, leading to muscular hyperresponsiveness. Tumor necrosis factor increased intracellular and extracellular oxidants production in guinea pig airway smooth muscle cells and tissue homogenates. This production was abolished by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodinium or apocynin) and was enhanced by NADPH, whereas inhibitors of mitochondrial respiratory chain, nitric-oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, and xanthine oxidase had no effect. NADPH oxidase subunits p22 phox and p47 phox were detected in smooth muscle cells and tissue homogenates by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and spectral analysis. Furthermore, oxidants production was significantly reduced by transient transfection of smooth muscle cells with p22 phox antisense oligonucleotides. Intracellular antioxidants and diphenylene iodinium abolished tumor necrosis factor-induced muscular hyperresponsiveness and increased in phosphorylation of the myosin light chain. Finally, NADPH oxidase subunits p22 phox and p47 phox were also detected in human airway smooth muscle.

Airway inflammation and ASM1 hyperresponsiveness, leading to an increased airway resistance, are characteristic features of asthma (1Bousquet J. Jeffery P.K. Busse W.W. Johnson M. Vignola A.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 1720-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). The inflammatory response in the asthmatic lung is characterized by an infiltration of the airway wall by mast cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. Activation of these cells results in the release of a plethora of inflammatory mediators that individually or in concert induce changes in the airway wall geometry and produce the symptoms of the disease. There is increasing evidence that one of these mediators, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF may be one of the primary components responsible for the ASM hyperresponsiveness observed in asthma (see Ref. 2Moore K.P. Sheron N. Ward P. Taylor G.W. Alexander G.J. Williams R. Eicosanoids. 1991; 4: 115-118PubMed Google Scholar for review). However, the mechanism of this TNF-induced ASM hyperresponsiveness remains unclear. TNF may act indirectly, via the release of other inflammatory or bronchoconstricting agents such as leukotrienes, by inflammatory cells (2Moore K.P. Sheron N. Ward P. Taylor G.W. Alexander G.J. Williams R. Eicosanoids. 1991; 4: 115-118PubMed Google Scholar), or directly on ASM cells that express TNF receptors (3McFarlane S.M. Jupp O.J. Cobban H.J. Hunter I. Anderson H.M. Vandenabeele P. Nixon G.F. MacEwan D.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Indeed, different investigators have shown that a short time incubation of tracheal smooth muscle strips with TNF enhances the contractile response to acethylcholine (4Pennings H.J. Kramer K. Bast A. Buurman W.A. Wouters E.F. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 12: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5Nakatani Y. Nishimura Y. Nishiuma T. Maeda H. Yokoyama M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 392: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) secondary, at least partially, to an increase in MLC phosphorylation (6Parris J.R. Cobban H.J. Littlejohn A.F. MacEwan D.J. Nixon G.F. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This direct effect of TNF on ASM contractility could be mediated by ROS synthesized by the muscular cells. At least three lines of evidence support this hypothesis: 1) TNF leads to the generation of ROS in various cell systems (7Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Deshpande S.S. Angkeow P. Huang J. Ozaki M. Irani K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), 2) incubation of guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle with SOD decreases the contractile response to metacholine (9De Boer J. Pouw F.M. Zaagsma J. Meurs H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that endogenous ROS can increase ASM contractility, and 3) ROS could increase phosphorylation of the MLC by activating the MLC kinase and/or by inhibiting the MLC phosphatase, as previously described with other kinases/phosphatases systems (10Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). However, very few studies investigated the capacity of ASM cells to generate ROS and the intracellular source of this generation (11Page K., Li, J. Hodge J.A. Liu P.T. Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B.

Chitano P. Hoidal J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20017-20026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no study is available in the literature concerning a potential autocrine role for muscular ROS in mediating TNF-induced ASM hyperresponsiveness. Such a role could open new insights in the pathophysiology of asthma. The aim of this study was therefore to assess in guinea pigs: 1) if ASM produces ROS when stimulated by TNF; 2) the cellular source of ROS production in this condition; 3) the role of TNF-induced ROS production in ASM hyperresponsiveness. The relation between ROS production by ASM, muscular hyperresponsiveness, and the level of phosphorylated MLC was also evaluated to investigate the mechanism linking TNF-induced ROS production and muscular hyperresponsiveness. Finally, the clinical relevance of our findings in animals was evaluated by studying human muscle in surgical biopsies. Pathogen-free male Hartley guinea pigs (250–300 g body weight; Charles River, France) were housed in individual cages in climate-controlled animal quarters and were given water and foodad libitum. The experiments conducted in the present study were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and the experimental protocol was in agreement with the recommendations related to animal studies of the French Law (Ministère des Affaires Sociales et de la Solidarité Nationale, Paris, France). Guinea pig ASM cells were isolated from tracheal smooth muscle by enzymatic digestion as previously described by Pyne and Pyne (13Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Ham's/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antimicrobial agents at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. Upon reaching confluence, cells were passaged by lifting the cells with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA and reseeding them into three new cultures plates per confluent dish. Cells from passage 2 to 4 were used. Prior to performing experiments, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence and then cultured for 24 h with medium containing 1% of fetal calf serum. ROS production was assessed both intra- and extracellularly. Intracellular ROS generation in ASM cells was assessed by using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH) (14Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). ROS in the cells oxidize DCFH yielding 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Fluorescence was quantified either by fluorescence microscopy or using a multiwell fluorescence plate reader. Cells on coverslips were perfused in a flow-through chamber (Penn Century, Philadelphia, PA) at 37 °C on an inverted microscope. Fluorescence images were acquired with a 12-bit digital camera (excitation 480 ± 20 nm, emission 527 ± 15 nm). Cells were loaded with 5 μm DCFH. Fluorescence was measured every 15 min. After a 1-h stabilization period, cells were treated during 1 h with different concentrations (1 and 10 ng ml−1) of TNF alone, or vehicle, or TNF plus an anti-TNF antibody. Cell viability was evaluated using the fluorescent dye PI at a 5 μm concentration (15Corda S. Laplace C. Vicaut E. Duranteau J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), (excitation 515–560 nm, emission 590 nm). Cells were grown in 96-well plates. Immediately before the experiments, cells were washed with HBSS and loaded with 50 μm DCFH-diacetate dissolved in HBSS for 30 min at 37 °C. They were then incubated 30 min with different inhibitors (see “Results”) followed by a 1-h stimulation with 10 μm TNF or vehicle. Subsequently, DCF fluorescence was measured with a multiwell fluorescence plate reader (Fluorostar BMG, Offenburg, Germany). ASM cells were cultured in six-well culture plates to confluence, and the confluent cells were washed with HBSS without phenol red and incubated with TNF or vehicle for 1 h in 1 ml of HBSS containing 80 μm cytochrome c. SOD (300 units ml−1) was added to the reference cells. The amount of O2− release was measured by the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c and expressed as nanomoles of superoxide anion released by 106 cells in 1 h (16Johnston R.B., Jr. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In some experiments, measures of TNF-induced ROS production were performed after a 30-min pretreatment with different inhibitors (see “Results”). Cells (107) were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 2% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 10 min. The reduced minus oxidized difference spectra were recorded with a dual beam scanning spectrophotometer (Uvikon) as described by Cross and co-workers (17Cross A.R. Higson F.K. Jones O.T. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The base-line (oxidized) spectrum was measured at 400–600 nm, then a few grains of sodium dithionite were added to the sample cuvette, and a new spectrum was performed. Subtraction was performed automatically. Cells were cultured in a Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nunc, Naperville, IL). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (18Teshima S. Rokutan K. Nikawa T. Kishi K. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1186-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antibody dilution was 1:100 and 1:200 for anti-p22 phox and p47 phox , respectively. Specificity of the immunostaining was evaluated by using pooled nonimmune rabbit IgG instead of the primary antibody at equivalent protein concentration as well as by omitting the primary antibody. Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides derived from a consensus sequence of bovine, human, murine, and porcine p22 phox gene (19Davis A.R. Mascolo P.L. Bunger P.L. Sipes K.M. Quinn M.T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were used: antisense p22 phox , TGCCAGCGCCTGTTCGTTGGC; sense, p22 phox , GCCAACGAACAGGCGCTGGC. Transient transfections of ASM cells were performed by liposomes using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Guinea pigs were stunned by a blow to the head and exsanguinated. The trachea was removed using open tracheotomy and cut into rings of ∼2 mm in width. The epithelial layer was thus removed as described previously (20Pavlovic D. Viires N. Zedda C. Fournier M. Aubier M. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 11: 575-582PubMed Google Scholar). The release of superoxide anion by epithelium-denuded guinea pig tracheal rings was evaluated by measuring SOD-inhibitable lucigenin-dependent chemilumiscence as described previously by Sadeghi-Hashjin and co-workers (21Sadeghi-Hashjin G. Henricks P.A. Folkerts G. Muis T. Garssen J. Nijkamp F.P. Mediators Inflamm. 1998; 7: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescence was measured over a 60-min time period after addition of TNF with and without pretreatment with different inhibitors (see “Results”). Data are presented as the area under curve over 60 min, normalized by the wet weight of the ring. To prepare tissue homogenate, tracheal smooth muscle was dissected from guinea pig trachea under a binocular dissecting microscope and cleaned of epithelium, fat, blood, and connective tissue. Western blot was performed as described previously (22Samb A. Pretolani M. Dinh-Xuan A.T. Ouksel H. Callebert J. Lisdero C. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The anti-p22 phox and p47 phox polyclonal antibodies were used at 1:2000 and 1:5000 dilution, respectively, and the anti-phosphorylated MLC polyclonal antibody was used at 1:500. Detection was performed by a chemiluminescent substrate. Using the same blots, the expression of the housekeeping protein, β-actin, was evaluated using an anti β-actin antibody. Results were expressed as a ratio of the expression of the NADPH oxidase subunit to that of β-actin. Positive controls for phox proteins were obtained from human neutrophils. Optical densities were measured using a Perfect ImageTM 2.01 image analysis system (Iconix, Courtaboeuf, France). Isometric tension generated by epithelium-denuded tracheal rings was measured as described previously (20Pavlovic D. Viires N. Zedda C. Fournier M. Aubier M. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 11: 575-582PubMed Google Scholar). Tissues were suspended in 20-ml organ baths containing a Krebs-Henseleit solution under an initial tension of 1.5 g and allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 h with washing every 20 min. The tension was then readjusted until steady at 2 g. Then, the preparation was contracted twice with 20 mm KCl, with intermediate washings. After 30-min washing, tissues were incubated during 1 h with Krebs solution containing either TNF (10 ng ml−1) or its vehicle, in the presence or absence of different inhibitors (see “Results”). Then, a cumulative dose-concentration curve to carbamilcholine was made (1 nm to 1 mm). To determine whether human ASM expressed p22 phox and p47 phox in vivo, 10-μm frozen sections from normal lung biopsies (obtained from two patients undergoing surgical lung resection for a localized lung tumor) were stained for p22 phox and p47 phox as described for ASM cells. Recombinant human TNF and anti-TNF IgG antibodies were provided by Imunogenex Corporation (Los Angeles, CA). DCFH-DA and PI were purchased from Molecular Probes Europe BV (Leiden, Neitherlands). Polyclonal antibodies against human p22 phox and human p47 phox were gifts from Dr. Bernard Babior (Scripps Research Institue, La Jolla, CA). The polyclonal anti-phosphorylated-MLC antibody was a gift from Dr. James Staddon (Eisai London Research Laboratories, London, UK) (23Ratcliffe M.J. Smales C. Staddon J.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Apocynin (Acetovanillone) was from Acros Organices (Geel, Belgium). MnTMPyP pentachloride was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The Superfect reagent was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). p22 phox sense and antisense oligonucleotides were from Genset S.A. (Paris, France). Culture media, supplements, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen SARL (Cergy Pontoise, France). Tissue culture plasticware was supplied by Costar Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Other reagents were from Sigma. Values are given as mean ± S.E. Dose-response curves of carbamilcholine-induced tracheal rings contraction in the different groups of animals were compared using two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures. The other data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance; differences between means were analyzed with the Fisher's protected least-significant difference multiple comparison test. Significance for all statistics was accepted at p < 0.05. We first assessed the effect of TNF on ROS production using cultured guinea pig ASM cells. To visualize the cells producing ROS, video fluorescent microscopy was used. ASM cells were exposed to either TNF (1 or 10 ng ml−1) or vehicle for 1 h. Fig.1 A shows a typical photography of ASM cells 1 h after exposition to 10 ng ml−1 TNF or vehicle. The results of this experiment clearly show that oxydized DCFH fluorescence was increased inside TNF-treated cells, indicating a rise in ROS production by the cells. By contrast, there was no modification for PI fluorescence throughout the study, indicating that TNF did not impair cell viability. Fig. 1 B displays the mean results of these experiments (n = 6 experiments). TNF induced a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence after 15 min of perfusion. Removal of TNF was associated with a progressive decrease in fluorescence. Anti-TNF IgG antibodies had no effectper se, but totally abolished the increase in DCFH fluorescence induced by 1 ng ml−1 TNF, showing the specificity of the effect induced by TNF. The source of ROS generation in guinea pig ASM cells in response to TNF stimulation was studied using a multiwell fluorescent plate reader. Pretreatment with exogenously added SOD (500 units ml−1) and catalase (1000 units ml−1) slightly reduced TNF-induced ROS production, whereas the combination of cell-permeable PEG-SOD plus the cell-permeable PEG catalase (100 units ml−1, respectively) (24Luo X.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23471-23476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) significantly reduced TNF-induced ROS production by 70 and 50%, respectively (p < 0.05 in each case; Table I).Table IIntracellular production of ROSPharmacological probes− TNF+ TNF % of increaseNone 7.6 + 3.223.5 + 3.21-ap < 0.05versus −TNF.Intracellular antioxidants PEG-SOD (100 units ml−1) + PEG-catalase (100 units ml−1)2.1 ± 2.21-bp < 0.05 versus−TNF alone.7.4 ± 3.31-cp < 0.05 versus+TNF alone.

TNF-induced ROS production was not significantly affected by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor mefenamic acid (20 μm), the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (10 μm), the NO synthase inhibitor l-NNA (1 mm), or the respiratory chain inhibitors (rotenone (50 mm) and TTFA (1 mm), or myxothiazole (1 ng/ml)) (15Corda S. Laplace C. Vicaut E. Duranteau J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, the TNF-induced ROS production was significantly reduced by pretreatment with DPI (10 μm) an inhibitor of flavin-containing enzymes such as NADPH oxidase (26Hancock J.T. White J.I. Jones O.T. Silver I.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (10 μm) (27Abid M.R. Kachra Z. Spokes K.C. Aird W.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Kashiwagi A. Shinozaki K. Nishio Y. Maegawa H. Maeno Y. Kanazawa A. Kojima H. Haneda M. Hidaka H. Yasuda H. Kikkawa R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E976-E983PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in separate experiments, we confirmed the effect of DPI by adding this agent 30 min after TNF. This addition resulted in a progressive decrease of DCFH fluorescence, which returned to basal levels 60 min after the beginning of TNF application (data not shown). Finally, we tested the effect of NADH and NADPH substrates on this activity. NADPH, but not NADH, increased TNF-induced DCFH fluorescence about 3-fold (Table I). TNF induced an extracellular production of superoxide anion by ASM cells as determinated by SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c; at 10 ng ml−1 of TNF, ASM cells produced 3.66 nmol of superoxide anion 106cells−1 h−1. This release was significantly reduced by DPI and apocynin (TableII).Table IISOD-inhibitable extracellular production of ROSPharmacological probes− TNF+ TNFNone1.30 ± 0.123.66 ± 0.312-ap < 0.05versus −TNF.DPI (10 μm)0.66 ± 0.062-bp < 0.05 versus−TNF alone.1.35 ± 0.012-cp < 0.05 versus+TNF alone.Apocynin (10 μm)0.66 ± 0.052-bp < 0.05 versus−TNF alone.1.32 ± 0.012-cp < 0.05 versus+TNF alone.Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with HBSS containing 80 μmol of cytochrome c in the absence or presence of TNF (10 ng ml−1), with or without a 30-min preincubation with different pharmacological agents.

Values are mean ± S.E.,n = 5 independent studies in each group. To assess the presence of NADPH oxidase in ASM cells, Western blot analysis with anti-p22 phox or anti-p47 phox antibodies were performed (29Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). Whole ASM cell homogenates showed expression of p22 phox and p47 phox with the same molecular weight as those found in human neutrophils (Fig. 2 A). Expression of these proteins was also detected by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 B). We further confirmed the presence of the cytochrome b 558, the membrane component of the NADPH oxidase system, by spectral analysis of ASM cells membranes (Fig.2 C). The reduced spectrum from ASM cells showed absorption at two main wavelengths: 426 and 558 nm, identical to previous reports in human neutrophils (17Cross A.R. Higson F.K. Jones O.T. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 30Yamaguchi T. Hayakawa T. Kaneda M. Kakinuma K. Yoshikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 112-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the peak at 558 nm is characteristic of cytochrome b 558 present in phagocytes. TNF-induced ROS formation was significantly reduced in cells transfected with a p22 phox antisense oligonucleotide as compared with cells transfected with a control sense oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 A). Western blot analysis demonstrated that p22 phox protein expression was substantially reduced in ASM cells transfected with the antisense-p22 phox oligonucleotide as compared with the control sense oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, B and C). As in cultured cells, Western blot analysis of ASM tissue homogenate allowed us to identify NADPH oxidase subunits p22 phox and p47 phox with a similar molecular weight as those observed in a lysate of human neutrophils (Fig. 2 A). TNF induced the release of superoxide anion by epithelium denuded tracheal rings (Table III). This release was significantly reduced by pre-incubation with DPI and apocynin (Table III).Table IIIROS production by epithelium-denuded guinea pig tracheal rings evaluated by chemiluminescencePharmacological probes− TNF+ TNFNone2.03 ± 0.313.72 ± 0.413-ap < 0.05versus −TNF.DPI (10 μm)0.30 ± 0.513-bp < 0.05 versus−TNF alone.0.52 ± 0.513-cp < 0.05 versus+TNF alone.Apocynin (10 μm)1.21 ± 0.523-bp < 0.05 versus−TNF alone.1.75 ± 0.623-cp < 0.05 versus+TNF alone.Chemiluminescence was measured over a 60-min time period after addition of TNF.

Values are expressed as the area under curve over 60 min, normalized by the wet weight of the ring. Values are mean ± S.E.,n = 8 independent studies in each group. The role of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS in ASM hyperresponsiveness induced by TNF was investigated using epithelium-denuded tracheal guinea pig rings both in the absence and presence of either TNF alone, TNF with DPI, or PEG-SOD plus PEG-Catalase. As shown in Fig.4 A, 1-h incubation of tracheal rings with 10 ng ml−1 TNF induced an increased response to carbachol (p < 0.05). This hyperesponsiveness was blocked by preincubation of the rings with DPI or the cell-permeable antioxidants PEG-SOD plus PEG-catalase (100 units ml−1, respectively) (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, both DPI and PEG-SOD plus PEG-catalase slightly decreased the contractile response in control rings (Fig. 4 B), suggesting a role of NADPH oxidase-derived intracellular ROS in the modulation of ASM contractility in basal conditions. Finally, we evaluated the role of NADPH oxidase derived ROS on TNF-induced phosphorylation of MLC in ASM cells and in tissue homogenates. Fig. 5 shows that TNF increased phosphorylation of MLC both in ASM cells and in tissue homogenates. This phenomenon was prevented by preincubation of the samples with DPI or PEG-SOD plus PEG-catalase (p < 0.05 in each case). Interestingly, independent incu"

Estrogens and androgens in turn control a variety of important physiological functions such as growth, reproduction, and differentiation. Using NAD as cofactor, 17β-HSD2, with its predominantly oxidative activity, primarily converts the highly active 17β-hydroxysteroids such as estradiol, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone into their inactive keto forms. Furthermore, studies carried out in vitro indicate that 17β-HSD2 is able to use C20-steroids as substrates, namely to catalyze the oxidation of 20α-dihydroprogesterone to progesterone. The expression of the mRNA of human 17β-HSD2 has been detected in a large variety of tissues. Its 1.5-kb mRNA is highly expressed in the endometrium, placenta, liver, and small intestine and also in smaller amounts in the pancreas, colon, kidney, and prostate (1Wu L. Einstein M. Geissler W.M.

In addition, both rodent and human 17β-HSD2 enzymes are widely distributed in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, in the liver, as well as in the adrenals of adults and developing fetuses (2Cassey M.L.

Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The broad tissue distribution, together with the predominant oxidative activity of 17β-HSD2, suggests that the enzyme plays an essential role in the inactivation of highly active 17β-hydroxysteroids. It may have a protective role by lowering the active steroid concentrations and reducing excessive sex hormone action in target tissues. 17β-HSD2 is a trans-membrane protein, which is demonstrated by its subcellular distribution in the endoplasmic reticulum (7Puranen T.J. Kurkela R.M. Lakkakorpi J.T. Poutanen M.H. Itaranta P.V. Melis J.P. Ghosh D. Vihko R.K. Vihko P.T.

The primary structure shows that it belongs to the type II signal anchor membrane protein, which is characterized by possessing a cluster of positively charged amino acids and followed by a hydrophobic core of about 33 nonpolar amino acids close to the N terminus of the protein (1Wu L.

The carboxyl terminus has a luminal carboxyl-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (KKK) (1Wu L. Einstein M. Geissler W.M. Chan H.K. Elliston K.O. Andersson S. J. Biol.

Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar), there are two proposed trans-membrane helices close to the N terminus of 17β-HSD2, the first one situated in amino acids 5–27 and the second one in 34–56. The latter is much more hydrophobic than the former. The enzyme is thus suggested to be an integral membrane protein (7Puranen T.J. Kurkela R.M. Lakkakorpi J.T. Poutanen M.H. Itaranta P.V. Melis J.P. Ghosh D. Vihko R.K. Vihko P.T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3334-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Up to now, most of the information obtained for 17β-HSD2 is about genes and mRNA studies. Although an N-29 amino acid truncated form, in which the first proposed transmembrane helix was deleted, retained about 60% of its catalytic activity as compared with wild type in the intact cells and was purified using a detergent β-octyl glucoside, knowledge about the purification of the enzyme is still limited (7Puranen T.J.

In order to elucidate the structure and function of the protein, we carried out the overproduction, purification, reconstitution, and characterization of N-terminal His6-tagged full-length 17β-HSD2, which are reported here. Restriction endonucleases and modifying enzymes used in molecular biology experiments were purchased from AmershamBiosciences and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Taq DNA polymerase and Pfu DNA polymerase were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), respectively. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, the Bac-N-Blue transfection kit, and the pBlue Bac4.5 transfer vector were from Invitrogen. Grace's insect cell culture medium, yeastolate, and lactalbumin hydrolysate were from Invitrogen. β-Octyl glucoside, decyl-β-d-maltoside, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (β-DDM), polyoxyethylene 8-lauryl ether (C12E8), and Triton X-100 were from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Radioisotopic labeled steroids were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. His bind resin was from Novagen. SM2 Bio-Beads was from Bio-Rad. Steroids, bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS),l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC),l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine,l-α-phosphatidylinositol, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. The full-length human 17β-HSD2 cDNA coding sequence was obtained by PCR amplification from pCMV/17β-HSD2 (11Luu-The V. Zhang Y. Poirier D. Labrie F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A nucleotide sequence coding for 6 histidine residues followed by a Factor Xa cleavage site was added at the 5′ terminus of the 17β-HSD2 cDNA. The forward primer contained a BamHI site (underlined), 5′-CGGGATCCATGGGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCATCATAGCAGCATCGAAGGCCGTGGCGGCATGAGCACTTTCTTCTCGGACACAGCATGG-3′, and the reverse primer contained an EcoRI site (underlined), 5′-GGAATTCTTACTAGGTGGCCTTTTTCTTGTA-3′. The 1.2-kb amplified products were digested with the appropriate enzymes and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pBlue Bac4.5 vector. Using this method, we also constructed N-terminal His10-tagged as well as C-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 and the enzyme lacking the first 38, 52, and 61 amino acids of the N terminus (N-38-, N-52-, and N-61-deleted 17β-HSD2). The recombinant vectors were identified using dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Big DyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit, PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, 373 sequencer with XL Upgrade). Linearized AcMNPV DNA (Bac-N-Blue DNA) (0.5 μg) was used to co-transfect monolayers of Sf9 cells in the presence of InsectinPlus liposomes, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five days after co-transfection, the media were collected, and the recombinant baculoviruses were purified using three rounds of plaque assay in the presence of Bluo-Gal. Sf9 cells were grown as monolayers in flasks containing Grace's insect cell culture medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 27 °C. The wild type baculovirus and the recombinant virus carrying 17β-HSD2 were used to infect the 90% confluent cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–0.5 for virus amplification and an multiplicity of infection of 5–10 for protein overproduction. The infected cells were harvested 72 h postinfection, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and stored at −80 °C for later use. Cell pellets containing overexpressed N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 were fractionated in 1.5 ml of buffer A (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 20 μm NAD, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 μg/ml each of the following protease inhibitors: leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) containing detergents. β-Octyl glucoside, decyl-β-d-maltoside, β-DDM, Triton X-100, sodium cholate, and C12E8 were used with concentrations 0.4–1.2%. The samples were sonicated on ice by a sonic dismembranator (Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. 0.1 ml of each homogenate was transferred to separate tubes as control, and the remaining homogenate was centrifuged for 45 min at 180,000 × g at 4 °C. The aliquots from the homogenates, supernatants, and pellets were analyzed by electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and activity assay. The cell pellets from 6–8 × 175-cm2flasks (which represents about 1.6–2 × 108 cells) were suspended in 50 ml of buffer A. The remaining procedures were carried out at 4 °C or on ice unless otherwise specified. The cells were lysed by sonication. The suspension was incubated for 15 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 180,000 × g. The pellets were then solubilized in 100 ml of buffer B (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 8 mmimidazole, 20 mm NAD, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% β-DDM, 1 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors) and incubated by rotating for 1 h. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 45 min at 180,000 × g, adjusted to 300 mm NaCl, mixed with 3 ml of nickel-chelated resin pre-equilibrated with buffer B (containing 300 mm NaCl), and incubated by rotating for 1 h. The mixture was loaded onto the column. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer C (buffer B containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.3% β-DDM, 15 mm imidazole, and 15% glycerol) and 10 column volumes of buffer D (buffer B containing 45 mm imidazole, 200 mm NaCl, 0.3% β-DDM, and 20% glycerol). Bound proteins were eluted with buffer E (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% β-DDM, 250 mm imidazole, 40 μm NAD, 0.4 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors). The fractions with high 17β-HSD2 activity were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The purified enzyme without adding cofactor NAD in the purification procedures was used to detect cofactor kinetic constants. The reconstitution method basically depended on the strategies described by Rigaud (12Rigaud J. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Three kinds of phospholipid (PC, phosphatidylethanolamine, and l-α-phosphatidylinositol) were tested in the reconstitution system. They were mixed with different ratios, which were around the lipid compositions of the human liver. The mixtures were dissolved in chloroform and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas to minimize the lipid oxidation. The remaining trace of solvent was removed under vacuum for at least 2 h. The dried films were suspended in buffer F (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT) at a concentration of 20 mg of lipids/ml. The liposomes were obtained by sonication (1-s burst, 5-s interval for 45 min at output 2.0) in an ice bath under nitrogen gas. The suspensions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at room temperature three times. The liposomes were extruded through 400-nm polycarbonate membranes (Nuclepore® Track-Etch Membrane; Corning) three times, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. To determine the physical state of the detergent-solubilized liposomes, the liposomes were aliquoted and mixed with different amounts of β-DDM in a final concentration of 4 mg of lipids/ml using buffer F. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 h under constant agitation. The turbidity of the different phospholipid-detergent suspensions was measured at 540 nm with a spectrophotometer (Backman DU 7400). To reconstitute 17β-HSD2, the liposomes were diluted to 4 mg of lipids/ml, saturated with β-DDM, and equilibrated under constant agitation for 3 h at room temperature. The purified N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 was adjusted to 0.15 mNaCl and the same concentration of detergent as that in the saturated liposomes, mixed with the saturated liposomes in a ratio of liposomes to protein of 14:1 (w/w), and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under rotating. The detergent was removed by three successive extractions with 80 mg/ml, wet weight, polystyrene beads and rotated at 4 °C. The first, second, and third extractions lasted for 2, 2, and 4 h, respectively. The beads were removed by filtration over glass wool. Then the mixture was adjusted to 6% glycerol using buffer F. The proteoliposomes were harvested by centrifugation at 180,000 ×g for 45 min, resuspended in a buffer (40 mmTris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT), and stored at −80 °C. The activity of 17β-HSD2 was monitored by the spectrophotometric assay. It was initiated by the addition of 17β-HSD2 in 0.5 ml of reaction mixture (50 mmsodium carbonate, pH 9.2, 1 mm NAD, and 25 μmtestosterone). The reactions were monitored by spectrophotometric measurement of the reduction of NAD at 340 nm. A reaction mixture containing no cofactor or substrate was used as control. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol of product formed in 1 min. Enzyme activities in cultured cells were measured by plating the cells in the six-well plates at a density of 1.2 × 106/well. The cells were set for 1 h to attach followed by the infection of virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. A mock infection was set as a background control. After a 50-h incubation at 27 °C, the medium was removed, and 2 ml of serum-free TNM-FH medium with 10 μmof each 14C-labeled estrone, estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione (4-dione), and dihydrotestosterone was added to each well. The reaction was set at room temperature, at different time intervals (3, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min), and aliquots of the media were moved to the tubes containing cold diethyl ether. The steroids were extracted and quantified as mentioned under “Steady-state Kinetics.” The kinetic constants of 17β-HSD2 were determined using purified and reconstituted N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mmconstant concentration of cofactor NAD, with different steroid substrates ([14C]estradiol, [14C]testosterone, [14C]dihydrotestosterone, and [3H]20α-dihydroxyprogesterone), and concentrations varied from 0.14 to 4 μm for the kinetic constants of steroids. The same buffer system contained a 10 μmconstant concentration of steroids (estradiol and testosterone) with various concentrations of cofactor NAD (0.05–1 mm) for the kinetic constants of NAD. The same buffer with 10 μm of constant concentration of 4-dione and estrone and with various concentrations of cofactor NADH (0.001–0.2 mm) was used for the kinetic constants of NADH. The kinetic constants of NADP were determined with a 10 μm constant concentration of estradiol and various concentrations of cofactor NADP (0.6–10 mm). The initial velocity was measured with less than 5% substrate conversion. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C and stopped by removing 0.5 ml of reaction mixture to the cold diethyl ether at four different time intervals (0, 20, 40, and 60 s). The steroids were extracted with ethanol in dry ice and dried by evaporation. They were then dissolved in dichloromethane, applied onto thin layer chromatograms (TLC), separated by toluene/acetone (4:1, v/v), and quantified by Storm 860 Laser Scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA; ImageQuant software). At least three independent experiments were carried out for each kinetic constant. The kinetic results were fitted for the Michaelis-Menten equation and calculated using a Lineweaver-Burk plot. The values of the catalytic constant,k cat, were calculated from theV max values with the homodimer molecular mass of 90 kDa (k cat is the turnover number,i.e. the number of moles of substrate transformed per second per mole of enzyme). The apparent functional molecular mass of N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 was estimated by cosedimentation with protein standards on 8–30% glycerol gradients. Glycerol gradients (13 ml; Beckman SW 40Ti rotor) were prepared by using a gradient maker with equal volumes of 8 and 30% glycerol buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 40 μm NAD, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The glycerol gradients were equilibrated at 4 °C for about 8 h before loading the samples. The samples contained 20 μg of purified and reconstituted 17β-HSD2, 100 μg of each protein standard (rabbit skeletal muscle aldolase, bovine serum albumin, and chicken ovalbumin (13Sigma Technical Bulletin No. MKR-137. St. Louis, MO1986Google Scholar)), and the same buffer as in the gradient, but the glycerol concentration was less than 8%. The samples were equilibrated at 4 °C for 1 h and then layered on top of the glycerol gradients and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 40 h at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated from the bottom into 0.3-ml fractions. 17β-HSD2 fractions were verified by the enzyme activity assay and Western blot. The positions of the standard markers were determined by SDS-PAGE. This was performed according to the method described by Knoller (14Knoller S. Shpungin S. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2795-2804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. 60 μl of reaction buffer contains 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 3 μg of purified and reconstituted N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2, and cross-linking reagent BS with concentrations at 0, 0.25, 1, and 3 mm, respectively. The reaction proceeded for 30 min at 25 °C and stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 30 mm. The samples were analyzed by 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 12% polyacrylamide gel or 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE. The samples in reducing loading buffer were incubated at 40 °C for 30 min instead of boiling before loading to prevent the aggregation of the membrane protein (16Schagger H. von Jagow G. Schagger H. A Practical Guide to Membrane Protein Purification. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 59-79Crossref Google Scholar). The gel after migration was stained with Coomassie Blue. For Western blot analysis, blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human 17β-HSD2 as the first antibody and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody (AmershamBiosciences) as the second antibody. The immunoreactive blots were detected with ECL reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Protein concentrations without detergent were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The concentrations of proteins with detergents or with phospholipid were determined by the method of microgram quantities of protein determination (17Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) to prevent the alteration of detergents and phospholipids in the protein concentration by conventional methods. Human 17β-HSD2 cDNA with a 6-histidine coding sequence and a Factor Xa cleavage site at its 5′ terminus was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac 4.5. The incorporation of the Factor Xa cleavage site allowed the removal of the His tag after purification of the recombinant protein, leaving only two additional glycines at the N terminus of 17β-HSD2. Sf9 cells were co-transfected with Bac-N-Blue DNA and the above transfer vector of 17β-HSD2 to produce the recombinant baculovirus. Protein expression was optimized by evaluating the expression levels of the infection at different time intervals. The activity was first detected 24 h postinfection and reached a maximum between 60 and 72 h postinfection (Fig.1, A and B), whereas no activity could be detected in wild-type AcMNPV virus-infected cells. Thus, the protein expression conditions were set as follows: infection of the cells at a multiplicity of infection from 5 to 10 and harvest in 72 h postinfection. Under these conditions, the overexpressed 17β-HSD2 constitutes about 3% of the total protein in the insect cell lysate, with a specific activity of 0.012 units/mg in the cell homogenate. Using the same method, we also overproduced N-38-, N-52-, and N-61-deleted 17β-HSD2, as well as N-terminal His10-tagged and C-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2. The truncated N-38 form was expressed at about 2% of the total protein in the insect cell lysate, with a specific activity of 0.005 units/mg in the cell homogenate. Although this form could be solubilized to a higher level with detergent from membrane vesicles (solubilized 45% of the enzyme in the presence of 0.4% β-DDM) than that of N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 (solubilized 30.5% of the enzyme in the presence of 0.4% β-DDM), it was unstable in the solubilized state with detergents even in intact cells and showed a very strong tendency to degrade and aggregate in the cell homogenate. The truncated N-52 and N-61 forms were expressed in fairly low amounts in Sf9 insect cells. The N-52 form was even more unstable than the N-38 form. We found that the N-52 form in fresh cultured cells still retained a little activity, but it completely lost activity in several hours at 4 °C. Moreover, the N-61 form was totally inactive in fresh cultured cells. The N-terminal His10-tagged 17β-HSD2 was expressed to a high level (about 5% of the total protein); however, it retained a quite lower specific activity (about 0.001 units/mg) than that of the N-terminal His6-tagged form (about 0.012 units/mg). The C-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 was expressed at about 2% of the total protein in the insect cell lysate, with a specific activity of 0.009 units/mg in the cell homogenate. This recombinant was solubilized to a lower level from membrane vesicles (solubilized 21% of the enzyme in the presence of 0.4% β-DDM) than that of N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 and exhibited a very high tendency to aggregate, as seen in SDS gel and Western blot analysis. Indeed, the majority of the protein presented as a polymer staying in the sample-loading place or as a dimer (data not shown). These findings suggest that there is a stronger membrane interaction in C-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 than in N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2. Furthermore, several purification tests using various detergents demonstrated that the C-terminal His6 tag of this form was not able to be effectively bound to nickel-chelated affinity matrix. Finally, N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2, although still highly labile, was found to be able to retain full biological activity, to be expressed in a fairly good amount in the baculovirus expression system, and to facilitate its purification. Therefore, this form was chosen in our study. N-terminal His6-tagged 17β-HSD2 is still a very labile protein with a strong tendency to aggregate and degrade. The choice of an optimal detergent is the crucial step in the purification. Much effort was devoted to finding a suitable detergent to solubilize this recombinant from the cell membranes. Several commonly used detergents were tested for the protein stability, solubility, and binding capacity with nickel matrix. The results are summarized in Table I. The pH during solubilization was kept at 8.0, since the protein was subsequently used to bind to the Ni2+-agarose matrix. Sodium cholate showed no significant inhibition of 17β-HSD2 activity, but the protein solubility was very low with this detergent. β-Octyl glucoside had low ability in protein solubilization and strong inhibition to the enzyme activity at increasing concentrations. C12E8 and decyl-β-d-maltoside displayed medium ability both in solubilizing and in maintaining the enzyme activity. Triton X-100 showed high protein solubility, but it significantly inhibited the enzyme activity. Although none of the detergent could assist the enzyme to get more than 50% solubility, β-DDM gave the best results both in solubilizing and in maintaining the enzyme activity among those detergents tested. Typically, we used 0.5% β-DDM in the solubilization of His6-tagged 17β-HSD2, considering that higher concentrations of β-DDM did not further improve the solubility notably but rather inhibited the enzyme activity and solubilized more contaminants.Table IDetergent solubility testDetergentsDetergent concentrationSolubilityActivity in homogenate % % units/mlNo detergent0.40.014Sodium cholate0.40.60.0140.81.30.0141.22.30.015β-octyl glucoside0.43.80.0150.813.40.0111.2160.006C12E80.411.80.0120.814.50.0121.221.80.010Triton X-1000.432.90.0090.836.20.0061.238.90.004Decyl-β-d-maltoside0.425.10.0160.827.60.0"

https://openalex.org/W2040946143,"UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:α-6-d-mannoside β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GlcNAc-TV) is a regulator of polylactosamine-containing N-glycans and is causally involved in T cell regulation and tumor metastasis. TheCaenorhabditis elegans genome contains a single orthologous gene, gly-2, that is transcribed and encodes a 669-residue type II membrane protein that is 36.7% identical to mammalian GlcNAc-TV (Mgat-5). Recombinant GLY-2 possessed GlcNAc-TV activity when assayed in vitro, and protein truncations demonstrated that the N-terminal boundary of the catalytic domain is Ile-138. gly-2 complemented the Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin binding defect of Chinese hamster ovary Lec4 cells, whereas GLY-2(L116R), an equivalent mutation to that which causes the Lec4A phenotype, could not. We conclude that the worm gene is functionally interchangeable with the mammalian form. GlcNAc-TV activity was detected in wild-type animals but not those homozygous for a deletion allele of gly-2. Activity was restored in mutant animals by an extrachromosomal array that encompassed the gly-2 gene. Green fluorescent protein reporter transgenes driven by the gly-2 promoter were expressed by developing embryos from the late comma stage onward, present in a complex subset of neurons in larvae and, in addition, the spermathecal and pharyngeal-intestinal valves and certain vulval cells of adults. However, no overt phenotypes were observed in animals homozygous for deletion alleles of gly-2.

Granovsky M. Warren C.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These branches can be further elongated by galactosyltransferase and other enzymes to create the mature glycoprotein oligosaccharides. The GlcNAcβ1,6 branch resulting from GlcNAc-TV action is distinct in that it is the preferred site for elongation with polylactosamine chains, repeating lactosamine units that themselves can be further branched and carry a variety of terminal structures. GlcNAc-TV is thus a potential regulator of polylactosamine containing N-glycan chains on target glycoproteins. GlcNAc-TV is also distinct from the otherN-acetylglucosaminyltransferases in that it has a specific temporal and spatial expression pattern in the developing mouse embryo. Expression is concentrated in neuronal tissues, specialized epithelium, and regions with stem cell-like populations. Zygotic expression increases at about 9.5 days post coitus, which coincides with the onset of organogenesis (2Granovsky M. Fode C. Warren C.E. Campbell R.M. Marth J.D. Pierce M. Fregien N. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in GlcNAc-TV activity through mutation of theMgat-5 locus are viable but develop glomerulonephritis with age, which is associated with T cell hypersensitivity, apparently as a result of altered activation kinetics of the T cell receptor complex (3Demetriou M. Granovsky M. Quaggin S. Dennis J.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). When the Mgat-5o allele is combined with a mouse mammary tumor virus-promoted Polyomavirusmiddle T antigen transgene, multifocal tumorigenesis is delayed, and metastasis caused by the Polyomavirus middle T antigen is dramatically suppressed (4Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with prior observations that tumor cell lines selected by resistance to the cytotoxic lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (l-PHA) deficient in GlcNAc-TV also failed to metastasize in syngeneic mice (5Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Waghorne C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S. Science. 1987; 236: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Although the Mgat-5o mouse is highly informative, systematic analysis of a complex viable phenotype remains difficult, particularly the identification of the dependent molecules and pathways. We therefore sought a simpler model organism in which synthetic genetics could be carried out rapidly to characterize the complex pleiotropic phenotypes expected from disruption of the glycosylation machinery. Because of the cellular non-autonomy typical of glycosylation phenotypes and of the phylogenetic restriction of complex-type N-glycans to metazoans, a whole animal model is necessary. Caenorhabditis elegans is the simplest and most highly characterized animal, its adult anatomy and developmental lineage have been completely determined (6-Google Scholar, 7-Google Scholar), and its genome is essentially completely sequenced (8The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). C. elegans is highly tractable to experimental phenotypic and genetic analysis, and there are numerous examples demonstrating that genetic pathways found in mammals are also conserved in this nematode (9Sternberg P.W.

Surveys of theC. elegans genome sequence revealed a coding potential for most known glycosyltransferase genes (14Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Genes encoding active polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (15Hagen F.K. Nehrke K. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have been characterized. In addition, there are at least three sqv genes that are elements of a proteoglycan glycosylation pathway that when mutated cause severe and pleiotropic defects (18Herman T. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Herman T. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The canonical oligomannose series ofN-glycans were observed, but atypical O-glycans were found where polypeptide linked GalNAc was β1–6-branched as in mammals but substituted with glucose or galactose rather than GlcNAc. We characterized the 6 homologues of core 2 GlcNAc-T (23Warren C.E. Krizus A. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that gly-1 transfers glucose from UDP-glucose to core 1 acceptor consistent with the inference based on the structural analysis (24Warren C.E. Krizus A. Partridge E.A. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 8GGoogle Scholar). We observed that the C. elegans genome encodes a single gene, designated gly-2, which is homologous to mammalian GlcNAc-TV sequences. In this paper, we establish that the nematode orthologue is functionally equivalent to that from mammals and thatC. elegans is an appropriate model in which to pursue investigations of the contributions to fitness made by β6-GlcNAc-branched N-glycans. Primer sequences (ACGT Corp.) are available on request. The wild-type Bristol strain of C. elegans (N2) (25Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and him-5(e1490) were available as laboratory stocks. CB1282dpy-20(e1282) IV, DR466him-5(e1490) V, and DR435dpy-5(e61) unc-13(e51)I were supplied by T. Stiernagle (C. elegansGenetics Center, University of Minnesota). BC107bli-4(e937), dpy-14(e188)I was the gift of Dr. D. Baillie (Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada). Standard husbandry methods were used (7-Google Scholar,26-Google Scholar). Cosmid C55B7 was obtained from Dr. A. Coulson (Sanger Centre, Cambridge, UK). pPD95.77 and pPD95.69 were from Dr. A. Fire (Carnegie Institute of Washington), pMH#6 was obtained from Dr. M. Han (University of Colorado), pRF4 originated in the laboratory of Dr. J. Kramer (Northwestern University Medical School), and pIMKF1 was the gift of Dr. F. Hagen (University of Rochester Medical School). pCMVCD20 was obtained from Dr. E. Harlow (Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center), and Dr. P. Stanley provided pLec4 and pCHO-K1 (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). The C. elegans EST cm20c4 (GB:M89265) was provided by Dr L. Hillier (Washington University Genome Sequencing Center), and yk126h8 (GB:D64875/D68132) was obtained from Dr. Y. Kohara (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). The GlcNAc-TV acceptor, βGlcNAc(1,2)αMan(1,6)βGlc-O(CH2)7CH3, was a gift from Glycodesign Inc. Unless otherwise noted, standard molecular biology techniques were employed (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1993Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from mixed populations of C. elegans using a QuickPrep Micro mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia). The 5′ RACE system (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was primed with yk5′rc0. First round PCR using AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was primed with yk5′rc1. The second round PCR used Pfu DNA polymerase (CLONTECH) and yk5′rc2 as the gene-specific primer. Amplimer was sequenced directly and subcloned into the EcoRV site of pZErO-2 (Invitrogen). Independent recombinants were analyzed by colony PCR using SL1, SL2, or RACE anchor and yk5′rc2 primers. Non-starved mixed stage animals from Bristol N2 and him-5(e1490) strains were used to prepare poly(A)+ RNA using a Dynabeads kit (Dynal A. S.) after disruption in a Polytron (Kinematica). ∼1 μg of mRNA was fractionated, blotted, probed with the α-32P-labeledSalI/SmaI fragment of yk126h8, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Storm/ImageQuant, Molecular Dynamics). pISTH1 was constructed from pIMKF1 (15Hagen F.K. Nehrke K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8268-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) by replacing theNdeI-BamHI segment upstream of the cloning site with an NdeI-BglII fragment from pCITE4b(+) (Novagen). N-terminal truncations of GLY-2 were generated by PCR from yk126h8 as template using Pfu DNA polymerase primed by yk*670r and one of ykI28f, gly2-Δ133, gly2-Δ137, or gly2-Δ138. Amplimers were subcloned into theEcoRV site of pZErO-2 (Invitrogen) and sequenced.BamHI fragments of error-free subclones were ligated into the BamHI site of pISTH1. Ligation junctions, frame, and orientation were checked by DNA sequencing. A yk5′rc2 and SL1-primedTaqDNA polymerase PCR product of the RACE amplimer was subcloned into EcoRV cut and T-tailed pGEM5zf(+) (Promega) forming pYS. pCDNA3::yk126h8(+) was created by subcloning the PvuII-SmaI fragment of yk126h8 intoEcoRV cut pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). An expression construct for mature SL1 trans-spliced cDNA (pCSYK-1) was constructed by combining the SpeI-NarI fragment of pYS with the NarI-NotI fragment of pCDNA3::yk126h8(+) in SpeI-NotI-cut pZErO-2, the BamHI-NotI fragment of which was subcloned into pCDNA3. The amplified region and ligation junctions were checked by DNA sequencing. The GLY-2(L116R) mutation was introduced into pCSYK-1 by mutagenesis directed by primer GLY2-L116R using the Chameleon kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The complete transcriptional unit of the resulting construct, pCSYK-L116R, was sequenced. pEGFP-GLY2 was constructed by subcloning the ykR2f-yk*670r product generated by PCR amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase from yk126h8 template into the BamHI site of pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH). The insert and ligation junctions were completely sequenced and found to be in-frame and error-free. pEGFP-L116R was derived by replacing theBstXI-EcoRV fragment with the equivalent section of pCSYK-L116R to generate pEGFP-L116R. The introduced segment was confirmed by sequencing. 3 × 105 Lec4 cells (ATCC) were plated in each well of 6-well tissue culture clusters (Costar). The following morning, 1 μg of DNA (QIAgen) of pISTH1-based truncation constructs were transfected at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere for 5–6 h using 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of OptiMEM-I (Invitrogen)/well. One ml of α-minimal essential medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added to the wells, and the clusters were transferred to a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 30 °C overnight. The following day, well contents were aspirated and replaced with 2 ml of α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubation was continued until 78 h post-transfection. Conditioned medium was clarified by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 10 min and stored at 4 °C after the addition of sodium azide to 0.05% w/v. Recombinant proteins directed by pISTH1-based plasmids bear an N-terminal S-tag that was assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions in conditioned media from the transient transfections (Novagen). 1.25 pmol of recombinant protein in conditioned medium was immunoprecipitated and diluted into 1 ml of dilution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% w/v NaN3, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100, 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin). Aliquots were preadsorbed with 35 μl of a 50% v/v slurry of goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C then centrifuged briefly before supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-S-tag antibody and a fresh aliquot of anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody-agarose were added for 2 h at 4 °C before the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 s in a microcentrifuge. Beads were washed 3 times with 1-ml aliquots of dilution buffer before 3 more washes with 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. A final aspiration of supernatant left the beads as a 50% slurry in a total volume of 35 μl, which was used for assay of GlcNAc-TV enzyme activity. Enzyme activity was measured using synthetic specific acceptors (28Srivastava O.P. Hindsgaul O. Shoreibah M. Pierce M. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 179: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Assays contained 1 mmβGlcNAc(1,2)αMan(1,6)βGlc-O(CH2)7CH3acceptor, 1 mm [6-3H]UDP-GlcNAc (44,400 dpm/nmol) in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, in total volumes between 30 and 100 μl. Enzyme sources were nematode microsomal membranes, cell lysates, conditioned media either directly or dialysates against 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, or immunoprecipitates. Assays using microsomal membranes contained 2 mm acceptor and donor, both, which was 105 dpm/nmol. In addition these samples contained 5 mm adenosine 5′-monophosphate and 500 μm 2-acetamido-1,2-dideoxynojirimycin (Toronto Research Chemicals). After 3 h at the appropriate incubation temperature, 1 ml of ice-cold water was added to stop further reaction, and assays were either frozen or processed immediately. Enzyme products were separated from radioactive substrates by binding them to 50 mg of C18 cartridges (Alltech) preconditioned with methanol rinsing and water washing. Reactions were loaded, and the columns were washed 5 times with 1 ml of water. Radiolabeled products were eluted directly into scintillation vials with 2 separately applied 0.5-ml aliquots of methanol, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Transient transfections were performed essentially as above except that Lec4 or CHO-K1 cells were plated at 106 cells on 6-cm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) that were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCMVCD20 (29Zhu L. van den Heuvel S. Helin K. Fattaey A. Ewen M. Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1111-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and 2.5 μg of pLec4, pCHO-K1, pCSYK-1, or pCSYK-L116R DNA using 18 μl of LipofectAMINE in 3 ml of OptiMEM-I. At 71 h post-transfection, the media were aspirated, and the plates were rinsed with ice-cold PBS followed by ice-cold PBS, 0.1% w/v EDTA (PBSE). Cells were dissociated from the dish by incubation in 0.5 ml of PBSE for 10 min at room temperature before triturating with 4.5 ml of PBS, 1% v/v fetal bovine serum, 0.1% w/v NaN3 (PBSFN). Aliquots of 1.2 × 106 transfected cells were transferred to 6-ml polypropylene tubes (Falcon) on ice, filled with PBSFN, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were decanted. FITC-conjugatedl-PHA (Sigma) was preadsorbed against Lec4 cells by incubating 40 μg of FITC-l-PHA with 4 × 107 untransfected Lec4 cells (harvested using PBSE) in a total volume of 800 μl of PBSFN for 15 min on ice, then clarified. Lec4-absorbed FITC-l-PHA (0.5 μg) and 10 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal anti-CD20 (BD PharMingen) were added to each sample, and the cells were resuspended. After a 30-min incubation on ice, tubes were filled with PBSFN and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were decanted. Washes were repeated twice more before a final resuspension in 1 ml of PBSFN. FACS was carried out on a FACStar (BD PharMingen). Live single cells were selected based on a forward and side scattering gates, and data acquisition and analysis used the CellQuest package. Transfected cells were gated based on the phycoerythrin anti-CD20 fluorescence, and the FITC l-PHA staining of at least 104 transfected live single cells was measured for each sample. 3 μg of pEGFP-C3, pEGFP-GLY2, or pEGFP-L116R were transfected into Lec4 or CHO-K1 similarly. After harvesting, cells were stained with 2 μg of biotinylatedl-PHA (Sigma), washed four times with PBSFN, then developed with 1 μg of streptavidin-CyChrome (BD PharMingen). After 3 washes with PBSFN, CyChrome staining of 2 × 104 transfected GFP+ cells was measured for each sample. The remaining cells after analysis were immediately washed twice in PBS before cell pellets were flash-frozen and stored at –70 °C. Cell pellets were lysed in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA containing 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 5 min on ice, lysates were clarified at 14,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and supernatants were transferred and assayed immediately for GlcNAc-TV activity. Conditioned media from Lec4 cells that had been transiently transfected with pISTH1-based truncation constructs were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (Waters), and blocked with TBS, 0.1% v/v Tween 20, 5% skimmed milk (TBSTM). Filters were washed with TBS, 0.1% v/v Tween 20 (TBST), then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-S-tag (CLONTECH) at 4 °C overnight. The blot was washed again with TBST then developed with 1:12,500 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences) in TBST for 2 h at room temperature before extensive washes with TBST then TBS and visualization of the signal by ECL (Amersham Biosciences), recorded using X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Clarified lysates prepared from samples that had been subjected to FACS analysis and GlcNAc-TV assay were separated by electrophoresis in a MOPS buffer system on 4–12% BisTris NuPage gels (Novex) then electroblotted as above. After methanol washing and air-drying, filters were incubated with 1:5000 monoclonal anti-GFP (CLONTECH) in TBSTM for 30 min at room temperature. After 5 rinses in TBS, the blot was developed with 1:2000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Biosciences) in TBSTM. After 5 rinses and a 15-min wash in TBS, chemiluminescence signals (Supersignal, Pierce) were recorded. The 7461-bp NsiI fragment of C55B7 was subcloned into the PstI site of pPD95.69 and pPD95.77. A partial NarI digest was performed, and the overhangs were blunted (Klenow). A SmaI digestion was used to excise the intervening fragment, and the construct was reclosed. The ligation junctions were found to be correct after DNA sequencing. This procedure created an in-frame fusion between theNarI site in codon 3 of GLY-2 and the GFP segment of the vector, preceded by 6.7 kbp of upstream genomic DNA corresponding to bases 19,280 to 25,991 of C55B7. CB1282 hermaphrodites were transformed by gonad injection (30Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar) of a mixture of reporter construct and pMH#6, a plasmid containing a region of C. elegans genomic DNA capable of rescuing the dpy-20(e1282) mutation. Several non-Dpy F1 progeny were selected for each reporter construct, transgenic lines were established from them, and epifluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica DMR photomicroscope. The inheritance of extra-chromosomal arrays is mosaic, and the fine structure of the array in each strain is different. Consequently, several individuals from each line were examined to compile consensus expression patterns. Cell identification was accomplished using the position and morphology of the expressing cells, the number and position of their nuclei, and by comparison to anatomical landmarks visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy. The gly-2 alleles, ev581, and qa700 were generated by Tc1-mediated mutagenesis with minor modifications (31Zwaal R.R. Broeks A. van Meurs J. Groenen J.T. Plasterk R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7431-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). qa703 was isolated from ethylmethanesulfonate-induced deletion libraries using minor variances from published procedures (32Liu L.X. Spoerke J.M. Mulligan E.L. Chen J. Reardon B. Westlund B. Sun L. Abel K. Armstrong B. Hardiman G. King J. McCague L. Basson M. Clover R. Johnson C.D. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Tc1 mutagenesis relies on transposon mobilization, so the founding strain contains mut-2 alleles. Animals bearing qa700 were therefore crossed eight times with N2 before out-crossing with BC107 and recombination of thedpy-14 locus with gly-2 to break the chromosome between gly-2 and mut-2. This strain was then further out-crossed an additional 4 times with N2 to remove thedpy-14 allele and create strain XA728gly-2(qa700**14) I. qa703-bearing animals were crossed three times with N2 then with DR435 to recombine the mutagenized chromosome with wild-type material either side ofgly-2. dpy-5(e61), gly-2(qa703), and unc-13(e51) I animals were derived and subsequently crossed another 5 times with N2 to remove the markers and generate strain XA762gly-2(qa703**10) I. Both alleles were mapped by recombination frequencies with dpy-5 and unc-13using PCR to score for the presence of the qa700 or qa703 alleles. The deletion boundaries of the alleles were characterized by sequencing DNA that had been PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using primers that encompassed the deletions. DR435 hermaphrodites were mated with XA728 males, and cross-progeny hermaphrodites were picked and allowed to segregate F2. Animals carrying chromosomes that had recombined between the dpy-5 and unc-13 loci were genotyped by single-worm PCR (26-Google Scholar) using primer sets that specifically detected wild-type and deletion alleles to determine the frequency of recombination between gly-2 and both marker loci,dpy-5 and unc-13. Of 26 Dpy non-Unc chromosomes, 15 recombinations occurred in the dpy-5-gly-2 interval, and of 28 Unc non-Dpy chromosomes, 13 recombinations occurred betweengly-2 and unc-13. The 13,806-bpXbaI fragment corresponding to bases 17,188–30,994 of cosmid C55B7 was subcloned into the XbaI site of pZErO-2 to create pResLng-9E, and the structure was verified by restriction digests. This genomic region encompassed allgly-2 sequences detected in transcripts as well as an additional 4248 bases upstream of the 5′ limit of yk126h8 and 1281 bases downstream of the site of polyadenylation. XA762 hermaphrodites were transformed by gonad injection (30Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V.

Several independent rolling lines were established, and the percentage of rolling self-progeny from each was characterized. GlcNAc-TV activity was assayed using microsomal membranes prepared from 2 such lines, XA766gly-2(qa703) I; qaEx743[gly-2(+),rol-6(su1006)] and XA768 gly-2(qa703) I; qaEx745[gly-2(+), rol-6(su1006)], both of which transmitted the array to 30–50% of their progeny. Cultures were established by picking 50 rolling L4 hermaphrodites (or 20 animals from non-transgenic lines) to each of 5 100-mm diameter complete nematode growth medium plates that were then grown at room temperature until the animals cleared the Escherichia coli OP50 lawn. Nematodes were rinsed from the plates in cold 100 mm NaCl, washed twice, then floated on sucrose (60% w/v). After 2 washes with 100 mm NaCl, the pellet was snap-frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath and stored at −70 °C. Samples were thawed by adding 1 ml of TSEC (20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1× CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) then sonicated on ice 5 times using a 10-s pulse before dilution with a further 3 ml of TSEC. After centrifugal clarification for 10 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C (Sorval RT6000), the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C (Beckman L8–80 M with a 70.1Ti rotor). The microsomal pellet was suspended in a minimal volume of 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 2% v/v Triton X-100, 2× CompleteTM, 20 mm EDTA, the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) standardized with bovine serum albumin, then 386 μg of each preparation was subjected immediately to GlcNAc-TV assay.

Previous work predicted that the two regions of important intersubunit interaction were the residue Met-140 and the N-terminal extensions of each subunit. The N-terminal extension was also implicated in β-lactam binding. Mutation of methionine 140 to aspartic acid results in a monomeric L1 β-lactamase with a greatly altered substrate specificity profile. A 20-amino acid N-terminal deletion mutant enzyme (N-Del) could be isolated in a tetrameric form but demonstrated greatly reduced rates of β-lactam hydrolysis and different substrate profiles compared with that of the parent enzyme. Specific site-directed mutations of individual N terminus residues were made (Y11S, W17S, and a double mutant L5A/L8A). All N-terminal mutant enzymes were tetramers and all showed higherK m values for ampicillin and nitrocefin, hydrolyzed ceftazidime poorly, and hydrolyzed imipenem more efficiently than ampicillin in contrast to wild-type L1. Nitrocefin turnover was significantly increased, probably because of an increased rate of breakdown of the intermediate species due to a lack of stabilizing forces. K m values for monomeric L1 were greatly increased for all antibiotics tested. A model of a highly mobile N-terminal extension in the monomeric enzyme is proposed to explain these findings. Tetrameric L1 shows negative cooperativity, which is not present in either the monomer or N-terminal deletion enzymes, suggesting that the cooperative effect is mediated via N-terminal intersubunit interactions. These data indicate that while the N terminus of L1 is not essential for β-lactam hydrolysis, it is clearly important to its activity and substrate specificity.

These are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective as inhibitors of bacterial cell wall synthesis (7Ghuysen J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). β-Lactamases, of which more than 400 have been identified, have been classified according to substrate specificity, inhibitor profile, and requirement of a metal cofactor at the active site (8Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The metallo-β-lactamases (Group 3) are distinct from the majority of β-lactamases in that they require zinc at the active site for maximal activity. They hydrolyze carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem, which, apart from one or two exceptions, are poorly hydrolyzed by serine β-lactamases (8Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob.

Metallo-β-lactamases are also insensitive to many serine β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam (8Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). To date, there are no clinically useful inhibitors of metallo-β-lactamases (9Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Antimicrob.

These structures all contain an αβ/βα fold, generally contain the zinc-binding motif His-X-His-X-Asp, and all bind either one or two atoms of zinc at the active site. L1 is distinct from all other known metallo-β-lactamases in the following respects. (i) The functional enzyme is a tetramer (5Saino Y. Kobayashi F. Inoue M. Mitsuhashi S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 22: 564-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 30Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol.

(ii) Its monomer is 4–5 kDa larger than the others. (iii) It contains a number of substitutions at sites thought to be important for metallo-β-lactamase function and particularly in zinc-binding ligands (30Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure of L1 (30Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R. Taylor I.A. Emery D.C. Verma C.S. Gamblin S.J. Spencer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) it is known that the tetramer structure contains three sets of intersubunit interactions. The principal contact between the A and B subunits is a hydrophobic interaction between the side-chain of Met-140 from chain A and a pocket formed by Leu-122, Pro-162, Tyr-199, and Pro-200 from chain B. An identical interaction binds the C and D subunits. The A and C chains (as well as B and D chains) interact in two regions, most importantly between the extended N-terminal residues of each chain where leucine residues 5 and 8 dock into apolar cavities formed by Ala-10, Tyr-11 and Ala-15, and Met-56 to His-62. This extension of the N-terminal region of ∼20 amino acids is unique to L1 (24Fabiane S.M. Sohi M.K. Wan T. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H. Mitchell T. Sutton B.J.

The second, more limited, interaction is between the side chain of Pro-132A with residues Pro-132C and Arg-116C. It has been proposed that interactions involving residues Met-140 and the hydrophobic N-terminal residues Leu-5, Leu-8, and Tyr-11 were important in maintaining tetramer stability (30Ullah J.H.

The monomeric structure of L1 is shown in Figs. 1 and2, and these residues are labeled. Docking studies, in which the substrates imipenem, ceftazidime, and ampicillin were docked into the active site of L1 and subjected to energy minimization, suggested interactions between the residues Trp-17 and Tyr-11 with the pyridine ring of ceftazidime and the aromatic substituent of ampicillin, respectively (30Ullah J.H.

In addition, the positioning of Trp-17 near the active site led to the suggestion that this residue makes stabilizing edge-face contacts with the Zn(II) ligand, His-225 (30Ullah J.H. Walsh T.R.

Understanding the roles of specific residues in L1, particularly in terms of substrate binding, is expected to contribute significantly to the rational design of therapeutic inhibitors of the L1 metallo-β-lactamase. We report the first study on L1 that probes the roles of specific residues and the first production of an L1 monomeric enzyme. This study also identifies negatively cooperative kinetics in the tetrameric enzyme and demonstrates that this effect is mediated through N-terminal subunit interactions. Unless otherwise stated, media used were either nutrient broth or nutrient agar (Oxoid plc., Basingstoke, UK). PCR primers were purchased from Sigma-Genosys Ltd. and used without modification. β-Lactams used were nitrocefin (BD PharMingen), imipenem (Merck Sharpe and Dohme, Huddesdon, UK), ceftazidime (Glaxo Laboratories Ltd., Greenford, UK), meropenem (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK), penicillin G, cefoxitin, cephaloridine, cefmetazole, cefotaxime, and ampicillin (all from Sigma). All other general reagents were from Sigma or from BDH, both of Poole, UK. The L1 gene (L1-WT), originally cloned from S. maltophilia strain IID 1275 on plasmid pUB5811 (18Walsh T.R. Hall L.

PCR was performed as described previously (32Avison M.B. von Heldreich C.J. Higgins C.S. Bennett P.M. Walsh T.R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 879-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These primers were designed to target both ends of the published L1 sequence (18Walsh T.R. Hall L. Assinder S.J. Nichols W.W. Cartwright S.J. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to enable amplification of the full gene. A deletion mutant of L1, lacking the N-terminal 20 amino acids of the mature protein (i.e. in addition to the cleaved signal peptide) was made by PCR using the “NDel-F” and “L1-R” primers. Specific site-directed mutants of L1 were created by PCR, using the method of Ho et al. (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar), with pUB5811 as a template (18Walsh T.R. Hall L. Assinder S.J. Nichols W.W. Cartwright S.J. MacGowan A.P. Bennett P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Internal mutagenic primers (Table I), containing the desired mutation, were used in conjunction with the L1-F and L1-R primers to create two part-length amplicons. These two amplicons were mixed, denatured, and annealed, and the products were used as templates for a subsequent PCR reaction using the L1-F and L1-R primers to generate the required full-length L1 mutant.Table ISequences of primers used in this studyPrimer nameSequenceL1-F5′-ATGCGTTCTACCCTGCTCGCCTTCGCC-3′L1-R5′-TCAGCGGGCCCCGGCCGTTTCTTGGCCAG-3′TOPO-F5′-AAATTAAAGAGGTATATATTAATGTATCGA-3′TOPO-R5′-CTGCGTTCTGATTTAATCTGTATCAGGCTG-3′L1-MID-F5′-GACGGCATCACCTATCCG-3′L1-MID-R5′-CGGATAGGTGATGCCGTC-3′N-Del-F5′-ATGGCACCGCTGCAGATCGCCGAC-3′L5A/L8A-F5′-GCCGAAGTACCAGCACCGCAGGCACGGGCCTACACC-3′L5A/L8A-R5′-GGTGTAGGCCCGTGCCTGCGGTGCTGGTACTTCGGC-3′Y11S-F5′-CCGCAGCTGCGGGCCAGCACCGTGGACGCCTCG-3′Y11S-R5′-CGAGGCGTCCACGGTGCTGGCCCGCAGCTGCGG-3′W17S-F5′-GTGGACGCCTCGTCGCTGCAGCCGATG-3′W17S-R5′-CATCGGCTGCAGCGACGAGGCGTCCAC-3′The nucleotide sequence in bold indicates the site at which the mutagenesis is to occur.

PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, UK) and sequenced on both strands with an ABI Prism 377 automatic sequencer (PerkinElmer, Warrington, UK) using dye termination chemistry according to the manufacturer's instructions to confirm the insertion of the mutation. DNA and protein sequences were compared using the Lasergene suite of programs (DNASTAR Inc, Madison, WI). DNA sequencing of the L1 mutants L5A/L8A and W17S confirmed that only the desired mutations were present; in the case of the N-Del mutant, no mutations in the remaining sequence were found. Despite many attempts, a single Y11S mutant could not be recovered. Further attempts to mutate Tyr-11 to threonine or phenylalanine were also unsuccessful. Analysis of numerous transformants from these cloning reactions generally revealed one of the three following outcomes. (i) The mutation was unsuccessful, and the DNA sequence recovered was wild-type. (ii) A Tyr-11 mutation had been introduced, but the gene had inserted in the wrong orientation in the vector for expression. Attempts to switch the orientation were unsuccessful. (iii) A Tyr-11 mutation was introduced, and the mutant gene was inserted in the correct orientation in the vector, but the desired mutation was accompanied by at least one additional mutation. Examples of the mutants recovered are: Y11S + A15T, Y11S + T212A, Y11S + N134T, Y11S + A69V + I138N, Y11T + V13E, Y11T + S16T, and Y11F + R9G. In this study we were interested in examining the involvement of the N-terminal region of L1. For this reason, a Tyr-11 mutation was chosen for study, which contained a second mutation in this region, namely Y11S + A15T. Given the ease with which all but the Tyr-11 substitutions were created, failure to generate mutations at the Tyr-11 locus in isolation is surprising. It seems likely that a mutation at this locus somehow creates a protein that is lethal to the cell; in which case, the mutations that are recovered in addition to the Tyr-11 mutation must suppress the lethal tendency. We have no sensible hypothesis for how this might be achieved. Resolution of this question clearly requires detailed study of L1 folding. PCR amplicons were TA-cloned into the pTrcHis2-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and recombinant molecules were transformed into Escherichia coliTOP10 One Shot competent cells (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's guidelines. The presence of recombinant L1 clones was confirmed by PCR. The L1 mutant proteins were overexpressed and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), as described previously (34Avison M.B. Higgins C.S. von Heldreich C.J. Bennett P.M. Walsh T.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The gel filtration column was calibrated using immunoglobulin G (BioRad Laboratories) (molecular mass, 150,000 Da; elution volume, 260 ml), bovine serum albumin (Sigma) (molecular mass, 67,000 Da; elution volume, 305 ml), and carbonic anhydrase (Sigma) (molecular mass, 29,000 Da; elution volume, 340 ml). Elution of L1 from the gel filtration column was followed with an antibody to the native L1 protein using a standard ELISA method (35Hudson L. Hay F.C. Practical Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK1989: 348-350Google Scholar). The L1 antibody was raised by injecting New Zealand White rabbits with a 2 mg/ml solution of pure tetrameric L1 in phosphate-buffered saline at two weekly intervals over a period of 8 weeks. Animals were anesthetized and bled via cardiac puncture. (This procedure was performed by Affiniti Research Products Ltd.) Serum was separated and assayed using the above ELISA technique. The maximum working dilution of this polyclonal serum in ELISA assays was 1:106. Peak fractions containing L1 protein were pooled and used for further analysis. Electrospray mass spectrometry (using a VG Quattro Mass Spectrometer) was used to assess molecular weight and protein purity. N-terminal sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems 477A amino acid analyser. Protein for each technique was prepared as described by Winston and Fitzgerald (36Winston R.L. Fitzgerald M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 262: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), starting with 500 μl of 5 μm enzyme. The overexpression plasmid for L1, pUB5832, was digested with NdeI andHindIII, and the resulting ∼900-bp piece was gel-purified and ligated using T4 ligase into pUC19, which was also digested withNdeI and HindIII, to yield the cloning plasmid pL1PUC19. Mutations were introduced into the L1 gene by using the overlap extension method of Ho et al. (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for the preparation of the mutants are shown in Table I. pUCMSZfor and M13Rev were used as the universal forward and reverse primers, respectively. The ∼900-bp PCR products were digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into pUC19. The DNA sequences were analyzed by the Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility in the Dept. of Biological Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University. After confirmation of the sequence, the mutated pL1PUC19 plasmid was digested with NdeI and HindIII, and the 900 bp, mutatedL1 gene was gel-purified and ligated into pET26b to create the mutant overexpression plasmids. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with the mutated overexpression plasmids, and large scale (4 liter) preparations of the L1 M140D mutant enzyme were performed as described previously (34Avison M.B. Higgins C.S. von Heldreich C.J. Bennett P.M. Walsh T.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. β-Lactamase assays and steady state kinetics were carried out as described previously (34Avison M.B. Higgins C.S. von Heldreich C.J. Bennett P.M. Walsh T.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients and wavelengths for the β-lactams used were: nitrocefin, 17,400 AU m−1 cm−1 (at 482 nm); imipenem, 7,000 AU m−1 cm−1 (at 299 nm); ceftazidime, 9,000 AU m−1cm−1 (at 265 nm); and ampicillin, 809 AUm−1 cm−1 (at 233 nm). Antibiotic solutions were prepared in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm ZnCl2. Enzyme concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients (at 280 nm), which were calculated from the amino acid sequence of each mature L1 enzyme using the Gill and von Hippel algorithm (37Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar) as follows: L1WT, 38,930 AU m−1 cm−1; N-Del, 31,960 AU m−1 cm−1; W17S, 33,240 AU m−1 cm−1; L5A/L8A, 38,930 AU m−1 cm−1; Y11S (+A15T), 37,650 AU m−1 cm−1. Purified L1 was dialyzed against 500 volumes of 50 mm cacodylate, pH 6.0 (24 h, 20 °C), with one change of dialysis buffer. The enzyme was concentrated to 10–30 μm in 2.5 ml using a Centricon Plus10 filter unit (Millipore). Concentrated enzyme was mixed with an equal volume of 11.4m nitric acid (BDH, Aristar Grade) and incubated for 18 h, 20 °C to hydrolyze the protein. The zinc content of this mixture (as ppm) was assayed in a Unicam 919 atomic absorption spectrometer at 213.9 nm, and the data were reported as zinc ions per subunit. Samples (110 μl) of L1 wild-type and mutant enzymes were examined by centrifugation to equilibrium at 20 °C in 3-mm columns in a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. After centrifugation for the requisite times, typically 16 and 20 h at 10,000 rpm followed by the same time intervals at 15,000 rpm, the radial distribution of the protein was measured by absorption at 280 nm. The distributions recorded 4-h apart duplicated each other, thus confirming that the sedimentation was at equilibrium. Another absorption record was taken after extending the centrifugation for 6 h at 40,000 rpm. The absorption at the meniscus in the latter record was used as a fixed offset in the subsequent analysis with the ORIGIN software from Beckman (38McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar). The analysis, fitted by non-linear regression for either single or multiple absorption records to obtain the best fit for M (molecular mass), is shown in Equation1, Ar=A0·exp[M·(1−v̄ρ)·(r2−r02)·(ω2/2RT)]+BEquation 1 where A r and A 0are the absorbances at radius r and at the reference radiusr 0; ω, angular velocity; R, gas constant; T, temperature; ν̄, partial specific volume (0.734 ml/g forL1); ρ, buffer density (1.008 g/ml for the buffer used here); and B, baseline offset (determined as above). Partial specific volumes and buffer densities were calculated with SENDTERP (Ref. 39Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1991Google Scholar, alpha.bbri.org/rasmb/spin/ms_dos/sednterp-philo/). The possible conformations available to the unrestrained N-terminal extension of L1 (as would be likely to exist in the monomer) were computed using the ab-initio evolutionary Monte Carlo technique of Gibbs et al. (40Gibbs N. Clarke A.R. Sessions R.B. Proteins. 2001; 43: 186-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the first 19 N-terminal amino acids, an initial set of structures was generated with backbone φ-φ geometries applied randomly. Each structure was then subjected to random mutations of its backbone φ-φ angles to form 10,000 daughter molecules. After energy minimization the most stable 1,000 structures are retained as the next generation of parent structures. This process was repeated for 7 generations where the 1,000 lowest energy structures are retained as the best solution to the conformational search. For each mutant a protein was purified that consisted of a single band on an SDS-PAGE gel. On the basis of size exclusion chromatography the calculated native molecular masses of the parent enzyme, L1, and mutant proteins were as follows: wild-type L1 (117,000 Da), L5A/L8A mutant (108,000 Da), Y11S (+A15T) mutant (108,000 Da), W17S mutant (117,000 Da), N-deletion mutant (96,000 Da), and M140D mutant"
https://openalex.org/W2033771927,"We have determined the solution structure of the PABC domain from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pab1p and mapped its peptide-binding site. PABC domains are peptide binding domains found in poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP) and are a subset of HECT-family E3 ubiquitin ligases (also known as hyperplastic discs proteins (HYDs)). In mammals, the PABC domain of PABP functions to recruit several different translation factors to the mRNA poly(A) tail. PABC domains are highly conserved, with high specificity for peptide sequences of roughly 12 residues with conserved alanine, phenylalanine, and proline residues at positions 7, 10, and 12. Compared with human PABP, the yeast PABC domain is missing the first α helix, contains two extra amino acids between helices 2 and 3, and has a strongly bent C-terminal helix. These give rise to unique peptide binding specificity wherein yeast PABC binds peptides from Paip2 and RF3 but not Paip1. Mapping of the peptide-binding site reveals that the bend in the C-terminal helix disrupts binding interactions with the N terminus of peptide ligands and leads to greatly reduced binding affinity for the peptides tested. No high affinity or natural binding partners from S. cerevisiae could be identified by sequence analysis of known PABC ligands. Comparison of the three known PABC structures shows that the features responsible for peptide binding are highly conserved and responsible for the distinct but overlapping binding specificities.

Pab1p contains 570 amino acids arranged as four N-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a C-terminal PABC domain of ∼70 amino acids. The two parts are separated by a largely unstructured region of ∼100 amino acids. The N-terminal RNA recognition motifs bind the mRNA poly(A) tail and interact with the eIF4F complex at the mRNA 5′ cap. This Pab1p-eIF4F interaction is important for the circularization of the mRNA in actively translating complexes (1Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). At the C terminus, the PABC domain acts as a peptide/protein binding domain, recruiting various translation or mRNA processing factors to the mRNA ribonucleic acid protein complex. In yeast, Pab1 is an essential gene whose deletion leads to inhibition of translation initiation, poly(A) shortening, and delay in the onset of mRNA decay (2Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 3Sachs A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Amrani N.

These include the PABP-interacting proteins Paip1 and Paip2 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E (or αCP1 and -2) as well as eRF3/GSPT (7Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A., De Crescenzo G. Roy G.

Nature. 1998; 392: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). A number of potential interacting agents have also been identified in plants and yeast; they are Pab1p-binding protein (Pbp1p), eIF4B, Rna15p, and a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (4Amrani N. Minet M., Le Gouar M. Lacroute F. Wyers F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3694-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7383-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that a large number of potential binding partners can be identified by sequence analysis based on the presence of a consensus PABC recognition site (12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Finally, it is notable that in addition to poly(A)-binding proteins, PABC domains also occur in a subclass of ubiquitin E3 protein ligases that contain a HECT (homologous to E6-AP Cterminus) domain. The function of the PABC domain in these ubiquitin ligases is unknown. The structures of PABC domains from human PABP (hPABP) and HYD (a human ubiquitin ligase) have recently been determined by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography (12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Deo R.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The two structures are largely similar and consist of 75 or 60 amino acid residues arranged as bundles of five or four α helices. Sequence conservation is highest in helices 2, 3, and 5, which correspond to the peptide-binding site determined by NMR spectroscopy (12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here we report the structure of the PABC domain from the yeast poly(A)-binding protein, Pab1p. The yeast sequence shows 40 and 57% identity with the domains from hPABP and HYD (themselves 52% identical). Together, the three proteins span much of the sequence variation in PABC domains. The yeast structure shows several distinct features that result in unique specificity and affinity of peptide binding. Forty sequences of PABC domains were obtained from a Ψ-BLAST search (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58715) Google Scholar) of the NCBI non-redundant data base with the yPABC sequence (gi417441, residues 490–563) as query. These unique sequences were analyzed by ClustalW to generate an alignment and Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree (15Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54871) Google Scholar). To simplify comparisons between different PABC domains, we have adopted a numbering scheme that is anchored on the KITGMLLE motif common to all PABC domains. The PABC domain was defined to begin 34 residues before this motif (36 residues in the case of yPABC). The two additional residues in the loop between α helices 2 and 3 that are unique to theSaccharomyces and Caenorhabditis proteins were numbered 30a and 30b. The C-terminal domain of Pab1p, residues 491–577, was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (a gift from Malcolm Whiteway) with primers PAByC-F (5′-CCCACAAGGTGGATCCCCAAGAAATGC-3′) and PAByC-R (5′-GTGATTACATGAATTCTTAAGCTTGCTCAG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). pPYC was transformed into Escherichia coli expression host BL21 Gold (DE3) (Stratagene) and grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth or M9 media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression of the glutathioneS-transferase-yPABC fusion protein was induced at 30 °C by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h and purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase tag was cleaved from yPABC by treatment for 20 h at 4 °C with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) on the column at 2.5 units/mg of fusion protein to yield a 92-residue protein fragment consisting of the 87 C-terminal residues of Pab1p plus a 5-residue (Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser) N-terminal extension. Glutathione-Sepharose was used to remove the PreScission protease. The sequence composition of purified yPABC was confirmed by mass spectrometry. For NMR analysis, the protein was exchanged into NMR buffer (50 mm K·HPO4, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm NaN3, pH 6.3). The final yield of purified yPABC domain was 6 mg/liter culture (M9) media including 6 g of Na2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, 0.5 g of15NH4Cl (Isotec, Inc.), and 2 g of [13C6]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory). Unlabeled peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse-phase chromatography on a Vydac C18 column (Hesperia, CA). The composition and purity of the peptides was verified by ion-spray quadrupole mass spectroscopy. The C-terminal domain of human Paip2, residues 106–127, was amplified by PCR using a plasmid template (a gift of Nahum Sonenberg) with primers P2C-F (5′-TCTTCTCTGGAAGGATCCGTGGTCAAGAGC-3′) and P2C-R (5′-CAGATGCACGACGAATTCTCAAATATTTCC-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to make plasmid pP2C. An15N-labeled peptide of this construct was made by expressing pP2C in E. coli expression host BL21 Gold (DE3) grown in M9 media containing 15NH4Cl and purifying the fusion protein as described previously for yPABC. Digestion with PreScission protease using the same conditions as described above yielded a 27-residue peptide consisting of the 22 C-terminal residues of human Paip2 plus a 5-residue (Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser) N-terminal extension. The peptide was desalted using C18 reverse-phase chromatography and then lyophilized. The composition and purity of the peptides was verified by ion-spray quadrupole mass spectroscopy. Peptide titrations were carried by adding either labeled or unlabeled Paip2 peptide into unlabeled or labeled yPABC, respectively. Titrations were monitored by 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra of the labeled species (either peptide or protein) and were brought to a final protein concentration of 1 mm. NMR resonance assignments of yPABC were determined using standard triple resonance techniques on a13C,15N-labeled sample (16Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (785) Google Scholar) on a Bruker DRX500 NMR spectrometer. All NMR experiments were recorded at 303 K. Main-chain Cα, N, and HN and side-chain Cβresonances were assigned using HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH experiments (17Grzesiek S. Dobeli H. Gentz R. Garotta G. Labhardt A.M. Bax A.

Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).1H,15N dipolar couplings were measured with an in-phase/anti-phase (IPAP)-heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiment on an isotropic sample (without phage) and on a sample containing 18 mg/ml Pf1 phage (20Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 21Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Other backbone and side-chain signal assignments were obtained from three-dimensional heteronuclear NOESY and total correlation spectroscopy experiments at 500 and 750 MHz and a homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY experiment at 500 MHz. NOESY constraints for the structure determination were obtained from15N-edited NOESY and 13C-edited NOESY three-dimensional experiments and two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY. The 15N-NOESY spectrum was recorded on a Varian Unity Plus 750 MHz spectrometer at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Assignments of amide resonances in the yPABP-Paip2 complex were based on an 1H,15N-edited NOESY spectrum obtained at 500 MHz. The 1H,15N heteronuclear NOEs were measured at 500 MHz on a 15N-labeled Paip2 (residues 106–127) complexed with unlabeled yPABC (22Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were processed with GIFA (23Malliavin T. Pons J.-L. Delsuc M.-A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 445-452PubMed Google Scholar) and XWINNMR software version 2.5 (Bruker Biospin) and analyzed with XEASY (24Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). For the structure determination, a set of 971 NOEs were collected from homonuclear and15N-edited NOESY spectra of Pab1p-(491–577) acquired at 500 and 750 MHz, respectively. After determination of the protein fold using manual NOE assignments (25Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), automated NOE assignments were made using ambiguous restraints for iterative assignment (ARIA) (26Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined using standard protocols in CNS version 0.9 (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16913) Google Scholar). PROCHECK-NMR was used to check protein stereochemical geometry and generate the Ramachandran plot of Fig. 2 (28Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1IFW, and the NMR assignments have been deposited under BMRB accession number 5053. The C-terminal fragment, yPABC, of Pab1p (residues 491–577; Fig.1) from S. cerevisiae was prepared as an isotopically labeled, recombinant protein fragment for structural studies by NMR spectroscopy at 500 and 750 MHz. The yPABC domain gave excellent quality spectra, and a large number of structural constraints were determined (TableI). The secondary structure and NOEs were very similar to human PABP, with the notable absence of the first α helix (Fig. 2 a). In addition to NOE and dihedral angle constraints, a small set of 48 residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) was measured on a sample of15N-labeled yPABC in Pf1 phage (Fig. 2 b).

Open table in a new tab The folded domain of yPABC includes ∼65 residues (502–567 of Pab1p) as a bundle of four helices (Fig. 3). The overall fold is similar to the recently determined PABC structures from human PABP (12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and HYD (13Deo R.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The four helices (numbered 2–5) form a compact structure with a well packed hydrophobic core consisting of residues Leu-17, Leu-21, Val-25, Ala-32, Ala-33, Ile-36, Ile-40, Leu-43, Val-48, Phe-49, Leu-51, Leu-52, Phe-58, Tyr-62, Ala-65, Ala-68, and Tyr-69. yPABC contains a unique two-amino acid insertion that is accommodated in the loop between helices 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). The most unusual feature of yPABC is the strong bend in the last α helix. This helix shows a roughly 50° bend centered around Tyr-62 and terminates antiparallel with helix 3. Helix 5 contributes three aromatic residues (Phe-58, Tyr-62, and Tyr-69) to the hydrophobic core. The bend can be detected in the RDC data; parallel RDC experiments on hPABP confirm that this is a unique feature of the yeast domain. 2G. Kozlov, unpublished results. Surprisingly, all the φ/ψ angles in helix 5 fall in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot for α helices (Fig. 2 d). As is the case for the HYD PABC domain, the yPABC domain is missing the first helix. Instead, the fourth helix in yPABC is raised and replaces a number of the contacts between helix 1 and 2 in hPABP (Fig. 3,d–f). The first N-terminal helix of PABC from hPABP is itself dispensable, and a shortened fragment (PABP residues 554–636) gave a 1H,15N correlation spectrum similar to that of the full-length domain (data not shown). Overall, the PABC domain from yeast PABP appears to be more closely related to the PABC domain from human HYD than human PABP. This is a consequence of the greater sequence relatedness of yPABC and HYD but is more clearly evident in the three-dimensional structures. A pairwise overlay of the most conserved Cα residues in the three proteins gives over twice the r.m.s.d. for hPABP compared with HYD (Fig3 c). Peptide binding studies were used to determine the specificity and position of the peptide-binding site on yPABC. The initial choice of peptides was based on the consensus binding sequence determined for the human PABC (12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The list of peptides studied is shown in TableII. Four peptides were found to bind to yPABC. The 22-residue C-terminal peptide from Paip2 demonstrated one of the highest affinities. Chemical shift mapping was used to identify yPABC residues that participate in peptide binding (Fig.4). Residues with the largest chemical shift changes (((Δ1H shift)2 + (Δ15N shift × 0.2)2)1/2) on binding of Paip2 were Lys-35 (0.6 ppm), Tyr-22 (0.47), Glu-19 (0.45), Met-39 (0.39), Gln-20 (0.39), and Ile-40 (0.37). Only small chemical shift changes were observed in helix 5 (Fig. 3), in contrast to previous results with hPABP (12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Instead, almost all the chemical shift changes occur in helices 2 and 3 around the hydrophobic binding pocket, which is the presumed binding pocket for Phe-118 of Paip2. Additional changes occur at the N terminus of helix 2 and likely reflect interactions with the C-terminal portion of the peptide (see below).Table IIPeptides used in yPABC binding assays1 Based on amide chemical shift changes in NMR titrations.

Yeast does not have a protein homologous to Paip2. Using the previously published consensus for human PABC (TableIII), we searched the S. cerevisiae genome for related sequences that might bind to yPABC. Among proteins known to interact with Pab1p, we identified residues 234–250 from Pan1p (29Boeck R. Tarun S., Jr. Rieger M. Deardorff J.A. Muller-Auer S. Sachs A.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7383-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a peptide derived from the N terminus of RF3 (residues 106–122) (Table II). None of these peptides bound to yPABC, as determined by the absence of chemical shift changes in1H,15N correlation spectra. Similar negative results were obtained for a peptide derived from human Paip1. This was unexpected since Paip1 has been shown to bind to HYD (13Deo R.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Of nine peptides tested, the four that bound were the Paip2 peptide, a peptide from the N terminus of human RF3, a peptide similar to Pichia pinus RF3, and a peptide from the Drosophila shuttle craft protein (Table II).Table IIIPotential PABC sites in yeast RF3 sequences3-1 From Ref. 12Kozlov G.

Based on the similar amounts of line-broadening in spectra with other peptides, we estimate that the affinities of all the ligands tested are in the millimolar range. This is 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than that measured for Paip2/hPABP (7Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A., De Crescenzo G. Roy G. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. O'Connor-McCourt M. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5200-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and likely reflects the fact that the peptides do not interact with the C-terminal helix of yPABC. We also monitored complex formation from the peptide side by cloning and expressing a 15N-labeled fragment of Paip2 (residues 106–127). The 1H,15N correlation spectrum of the unbound peptide showed the small dispersion of signals characteristic of an unfolded peptide (Fig. 4 c). The addition of unlabeled yPABC to the 15N-labeled peptide caused changes in roughly half of the signals. The complex was in intermediate exchange, so many of the NMR peaks broadened or disappeared upon the addition of yPABC. We identified peptide residues involved in PABC binding by an1H,15N heteronuclear NOE (hNOE) experiment (Fig. 4 d). The hNOE is a measure of the reorientation rate of the amide nitrogen-hydrogen internuclear vectors and, thus, of the mobility of the peptide residues. At 500 MHz, the hNOE varies between −3.6 and 0.82 for mobile and immobile residues (22Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For Paip2 residues Leu-103 to Leu-111 and Lys-123 to Ile-127, the hNOE was negative, which indicates a lack of binding. Residues Asn-112 to Val-122 gave small or zero hNOEs and identified these residues as binding to yPABC. The absence of positive hNOEs is a reflection of the weak binding of Paip2 to yPABC. For several residues in the middle of the binding region, no hNOE signal could be detected. This was a consequence of exchange broadening and constitutes independent evidence for PABC binding by these residues. Residue Phe-118 of Paip2 showed the largest hNOE, which is consistent with its key role in complex formation. Previous studies identified a 12-residue consensus PABC site between Ser-109 and Pro-120 of Paip2 (7Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A., De Crescenzo G. Roy G. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. O'Connor-McCourt M. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5200-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our hNOE results suggest that this motif is shifted toward the C terminus and includes Gly-121 and Val-122. This agrees with on-going studies with PABC from human PABP, which suggest that Paip2 binds hPABP as a series of β-turns.2 For yPABC, small negative hNOE values were observed for residues Ser-109 through Leu-111. These negative hNOEs likely reflect the differences in the structure and position of the last α helix in yPABC and hPABP. Residues Ser-109 through Leu-111 do bind hPABP but via helix 5.2 These results suggest that the major specificity differences between PABC domains in human and yeast PABP occur in the N-terminal residues of the peptide ligands due to the altered structure of the terminal helices. PABCs are highly conserved eukaryotic protein domains of 64–72 amino acids in length and sequence identities of 40% in interspecies comparisons. Three subfamilies can be distinguished in a phylogenetic tree of PABC sequences (Fig. 1 b). The first group encompasses PABCs of animal origin, with overall pairwise identities of 80% or more (62% for C. elegans). Tissue-specific (testis) or -inducible (activated platelets or T cells) isoforms have been described in humans (31Feral C. Guellaen G. Pawlak A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1872-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Houng A.K. Maggini L. Clement C.Y. Reed G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Yang H. Duckett C.S. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6770-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and these sequences show a slightly lower level of identity when compared with other forms. This is likely the result of subcellular or tissue specialization, with conserved but distinct specificity among the different PABC domains within one organism. A second branch groups a family of more divergent PABC domains of vegetal origin with pairwise sequence identities of about 70%. PABC from the parasite Trypanosoma brucei is branched with its homologues in plants; this is supported by recent work that has hinted at a weak phylogenetic link between the euglenozoan lineage (to which trypanosomids belong) and plants (34Baldauf S.L. Roger A.J. Wenk-Siefert I. Doolittle W.F. Science. 2000; 290: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The third, most divergent group contains the PABC domains of the ubiquitin ligases of the hyperplastic discs (HYD) family as well as S. cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe PABPs. The relationship between HYD and PABP proteins has not yet been established, but it hints at a role for ubiquitination in the regulation of protein synthesis. Structurally, the absence of the first α helix in yPABC and HYD seems to be a feature of the third group of PABC domains. Secondary structure predictions using the multivariate linear regression combination (MLRC) software (35Guermeur Y. Geourjon C. Gallinari P. Deleage G. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) as well as sequence conservation indicate the likely presence of helix 1 in the wheat PABC domain and most other plant PABCs, including trypanosomids, whereas the fungal PABC fromAspergillus nidulans was predicted to harbor only four helices. Limited data are available on the binding specificity of PABC domains. PABC from hPABP is known to bind a number of different proteins and peptides that were used to derive a consensus binding sequence or PABC site (12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The PABC domain of HYD has been shown to bind Paip1 (13Deo R.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, we show that yPABC binds peptides from Paip2 and human RF3 but not Paip1. The failure of yPABC to bind Paip1 is surprising given the close similarity of Paip1 and Paip2 around the critical Phe-X-Pro sequence at the C terminus of the consensus motif (Table III). The phenylalanine is highly conserved and essential for binding.2 The weak affinities of the tested peptides suggest that a novel specificity exists for yPABC. Among the proteins/peptides that bind to yPABC (Table II), only RF3 occurs in yeast. In S. cerevisiae, RF3 was first identified as the stop codon suppressor mutations Sup35 and Sup2 (36Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I. Paushkin S.V. Nierras C.R. Cox B.S. Ter- Avanesyan M.D. Tuite M.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4365-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 37Zhouravleva G. Frolova L., Le Goff X., Le Guellec R. Inge-Vechtomov S. Kisselev L. Philippe M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). More recently, this protein has received considerable attention as it mediates non-mendelian inheritance through a prion-like mechanism. The yeast [PSI+ ] prion phenotype results from self-propagating aggregation of RF3 through its N-terminal domain (38Santoso A. Chien P. Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This behavior is thought to be related to the large number of glutamine residues at the N terminus. Comparison of RF3 sequences from 11 different yeast species allowed us to identify potential PABC binding sequences in all but 4 species:S. cerevisiae, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii,Saccharomycodes ludwigii, and Kluyveromyces lactis (Table III). As is the case for human RF3, several of the RF3 proteins contain two or three potential PABC-binding sites.Yarrowia lipolytica RF3 contains three overlapping, putative PABC sites. It is unknown if all these sites are functional or if cooperativity exists between them. The absence of an evident PABC site in S. cerevisiae RF3 suggests that this interaction may be absent in baker's yeast and related strains. The four species missing PABC sites are most closely related to each other based on phylogenetic grouping of yeast using 23 S RNA sequences, which suggests that the site was lost relatively recently (38Santoso A. Chien P. Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 39Kushnirov V.V. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Didichenko S.A. Smirnov V.N.

Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7383-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used the C-terminal portion of Pab1p as bait in a two-hybrid screen for interacting yeast proteins. Surprisingly, none of the proteins identified contain a consensus PABC site. Instead, mutagenesis studies indicate that the region preceding yPABC (Pab1p residues 406–494) is required for the binding of Pbp1p (11Mangus D.A. Amrani N. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7383-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This preceding region is not a structured part of the C-terminal domain of yPABP (12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Deo R.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4414-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although Pbp1p does not bind PABC, it is related to ataxin-2, the human protein responsible for type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA2), which does contain a PABC site (11Mangus D.A. Amrani N. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7383-7396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kozlov G. Trempe J.F. Khaleghpour K. Kahvejian A. Ekiel I. Gehring K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Perhaps coincidentally, the origin of SCA2 is a polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-2 that leads to protein aggregation as for RF3. In conclusion, the structure of the PABC domain from the yeast poly(A)-binding protein shows similarities to previous structures but contains a very different C-terminal helix (Fig. 3). This gives rise to a distinct binding specificity for yPABC, particularly toward the N terminus of the bound peptides (Fig. 4). A hydrophobic pocket between helices 3 and 5, which is unique to yPABC, could bind aromatic residues that occur in the N-terminal end of PABC sites in fungal RF3 proteins (Table III), but no PABC site was detected in RF3 from S. cerevisiae. Future work will be directed toward understanding the function of yPABC in S. cerevisiae and in the identification of physiological binding partners.

Open table in a new tab During the last decade, significant progress has been made in elucidating the structural features of HPLC6 that are required to give antifreeze activity.

However, a model that explains the selective interaction of HPLC6 with the [2 0 2̄ 1] interface has not emerged (for a full description of the different ice interfaces see the previous review (12Harding M.M. Ward L.G. Haymet A.D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)). Recent computational studies on the nature of the ice/water interface have allowed the first real simulations of the interaction of HPLC6 with the fluid interface to be carried out (30Dalal P.

Hew C.L. Shears M. Fletcher G. Can. J. Zool. 1988; 66: 403-408Crossref Google Scholar), the shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) (3Hew C.L. Joshi S. Wang N.-C. Kao M.-H. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Fletcher G.L. Addison R.F. Slaughter D. Hew C.L. Arctic. 1982; 35: 302-306Crossref Google Scholar), and the Arctic sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpioides) (33Yang D.S.C. Sax M. Chakrabartty A. Hew C.L. Nature. 1988; 333: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) have been much less studied. These proteins differ from both HPLC6 and sequences from the right-eye flounders in the N-terminal region of the sequence. The N-terminal residues of the sculpin proteins (e.g. SS3, SS8 in Table I) include established helix-breaking residues followed by an 11-residue repeat unit that is similar to the Thr-X 2-Asx-X 7 repeat present in the other type I proteins (12Harding M.M. Ward L.G. Haymet A.D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Two proteins, XSS3 and XSS8 (Table I), have been isolated from the blood serum of the shorthorn sculpin (3Hew C.L. Joshi S. Wang N.-C. Kao M.-H. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has been estimated using CD spectroscopy that XSS8, the major component, is more helical than XSS3, and it has been proposed that there are two different structural and possibly functional domains, the nine-residue N terminus and the alanine-rich helical region between residues 8 and 42 (3). Vacuum phase molecular dynamics studies on SS8, a closely related sequence to XSS8, concluded that the polypeptide conformation resembles an idealized α-helix, except for a short section of the N-terminal region (34Wierzbicki A. Taylor M.S. Knight C.A. Madura J.D. Harrington J.P. Sikes C.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 8-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This study also proposed that SS8 acts via insertion of the side chains of the Arg and Lys residues into the ice lattice. However, no experimental or condensed-phase computational evidence exists to support these conclusions. Of particular significance is the fact that the sculpin proteins accumulate specifically at a different ice plane than the winter flounder protein HPLC6 (15Knight C.A. Cheng C.-H.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The origin of this difference in specificity between the flounder and sculpin proteins is not understood and must eventually be explained by any proposed model(s) of ice growth inhibition by the type I AFPs. Recent structure-activity studies on SS8 (that was independently isolated and resequenced) propose a mechanism that involves appreciable hydrophobic interactions, with the lysine residues enhancing solubility (35Baardnes J. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Kondejewski L.H. Kuiper M.J. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The lack of understanding of the one or more mechanisms through which the type I AFPs inhibit ice growth has also hampered the realization of industrial and biotechnological applications (6Fletcher G.L. Goddard S.V. Wu Y.L. Chemtech. 1999; 29: 17-28Google Scholar, 7Feeney R.E. Yeh Y. Trends Food Sci. Technol. 1998; 9: 102-106Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the production of these proteins using solid-phase synthesis (which has been used to produce almost all the analogues of HPLC6 reported to date) is unsuitable for the large scale production of structural variants of the wild-type proteins. In this paper, we address both these issues by producing a type I polypeptide from the shorthorn sculpin (rSS3) using recombinant methods. 2Presented in part at the IUPAC World Chemistry Congress, Brisbane, Australia, July 2001 and the Novartis Foundation/Royal Society Discussion Meeting, London, UK, September 28, 2001.2Presented in part at the IUPAC World Chemistry Congress, Brisbane, Australia, July 2001 and the Novartis Foundation/Royal Society Discussion Meeting, London, UK, September 28, 2001. This has allowed complete 1H and 15N resonance assignments and characterization of the solution conformation of rSS3 using heteronuclear NMR experiments. Ice growth inhibition studies on rSS3 and an acetylated derivative have provided important new clues regarding the mechanism of action of these proteins and have allowed a new contribution to the mechanism to be proposed to explain the unique interaction of the sculpin AFPs with ice.DISCUSSIONCompared with the type I winter flounder proteins (in particular HPLC6), much less is known about the type I sculpin proteins. There are no x-ray or NMR structures of AFPs from any of the sculpin proteins, and, with the exception of a very recent report on SS8 (35Baardnes J. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Kondejewski L.H. Kuiper M.J. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), systematic structure-activity studies to determine the residues that are crucial for activity have not been reported. The sculpin proteins are important, given that SS8 was proposed to interact with the ice surface based on the spacing of Lys-9, Lys-23, Lys-31, and Arg-12 (34Wierzbicki A. Taylor M.S. Knight C.A. Madura J.D. Harrington J.P. Sikes C.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 8-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar);i.e. a completely different mechanism to that proposed for HPLC6 and other synthetic flounder AFPs, including VVVV2KE, in which hydrophobic interactions play a dominant role in the mechanism (21Haymet A.D.J. Ward L.G. Harding M.M. Knight C.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Haymet A.D.J. Ward L.G. Harding M.M. J. Am. Chem.

We have previously noted that a common hydrophobic face is present in all type I proteins, including the sculpins (12Harding M.M. Ward L.G. Haymet A.D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and hence proposed that the type I AFPs act via a common mechanism. Very recently this hypothesis has been confirmed by point mutations made on SS8, which have identified the alanine-rich surface as oriented toward ice, and the charged residues oriented toward liquid water (35Baardnes J. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Kondejewski L.H. Kuiper M.J. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Despite the presence of a common hydrophobic face in all type I AFPs (12Harding M.M. Ward L.G. Haymet A.D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the sculpins accumulate at a different ice plane than the flounder proteins; the winter flounder sequence HPLC6 (and the synthetic mutant VVVV2KE) accumulates on the 12 equivalent {2 02̄ 1} bipyramidal planes of the ice 1h crystal (15Knight C.A. Cheng C.-H.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) whereas the shorthorn sculpin (and the synthetic mutant AAAA2KE) accumulates on the six equivalent {2 1̄ 1̄ 0} planes (34Wierzbicki A. Taylor M.S. Knight C.A. Madura J.D. Harrington J.P. Sikes C.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 8-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (for a detailed description of the origin and naming of the different ice planes see for example Ref. 12Harding M.M. Ward L.G. Haymet A.D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The origin of this difference is not understood, but an obvious structural difference between the natural flounder and sculpin sequences is the N-terminal region of the polypeptides (TableI).We chose SS3, as one of the simplest sculpin proteins, to prepare and investigate the solution conformation, particularly of the N-terminal region, and to allow preparation of a simple acetylated derivative that would establish the residues that are required for antifreeze activity. A highly effective expression system for production of the protein as a GST fusion was developed, which yielded milligram quantities of purified rSS3 from a few liters of bacterial culture. After affinity chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, rSS3 was >99% pure, a level of purity much greater than sSS3, or other related proteins that our laboratory has produced using solid-phase peptide synthesis (21Haymet A.D.J. Ward L.G. Harding M.M. Knight C.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Haymet A.D.J. Ward L.G. Harding M.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 941-948Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar,53Haymet A.D.J. Ward L.G. Harding M.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, in our hands, the expression of rSS3 is superior to solid-phase production of sSS3 in terms of the time required for the synthesis, overall cost, and the purity of the isolated protein. The recombinant system also offers the additional advantages of simple and inexpensive production of mutants (which may be used for mechanistic or biotechnological studies) and the ability to produce isotopically labeled forms of the protein (e.g. 15N-rSS3 or15N,13C-rSS3) for detailed structural analysis using NMR spectroscopy.Although CD measurements are consistent with ∼42% helicity at 2 °C, NMR studies (Figs. 3 and 4) provide clear evidence that rSS3 is highly structured and predominantly α-helical in conformation at low temperature. Examination of the NMR parameters presented in Fig. 5suggests that residues 5–33 of rSS3 adopt a stable α-helical conformation, whereas residues 1–4 are partially helical. This corresponds to an overall helicity of ∼80–90% (taking into account the non-native residues −2 and −1 that were introduced by the cloning procedure). It is interesting that there is such a large apparent difference between the estimates of helicity based on CD and NMR data. This is most likely related to the method used to estimate helicity from CD data (38Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar), which is not well suited to proteins containing non-helical secondary structure. Alternatively, there may be some flexibility in the helix (especially near the termini) that reduces the CD value and is not accurately reflected in the NMR parameters we have measured. This issue will be resolved when a full structure determination is carried out using more NMR data.For comparison, vacuum modeling has predicted that SS8 adopts a fully α-helical conformation (34Wierzbicki A. Taylor M.S. Knight C.A. Madura J.D. Harrington J.P. Sikes C.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 8-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas more recent molecular dynamics calculations on SS8 have predicted that the N-terminal cap structure folds the N terminus up and away from the Ala-rich surface of the protein (35Baardnes J. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Kondejewski L.H. Kuiper M.J. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although direct comparisons between the conformation of residues 1–10 of SS3 and SS8 cannot be made, our results suggest that the first 10 residues of SS3 are aligned approximately parallel to the α-helix formed by residues 11–33, with no significant deviation similar to that predicted for SS8 (35Baardnes J. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Kondejewski L.H. Kuiper M.J. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Further structural constraints derived from 15N,13C-labeled protein (including13C-X residual dipolar couplings) are required to fully refine the structure.Although both sSS3 and rSS3 cause faceting of the ice crystals to occur, zero or very low thermal hysteresis values were measured. Thus, both polypeptides behave as ice growth modifiers (12Harding M.M. Ward L.G. Haymet A.D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) rather than as true kinetic ice growth inhibitors or AFPs. The measured hysteresis value is significantly lower than that reported from SS3 isolated from sculpin blood serum (3Hew C.L. Joshi S. Wang N.-C. Kao M.-H. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, both of the naturally occurring sculpin proteins XSS3 and XSS8 isolated and characterized by Hewet al. (3Hew C.L. Joshi S. Wang N.-C. Kao M.-H. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) contained an uncharacterized blocked N terminus. In the case of SS8, cleavage of this blocking group reduced the thermal hysteresis (Table I). Thus, the difference between the measured hysteresis values for sculpin XSS3 (0.37 °C) and the synthetic sSS3/rSS3 polypeptides (0.0 °C) is consistent with the requirement of an N-terminal blocking group for activity.The thermal hysteresis and characteristic ice faceting of 4Ac-rSS3 (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8) show that not only is this derivative a true kinetic ice growth inhibitor, but also that this derivative is more active than rSS3, which exhibited negligible hysteresis. These results conclusively rule out an inserted charge mechanism, similar to that proposed for SS8 involving the protonated lysine amino groups and the arginine side chain (34Wierzbicki A. Taylor M.S. Knight C.A. Madura J.D. Harrington J.P. Sikes C.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 8-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and support our earlier hypothesis that the hydrophobic face is important in the mechanism of ice growth in both the winter flounder and sculpin proteins (12Harding M.M. Ward L.G. Haymet A.D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our hypothesis is also supported by the very recent work by Baardnes et al. (35Baardnes J. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Kondejewski L.H. Kuiper M.J. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) on SS8 in which point mutations of the hydrophobic face were seen to switch off antifreeze activity. This study also identified the blocking group as an acetyl group and, although SS3 was not studied, it seems plausible that the blocking group X is the same in both SS3 and SS8.Fig. 9 shows a helical wheel representation of SS3 with the hydrophilic face containing the highlighted lysine residues proposed to be oriented toward liquid water. The increase in hysteresis that occurred following acetylation of rSS3 is consistent with two current hypotheses. First, it supports a role for the N-terminal group in activity, originally proposed by Hewet al. (3Hew C.L. Joshi S. Wang N.-C. Kao M.-H. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The N-terminal blocking group may affect several properties of the polypeptide, including overall charge, dipole moment, N-terminal capping network, and solution conformation, all of which need to be considered in further refinement of the mechanism for ice growth inhibition.In addition, our recent studies have shown that there is significant charge inhomogeneity at the ice/water interface (54Hayward J.A. Haymet A.D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 2001; 114: 3713-3726Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 55Bryk, T., and Haymet, A. D. J. (2002) J. Chem. Phys., in pressGoogle Scholar). The full charge distribution of SS3, or any polypeptide, interacts with the charge inhomogeneity that occurs naturally at any broad interface such as the ice/water interface. This full charge distribution may be summarized crudely by the dipole moment of the polypeptide. Thus we have proposed that, next in importance to hydrophobicity, the overall charge distribution of the polypeptide is a crucial factor that influences the exact interface at which the polypeptide accumulates (55Bryk, T., and Haymet, A. D. J. (2002) J. Chem. Phys., in pressGoogle Scholar). A consequence of this hypothesis is that enhancing the charge distribution in the polypeptide will increase the strength of the interaction with the ice/water interface (55Bryk, T., and Haymet, A. D. J. (2002) J. Chem. Phys., in pressGoogle Scholar) and lead to greater thermal hysteresis. Hence, the observed increased thermal hysteresis of the acetylated derivative 4Ac-rSS3 compared with rSS3, which enhances the molecular charge distribution, is consistent with this hypothesis. However, slightly different conformations of the native protein from the fish, rSS3, and 4Ac-rSS3 cannot be ruled out as contributor to the different thermal hysteresis values. Further NMR studies to determine full structures of these AFPs would be informative in this regard.In summary, this study reports the first recombinant production, solution conformation, and preparation and ice growth inhibition properties of an acetylated derivative of the 33-residue AFP from the shorthorn sculpin. Together with recent independent studies on the 42-residue shorthorn sculpin AFP, SS8 (35Baardnes J. Jelokhani-Niaraki M. Kondejewski L.H. Kuiper M.J. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), these data confirm our hypothesis (12Harding M.M. Ward L.G. Haymet A.D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that all type I AFPs contain a common hydrophobic face that is required for antifreeze activity. Beyond supporting the hydrophobicity mechanism, the data are consistent both with a proposed role for the N-terminal blocking group (3Hew C.L. Joshi S. Wang N.-C. Kao M.-H. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and with the proposed role of the interaction of the overall charge distribution of the peptide with the ice/water interface (55Bryk, T., and Haymet, A. D. J. (2002) J. Chem. Phys., in pressGoogle Scholar). The complete details of the accumulation of SS3 at the specific {2 1̄ 1̄ 0} ice plane require further detailed molecular simulations and experimental studies. The type I AFPs1 found in the blood of cold water teleosts (1Duman J.G. DeVries A.L. Nature. 1974; 247: 237-238Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Duman J.G. DeVries A.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

https://openalex.org/W2033900277,"Grb2-associated binder-1 (Gab1) is an adapter protein related to the insulin receptor substrate family. It is a substrate for the insulin receptor as well as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and other receptor-tyrosine kinases. To investigate the role of Gab1 in signaling pathways downstream of growth factor receptors, we stimulated rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) with EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Gab1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGF and PDGF within 1 min. AG1478 (an EGF receptor kinase-specific inhibitor) failed to block PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that transactivated EGF receptor is not responsible for this signaling event. Because Gab1 associates with phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), we studied the role of the PLCγ pathway in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF was impaired in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing mutant PDGFβ receptor (Y977F/Y989F: lacking the binding site for PLCγ). Pretreatment of VSMC with U73122 (a specific PLCγ inhibitor) inhibited Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well, indicating the importance of the PLCγ pathway. Gab1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by phorbol ester to the same extent as PDGF stimulation. Studies using antisense protein kinase C (PKC) oligonucleotides and specific inhibitors showed that PKCα and PKCε are required for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Binding of Gab1 to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was significantly decreased by PLCγ and/or PKC inhibition, suggesting the importance of the PLCγ/PKC-dependent Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation for the interaction with other signaling molecules. Because PDGF-mediated ERK activation is enhanced in Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress Gab1, Gab1 serves as an important link between PKC and ERK activation by PDGFβ receptors in VSMC. Grb2-associated binder-1 (Gab1) is an adapter protein related to the insulin receptor substrate family. It is a substrate for the insulin receptor as well as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and other receptor-tyrosine kinases. To investigate the role of Gab1 in signaling pathways downstream of growth factor receptors, we stimulated rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) with EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Gab1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by EGF and PDGF within 1 min. AG1478 (an EGF receptor kinase-specific inhibitor) failed to block PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that transactivated EGF receptor is not responsible for this signaling event. Because Gab1 associates with phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), we studied the role of the PLCγ pathway in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF was impaired in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing mutant PDGFβ receptor (Y977F/Y989F: lacking the binding site for PLCγ). Pretreatment of VSMC with U73122 (a specific PLCγ inhibitor) inhibited Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well, indicating the importance of the PLCγ pathway. Gab1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by phorbol ester to the same extent as PDGF stimulation. Studies using antisense protein kinase C (PKC) oligonucleotides and specific inhibitors showed that PKCα and PKCε are required for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Binding of Gab1 to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was significantly decreased by PLCγ and/or PKC inhibition, suggesting the importance of the PLCγ/PKC-dependent Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation for the interaction with other signaling molecules.

These proteins have multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites that act as docking sites for the Src homology (SH) 2 domains of various signaling proteins. These allow IRS proteins to function as multisite docking proteins and link growth factor receptors to multiple signaling pathways.

However, it has not yet been established what kinase is responsible for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation or whether Gab1 is required for growth factor-mediated signal transduction. In the present study we demonstrated that Gab1 was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated by PDGF in VSMC. We then investigated the upstream mediators of Gab1 phosphorylation. Based on the association between Gab1 and PLCγ (11Fixman E.D. Holgado-Madruga M. Nguyen L. Kamikura D.M. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we investigated the potential role of PLCγ for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. We used CHO cells expressing mouse wild type (WT) and mutant (Y977F/Y989F, lacking the PLCγ binding site) PDGFβ receptor and the specific PLCγ inhibitor U73122. Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased in both Y977F/Y989F-transfected CHO cells and VSMC pretreated with U73122. PKC is a molecule activated downstream of PLCγ, and Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF was totally blocked after inhibiting PKC activity. Experiments using phorbol esters suggested the involvement of conventional PKC (cPKC) and/or novel PKC (nPKC) for this process. We demonstrated previously the expression of PKCα (cPKC), PKCδ, and PKCε (nPKC) in cultured VSMC (13Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Studies with PKC inhibitors and antisense PKC oligonucleotides showed that PKCα and PKCε, but not PKCδ, are required for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF. Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, showing the importance of genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinases in this signaling event. It has been suggested that tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 associates with other signaling molecules such as SHP2 and PI3-K and subsequently regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity (9Takahashi-Tezuka M.

The binding between Gab1 and SHP2 or PI3-K was decreased by PLCγ and/or PKC inhibition that was parallel to the abrogation of Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Because PDGF-mediated ERK activation was significantly enhanced in Gab1-overexpressed CHO cells, these results indicate the importance of the PLCγ/PKC-dependent Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation for the interaction with other signaling molecules, which subsequently regulates ERK activation. Reagents and other supplies were obtained from the following sources. Cell culture medium was from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-cPKCα and anti-nPKCε antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-SH-PTP2 (SHP2), and protein A/G PLUS-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-human PDGFβ receptor, rabbit anti-PI3-K p85, and mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).

Recombinant human PDGF-BB was from Sigma. Recombinant human EGF was from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Rat aortic VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of 200–250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% serum as described (19Ishida T. Ishida M. Suero J. Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). VSMC of passage 8 to 14 at 70–80% confluence were growth-arrested by incubation in DMEM without serum for 48 h before use. Mouse PDGFβ receptor WT or mutant (Y977F/Y989F)-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were a kind gift from Dr. Harlan E. Ives. CHO cells were maintained in Ham's medium supplemented with 10% serum and 600 μg/ml G418. pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1 Gab1 was co-transfected with pcDNA3.1 hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged ERK2 into WT PDGF receptor-expressing CHO cells. The immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were performed following previously described methods (20Okuda M. Takahashi M. Suero J. Murry C.E. Traub O. Kawakatsu H. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26803-26809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Growth-arrested VSMC were stimulated with PDGF-BB or EGF as indicated in each experiment. Cells were lysed in Triton/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm KCl, 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol), scraped off the dish, and centrifuged. Lysates containing equal amounts (1 mg) of protein were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubating with protein A/G-agarose for 2 h, precipitates were washed four times with the lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After heating at 100 °C for 5 min, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (6–8%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation in blocking solution (5% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution in blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the membranes six times (5 min each) with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20), the blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution in blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed six times, and proteins were detected by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). CHO cells were grown to 50% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture dishes for transfection. Lipid 2012G (Sequitur, Inc.) was prepared in 5 μl/ml DMEM with 10% serum containing 200 nm oligonucleotide. After a 48-h incubation, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with PDGF for 5 min. Antisense and scramble oligonucleotides for mouse PKCα and PKCε were generous gifts from Dr. Brett Monia (ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA). Tyrosine phosphorylation levels were measured by densitometry of autoradiograms using NIH image. Results were corrected by the amount of loaded protein and presented as mean ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments. Significant differences (p < 0.01) were determined by Student'st test. To measure the effect of growth factors on Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, VSMC were exposed to 10 ng/ml EGF or PDGF-BB for 1–20 min. After the preparation of cell lysates, Gab1 was immunoprecipitated, and immunoblots were performed for phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 occurred within 1 min and peaked at 3 and 5 min after exposure to EGF and PDGF, respectively (Fig.1). It has been reported that cross-talk (transactivation) exists among growth factor receptors (21Saito Y. Berk B.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Saito Y. Haendeler J. Hojo Y. Yamamoto K. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6387-6394Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine the role of PDGF-induced EGF receptor transactivation in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, AG compound studies were performed (Fig. 2). VSMC were preincubated with 10 μm AG1295 and AG1296 (specific PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors) or AG1478 (specific EGF receptor kinase inhibitor) for 30 min before EGF and PDGF stimulation. We measured the inhibitor effects of AG compounds by their effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in co-immunoprecipitated EGF receptor (170 kDa) or PDGF receptor (180 kDa). Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF was inhibited by AG1478 but not by AG1295 or AG1296. On the contrary, PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by AG1295 and AG1296 but not by AG1478. These results show that EGF receptor kinase activity is required for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation when VSMC is stimulated by EGF, but transactivated EGF receptor kinase activity is not required when stimulated by PDGF. Inhibition of PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation with AG1295 and AG1296 suggests that PDGF receptor kinase activity is responsible for this signaling event. Although PLCγ has been reported to be associated with Gab1 (11Fixman E.D. Holgado-Madruga M. Nguyen L. Kamikura D.M. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20167-20172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Gual P. Giordano S. Williams T.A. Rocchi S. Van Obberghen E. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the function of this association has not yet been elucidated. To investigate the role of PLCγ in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we prepared CHO cells transfected with mouse PDGFβ receptor wild type (PDGFβR-WT) or with mutant (PDGFβR-Y977F/Y989F), which is unable to interact with PLCγ. In transfected CHO cells stimulated by PDGF (10 ng/ml, 5 min), both PDGFβR-WT and PDGFβR-Y977F/Y989F were tyrosine-phosphorylated to the same extent (Fig.3 A). However, Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF was significantly impaired in CHO cells transfected with PDGFβR-Y977F/Y989F compared with PDGFβR-WT, demonstrating PDGFβ receptor kinase activity (Fig. 3 B). PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was also abrogated after pretreatment with the PLCγ inhibitor U73122 (10 μm) (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that PLCγ activity plays an important role in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF. The results further suggest that the PDGFβ receptor is not the Gab1 tyrosine kinase. Because PLCγ stimulates diacylglycerol-dependent PKC isoforms, we further investigated the role of PKC in PDGF-stimulated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. To examine the signaling pathway downstream of PKC, we treated VSMC with the phorbol esters PMA and PDBu, which bind and activate PKC (cPKC and nPKC). Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was stimulated by 200 nm PMA to the same extent as by PDGF (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). Longer exposure to phorbol ester is known to down-regulate PKC expression (13Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). VSMC were pretreated with 1 μm PDBu for 24 h to down-regulate phorbol ester-responsive PKC isoforms and were stimulated with PDGF. As shown in Fig. 4 A (lane 4), PDGF-mediated Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly inhibited in PDBu-treated cells. These findings suggest a significant role for conventional and/or novel PKC isoforms for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. It has been reported that PKC is essential for erythropoietin receptor-tyrosine phosphorylation and that it regulates Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by erythropoietin (23von Lindern M. Parren-van Amelsvoort M. van Dijk T. Deiner E. van den Akker E. van Emst-de Vries S. Willems P. Beug H. Lowenberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34719-34727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that PDGFβ receptor is positively regulated by PKC in this context, we treated VSMC with chelerythrin (PKC inhibitor acting on the catalytic domain). Although PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by chelerythrin pretreatment (Fig.4 B), tyrosine phosphorylation in co-immunoprecipitated PDGFβ receptor was not inhibited, suggesting that PKC regulates Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of PDGFβ receptor but does not regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the PDGFβ receptor itself. It is also suggested that the binding between PDGFβ receptor and Gab1 is independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of Gab1. Previously we have characterized PKC isozyme expression in cultured VSMC, and we have shown that PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε are expressed among cPKC and nPKC (13Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To determine the PKC isozyme specificity for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we incubated VSMC with rottlerin (a specific PKCδ inhibitor). As shown in Fig. 5 A, PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was not blocked by rottlerin pretreatment. Next we used antisense PKCα and PKCε oligonucleotides. CHO cells were stimulated with PDGF 72 h after transfection. Expression of PKCα and PKCε were effectively decreased (Fig. 5, B andC, upper panels). PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly impaired in both antisense PKCα- and PKCε-transfected cells (Fig. 5, B and C,middle panels and graphs; p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). These results suggest that conventional PKCα and novel PKCε are both involved in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF. To study PTK responsible for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we designed experiments using PTK inhibitors. VSMC were pretreated with general PTK inhibitors (herbimycin A and genistein) and stimulated by PDGF. As shown in Fig.6 A, Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by genistein but not by herbimycin A. Herbimycin A is known to show inhibitory activity preferably to Src related kinases. Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 also failed to inhibit Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by PDGF (Fig.6 B). These results show that Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by genistein-sensitive kinases different from Src family kinases. To investigate the role of Gab1 in signaling pathways downstream of PDGFβ receptor, we prepared CHO cells expressing PDGFβR-WT that were co-transfected with an HA epitope-tagged ERK2 and an HA-tagged Gab1. PDGF stimulation of ERK2 phosphorylation was significantly increased (p < 0.001) in CHO cells that overexpress Gab1 as compared with control (vector) cells (Fig.7 A). It has been suggested that tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 associates with other signaling molecules such as SHP2 and PI3-K and subsequently regulates MAPK activity by IL6 (9Takahashi-Tezuka M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next studied the effect of inhibiting the PLCγ/PKC pathway on the association between Gab1 and SHP2 or PI3-K in PDGF-stimulated VSMC. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the amount of SHP2 and PI3-K co-immunoprecipitated by Gab1 was increased by PDGF in VSMC. However, when we pretreated VSMC with U73122 (PLCγ inhibitor) or chelerythrin (PKC inhibitor), PDGF-stimulated association of Gab1 with SHP2 and PI3-K was significantly reduced. Because Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation is abrogated by the inhibitors (Figs. 3 C and4 B), the results suggest that Gab1 needs to be tyrosine-phosphorylated to interact with SHP2 and PI3-K. Furthermore, the PLCγ/PKC-dependent Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be critical for association with other signaling molecules, thereby regulating PDGF-mediated ERK activation in VSMC. The major findings of this study are that Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by PDGF via a pathway that requires PLCγ, PKCα, and PKCε activity and genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinases (Fig. 8). Gab1 is important for PDGF signaling because overexpression leads to enhanced ERK activation upon stimulation by PDGF (Fig. 7 A). It has been reported that Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of EGF receptor (6Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 24Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

Muller-Wieland D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that Gab1 is also tyrosine-phosphorylated by PDGF in VSMC. Because there is accumulating evidence that EGFR is transactivated by PDGF (21Saito Y. Berk B.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), there is a possibility that Gab1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of EGFR that was transactivated by PDGF. In fact, Daub et al. (24Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) showed that Gab1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of transactivated EGFR in COS-7 cells when stimulated with G protein-coupled receptor agonist. We successfully excluded this possibility because AG1478 (a specific EGFR kinase inhibitor) failed to inhibit PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, a direct association between Gab1 and PDGF receptor was demonstrated because PDGF receptor was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-Gab1 (Figs. 1 and2). To characterize signaling molecules that are involved in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation, we first investigated PLCγ, which was already reported to be associated with Gab1 (11Fixman E.D.

Giordano S. Williams T.A. Rocchi S. Van Obberghen E. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrated that PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was impaired in PDGFβ receptor mutant (Y977F/Y989F, which lacks binding sites for PLCγ)-expressing CHO cells as compared with PDGFβ receptor wild type. The PLCγ inhibitor (U73122) dramatically reduced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF. These results strongly suggest that PLCγ and its downstream signaling cascade (but not PDGFβ receptor-tyrosine kinase activity) play an important role in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. PKC isozymes are serine-threonine kinases activated by diacylglycerol, which is a product generated by PLCγ. PKC consists of three subtypes, cPKC, nPKC, and atypical PKC. Our data using PMA and PDBu suggested that phorbol ester-responsive PKC isoforms (cPKC and nPKC) may be responsible for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In a previous report, we found that PKCα (cPKC), PKCδ, and PKCε (nPKC) are expressed predominantly in cultured VSMC (13Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that PKCα and PKCε are involved in important VSMC functions. Halleret al. (27Haller H. Lindschau C. Maasch C. Olthoff H. Kurscheid D. Luft F.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) observed that these two PKC isoforms were translocated to focal adhesions during integrin-induced VSMC spreading and that inhibition of these PKC isoforms with antisense oligonucleotides significantly inhibited cell spreading. Giardinaet al. (28Giardina J.B. Tanner D.J. Khalil R.A. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 561-568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that oxidized low density lipoprotein enhanced coronary vasoconstriction by increasing the activity of PKCα and PKCε. In the present study, our results showed the involvement of PKCα and PKCε in PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. PKCδ was considered unlikely based on experiments using rottlerin (a PKCδ inhibitor). However, the potential lack of specificity and the cell-specific ineffectiveness of drug inhibitors such as rottlerin limits our ability to completely rule out PKCδ or other PKC isozymes. Further study with other independent approaches will be required to define the precise role of PKC isozymes. The ubiquitously expressed Src family kinase members seem to be important mediators of PDGFβ receptor signal events, regulating the mitogenic response to PDGF (29Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We also reported previously that Src activity is important for ERK activation through transactivated EGF receptor by PDGF (22Saito Y. Haendeler J. Hojo Y. Yamamoto K. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6387-6394Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the present study showed no evidence for Src family kinase involvement in Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation because herbimycin A and PP2 failed to inhibit this signaling event. Genistein successfully inhibited PDGF-induced Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Further study is required to identify the particular tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate Gab1. In this study, we observed that overexpression of Gab1 in CHO cells significantly enhanced ERK activation by PDGF, suggesting that Gab1 plays an important role in ERK activation downstream of PDGFβ receptor in VSMC. Although the mechanism by which Gab1 contributes to ERK activation is still not fully understood, it has been reported that Gab1 needs to be tyrosine-phosphorylated to interact with other signaling molecules. For example, SHP2 and PI3-K bind to Gab1 that is tyrosine-phosphorylated by insulin (6Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J.

Because ERK is activated at much lower levels in cells from Gab1-deficient embryos in response to these growth factors or cytokines, these findings suggest that Gab1 is a common player in a broad range of growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways linking ERK MAPK activation (14Itoh M. Yoshida Y. Nishida K. Narimatsu M. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3695-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that the binding of SHP2 and PI3-K to Gab1 was increased in proportion to Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF in VSMC. A significant reduction in SHP2 and PI3-K associated with Gab1 was observed when Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by the blocking PLCγ/PKC activity. Considering that the expression of Gab1 protein was not affected by the 5-min PDGF incubation in VSMC, our results suggest that Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation is an important factor in regulating the PDGF-induced ERK activation, interacting with other molecules including SHP2 and PI3-K. In summary, PDGF-mediated ERK activation is positively regulated by tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1, which is also positively controlled by two different PKC isoforms, PKCα and PKCε, when VSMC are stimulated with PDGF. We conclude that activation of the PLCγ/PKC pathway including PKCα and PKCε is indispensable for Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation and that Gab1 plays a pivotal role in ERK activation in VSMC by PDGF. We thank Dr. Harlan E. Ives for providing the wild type and mutant PDGF receptor-expressing CHO cells and Dr. Brett Monia (ISIS Pharmaceuticals) for providing the antisense and scramble oligonucleotides for mouse PKCα and PKCε."
https://openalex.org/W2137657005,"His73 participates in the regulation of the nucleotide binding cleft conformation in yeast actin. Earlier molecular dynamics studies suggested that Asp184interacts with His73 thereby stabilizing a “closed-cleft” G-actin. However, β-actin in the open-cleft state shows a closer interaction of His73 with Asp179than with Asp184. We have thus assessed the relative importance of Asp184 and Asp179 on yeast actin stability and function. Neutral substitutions at 184 or 179 alone had little adverse effect on the monomer and polymerization behavior of actin. Arg or His at 184 in H73E actin partially rescued the monomeric properties of H73E actin, as demonstrated by near-normal thermostability and wild-type (WT)-like protease digestion patterns. ATP exchange was still considerably faster than with WT-actin although slower than that of H73E alone. However, polymerization of H73E/D184R and H73E/D184H is worse than with H73E alone. Conversely, D179R rescued all monomeric properties of H73E to near WT values and largely restored polymerization rate and filament thermostability. These results and new simulations of G-actin in the “open” state underscore the importance of the His73-Asp179 interaction and suggest that the open and not the closed state of yeast actin may be favored in the absence of the methyl group of His73.

In higher eukaryotic cells His73 is post-translationally methylated on the ε2 nitrogen of the imidazole ring (1Asatoor A.M. Armstrong M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 26: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Johnson P. Harris C.I. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1967; 105: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), although in lower eukaryotic species such asSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Naegleria gruberii, andCandida albicans it remains unmethylated (3Kalhor H.R. Niewmierzycka A. Faull K.F. Yao X. Grade S. Clarke S. Rubenstein P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Sussman D.J. Sellers J.R. Flicker P. Lai E.Y. Cannon L.E. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Fulton C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7349-7354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of this methylation is unknown. One proposed function of His73, based on modeling, is that it regulates the rate of phosphate release after ATP hydrolysis during actin polymerization (5Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins. 1999; 35: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). His73 is not close enough to the ATP γ-phosphate to interact directly with it prior to hydrolysis. However, after hydrolysis, the free γ-phosphate separates from the ADP and moves toward the imidazole group, allowing a possible ionic interaction to occur. This proposed interaction could retard the rate of the phosphate release from the protein interior, producing the significant lag in Pi release relative to polymerization observed with many actins. Because the release of phosphate determines the stability of actin filament and triggers filament disassembly (6Carlier M.F. Adv. Biophys. 1990; 26: 51-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3-4PubMed Google Scholar), such a hypothesis, if true, would make His73 an important regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics. Results from our initial attempts to address this hypothesis suggested an important role of His73 in actin structure other than the proposed phosphate release mechanism (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that His73 controls interdomain flexibility as well as overall stability of the actin molecule. Substitution of His73 with a neutral or acidic residue resulted in an increased interdomain flexibility and decreased thermal stability indicated by faster ATP exchange rate, increased susceptibility to selected proteases, and decreased melting temperature. In contrast, increasing the positive charge by replacement with Arg or Lys leads to a hyperstable monomer structure with decreased interdomain flexibility and increased thermal stability. A model for the conformational determination by His73 has been proposed by Wriggers and co-workers (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) based on the molecular simulations of WT,1 H73R, and H73E mutant actins. That model is based on the closed-cleft muscle actin structure that has methylhistidine at position 73 (9). The methyl group was removed to simulate the WT state of yeast actin. The results suggest that His73 is constrained with residue Asp184 across the cleft in a manner dependent on the methylation or protonation state of the imidazole ring. When methylhistidine is present, the imidazole group is about 5 Å away from the carboxylate of Asp184, stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the δ1 proton and the Gly158 oxygen. Without the methyl group, the imidazole group has three possible protonation states, with protons at either δ1 or ε2 nitrogens or both. When the δ1 nitrogen alone is protonated, the local conformation observed was the same as that when methylhistidine is present. When ε2 nitrogen alone is protonated, the imidazole ring is predicted to flip over and form a cross-domain interaction with Asp184 leading to a distinct conformation not possible with methylhistidine based on steric considerations. Although this contact with Asp184 did not completely form in the doubly protonated His73 case, probably because of an undersampling of the conformational variability in a single simulation trajectory, it appeared that His73-Asp184 interactions based on ε2 protonation could provide a new mechanism for cross-domain stabilization. This new conformation has not yet been observed crystallographically. If true, it distinguishes yeast actin from muscle actin that has methylhistidine, and the difference might account, at least partially, for some of the differences in behavior of these two actins (10Orlova A. Chen X. Rubenstein P.A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Kim E. Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16566-16572Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This cross-domain interaction is disrupted in our severest mutant, H73E, in which Glu73 actually forms an interaction with Arg183 in a different direction, causing a rearrangement of the set of hydrogen bonds at the bottom of the cleft. This reorientation may well lead to the abnormal monomer and polymer behavior we observe. An alternative scenario became apparent when we examined the actin structure in a more open state. The modeling study, predicting a cross-domain interaction between His73 and Asp184, was based on an actin structure in the closed state that was observed in the earlier crystal structures (9McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). However, Schutt and co-workers (12Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) more recently crystallized actin in an open-cleft conformation by altering the conditions for crystal bathing. Due to the opening of the cleft, His73 moves away from Asp184 causing a separation of ∼8 Å between the side chains of His73 and Asp184, a distance that appears to disfavor a direct contact. Asp179, which in the closed state is parked below His73 further down in the cleft, now faces His73 with the carboxyl group about 4 Å away from the imidazole ring. Thus, the 73–184 cross-cleft interaction in the closed state, strongly suggested by modeling, could be replaced by a 73–179 interaction in the open conformation. A structure depicting the relationship of these residues is shown in Fig.1. These two forms of interaction might be important in maintaining the distinct cleft conformation associated with the two states. His73 would be the pivotal residue involved in both interactions. In this paper, in order to test the role of Asp184 and Asp179 in determining the conformation of actin, we used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the effects of compensatory substitutions in this collection of residues on monomer stability and polymerizability. Because the conformational sampling by molecular dynamics is limited to the structural vicinity of one actin isoform, we performed new mutant structure predictions starting from both the closed and open states. Together, both mutagenesis and modeling allowed us to reexamine the role of Asp184 and Asp179on structure and function of yeast actin. The site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene. Oligodeoxynucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained through the DNA Core Facility at the University of Iowa. DNase I was obtained from Worthington. Affi-Gel 10 and Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Tris gel filtration chromatography columns were obtained from Bio-Rad. 1,N 6-Ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate, α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin were purchased from Sigma. All other compounds used were reagent grade quality. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the desired mutations into the yeast actin coding sequence. The template plasmid for single substitution was pRS314WN (13Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a derivative of pRS314 (14Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) carrying a WT yeast actin coding sequence and promoter between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. Double mutations H73E/D184R, H73E/D184H, and H73E/D179R were produced using pRS314-H73E actin as the template (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-CGATTTGGCCGGTAGAG(A/C)C(T/A/G)T(C/A)TTGACTGACTACTTGATGAAG-3′ was used to generate the mutant actins in which the codon for 184 Asp(GAT) was mutated to that for Ala(GCT), Val(GTT), Asn(AAC), His(CAC), and Arg(AGA). The oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-CGCCATTTTGAGAATCAG(A)A(T)TTGGCCGGTAGAGATTTGAC-3′ was used to generate the mutant actins in which the codon for Asp179(GAT) was mutated to Arg(AGA) and Asn(AAT). The underlined sequences are the mutated codons. The DNA was sequenced in each case to verify the desired mutation. Plasmids containing the mutant coding sequences were introduced into atrp1, ura3-52 haploid cell in which the chromosomal ACT1 gene had been disrupted by replacement of the coding sequence with the LEU2 gene. Wild-type actin was expressed in these recipient cells from another centromeric plasmid containing the URA3 gene. Following transformation with the mutant plasmid and selection on tryptophan-deficient medium, surviving cells were subjected to plasmid shuffling to eliminate the plasmid carrying the WT-actin gene. The mutant plasmid was rescued from surviving trp+, ura− cells and sequenced to ensure that the mutation was still intact. Viable cells were readily obtained for all mutants. Wild-type, Asp184, and Asp179 mutant actins were purified using a combination of DNase I affinity chromatography, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and subsequent polymerization-depolymerization cycling as described previously (15Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+-G-actin was stored in Ca2+-G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Ca2+-actin was converted to the Mg2+ form by treatment with 50 μm EGTA in the presence of 0.1 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C for 5 min as modified from Chen and Rubenstein (16Chen X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11406-11414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Pollard (17Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Mg2+-G-actin was used immediately after the conversion from Ca2+-G-actin. Actins were stored at 4 °C following purification and used within 4 days following completion of purification. Actin polymerization was assessed by the increase in light scattering that occurs following the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl to a G-actin solution in the thermostated cuvette chamber of a Spex Fluorolog 3 fluorescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 360 nm. For all experiments, wild-type actin was run as a control, and experiments were repeated with at least two different batches of actins. To assess cold sensitivity, actin was polymerized at 25 °C until a plateau was reached. The temperature was then lowered to 4 °C over 15–30 min, and the sample was subsequently maintained at this temperature during which the change in light scattering was monitored. For the cold-reversed polymerization assay, the temperature was then raised back to 25 °C, and the change in the light scattering signal was followed. G-actin was polymerized by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl at 25 °C for 2 h. F-actin was then diluted to the desired concentration with F buffer (G buffer plus 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl) and further incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. The light scattering of F-actin at each concentration was monitored as described above. The light scattering from G-actin at each concentration was also determined. The net increase in light scattering (F-G) was plotted as a function of actin concentration. The apparent critical concentration was obtained by adding a linear trend line to the data points and by determining the intercept on the x axis. The apparent melting temperatures of the wild-type and mutant G-actins were determined by circular dichroism according to Chen et al. (18Chen X. Peng J. Pedram M. Swenson C.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11415-11423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 1.4 μm G-actin was heated at a constant rate of 1 °C/min over a range from 20 to 80 oC with constant stirring of the samples over the entire range tested. Changes in the ellipticity of actin samples were monitored at 222 nm in an AVIV 62 DS spectropolarimeter. Data were fitted to a two-state model with a single transition between a native and a denatured form of the protein, and the T m value was defined as the temperature when 50% of the G-actin was in the denatured form. Unbound ATP was removed from a 20 μm G-actin solution using a Micro Bio-Spin P-30 column (Bio-Rad), and the actin was incubated with 0.3 mm1,N 6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate at 4 °C for 2 h. Excess nucleotide was removed using a Micro Bio-Spin P-30. The subsequent actin solution was diluted with ATP-free G buffer to 3 μm. The exchange was triggered by the addition of 0.1 mm cold ATP to 3 μm labeled actin. The decay in fluorescence that accompanied release of the etheno nucleotide from the actin was monitored as a function of time with excitation and emission wavelengths at 340 and 410 nm, respectively. Nucleotide exchange rates were derived by fitting the data to a single exponential expression. Polymerized actin at 25 °C was applied to carbon-coated Formvar grids and visualized following negative staining with 1.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate using a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope (University of Iowa Electron Microscope Facility). Alterations in the tertiary structure of G-actins were monitored by the susceptibility of the actins (9 μm) to limited digestion by the following three enzymes at the indicated actin/protease ratios (w/w): trypsin (80:1), subtilisin (600:1), and chymotrypsin (16:1) essentially as described previously (19Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out at room temperature for the desired time. The digestion with trypsin was stopped with 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and the digestion with the other two proteases was stopped with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were then separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the fragments were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Simulated annealing refinements of modeled Mg2+-ATP actin mutants in the closed state were carried out as described (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the program X-PLOR (25Brunger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The mutants were modeled by adding or replacing atoms of the respective side chains. Actin in the closed state was simulated with the His73 proton at the ε2 nitrogen, a conformation that was found earlier to depart from the crystallographic conformation exhibited by methylhistidine actin after forming a salt bridge with Asp184 (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The simulated systems also included 1,159 water molecules that provided a solvent shell for the exposed surface of the molecule (5Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins. 1999; 35: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). β-Actin in the open state with methylhistidine and unmethylated histidine was simulated similarly using 1,232 water molecules starting from the crystal structure (12Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To explore a possible interaction between Asp179 and His73in the open-cleft conformation, His73 was simulated in two protonation states, one with a proton at the ε2 nitrogen (as in closed actin), and the other in an alternative, doubly protonated His73+ state. Our earlier modeling suggested an His73-Asp184 cross-domain interaction in yeast actin (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we first replaced Asp184 with two neutral aliphatic residues with different bulk, Ala and Val, and Asn a neutral residue isosteric with Asp. The effects of the mutations on the monomeric structure of actin were determined based on thermal denaturation, protease digestion, and ATP exchange assay. All the mutants showed similar melting temperatures with a difference of less than 1 °C from that of WT-actin (data not shown). Controlled proteolysis with trypsin, subtilisin, or α-chymotrypsin as a probe of the conformation of the top of subdomain 2 produced a WT-like digestion pattern for all of the mutants (data not shown). The rate of exchange of bound ATP with free ATP, related to central cleft conformation, was also determined. Ala and Val had the same rate as WT-actin. Asn exhibited a slightly (25%) faster exchange than WT-actin (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the neutral substitutions of Asp184 affected actin monomeric structure to a much lesser extent than did the His73neutral substitutions, suggesting a limited role of a 73–184 interaction in conformational regulation. We next determined the effects of the single mutations on the polymerization properties of actin. The mutations did not alter the polymerization rate dramatically (data not shown). Ala and Val polymerized at a rate similar to that of WT-actin, and Asn appeared to polymerize slightly more slowly. All three mutations had higher critical concentrations for polymerization (1.0 μm as compared with 0.5 μm in WT-actin). The cold resistance of the mutant actin filaments was also tested. All three mutant actins showed very mild depolymerization at 4 °C indicated by a 15–25% drop in the light scattering signal (WT-actin drops 5–10%), and the disassembly was reversible. Electron microscopy confirmed WT-looking filament formation from both the standard and cold-reversed polymerization assays. Although removal of the charge on 184 did not have a dramatic negative effect on monomer structure, it was possible that neighboring residues somehow compensated for the defects in order to maintain a WT-like conformation. Based on the significant defect associated with the H73E mutation, we next assessed the effects of planting a positively charged residue at 184 in the H73E mutant actin. This would recreate the original ionic interaction but in an inverted orientation. If such an interaction were a major factor in actin behavior, this second substitution might be expected to convert H73E to a more normal phenotype. Table I shows that indeed D184H and D184R partially restored the overall thermal stability of H73E actin. Whereas monomeric H73E actin had a T m of 55 °C in the Ca2+ form and 45 °C in the Mg2+ form, the double mutants H73E/D184H and H73E/D184R showed increasedT m values of 61 and 59 °C respectively in the Ca2+ form. In the Mg2+ form, theT m values of both the double mutants increased to 50 °C.Table IT m values (°C) of Asp 184 and Asp 179 mutant actinsWTH73EH73E/D184HH73E/D184RH73E/D179RD179ND179RMg2+-actin53 ± 0.244 ± 0.350 ± 0.450 ± 0.253 ± 0.455 ± 0.255 ± 0.2Ca2+-actin61 ± 0.455 ± 0.361 ± 0.559 ± 0.561 ± 0.263 ± 0.363 ± 0.2The thermal stability of Asp184 and Asp179 mutant actins was assessed by subjecting G-actin solutions to increasing temperatures and monitoring the circular dichroism of the samples at 222 nm as a function of temperature as described under “Materials and Methods.” The T m value for each actin was obtained by fitting the change in dichroism to a two-state denaturation model with the help of Dr. B. Sorensen. The assay was repeated with two actin preparations, and the average T m values with variations between the two are listed in the table. TheT m values of H73E were determined (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the values listed in this table were adjusted based on relative values of the WT-actin due to a calibration of the temperature probe of the CD instrument.

Results from selective protease digestion studies as a probe of actin structure indicated that H73E caused a significant conformational change in the top of subdomain 2 leading to a much more extensive digestion pattern than that observed for WT-actin (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The addition of a positive charge at 184 largely reversed this defect (Fig.2 A). However, the conformations of subdomain 2 in the double mutants were still different from that of WT-actin as indicated by more extensive digestion by trypsin and α-chymotrypsin (arrows in Fig.2 A). H73E dramatically enhanced the rate of ATP exchange suggesting a much more flexible interdomain cleft conformation. Fig.3 shows the results of the second substitution on the effect of ATP exchange, and the t 12 values for each reaction are summarized in TableII. Although H73E/D184R or H73E/D184H retarded the rate of ATP exchange by 3- or 4-fold compared with H73E alone, their rates were still significantly faster than that of WT-actin.Table IIt12 values for ɛ-ATP exchange with Asp 184 and Asp 179 mutant actinsWTH73EH73E/D184HH73E/D184RH73E/D179RD179ND179RMg (s)37 ± 32.4 ± 0.27 ± 0.510 ± 129 ± 250 ± 471 ± 2The exchange data for actins as shown in Fig. 3 were fitted to a first-order decay plot and the t 12 values calculated.

H73E polymerizes much more slowly compared with WT-actin and shows a lower extent of polymerization as well, because of a higher critical concentration (8Yao X. Grade S. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37443-37449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the second mutation at 184 partially rescued the monomeric defects associated with H73E actin, to our surprise, the second mutant exacerbated the polymerization defect observed with H73E alone. The rates of polymerization of H73E/D184R and H73E/D184H were even slower than H73E. More significantly, the extent of polymerization was much less than H73E (Fig.4). The critical concentrations for polymerization of H73E/D184R and H73E/D184H were 3.3 and 2.7 μm, respectively, whereas H73E had a critical concentration of 0.9 μm (Fig. 5 and TableIII).Figure 5Apparent critical concentration determination of Asp184 and Asp179 mutant actins.

Open table in a new tab These data were derived from the experiments shown in Fig. 5 and Fig.8. The numbers are an average of two independent experiments with different preparations of actin. The ranges of the measurements are shown in each case as well. The mutations at residue 184 also increased the cold sensitivity associated with H73E actin polymerization. At 9 μm, only half of the H73E filaments disassembled at 4 °C, and H73E/D184R and H73E/D184H completely disassembled under the same conditions (Fig. 6 A). Complete disassembly was also observed with the two double mutant actins at a higher actin concentration of 14 μm (data not shown). However, Fig. 6 B shows this disassembly could be reversed by elevating the temperature to 25 °C. EM confirmed filament reformation at 25 °C (data not shown). Because the results from Asp184 single mutations and His73/Asp184 double mutations did not fully support a strong 73–184 interaction, we tested the alternative prediction involving an interaction between His73 and Asp179 favored in the more open actin conformation. We first made the D179N single substitution to assess the inherent importance of this residue. No adverse changes were caused by the mutation based on the same assays used above. The protease digestion pattern shows no difference from that of WT-actin (Fig.2 A). Table I shows that D179N exhibi"

Replacement of the yeast ARO4 promoter by the stronger ACT1promoter increases ARO4 transcription and simultaneously reduces the basal transcription of the downstream HIS7gene. The open reading frames of ARO4 and HIS7are tandemly transcribed and are separated by 416 bp. In wild-type cells, a nuclease-resistant site suggests that the two genes are separated by a single positioned nucleosome. Transcriptional interference correlates with Micrococcus nuclease accessibility of this otherwise nuclease-resistant site. Deletion analyses of the region between the two open reading frames revealed that transcriptional interference increases upon removal of either parts of the ARO4 3′ end or HIS7promoter sequences. The abolishment of the Abf1p-binding site within the HIS7 promoter significantly enhances transcriptional interference, resulting in a histidine auxotrophic strain. Our data suggest that the yeast cell prevents transcriptional interference by the combined action of efficient ARO4 transcription termination, the positioning of a fixed nucleosome, and transcription factor binding to the HIS7 promoter.

As consequence of elevated transcription of the upstream gene, transcription of the adjacent downstream gene might be diminished or even abolished. Transcriptional interference is favored by close proximity of genes that are only separated by short intergenic regions between the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs).1 It was found in HeLa cells that two closely spaced α-globin genes in an artificial gene construct interfere with each other (1Proudfoot N.J. Nature. 1986; 322: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In yeast, the cryptic promoter within the intron of the ACT1 gene is occluded by transcription from the actual ACT1 promoter at the 5′ end of the gene (2Irniger S. Egli C.M. Braus G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3060-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have described previously (3Springer C. Valerius O. Strittmatter A. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26318-26324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) thatHIS7 transcription is reduced when the upstream-locatedARO4 gene is transcribed from the strong ACT1promoter instead of its natural promoter. Eukaryotic transcriptional interference is understood as the result of RNA polymerase II complexes that initiate transcription at the promoter of the upstream gene and subsequently read through the promoter of the downstream gene. Therefore, the assembly of functional transcription complexes at the downstream promoter is disturbed, resulting in promoter occlusion. The extent to which the reading through of RNA polymerase II complexes occurs critically depends on the efficiency of transcription termination of the upstream gene (3Springer C. Valerius O. Strittmatter A. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26318-26324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 4Greger I.H. Proudfoot N.J.

Deletions ofGAL10 poly(A) signals abolished any activity of the downstream GAL7 gene, even when the GAL7 promoter was intact, resulting in a bicistronic read-through transcript. Therefore, in the case of GAL7, the promoter was completely occluded. Polymerase profiles raised in transcription run-on experiments for these poly(A) mutant strains confirmed the accumulation of nonterminated polymerase II complexes within the GAL7promoter (4Greger I.H. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4771-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As a consequence of transcriptional interference, it was shown that various transcription factors are not able to bind to their promoter sites any more. This was demonstrated for the tandem HIV-1 promoters integrated into the genome of HeLa cells, where promoter occlusion of the downstream promoter correlated with reduced binding of the transcription factor Sp1 (6Greger I.H. Demarchi F. Giacca M. Proudfoot N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The binding of the Gal4p transcriptional activator to the GAL7 promoter was reduced in a similar fashion by read-through transcription initiated at the upstream GAL10 promoter. Interestingly, Gal4p overexpression can suppress this effect (7Greger I.H. Aranda A. Proudfoot N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8415-8420Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic transcription is affected by the DNA accessibility of promoter sequences. Nucleosome structures in intergenic regions might therefore play an important role in the prevention of transcriptional interference. An example for prevention of transcriptional interference by a positioned nucleosome was described in Drosophila melanogaster. There, reconstituted chromatin with rDNA templates resulted in a positioned upstream nucleosome that is recruited by termination factor TTF-I. This nucleosome can act as barrier to transcriptional interference of the downstream ribosomal RNA genes that are transcribed by the RNA polymerase I complex (8Längst G. Blank T.A. Becker P.B. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ARO4 and HIS7 are adjacent genes ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae that are transcribed into the same direction. The intergenic region between both ORFs consists of 416 bp. Both genes encode amino acid biosynthetic enzymes required for the formation of aromatic amino acids and histidine, respectively. Here, we address the question of which parts of the entire ARO4-HIS7intergenic region antagonize transcriptional interference. We show that both ARO4 mRNA 3′ end formation signals and specificHIS7 promoter sequences diminish transcriptional interference. Moreover, we present a correlation between transcriptional interference and the intergenic chromatin structure. Yeast strains and genotypes used in this work are listed in Table I. For all experiments described here, strains were cultivated in minimal vitamin medium (9Miozzari G. Niederberger P. Hütter R. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 48-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with the required amino acids according to Rose et al. (10Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). To generate functional fusions of the ACT1 promoter with theARO4 ORF at the original ARO4 locus, aSalI/BstEII 3.1-kb fragment from plasmid pME1429 (3Springer C. Valerius O. Strittmatter A. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26318-26324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was transformed in the respective strains. The cassette consists of the ACT1 promoter fused to the first half of theARO4 ORF. Upstream, the cassette carries the divergently orientated URA3 auxotrophic marker gene, which is itself preceded by the ARO4 5′-untranslated region for homologous integration. Transformants that had replaced the wild-typeARO4 locus by this cassette by homologous recombination were selected by uracil prototrophy and confirmed in Northern hybridizations by increased ARO4 mRNA levels and by PCR.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReference no.RH1381MATαaro3–2gcn4–101 ura3–5223Paravicini G.

Tinkelenberg A.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 875-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For Northern hybridization analysis, 20 μg of total RNAs were separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Biodyne B; PALL) by capillary blotting. Hybridization with specific DNA probes was performed after 32P labeling with the Prime It II DNA Labeling Kit from Stratagene. One-kb PCR fragments generated with the oligonucleotides ARO-OLV19 (5′-taccggatccagacgacagagttcttg-3′) and ARO-OLV11 (5′-cctcaagacgtcttcagtagtttcccaacc-3′), HIS-OL1 (5′-gtggtaacctacagtcactaacc-3′) and HIS-OL2 (5′-ccgatcgatactttatcagcacc-3′), and ACT-OL1 (5′-gctgctttggttattgataacgg-3′) and ACT-OL2 (5′-cacttgtggtgaacgatagatgg-3′) served as probes for theARO4, HIS7, and ACT1 genes, respectively. In all cases, template was genomic DNA of strain RH1381. Band intensities were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a BAS-1500 phosphorimaging scanner (Fuji). These methods have been described previously (12Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Biodyne B nylon membranes were used for Southern transfer. Probes were labeled by the random primer method (13Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16569) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from the nuclease digestion was digested with XbaI and MluI and fractionated in 1.2% agarose gels. The fractionated DNA was blotted on the nylon membrane by the alkaline blotting method and hybridized with a radioactively labeled 250-bp PCR product generated with oligonucleotides HIS7-CHR1 (5′-gagattaaagaaattgtcaga-3′) and HIS7-CHR2 (5′-caagtattgagga gaaatggta-3′), annealing just downstream of theXbaI site. A DNA ladder consisting of multiples of 256 bp was used for size estimation (14Thoma F. Bergman L.W. Simpson R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 715-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities were determined by using permeabilized yeast cells and the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactoside as described previously (15Künzler M. Balmelli T. Egli C.M. Paravicini G. Braus G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultivated in minimal vitamin medium overnight, diluted to an absorbance of ∼0.5 at 546 nm, and cultivated for another 6 h before assay. One unit of β-galactosidase activity is defined as 1 nmol 4-methylumbelliferone h−1 ml−1A546−1. The values presented are the means of at least four independent cultures, each of them measured three times. S.D.s were <20%. The replacement of the natural promoter of the ARO4 gene by the stronger ACT1promoter causes transcriptional interference with the downstreamHIS7 gene, reducing HIS7 transcription in comparison to wild-type expression (3Springer C. Valerius O. Strittmatter A. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26318-26324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because eukaryotic gene expression and its tight regulation in terms of transcriptional initiation and termination processes must take place in the presence of highly ordered chromatin structure, we wanted to know whether the transcriptional interference between the ARO4 and HIS7 gene is manifested in chromatin changes. Therefore, we analyzed the chromatin structure of the ARO4-HIS7 intergenic region in absence and presence of transcriptional interference. The chromatin structure was investigated by MNase protection experiments. Crude nuclear extracts from overnight cultures grown in minimal vitamin medium from strains with the wild-type ARO4promoter (RH1381) or the PACT1-ARO4 fusion (RH2642), respectively, were partially digested with MNase and further treated as described previously (12Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, the ARO4 3′ region immediately downstream of the ORF is sensitive to MNase (Fig.1). This short sensitive region was followed by a strongly protected region, which corresponds in length to a positioned nucleosome. The HIS7 promoter further downstream was again sensitive to MNase. Although the mutant strain with the PACT1-ARO4 fusion gene showed a largely similar chromatin pattern, an additional band within the protected region between the ARO4 3′-end region and theHIS7 promoter became obvious (Fig. 1, arrow 1). This sensitive site already appeared at very low MNase concentrations (chromatin digest with 3 units of MNase for 6 min) and got more pronounced at 9 and 18 units of MNase. In contrast, this MNase-sensitive site is faint in the ARO4 wild-type strain, even for the digest with 18 units of MNase. A feasible consequence of enhanced ARO4 transcription could be that nonterminated, still-transcribing RNA polymerase II complexes weaken the DNA histone interaction at the respective nucleosome, thereby drastically increasing this otherwise very weak MNase-sensitive site. In addition, a sensitive site at the end of the ORF of the wild-type ARO4 gene appears to be less sensitive in the case of the PACT1-ARO4 fusion gene (Fig. 1, arrow 2). Apparently, the chromatin structure of the very 3′ end of theARO4 ORF is also subjected to changes upon strongARO4 transcription. These changes of chromatin structures may be directly related to the termination efficiency and transcriptional interference. The DNA in between the two ORFs of ARO4and HIS7 possesses elements required for efficient 3′-end formation of the ARO4 mRNA and others that promote efficient HIS7 transcription (3Springer C. Valerius O. Strittmatter A. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26318-26324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we intended to define DNA regions between these ORFs whose loss enhances transcriptional interference caused by increased ARO4 transcription. We established a reporter system with the HIS7 gene replaced by the quantifiable chimeric Phis7-lacZ gene, preceded by the ARO4 gene driven from either its natural promoter (Fig. 2, reporter-system I) or the ACT1 promoter (Fig. 2, reporter-system II). To determine regions in between both ORFs that counteract transcriptional interference, specific β-galactosidase activities for various small intergenic deletions were measured. DNA elements that diminish transcriptional interference were identified by comparison of the read-outs of the two reporter systems for each deletion construct (Fig. 3). To maintain the original chromosomal context, the reporter system was established at the authentic ARO4-HIS7 locus, with the separating nucleosome positioned approximately from –235 to –381 relative to theHIS7 ATG start codon. Deletions were chosen to cover several DNA motifs that fulfill different functions, including the Zaret/Sherman element (Z/S) required for ARO4mRNA 3′-end formation, three sites defining the actual poly(A) addition sites, C+T- and A+T-rich regions, the Abf1p-protein binding site (ABS), and both Gcn4p recognition elements (GCRE1 and GCRE2) (Fig. 3).FIG. 3Effects of deletions of theARO4-HIS7 intergenic region on his7-lacZactivity. The strains carry either the ARO4 gene possessing its natural wild-type promoter (reporter system I) or the more efficient ACT1 promoter (reporter system II). β-Galactosidase activities in units (measured as nmol 4-methylumbelliferone h−1 ml−1A546−1) are indicated in the chart on the right side for strains with various deletions throughout the intergenic region. The scheme on the left side visualizes the exact locations of the deletions according to the translational start side (+1) and the DNA motifs at these positions. Z/S stands for the Zaret/Sherman motif necessary for correct ARO4 3′-end formation, p(A) stands for the sites where the pol(A) tail is added to the ARO4mRNA 3′ end, and CT stands for a C+T-rich element. In the HIS7 promoter, GCRE stands for Gcn4p recognition element, ABS stands for Abf1p-binding site, and AT stands for an A+T-rich sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When measured in reporter system I, deletions that cover the Zaret/Sherman element or poly(A) sites as elements of ARO4mRNA 3′-end formation (RH1815, RH1816, and RH1818) did not affect the Phis7-lacZ expression compared with that of the wild-type intergenic region (RH1616). In reporter system II, however, a 52-bp deletion that eliminated the Zaret/Sherman element (RH2632) reduced the specific β-galactosidase activity to about 28% of reporter system I (RH1815). Moreover, a 28-bp deletion that removed the first poly(A) site strongly reduced Phis7-lacZexpression if present in reporter system II (RH2633). Only about 22% activity was left in comparison to reporter system I with this deletion (RH1816). Further deletions of the second and third poly(A) site (reporter system I, RH1818; reporter system II, RH2634), C+T-rich (reporter system I, RH1819; reporter system II, RH2635) and A+T-rich (reporter system I, RH1835; reporter system II, RH2638) stretches, or the binding sites for Gcn4p (Gcn4p recognition elements; reporter system I, RH1822/RH1826; reporter system II, RH2636/RH2639) did not increase transcriptional interference. A 28-bp deletion that covered the Abf1p-binding site in reporter system II (RH2637) displayed a severe loss of specific β-galactosidase activity and almost shut off any his7-lacZ expression. In the background of reporter system I, this deletion alone reduced his7-lacZ expression to about one-third of the wild-type promoter. In summary, the data obtained from our reporter system suggest that Abf1p binding to the HIS7 promoter is an essential element that antagonizes transcriptional interference. Furthermore, the Zaret/Sherman element and the first poly(A) site, which together are responsible for efficient ARO4 3′-end formation, obviously counteract transcriptional interference. Deletions within these regions enhance transcriptional interference. No deletion has resulted in higher β-galactosidase activities in reporter system II compared with reporter system I, suggesting that there are no cis-elements that support transcriptional interference. The results obtained thus far with the deletion constructs suggested an important contribution of Abf1p binding in the prevention of transcriptional interference at the wild-type ARO4-HIS7 locus under conditions whereACT1-driven transcription also weakens the DNA-protein interaction of the separating nucleosome. We investigated whether it has been the broader context of the deleted 28-bp promoter region or solely the abolished binding of Abf1p itself that antagonized transcriptional interference. Therefore, we investigated thePhis7-lacZ expression of a mutant strain with two single nucleotide exchanges within the Abf1p-binding site that were previously shown to abolish binding of Abf1p (16Dorsman J.C. van Heeswijk W.C. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2769-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Springer C. Krappmann S. Künzler M. Zmasek C. Braus G.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the background of wild-type ARO4 expression in reporter system I (RH1830), single nucleotide exchanges within the Abf1p-binding site by themselves reduced Phis7-lacZ expression to about 35% of that of wild-type. Integrated in reporter system II (RH2640), these nucleotide exchanges caused a further strong reduction in β-galactosidase activity to about 9% of wild-typePhis7-lacZ expression. This result demonstrated that it was in fact the binding of Abf1p to its binding site within theHIS7 promoter, and not a broader promoter context, that antagonized transcriptional interference at the ARO4-HIS7locus. It is possible that binding of Abf1p to itscis-element competes with the transcription of a nonterminated polymerase II complex and thus blocks transcriptional interference. The data of the reporter systems that derived from a lacZ reporter gene have shown that the Abf1p-binding site and elements required for efficient ARO4 mRNA 3′-end formation are important to prevent transcriptional interference. We then investigated whether the increased transcriptional interference of these deletion mutants gave rise to malfunctions in cells that harbor the wild-type HIS7 gene. Therefore, the growth rates of these strains were determined in medium without histidine. When the ARO4 gene was driven from its own promoter, the wild-type's growth rate of about 0.28 h−1 was not changed in strains with deletions in the ARO4 3′-end region (strains RH1833, RH1834, and RH1836 in Fig.4A). The growth rate nearly halved with the deletion of the Abf1p-binding site in theHIS7 promoter (0.18 h−1, RH1781). The combination of a deleted first poly(A) site with an inducedARO4 expression (RH2644) also significantly reduced the growth rate in comparison to the wild-type (0.20 h−1). Deletion of the Abf1p-binding site in combination with theACT1-ARO4 fusion gene (RH2646) was so deleterious for the cell that it resulted in a histidine auxotrophic growth phenotype (Fig. 4, A and B). We compared the effects of the transcriptional interference as obtained by the his7-lacZ chimeric genes and the growth tests with the quantified HIS7 mRNA steady-state levels determined by Northern hybridizations (Fig.5). The fusion of the ACT1promoter to the ARO4 gene increases ARO4 mRNA levels ∼4-fold (Fig. 5). Enhanced ARO4 transcription in the background of the wild-type HIS7 gene with the wild-type ARO4-HIS7 intergenic region (RH2642) resulted in HIS7 mRNA levels of about 60% in comparison to wild-type ARO4 (RH1381). Deletion of the Zaret/Sherman element as ARO4 3′-end formation signal in the background of increased ARO4 transcription (RH2643) reduced the HIS7 mRNA levels to ∼40% in comparison to the natural ARO4 promoter (RH1833). When the firstARO4 poly(A) site was deleted, the reduction ofHIS7 transcript levels as a consequence of enhancedARO4 transcription was even more pronounced (RH2644), namely, 30% of the respective strain with wild-type ARO4expression (RH1834). In contrast, the deletion covering the second and third ARO4 poly(A) addition site did not show obvious differences in HIS7 transcript levels caused by transcriptional interference. The deletion within the HIS7 promoter that covers the Abf1p-binding site in the wild-type ARO4 background (RH1781) already reduced HIS7 mRNA levels to 40% in comparison to the wild-type HIS7 promoter. However, in combination with high ARO4 transcription from the ACT1 promoter (RH2646), HIS7 transcripts were no longer detectable. This result confirmed the transcriptional interference as detected before in both the reporter system with the his7-lacZ reporter gene and the growth defect on histidine-deficient medium. We have also investigated whether the single nucleotide exchanges within the Abf1p-binding site alone can change the chromatin structure of the intergenic region without ACT1-driven overexpression of ARO4. However, no changes in comparison to the wild-type intergenic region have been detected (data not shown). Therefore, we suggest that it is the DNA binding of the Abf1 protein itself that somehow blocked the transcribing polymerase II complex, rather than a reorganization of the nucleosomal structure by Abf1p that subsequently prevents transcriptional interference. Taken together, these results imply that binding of the ubiquitous transcription factor Abf1p to the HIS7 promoter counteracts transcriptional interference caused by enhanced ARO4expression, which is itself accompanied by nucleosomal changes.ARO4 3′-end formation signals also prevented transcriptional interference, although less efficiently than Abf1p binding. By name, these were the ARO4 mRNA 3′-processing motif, originally described by Zaret and Sherman for CYC1 (18Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and the major site where the ARO4 mRNA transcript is finally cleaved and processed. Cells have developed mechanisms that enable individually regulated expression of adjacent genes that are located in close proximity without influencing one another. One essential parameter to prevent read-through transcription is the efficient termination of transcription of the upstream gene. In eukaryotic cells, this process is characterized by the combination of events that generate the mRNA 3′ end, followed by its polyadenylation and the actual termination of transcription (that is, the release of the elongation complex from the DNA template). To initiate transcription at the downstream promoter, an efficient recruitment of the transcriptional preinitiation complex at the initiation site is necessary. In addition to this recruitment, regulated gene expression requires efficient binding of gene-specific transcriptional activators to the promoter upstream of the transcriptional initiation site. The efficiency of both the 3′-end formation/termination and the initiation of transcription at the downstream gene must be adjusted to the “strength” of the two adjacent genes for their different levels of expression. Otherwise, transcriptional interference reduces or even abolishes the expression of the downstream gene by promoter occlusion. Because the eukaryotic DNA is closely associated with histone proteins, these processes must take place in the context of a highly ordered chromatin structure. Here we show that a nucleosome is strictly localized in such a position between two tandemly arranged yeast genes that it may guard the more downstream gene from transcriptional interference under normal circumstances. This assumption is corroborated through the finding that increased transcription of the more upstream gene weakens this nucleosome. We determined additional elements located in between the ORFs of the two yeast genes that contribute to antagonizing transcriptional interference (Fig. 6). Elements were identified that are necessary to separate transcription of the two adjacent genes. mRNA 3′-end formation signals such as the Zaret/Sherman element as well as the site where the nascent transcript is cleaved and the poly(A) tail is added represent borders that belong to the preceding ARO4 gene. The removal of these elements significantly increased transcriptional interference at that locus. Termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II and its release from the DNA template were previously shown to be linked to mRNA 3′-end processing (4Greger I.H. Proudfoot N.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4771-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Destruction of poly(A) signals probably results in reduced termination events, leading to increased transcription far beyond the poly(A) site of a gene and thereby impairing the activity of downstream promoters (3Springer C. Valerius O. Strittmatter A. Braus G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26318-26324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Proudfoot N.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, future transcription run-on experiments for this locus should confirm transcribing RNA polymerase II complexes driven from the upstream promoter into the ORF of the downstream HIS7 gene. Another border marked by the downstream HIS7 gene is the presence of the general DNA-binding factor Abf1p in its promoter. Besides its role as an activator of HIS7 transcription, it seems to have the additional function of forming a protective barrier against read-through transcription initiated at the upstreamARO4 gene. This roadblock function of Abf1p is supported by the observation that deletion/mutation of the Abf1p-binding site had different effects in both the wild-type and thePACT1-ARO4 systems on his7-lacZexpression (Fig. 3). Recent investigations focusing on theGAL10-GAL7 locus in yeast or the tandem HIV-1 promoters integrated in HeLa cells also support such a link between termination and promoter activity (6Greger I.H. Demarchi F. Giacca M. Proudfoot N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Greger I.H. Aranda A. Proudfoot N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8415-8420Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). By in vivo footprinting, it was demonstrated that reduced 3′-end processing activity of theGAL10 gene directly weakens the binding of the transcription factor Gal4p to the adjacent GAL7 promoter and thereby reduces its transcription. In the GAL10-GAL7 system, overexpression of Gal4p seems to counteract some of the transcriptional interference. Because Abf1p is an abundant protein in the yeast cell and it also binds the HIS7 promoter consistently during inactivated HIS7 transcription, testing its overexpression in terms of lowering transcriptional interference does not seem promising. The binding of transcription factor Sp1 to the downstream promoter of tandemly localized HIV-1 promoters is significantly increased by insertion of an efficient transcriptional termination element upstream of the occluded promoter. A recent report stated that efficient termination enabled by the murine transcript release factor PTRF augments downstream ribosomal gene transcription by enhancing reinitiation at the ribosomal DNA promoters (20Jansa P. Burek C. Sander E.E. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although previous reports demonstrated an influence of Abf1p binding on the local chromatin structure of promoters of the QCR8 and RPS28A genes (21De Winde J.H. van Leeuwen H.C. Grivell L.A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Lascaris R.F. Groot E. Hoen P.B. Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1390-1396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we could not detect any changes in nucleosome distribution at the ARO4-HIS7 locus upon destruction of the Abf1p-binding site (data not shown). Possibly, in common with other promoters of typical housekeeping genes, theHIS7 promoter has a pre-set accessible chromatin structure that is not directly dependent on the presence or absence of Abf1p. The different factors that in concert seem to prevent transcriptional interference are outlined in Fig. 6. Because there is also an alteration of the nucleosomal structure at the 3′ end of the ARO4open reading frame upon high ARO4 transcription, efficient termination of transcription might require a defined chromatin structure at the very end of a gene. A link between the positioning of an upstream nucleosome, transcriptional initiation at downstream promoters, and transcriptional interference was not yet described for an RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene. For genes encoding ribosomal RNA, it was shown that the positioning of a nucleosome at an upstream terminator element is required to allow transcription from the downstream promoter. To position this nucleosome, the DNA-binding termination factor TTF-I, homologous to the yeast Reb1p, was shown to be necessary (8Längst G. Blank T.A. Becker P.B. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).

Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the secondary structure, conformation, and molecular stability of recombinant human apoA-IV were identical to the native protein. However, deletion of any of the α-helical domains in apoA-IV disrupted its tertiary structure and impaired its molecular stability. Surprisingly, determination of the water/phospholipid interfacial exclusion pressure of the apoA-IV truncation mutants revealed that, for most, deletion of amphipathic α-helical domains increased their affinity for phospholipid monolayers. All of the truncation mutants activated the transfer of fluorescent-labeled cholesterol esters between high and low density lipoproteins at a rate higher than native apoA-IV. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.790, p = 0.002) between the rate constant for cholesterol ester transfer and interfacial exclusion pressure.

Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) is a 74,000-dalton plasma protein that facilitates the exchange of non-polar lipids among circulating lipoproteins (21Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1255-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CETP-mediated transfer of cholesterol esters from HDL to very low density lipoprotein is central to the process of reverse cholesterol transport (22Bruce C. Chouinard R.A., Jr. Tall A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 297-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is well established that lipoprotein lipid composition modulates CETP activity (23Lagrost L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 209-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but the role of apolipoproteins is less clear. In studies that used lipid emulsions as model lipoproteins, apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, A-IV, and E stimulated CETP-catalyzed lipid exchange equally well (20Main L.A. Ohnishi T. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 29: 17-24Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar,24Milner T.G., Ko, K.W.S. Ohnishi T. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys.

However, studies that assayed CETP activity using native lipoproteins found that apoA-IV may have distinct concentration-dependant effects on CETP-catalyzed lipid exchange between HDL and LDL (26Guyard-Dangremont V. Lagrost L. Gambert P. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 982-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and among HDL subfractions (19Lagrost L. Gambert P. Dangremont V. Athias A. Lallemant C. J.

J. 1988; 254: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although like all apolipoproteins, apoA-IV has a high content of amphipathic α-helical structure (28Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Weinberg R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 918: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the amphipathic helices in apoA-IV are very hydrophilic (29Weinberg R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 918: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), are predominantly of the Y-class (30Segrest J.P. Jones M.K., De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anatharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are incapable of deeply penetrating lipid monolayers (31Weinberg R.B. Jordan M. J. Biol.

With increasing surface pressure, these helices are sequentially excluded from the interface (33Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. DeLozier J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the interaction of apoA-IV with lipoproteins is very labile and is sensitive to interfacial pressure (35Weinberg R.B. Miller N.E. Tall A.R. Third International Symposium on Plasma High Density Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis. Elsevier, New York1992: 89-98Google Scholar). We have proposed that these properties enable apoA-IV to act as a barostat which maintains lipoprotein surface pressure within a critical range required for optimal activity of lipolytic enzymes and transfer proteins (33Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Kussie P. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Commun. 1995; 211: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this regard, apoA-IV possesses dynamic interfacial properties that are optimal for stabilizing surface tension and lipid packing at expanding lipid/aqueous interfaces (34Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. DeLozier J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a panel of recombinant human apoA-IV truncation mutants, Emmanuelet al. (38Emmanuel F. Steinmetz A. Rosseneu M. Brasseur R. Gosselet N. Attenot F. Cuine F. Seguret S. Latta M. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29883-29890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that a specific α-helical domain located between residues 117 and 160 determines the catalytic efficiency of apoA-IV in the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reaction. Given the impact of distinctive α-helical domains in determining the interfacial properties of apoA-IV, and given the importance of interfacial phenomena in the regulation of the CETP reaction (36Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Kussie P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29588-29591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have used this same panel of truncation mutants to examine the impact of α-helical structure, protein conformation, and interfacial activity on the ability of apoA-IV to modulate CETP-catalyzed cholesterol ester transfer between HDL and LDL. Egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol oleate (Sigma) were dissolved in high performance liquid chromatography grade chloroform (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) and stored under nitrogen at −20 °C. Phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphorous analysis (39Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The self-quenching fluorescent cholesterol ester analog NBDCE was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Lipids were >99% pure by TLC on silica gel. LDL and HDL were isolated from human plasma by sequential flotation at 1.019–1.063 and 1.125–1.25 g/ml, respectively, and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.025% sodium azide. Human apoA-I was isolated from HDL (40Shore B. Shore V. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Human apoA-IV was isolated from donors homozygous for the A-IV-1 and A-IV-2 alleles (41Weinberg R.B. Hopkins R.A. Jones J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 263: 282-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human apoA-IV truncation mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis of a DNA construct containing the human apoA-IV coding sequence, followed by expression in Escherichia coli (38Emmanuel F. Steinmetz A. Rosseneu M. Brasseur R. Gosselet N. Attenot F. Cuine F. Seguret S. Latta M. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29883-29890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human CETP was produced in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing a cloned human CETP cDNA; the specific activity of recombinant CETP, as assayed by the transfer of 14C-cholesterol ester from HDL to LDL, was identical to plasma CETP (42Hesler C.B. Swenson T.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2275-2282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with bicinchoninic acid (43Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18507) Google Scholar). All preparations were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. Mean molecular hydrophobicities and helical hydrophobic moments of recombinant apoA-IV truncation mutants were calculated using a consensus hydrophobicity scale (44Eisenberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 595-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism studies were performed on a Jasco J-720 Spectropolarimeter. Spectra of apolipoproteins at 3 μm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide were recorded at 25 °C from 190 to 260 nm using a 1-mm thermostated cell, 1-mm spectral bandwidth, and 2-s time constant. Buffer blanks were digitally subtracted. Percent α-helicity was calculated as previously described (28Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation studies were performed by monitoring ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature from 20 to 65 °C. The enthalpy of denaturation, ΔHD, and the thermal denaturation midpoint, Tm, were determined from the slope of plots of ΔG versus 1/T(45Weinberg R.B. Anderson R.A. Cook V.R. Emmanuel F. Denefle P. Hermann M. Steinmetz A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1410-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence studies were performed on an SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer. Spectra of apolipoproteins at 3 μm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide were recorded at 25 °C from 290 to 370 nm using a 1-cm cell with excitation at 280 nm, 1-s integration, and 4-nm slits on excitation and emission monochromators. Spectra were excitation corrected by reference to a rhodamine quantum counter, and corrected for scatter and Raman emission by digital subtraction of buffer blanks. Chemical denaturation studies were performed by addition of buffered 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. Quenching studies were performed by addition of buffered 6 m KI; Stern-Volmer quenching constants, Kq, were obtained from plots ofIo/I versus [KI]; fractional tryptophan exposure was calculated asKq(apolipoprotein)/Kq(N-acetyltryptophanamide) (46Weinberg R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The interfacial exclusion pressure (Πex) of recombinant apolipoproteins at the phospholipid/water interface was determined using a KSV 5000 Langmuir Film Balance (KSV Instruments, Helsinki, Finland), as previously described (33Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Kussie P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29588-29591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Egg phosphatidylcholine monolayers were spread at the air/buffer interface at initial pressures (Πi) of 5–30 mN/m and then apolipoproteins were injected into the subphase to give a final concentration of 50 μg/dl, which had been previously determined to yield saturating binding to the interface. The increase in interfacial pressure was then monitored by a Wilhelmy plate until it reached a stable plateau (ΔΠ). Πex was determined by extrapolation of ΔΠversus Πi. The precision of the interfacial pressure measurements was ±0.1 mN/m. Fluorescent cholesterol ester transfer assays were performed using an SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder. Recombinant HDL (rHDL) containing apoA-I, egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol oleate, and the self-quenching fluorescent cholesterol ester analog NDBCE were prepared by the method of Pittman et al. (47Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing NBDCE-labeled rHDL (0.1 mg/ml), LDL (1 mg/ml), apolipoproteins (5 μm), and recombinant human CETP (5 μg) in a final volume of 150 μl were incubated at 37 °C in a 3 × 3-mm magnetically stirred microcuvette, and the fluorescence intensity at 535 nm was monitored for 30 min with excitation at 465 nm, a 1-s integration rate, and 4-nm monochromator slits. Transfer rate constants were calculated from the slope of a linear regression of time versusln(Imax − Ix), whereImax is the maximal fluorescence intensity and Ix is the fluorescence intensity at time X. Recombinant human apoA-IV (r-AIV) and a panel of recombinant apoA-IV truncation mutants in which pairs of 22-mer α-helices were sequentially deleted along the primary sequence from the amino to carboxyl terminus were expressed in E. coli(38Emmanuel F. Steinmetz A. Rosseneu M. Brasseur R. Gosselet N. Attenot F. Cuine F. Seguret S. Latta M. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29883-29890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the calculated mean hydrophobicities, <H>, and mean helical hydrophobic moments, <μ>, of the deleted segments varied considerably, their deletion had a negligible impact on the hydrophobic properties of the remaining molecule (Table I).Table IProperties of the amphipathic helices in recombinant human apo A-IV and recombinant apo A-IV truncation mutantsApolipoproteinModificationClass1-aAmphipathic α-helix class (30).Deleted helicesRemaining molecule〈H〉1-bMean residue hydrophobicity (44).〈μ〉1-cMean residue helical hydrophobic moment (44).〈H〉〈μ〉kcal/molkcal/molr-AIVMRGS(H)6−0.220.36r-AIVΔN12Δ1–120.270.22−0.240.37r-AIVΔh1–2Δ13–61G/Y−0.070.83−0.250.36r-AIVΔh3–4Δ62–116Y/A0.291.02−0.210.34r-AIVΔh5–6Δ117–160A/Y−0.351.46−0.210.34r-AIVΔh7–8Δ161–204A/Y−0.240.98−0.220.36r-AIVΔh9–10Δ205–248A/Y−0.260.75−0.220.37r-AIVΔh11–12Δ249–288Y/Y−0.261.27−0.220.35r-AIVΔh13–14Δ289–332Y/Y−0.150.84−0.230.361-a Amphipathic α-helix class (30Segrest J.P.

Open table in a new tab Circular dichroism spectra of r-AIV revealed a mean residue ellipticity of 16,649 deg cm2/dmol at 222 nm, which corresponds to 50% α-helical structure (Table II). Thermal denaturation of r-AIV yielded an enthalpy of denaturation, ΔHD, of 70.8 kcal/mol with a transition midpoint at 50.3 °C. These parameters are similar to those obtained for native human apoA-IV-1 (28Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Weinberg R.B. Jordan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8081-8086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Weinberg R.B. Anderson R.A. Cook V.R. Emmanuel F. Denefle P. Hermann M. Steinmetz A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1410-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, fluorescence spectroscopy of r-AIV revealed several features characteristic of human apoA-IV (28Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Weinberg R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 1) The fluorescence emission of its single tryptophan was blue shifted to 328 nm. 2) Tryptophan fluorescence was resistant to iodide quenching, indicating that the tryptophan resides in a hydrophobic and/or negatively shielded environment. 3) Chemical denaturation induced a multiphasic red-shift in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission (data not shown) and an increase in relative quantum yield (Imax/Io) at the denaturation midpoint (Table II). Together these findings suggest that the secondary structure, conformation, and molecular stability of r-AIV are identical to that of native human apoA-IV.Table IISpectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of human apo A-IV and recombinant apo A-IV truncation mutantsApolipoproteinα-HelixΔHDTmλmaxImax/Iokq/kqnata%kcal/mol°Cnmh-AIV-1562-aWeinberg and Spector (28).63.648.13321.260.242-bWeinberg (46).r-AIV5070.850.33281.190.18r-AIVΔN125751.248.3ND2-cND, not determined.1.00NDr-AIVΔh1–25927.948.43311.000.09r-AIVΔh3–46322.853.23341.000.10r-AIVΔh5–66927.745.63371.000.14r-AIVΔh7–86320.547.03361.010.09r-AIVΔh9–106019.852.33341.000.09r-AIVΔh11–127030.747.83341.000.10r-AIVΔh13–146930.848.83321.030.132-a Weinberg and Spector (28Weinberg R.B.

Open table in a new tab ApoA-IV truncation mutants were much more sensitive to thermal denaturation, as evidenced by ΔHD values that were 19.6–51.0 kcal/mol lower than either native or the parent recombinant apoA-IV. Interestingly the α-helicity of all the truncation mutants was higher, perhaps reflecting recruitment of some local secondary structure with disruption of ordered folding. The tryptophan fluorescence emission in all the deletion mutants was red-shifted compared with native and r-AIV, although iodide accessibility was lower. Moreover, none of the truncation mutants displayed the increase in quantum yield with denaturation that is a signature of native human apoA-IV (28Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Weinberg R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that deletion of any of the α-helical domains in apoA-IV significantly disrupts its tertiary structure and impairs its molecular stability. Examination of the binding of r-AIV to egg phosphatidylcholine monolayers revealed that r-AIV was excluded from the lipid/water interface at pressures above 34.3 mN/m. In comparison, the exclusion pressure was 27.0 mN/m for native human apoA-IV-1, 30.8 mN/m for native apoA-IV-2, and 33.0 mN/m for apoA-I, as previously noted (33Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The higher interfacial exclusion pressure of r-AIV relative to the native apolipoproteins could be a consequence of the presence of a hydrophobic MRGS(H)6 decapetide at its amino terminus, which was added to the recombinant construct to facilitate purification (38Emmanuel F. Steinmetz A. Rosseneu M. Brasseur R. Gosselet N. Attenot F. Cuine F. Seguret S. Latta M. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29883-29890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the interfacial exclusion pressure of the recombinant apoA-IV truncation mutants with r-AIV yielded the surprising finding that, with the exception of the Δh1–2 and Δh9–10 mutants, deletion of amphipathic α-helical domains increased the interfacial exclusion pressure (Fig. 1). There was no consistent relationship between either the hydrophobic properties of the excluded helices or the α-helicity of the remaining molecule and the interfacial exclusion pressure, although deletion of the exclusively Y class helices (30Segrest J.P. Jones M.K., De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anatharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) near the COOH terminus yielded proteins with the highest surface activity. Incubation of NDBCE-labeled rHDL with a 10-fold excess of LDL produced little change in fluorescence intensity; however, in the presence of CETP, transfer of the probe from the recombinant HDL to LDL caused a rise in fluorescence emission. The transfer rate constant in the presence of the common human apoA-IV-1 isoprotein was 2.22 × 10−3 s−1, for the variant human apoA-IV-2 isoprotein it was 2.59 × 10−3 s−1, and for r-AIV it was 2.92 × 10−3 s−1. In the presence of recombinant apoA-IV truncation mutants in the reaction mixture, the transfer rate constant varied between 2.45 and 3.29 × 10−3 s−1. Multiple factor correlation analysis identified no significant relationship between the transfer rate constants and any of the spectroscopic parameters, but a strong correlation was found between the transfer rate constants and interfacial exclusion pressure (r = 0.790, p = 0.002) (Fig. 2). In solution, apoA-IV adopts a loosely folded “molten globule” conformation, in which the hydrophobic faces of its multiple amphipathic α-helices face inwards toward the interior of the molecule (28Weinberg R.B. Spector M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4914-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Weinberg R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our present findings demonstrate that these repeated α-helices collectively and cooperatively contribute to the molecular stability of apoA-IV in solution, for deletion of even short helical segments disrupts its tertiary conformation and significantly destabilizes the molecule. This is further suggested by the observation that these same deletions disrupt the otherwise strong self-association of apoA-IV (38Emmanuel F. Steinmetz A. Rosseneu M. Brasseur R. Gosselet N. Attenot F. Cuine F. Seguret S. Latta M. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29883-29890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, conformational destabilization of apoA-IV was associated with induction of additional α-helical structure, probably as a consequence of coil → helix transformations in regions of random coil structure, as occurs when it binds to phospholipid vesicles (31Weinberg R.B. Jordan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8081-8086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or possibly because of altered self-association. Paradoxically, destabilization of the tertiary structure of the apoA-IV truncation mutants increased their interfacial exclusion pressure, perhaps because apoA-IV must unfold before it can fully adsorb to lipid/water interfaces (31Weinberg R.B. Jordan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8081-8086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or perhaps because destabilization of apoA-IV in solution increases the free energy gradient for its adsorption to the hydrophobic interface. The data from this unique panel of apoA-IV truncation mutants do not support a role of specific helical domains in activating CETP. However, the observation of a relationship between interfacial exclusion pressure and cholesterol ester transfer rate sheds additional light on the biophysical role of apolipoproteins in the CETP reaction. CETP catalyzes the movement of non-polar lipids between lipoproteins along chemical concentration gradients (21Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1255-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lagrost L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 209-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins could modulate this process by: 1) controlling the physical interaction of CETP with the surface of acceptor and/or donor particles; 2) modulating the interfacial solubility and accessibility of cholesterol esters; and 3) stabilizing acceptor particles as they acquire additional core lipids. Regarding the first mechanism, the exclusion pressure of a lipid transfer protein must be close to the pressure of donor and acceptor interfaces, so that its binding is reversible; otherwise it could bind too tightly and become “locked” on the interface. Indeed, the calculated pressure of the HDL3 surface is 33 mN/m (33Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the interfacial exclusion pressure of CETP is 31 mN/m (36Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Kussie P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29588-29591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, apolipoproteins could control the association of CETP with donor and acceptor lipoproteins by modulating surface pressure. For example, there is little lipid transfer between naked lipid emulsion particles with CETP alone (24Milner T.G., Ko, K.W.S. Ohnishi T. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1082: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Ohnishi T. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5029-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), for CETP binds tightly to both donor and acceptor particles (48Ohnishi T. Hicks L.D. Oikawa K. Kay C.C. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6093-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The presence of apolipoproteins with exclusion pressures higher than CETP enables it to dissociate from donor particles after cholesterol ester loading, and, especially, from expanding acceptor particles after cholesterol ester delivery. If such phenomena predominate, then the efficacy of apolipoproteins in activating or inhibiting CETP will be a function of both their exclusion pressure and their ambient concentration (26Guyard-Dangremont V. Lagrost L. Gambert P. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 982-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding the second and third mechanisms, both the microsolubilization of membrane-free cholesterol and phospholipids (49Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2021-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and the solubility of cholesterol esters in phospholipid monolayers (36Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Kussie P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29588-29591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a function of interfacial pressure. Thus, adsorption of apolipoproteins to acceptor and donor particles could facilitate loading/unloading of cholesterol ester molecules by optimizing their surface accessibility and buffering any changes in the chemical concentration gradient as the reaction proceeds. In this regard, the relationship between the interfacial exclusion pressure of apoA-IV truncation mutants and cholesterol ester transfer rate depicted in Fig. 2 is remarkably similar to the relationship between exclusion pressure and the ability of apolipoproteins to promote phospholipid efflux from free cholesterol-enriched fibroblasts shown in Fig. 6 in the paper by Gillote et al. (49Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2021-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, by reducing surface tension, adsorption of apolipoproteins to acceptor particles would minimize the free energy cost of expansion, analogous to the role of the insect protein Lp-III in stabilizing hemolymph high density lipophorin particles as they acquire diacylglycerol transported by the lipid transfer particle (50Ryan R.O. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1725-1739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If such phenomena predominate, then the efficiency with which apolipoproteins activate CETP will be directly proportional to their surface activity (25Ohnishi T. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5029-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Given that a large fraction of apoA-IV circulates as a lipid-free apolipoprotein (6Bisgaier C.L. Sachdev O.P. Megna L. Glickman R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that both plasma apoA-IV levels (5Green P.H. Glickman R.M. Riley J.W. Quinet E. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 51Ostos M.A. Lopez-Miranda J. Marin C. Castro P. Gomez P. Paz E. Jimenez-Pereperez J.A. Perez-Jimenez F.

Invest. 1986; 77: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) increase in the post-prandial period, it is possible that apoA-IV could modulate CETP activity in vivo. In this regard, the higher exclusion pressure and cholesterol ester transfer rate of the apoA-IV-2 isoprotein raise the question as to whether this variant increases CETP activity in vivo. Several population screening studies have observed lower HDL levels (53Kamboh M.I. Iyengar S. Aston C.E. Hamman R.F. Ferrell R.E. Hum. Biol. 1992; 64: 605-616PubMed Google Scholar, 54Campos H.

Assmann G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 1115-1128PubMed Google Scholar), and an increased LDL/HDL ratio (54Campos H. Lopez-Miranda J. Rodrigquez C. Albajar M. Schaefer E.J. Ordovas J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in individuals carrying an A-IV-2 allele, as would be expected with increased CETP activity (57Agellon L.B. Walsh A.

However, in the only population survey to directly measure CETP activity, von Eckardstein et al. (58VonEckardstein A. Funke H. Chirazi A. Chen-Haudenschild C. Schulte H. Schonfeld R. Kohler E. Schwarz S. Steinmetz A. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1114-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) found lower CETP activity in apoA-IV-1/2 heterozygotes. Possibly, other apoA-IV genetic variants with altered interfacial properties (59Weinberg R.B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) could influence CETP activity. Finally, these data raise several caveats regarding the use of modified recombinant apolipoproteins in biological studies. First, they illustrate how minor modifications made to facilitate protein purification may have major structural and functional consequences. In this case, addition of a hydrophobic decapeptide to the amino terminus of the r-AIV construct significantly increased its surface binding affinity and its ability to activate CETP. Second, these data illustrate the need for a full biophysical characterization of recombinant apolipoproteins used to probe the function of local domains. Again, the amino-terminal modification of r-AIV appeared to have no affect on its solution structure as assessed spectroscopically, yet it had a major impact on its interfacial activity. Likewise, spectroscopic characterization of the deletion mutants, alone, provided no indication as to how their apparent structural destabilization could increase their catalytic efficacy in the CETP reaction. Failure to fully characterize the biophysical properties of modified recombinant apolipoproteins could also lead to erroneously attributing a specific biologic function to local structure, when in fact, it was determined by global properties, such as interfacial activity. In this regard, however, comparison of our data and that of Emmanuel et al.(38Emmanuel F. Steinmetz A. Rosseneu M. Brasseur R. Gosselet N. Attenot F. Cuine F. Seguret S. Latta M. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29883-29890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supports their conclusion that helixes 5 and 6 (residues 117–160) in apoA-IV play a specific catalytic role in lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activation. In summary using a panel of recombinant human apoA-IV truncation mutants, we have found a strong correlation between interfacial exclusion pressure and the ability to activate CETP. We conclude that molecular interfacial exclusion pressure, rather than specific helical domains, determines the degree to which apoA-IV, and most likely other apolipoproteins, facilitate CETP-mediated lipid exchanges."

The toxin, that is involved in several extraintestinal infections in humans, is a member of a family of widely disseminated toxins and non-toxin proteins known as “RTX family,” for a series of Gly- and Asp-rich nonapeptide repeats in the carboxyl end of their structural proteins. They also share other structural features derived from their high homology: a NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain containing hydrophobic and/or amphipathic helices, and a COOH-terminal uncleavable export sequence (for reviews, see Refs. 1Coote J.G. Rev. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 7: 53-62Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 1998; 31: 1019-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 3Stanley P.

Perhaps because of the difference in hydrophobicities between the NH2-terminal membrane-binding domain and the COOH-terminal calcium-binding domain, E. coli α-hemolysin shows a remarkable tendency for self-aggregation (6Ostolaza H. Bartolomé B. Serra J.L. de la Cruz F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Soloaga A. Ramı́rez J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The protein exists in aqueous solution in a monomer-aggregate equilibrium. In the presence of a cell membrane, the monomeric form binds the membrane and eventually becomes inserted. In the absence of a lipid bilayer, the system evolves into an irreversibly aggregated form. Only in the presence of 6m urea can the protein be stored, apparently because under those conditions the protein is reversibly denatured and does not become irreversibly aggregated (8González-Carreró M. Zabala J. de la Cruz F. Ortiz J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 199: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When urea is removed, by dilution or dialysis, the active monomer-aggregate equilibrium is restored and the pathway to irreversible aggregation/inactivation is reopened (7Soloaga A. Ramı́rez J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Calcium (≈10−4m) is essential for the lytic activity of α-hemolysin. The repeat region in its COOH-terminal end is also the calcium-binding domain (9Ludwig A. Jarchay T. Benz R. Goebel W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Boehm D.F. Welch R.A. Snyder I.S. Infect. Immnun. 1990; 58: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work from this laboratory has shown that HlyA can reversibly “bind,”i.e. adsorb onto, the membrane lipid bilayer in the absence of calcium, but only in its presence does the toxin undergo a conformational change, and become irreversibly inserted into the host membrane, thereby inducing membrane disruption (11Ostolaza H. Goñi F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Bakás L. Ostolaza H. Vaz W.L.C. Goñi F.M. Biophys.

Acta. 1998; 1368: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The calcium-binding domain of HlyA extends approximately between residues 720 and 870. It is characterized by the presence of 11–17 (depending on how much deviation from the optimal consensus sequence is allowed) nonapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence GGXGXDXUX, whereX is an arbitrary amino acid residue, and U is a bulky hydrophobic residue. The three-dimensional structure of a non-toxin member of the RTX family, the alkaline protease from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is known at a 0.164-nm resolution (14Baumann U., Wu, S. Flaherty K. McKay D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Its COOH-terminal domain consists of a 21-strand sandwich, in which successive β-strands are wound in a right-handed spiral. Ca2+ are bound within the turns between strands formed by the repeated nonapeptide motif. It can be reasonably assumed that a similar structure exists in the repeat domain of HlyA. In a previous study (15Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goñi F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar), we had pointed out that the last-but-one of the 17 putative repeats in HlyA contained a His residue (His-859) in the same position occupied in all other 16 repeats by the Ca2+ ligand Asp or (in one case) by Asn. To explore the role of this particular His residue, we have prepared HlyA mutants by site-directed mutagenesis, in which His-859 has been replaced by Asn (H859N) or Asp (H859D). The Asn mutant is totally inactive, because it cannot bind Ca2+ and remains in the aggregate state under all conditions, while H859D is active, but displays a pH dependence different from that of wild-type HlyA. Egg phosphatidylcholine was obtained from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, England). Horse erythrocytes were purchased from Microlab (Madrid, Spain). ANTS (8-aminonaphtalene-1,2,3-trisulfonic acid), ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate), and DPX (p-xilene bis(pyridinium bromide)) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).N-Rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine was supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 45Ca in the form of CaCl2 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). TheE. coli D1210 strain was used throughout this work for DNA manipulation and HlyA expression. The recombinant plasmid pSU124, containing the hly genes (16Zabala J.C. Garcı́a-Lobo J.M. Dı́az-Aroca E. de la Cruz F. Ortı́z J.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was used to introduce the mutations into the hlyA gene. E. coli (pSU124) was grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a shaking bath. The substitutions of the codon for His-859 were introduced into the hlyA gene by sequential PCR steps. In the first step, fragments upstream and downstream of the point mutation were PCR-amplified, in two separate reactions, using the flanking primers and oligonucleotides containing the point mutation to be introduced. The two fragments, partially overlapping, encompassing the mutation, were combined in an overlap extension reaction with the flanking primers. The full-length mutagenized fragment generated in this way was digested withNcoI and PacI and cloned into pSU124 restricted with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid contained an inserted fragment identical to the original DNA except for the point mutation. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Flanking primers were 5′-GATATCTTCCATGGCGCGG-3′ and 5′-GATTTCATTAATTAATGGATTA-3′. Mutagenic primers were H859N, 5′-CATCAATAATGTTATGACCATA-3′, 5′-TATGGTCATAACATTATTGATG-3′; and H859D, 5′-CATCAATAATGTCATGACCATA-3′, 5′-TATGGTCATGACATTATTGATG-3′. WT and H859D were purified as described previously for the wild type (6Ostolaza H. Bartolomé B. Serra J.L. de la Cruz F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). H859N, that was expressed in smaller amounts, was purified by FPLC using a Superdex HR-200 column instead of the Sephacryl S-500 gel-filtration column. The purified proteins were stored at −20 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 6 m urea, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0. Urea used in protein storage was removed before any protein assay. This was usually accomplished by dilution, when HlyA was assayed at such concentrations that, upon dilution of the stock protein in the assay buffer, urea concentration fell below 0.25m, a concentration that did not interfere with our assays. When required, urea was removed by dialysis against 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, at 4 °C, for 6 h. A standard red blood cell suspension was used, obtained by diluting the erythrocytes with saline so that 37.5 μl of the mixture in 3 ml of distilled water gave an absorbance of 0.6 at 412 nm. Equal volumes of the standard suspension of washed horse erythrocytes were added to serial 2-fold dilutions of hemolysin in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The assay was carried out either in microtiter plates or in test tubes. In the first case, the cell + toxin mixtures were incubated at room temperature for a few hours, so that erythrocyte sedimentation occurred. In the test tube assay, the tubes were left for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking, then centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The absorbance of the supernatants, appropriately diluted with distilled water, was read at 412 nm. The blank (zero hemolysis) consisted of a mixture of equal volumes of buffer and erythrocytes. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) made of egg phosphatidylcholine were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate filters (Nuclepore, Pleasanton, CA), pore size 0.1 μm. Buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The diameter of the resulting vesicles was about 100 nm, according to quasi-elastic light scattering measurements.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar with ANTS and DPX entrapped in the liposomes. LUV were prepared in 70 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm ANTS, 45 mm DPX, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Non-entrapped probes were removed passing the LUV through a Sephadex G-75 column, eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Assays were performed at 100 μm lipid in a total volume of 1 ml, with continuous stirring, at 25 °C. Buffer was as above, with the addition of 10 mm CaCl2. The assay was started by adding 100 nm calcium-free dialyzed HlyA. ANTS fluorescence was recorded continuously (λex = 355 nm; λem = 520 nm). When leakage reached equilibrium, Triton X-100 was added (final concentration 0.1% w/v) to induce 100% release. Percent release was computed as follows, %Release=(Ff−Fo)(F100−Fo)×100Equation 1 where F f , F 100, andF o were, respectively, the fluorescence intensity values observed after addition of HlyA, after addition of Triton X-100, and before any addition. For leakage measurements at different pH the buffers were as above, except that 20 mm Tris-HCl was replaced by 50 mm Tris acetate, and pH adjusted as required. Protein binding to phosphatidylcholine LUV was assayed by the flotation method of Ref. 19Pereira F.B. Valpuesta J.M. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Nieva J.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1977-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar. LUV were prepared containing 0.6 mol % rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine, and diluted to 250 μm in a D2O buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). Liposomes were incubated with protein for 1 h at 25 °C, at 1:2,500 and 1:5,000 protein:lipid molar ratios. Then liposome-bound and non-bound proteins were separated by ultracentrifugation in a TLA 120.2 Beckman rotor (627,000 × g, 2 h, 20 °C). Liposomes containing bound protein floated on top of the buffer. This upper fraction was removed, liposomes solubilized in detergent, and lipid and protein quantitated by fluorescence. Lipid (rhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine) fluorescence was measured at λex = 520 nm and λem = 590 nm. Protein (tryptophan) fluorescence was measured at λex = 280 nm and λem = 340 nm. The amount of exchangeable Ca2+ bound to the proteins was measured by isotopic dilution of45Ca in the form of calcium chloride (15Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goñi F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). Protein (25 μg) was incubated with increasing 45CaCl2concentrations for 45 min at room temperature; the total volume was 1 ml. Free and bound Ca2+ were separated by filtration through cellulose mixed-ester filters (Millipore GSWP 02500). Nonspecific binding was estimated by adding an excess (100-fold) of non-radioactive Ca2+. Steady-state 90° light scattering measurements were used to detect changes in protein aggregation. The protein was diluted to 1 μm, then dialyzed successively to remove calcium, EGTA, and urea. Light scattering was measured at 25 °C, in a spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission monochromators at 520 nm. Binding of the fluorescent probe ANS was used to detect hydrophobic regions on the protein surface. Protein samples were diluted to 1 μm, then dialyzed to remove calcium and urea. ANS was added to a 5 μm final concentration, and its fluorescence emission spectrum recorded with λex = 360 nm and λem = 430–600 nm. Gel filtration was performed on a Superdex HR-200 column using a FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was diluted to 1.5 μm, left to equilibrate for 10 min, then filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter and injected into the column that was equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Calcium was added, when required, to the protein and elution buffer, at the same concentration. In each case, 80 μg of protein were injected in 0.5 ml. The column was eluted at 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The H859D and H859N mutants were expressed and purified in the same way as the wild-type (WT) protein, except that for the H859N mutant, a Superdex HR-200 chromatography was used instead of the Sephacryl S-500 column, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The yield of the proteins was about 2.0 mg/liter culture filtrate for WT and H859D, and about 0.5 mg/liter culture filtrate for H859N. For each of the mutants, a single band with identical electrophoretic mobility as that of WT was seen in SDS-PAGE (not shown). In Western blots, the mutant bands were stained with the polyclonal anti-HlyA antibodies used in previous work (20Cortajarena A.L. Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12513-12519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HlyA lytic activity was typically assayed on erythrocytes. A dose-response curve of hemolysis is shown in Fig. 1 A for the native and mutant forms. H859D behaved virtually like wild-type HlyA, while H859N was totally inactive in producing hemolysis. HlyA can also disrupt the permeability barrier of pure lipid large unilamellar vesicles (liposomes) (20Cortajarena A.L. Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol.

Again the H859D mutant behaved like the wild-type protein, while the H859N mutant was totally inactive. Binding (adsorption) of wild-type and mutant HlyA to liposomes was assayed by flotation, as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are summarized in Table I. Slightly less than one-half of the protein remained bound to the lipid bilayer, at both protein:lipid ratios tested. No significant differences were found between the WT and mutant proteins. Binding measured under these conditions represents protein adsorption onto the membrane, that may or may not be accompanied/followed by insertion of the toxin into the lipid bilayer (11Ostolaza H.

The calcium dependence of fluorescent probe efflux from liposomes is shown in Fig.2 for the wild-type and mutant proteins. HlyA reached a maximum of activity with about 100 μmCa2+, in agreement with previous data (15Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goñi F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar), and H859D behaved in a similar way. In contrast, H859N was inactive even in the presence of 250 μm Ca2+. High-affinity calcium binding was measured next for the three proteins under study, using 45Ca. It should be noted that only a small fraction of all Ca2+ ions bound to the β-roll are easily exchangeable with Ca2+ in solution, corresponding probably to those bound to the COOH-terminal (outermost) repeats (14Baumann U., Wu, S. Flaherty K. McKay D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar,15Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goñi F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 3 show that wild-type HlyA bound 3–4 calcium ions/protein molecule at 100 μm Ca2+, and this was enough to allow maximum activity. Mutant H859D bound on average less than 1 Ca2+/protein molecule at 100 μmCa2+, and this also induced maximum activity, as seen in Fig. 2 (this will be discussed below). Finally, H859N could not bind Ca2+ even at 500 μm CaCl2 (Fig.3). In our previous study (15Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goñi F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar) we had shown that the intrinsic fluorescence of HlyA tryptophanyl residues was increased, and the maximum emission wavelength shifted to lower wavelengths when HlyA bound Ca2+. The same phenomenon was observed here for H859D for Ca2+ ≥200 μm, while the fluorescence spectrum of H859N remained unchanged even at 1 mmCa2+ (spectra not shown). Calcium binding to HlyA in the absence of target membranes leads to irreversible protein aggregation, presumably through exposure of hydrophobic surfaces following a Ca2+-dependent conformational change (13Bakás L. Veiga M.P. Soloaga A. Ostolaza H. Goñi F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Aggregation can be conveniently monitored through changes in light scattering of the protein suspension. Fig.4 depicts the Ca2+-dependent changes in light scattering of WT and mutant HlyA. For WT, increasing Ca2+ concentrations led to increased aggregation, particularly in the 0–250 μm Ca2+ concentration range. A similar behavior, although to a smaller extent, and at higher Ca2+concentrations was displayed by H859D (Fig. 4 B). H859N departed again from WT and H859D behavior by showing, even in the absence of Ca2+, a high degree of aggregation, that was not modified by Ca2+ concentrations up to 1 mm(Fig. 4 A). The increased aggregation of H859N might be a clue for its lack of activity, since the active form of HlyA is the monomer (7Soloaga A. Ramı́rez J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), thus this aspect was examined in more detail. HlyA aggregation also occurs, in the absence of Ca2+, when urea is removed from a HlyA suspension that had been stored in 6m urea. In fact, the protective effect of 6 murea appears to consist of a displacement of the aggregate-monomer equilibrium toward the monomer side (7Soloaga A. Ramı́rez J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows the increase in light scattering of WT and H859N suspensions, originally in 6 m urea, when urea was removed by dialysis. In both cases, aggregation increased with time, but the mutant aggregated faster, and to a larger extent than the WT. The hypothesis that H859N is more aggregated than WT under all conditions was further confirmed by the studies of ANS fluorescence. The fluorophore ANS partitions in non-polar with preference to polar media. When transferred from aqueous to hydrophobic environments its fluorescent emission is enhanced, and shifted toward lower wavelengths (22Slavik J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 694: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). When HlyA was added to ANS in aqueous solution, the fluorescence intensity was indeed increased and blue-shifted, but the H859N mutant had a clearly larger effect on both parameters of ANS fluorescence (Fig. 6). The increase in ANS fluorescence in the presence versus absence of protein (F/F o) was of 8.2 and 10.6 for the WT and mutant, respectively. The maximum wavelengths of emission (λmax) were 490 and 482 nm, respectively. This suggests that, even in the absence of Ca2+, H859N has more hydrophobic patches that are accessible to ANS than WT, and this would explain the higher tendency of the mutant to aggregate. Additional evidence of the unusual displacement of the aggregate-monomer equilibrium toward the aggregate in the case of H859N came from FPLC. Fig. 7, A, C, and E, show typical chromatograms of, respectively, WT, H859N, and H859D HlyA. The chromatograms were dominated by a large peak that came out with or near the void volume, and corresponded, according to blue native gels (not shown), to some kind of aggregate (note, however, that the largest aggregates were removed by filtration prior to sample application to the column). In the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 7, B and F) both WT and H859D gave rise to a prominent peak at higher elution volumes (about 18 ml) that appeared as monomeric protein in blue native gels. This peak had the same electrophoretic mobility as HlyA in SDS-PAGE, and had hemolytic activity. Mutant H859N, however, did not give rise to the monomer peak in the presence or absence of Ca2+, the aggregate being the only species that was observed in the chromatograms (Fig. 7, C and D). The aggregation behavior of H859N can also explain some experimental results with red blood cells treated with both this mutant and WT HlyA. In the experiment in Fig. 8 A,erythrocytes were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with increasing amounts of H859N, then washed three times by centrifugation and treated with 10 ng (≈0.4 nm) of WT protein. Preincubation with the mutant had virtually no effect. This is probably indicating that the H859N mutant does not bind the glycophorin receptors of HlyA. Alternatively, binding may be so weak that the toxin is removed in the washing steps. In a different experiment, H859N and WT protein are mixed at different ratios, keeping constant the WT concentration at 0.4 nm, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before being added to the cell suspension. The result was that HlyA mixtures containing mutant:WT ratios 5 or higher were totally inactive in hemolysis, even if the amount of WT alone could induce over 80% hemolysis (Fig. 8 B). Our interpretation of this observation is that the tendency of H859N to aggregate is such that the WT monomers were also incorporated into the mutant aggregates, and thus neutralized their hemolytic capacity. The liposome system allows the study of HlyA lytic activity over a wide pH range. Release of liposomal contents by WT and H859D HlyA in the pH range 4–8 is depicted in Fig.9. WT HlyA displayed a sigmoidal pH dependence, with a maximum change at about pH 6.5, while H859D activity decreased steadily and slowly with decreasing pH in the 4–8 range. This is an indication that the pH dependence of WT HlyA is largely due to His-859. In most proteins the His side chain is protonated with pK a values in the pH region 6–7. The results in Fig. 9 suggest that His-859 in HlyA has a pK a at about 6.5, and that its protonation impairs severely the protein lytic activity. Aspartate, in turn, has no pK a in the 4–8 pH range, and consequently the activity of H859D decreases smoothly and regularly with pH, remaining clearly above that of WT at pH < 6.5. The observation that His-859 occupies position 6 in a nonapeptide of the RTX repeat region where aspartate is usually found (15Ostolaza H. Soloaga A. Goñi F.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 39-44PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to perform a comparative study on other RTX toxins. TableII summarizes data from the RTX repeat regions of 10 bacterial toxins, including HlyA. A total of 141 repeats were found, of which position 6 was occupied by Asp in 127 cases, Asn was found in 10 cases, and His in 4. No other amino acid was found in position 6 of the nonapeptide in any of the 141 repeats. Asn (codons AAU, AAC) or His (codons CAU, CAC) may have arisen as point mutations from an original Asp (codons GAU, GAC). Asn is never found in position 6 in the last four nonapeptides. Conversely, when His occurs in position 6 of a nonapeptide, it is always in the last, or last but one, of the repeats. Note that the nonapeptides closer to the COOH-terminal may be more accessible from the aqueous phase, and they are supposed to bind the exchangeable Ca2+ (14Baumann U., Wu, S. Flaherty K. McKay D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, two possible His-859 mutants were predicted to have a particular interest, one in which His was replaced by Asp, by far the most common residue in that position, and another one in which His was replaced by Asn, a residue that never occurs in position 6 in the last repeats. It is interesting that in fact H859D behaved very much like the wild type, while H859N was very different from almost every point of view tested.Table IINonapeptide repeats in toxins from the RTX familyToxinOrganismAccession No.No. of repeats2-aA minimally stringent criterion has been followed to detect the nonapeptides, other criteria may lead to smaller numbers of repeats in a given protein.

The fact that HlyA contains an N-terminal hydrophobic and a C-terminal hydrophilic domain explains probably its tendency to self-aggregation. However, only the monomeric form appears to be active from the point of view of membrane insertion and eventual lysis. Soloaga et al. (7Soloaga A. Ramı́rez J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have described how urea and calcium ions can modify the aggregate-monomer equilibrium. From those studies, and from those by Bakás et al.(12Bakás L. Ostolaza H. Vaz W.L.C. Goñi F.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1869-1876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Bakás L. Veiga M.P. Soloaga A. Ostolaza H. Goñi F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) it can be concluded that the lytic form of HlyA is a monomer that contains a number of exchangeable calcium ions bound to its repeat region. Data in the present paper illuminate from a different point of view the relevance of the aggregate-monomer equilibrium. Light scattering (Figs.4 and 5), ANS fluorescence (Fig. 6), FPLC (Fig. 7), and WT-mutant competition experiments (Fig. 8) concur in presenting mutant H859N as a protein in which the aggregate-monomer equilibrium is clearly shifted toward the aggregate form, so that the concentration of free monomer appears to be negligible. The H859N aggregates do not take up Ca2+ from the aqueous medium (Fig. 3) and are totally inactive (Figs. 1 and 2). There is no direct proof that only monomeric WT HlyA may bind Ca2+, but the fact that the highly aggregated H859N does not bind the cation speaks in favor of that hypothesis. In this case the scheme proposed by Soloaga et al. (7Soloaga A. Ramı́rez J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for the equilibria involving HlyA and calcium may be given in more detail in Scheme FS1, whereh represents a denatured form of HlyA. Mutant H859D represents a different situation. Judging from its activity (Figs. 1 and 2), similar to WT, the aggregate-monomer equilibrium in the absence of Ca2+ must also be comparable in H859D and WT. However, the low tendency of H859D to aggregate in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B) suggests that, in terms of the above scheme, the rate of conversion ofH mon · Ca into h·Ca is lower in the mutant than in the WT. In other words, the lifetime ofH mon·Ca is longer for H859D than for WT. In turn, this explains that with a lower averageCa2+:protein ratio, at e.g. 150 μmtotal Ca2+, the mutant is as active as the wild type (Figs.2 and 3). Ostolaza et al. (23Ostolaza H. Bakás L. Goñi F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) had observed that HlyA activity was much reduced at pH ≤ 5. However, the comparison of the pH dependence of WT and the H859D mutant reveals some important details. First, the pH dependence of WT follows closely the His protonation curve in many proteins. Second, substitution of His-859 by Asp changes the profile of the pH dependence curve, and makes the mutant clearly more active at low pH (Fig. 9). It is remarkable that a single amino acid substitution changes the pH profile of such a large and complex protein. The data in Fig. 9 alone are enough to identify His-859 as a very important residue in HlyA, and point to a physiological adaptive advantage for His over Asp in that position. The His side chain protonable group has a pK a at 6–7, so that protonation (i.e. gain of a positive charge) appears to “switch off” the protein. Asp has a net negative charge in all the 4–8 pH range, and the lytic activity remains all along. In the absence of a crystal structure, it is difficult to explain why either a negative charge or no charge in residue 859 are compatible with HlyA activity, while a positive charge is not. However, the pH dependence data of WT and H859D, together with those on the lack of activity of H859N, concur in pointing to His-859 as an essential residue inE. coli α-hemolysin activity. We are grateful to Dr. A. R. Viguera for comments and advice on several aspects of HlyA structure."
