https://openalex.org/W2003893812,"Transcription factor CTF, which is responsible for selective recognition of eukaryotic promoters that contain the sequence CCAAT, was purified to apparent homogeneity by sequence-specific DNA affinity chromatography. Binding sites for CTF in the human Ha-ras and alpha-globin promoters were highly homologous to sequences recognized by nuclear factor I (NF-I), a cellular DNA-binding protein that is required for the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication in vitro. To determine the relationship between CTF and NF-I, we compared the biochemical properties of these two proteins. CTF and NF-I were found to be indistinguishable in polypeptide composition, DNA-binding properties, immunological cross-reactivity, and in vitro stimulation of DNA replication and transcription initiation. We conclude that CTF/NF-I can serve both as a transcription selectivity factor for RNA polymerase II and as an initiation factor for adenovirus DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2001165707,"We have developed a cell-free system derived from Xenopus eggs that reconstitutes nuclear structure around an added protein-free substrate (bacteriophage lambda DNA). Assembled nuclei are morphologically indistinguishable from normal eukaryotic nuclei: they are surrounded by a double membrane containing nuclear pores and are lined with a peripheral nuclear lamina. Nuclear assembly involves discrete intermediate steps, including nucleosome assembly, scaffold assembly, and nuclear membrane and lamina assembly, indicating that during reconstitution nuclear organization is assembled one level at a time. Topoisomerase II inhibitors block nuclear assembly. Lamin proteins and membrane vesicles bind to chromatin late in assembly, suggesting that these components do not interact with chromatin that is formed early in assembly. Reconstituted nuclei replicate their DNA; replication begins only after envelope formation has initiated, indicating that envelope attachment may be important for regulating replication."
https://openalex.org/W2050879305,"The crystal structure of the complex between Eco RI endonuclease and the cognate oligonucleotide TCGCGAATTCGCG provides a detailed example of the structural basis of sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions. The structure was determined, to 3 A resolution, by the ISIR (iterative single isomorphous replacement) method with a platinum isomorphous derivative. The complex has twofold symmetry. Each subunit of the endonuclease is organized into an alpha/beta domain consisting a five-stranded beta sheet, alpha helices, and an extension, called the ""arm,"" which wraps around the DNA. The large beta sheet consists of antiparallel and parallel motifs that form the foundations for the loops and alpha helices responsible for DNA strand scission and sequence-specific recognition, respectively. The DNA cleavage site is located in a cleft that binds the DNA backbone in the vicinity of the scissile bond. Sequence specificity is mediated by 12 hydrogen bonds originating from alpha helical recognition modules. Arg200 forms two hydrogen bonds with guanine while Glu144 and Arg145 form four hydrogen bonds to adjacent adenine residues. These interactions discriminate the Eco RI hexanucleotide GAATTC from all other hexanucleotides because any base substitution would require rupture of at least one of these hydrogen bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2013812530,"We have used exonuclease protection in vivo as an assay to detect interaction of nuclear factors with the steroid-inducible promoter of mouse mammary tumor virus. Binding of two factors is detected uniquely at the steroid-activated promoter, and results in protection of sequences between -82 and approximately +12 One factor is identified as the murine homolog of nuclear factor 1. The second (designated factor i) binds downstream of nuclear factor 1 and protects sequences extending over the cap site. Binding activities associated with both factors can be detected in crude nuclear extracts; their apparent concentrations are unaffected by hormone treatment of the cells. These results demonstrate that glucocorticoid induction of transcription results from receptor-mediated establishment of a transcription factor complex at the promoter rather than activation of a preexisting complex."
https://openalex.org/W2152922534,"In this study we provide evidence that distinct DNA sequences within the 5′-flanking regions of the genes for interleukin-2 (IL-2) and its receptor (IL-2R) are involved in human T-cell-specific activation of transcription by p40x, a product of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1). The same DNA sequences appear to be responsible for induction of the genes in a T cell line, Jurkat, by mitogens. Although the IL-2 gene sequences are activated by p40x with much lower efficiency than the IL-2R gene sequences, they are synergistically activated by the p40x expression and subsequent extracellular stimulation by Concanaval-in-A or anti-T3. We propose a model for two-step activation of the IL-2 autocrine loop in ATL development."

https://openalex.org/W1572770561,"Multidrug resistance in human KB carcinoma cells selected for resistance to colchicine, vinblastine, or adriamycin results from overexpression, and frequently amplification, of a specific gene (mdr1). Overlapping cDNA clones representing a complete 4.7-kilobase mdr1 transcript have been obtained from multidrug-resistant KB cells. Primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments show that two transcripts initiate 136 and 140 bases upstream from the first ATG codon in all human multidrug-resistant cell lines. The mdr1 gene is expressed in human normal kidney cells and HepG2 liver cells as a poly(A)+ RNA which starts from the same sites. Less prominent transcripts were found to initiate 155-180 bases upstream from the first ATG codon in vinblastine- or adriamycin-selected cell lines and 480-630 bases upstream in colchicine-selected cell lines. Southern hybridization analyses with different portions of a full-length cDNA indicate that the human mdr1 gene encompasses at least 70 kilobases of DNA amplified in all highly multidrug-resistant cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2068072725,"We describe a stable cell-free mitotic extract derived from Xenopus eggs that contains activities necessary for nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome condensation during mitosis. Using these cell-free extracts, we have demonstrated that nuclear envelope vesicularization, lamina solubilization, and chromosome condensation are independent and separable biochemical processes. We present evidence indicating that during mitosis nuclear membrane breakdown may involve the binding of a coating protein, lamin solubilization is enzymatically driven, and chromosome condensation involves both binding proteins and enzymatic activities including topoisomerase II. These results provide a coherent framework for investigating structural modification of the nucleus during mitosis at the biochemical level."
https://openalex.org/W2002075344,"The structure of Mengo virus, a representative member of the cardio picornaviruses, is substantially different from the structures of rhino- and polioviruses. The structure of Mengo virus was solved with the use of human rhinovirus 14 as an 8 A resolution structural approximation. Phase information was then extended to 3 A resolution by use of the icosahedral symmetry. This procedure gives promise that many other virus structures also can be determined without the use of the isomorphous replacement technique. Although the organization of the major capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 of Mengo virus is essentially the same as in rhino- and polioviruses, large insertions and deletions, mostly in VP1, radically alter the surface features. In particular, the putative receptor binding ""canyon"" of human rhinovirus 14 becomes a deep ""pit"" in Mengo virus because of polypeptide insertions in VP1 that fill part of the canyon. The minor capsid peptide, VP4, is completely internal in Mengo virus, but its association with the other capsid proteins is substantially different from that in rhino- or poliovirus. However, its carboxyl terminus is located at a position similar to that in human rhinovirus 14 and poliovirus, suggesting the same autocatalytic cleavage of VP0 to VP4 and VP2 takes place during assembly in all these picornaviruses."

https://openalex.org/W1569405015,"We here describe a mutant low density lipoprotein receptor gene that produces a shortened receptor protein lacking three domains: the region of clustered O-linked carbohydrates, the membrane-spanning region, and the cytoplasmic tail. The defect is attributable to a single nucleotide substitution that creates a premature termination codon at amino acid 660, eliminating 180 residues from the mature protein. The truncated protein retains only two domains: a complete ligand-binding region (residues 1-292) and a partial epidermal growth factor precursor homology region (residues 293-659). The termination codon occurs in the middle of a cysteine-rich sequence that is part of the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain. The mutant protein is present in markedly reduced amounts and may be translated at a reduced rate. After synthesis, most of the receptor remains within the cell for several hours with its N-linked carbohydrate in an unprocessed endoglycosidase H-sensitive form. This finding suggests that the shortened receptor leaves the endoplasmic reticulum at an abnormally slow rate, which is likely attributable to abnormal folding of the truncated protein. The mutation creates a new restriction site for the enzyme HinfI, thus permitting diagnosis by Southern blotting of genomic DNA. Two copies of this mutant gene were present in each of four unrelated Arab patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (three from Lebanon and one from Syria). We believe that this mutation, hereafter referred to as the Lebanese allele, is responsible for the extraordinarily high incidence of familial hypercholesterolemia in Lebanon."

https://openalex.org/W1598425752,"Bombesin, a peptide mitogen for a variety of cell types, acts as a typical Ca2+-mobilizing hormone in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. At its mitogenic concentrations (1-25 nM), bombesin stimulates polyphosphoinositide turnover, i.e. breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and a concomitant increase in inositol phosphates in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In particular, bombesin induces an initial transient increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentration, followed by an increase in the concentration of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. Also, within 30 s of bombesin addition, the mass of 1,2-diacylglycerol nearly doubles and remains at this level for up to 60 min. Intracellular [Ca2+] measurements with a photoprotein, aequorin, demonstrate that bombesin stimulates a transient rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. A mobilization of Ca2+ from an intracellular pool is observed as a dose-dependent, transient increase in 45Ca2+ efflux from prelabeled cells, both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Bombesin also induces a sustained increase in Ca2+ influx rate and stimulates 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport across the plasma membrane. These composite results indicate that the mitogenic effect of bombesin is mediated through an activation of the Ca2+ messenger system."
https://openalex.org/W1583075434,"Light stimulates phospholipase A2 activity in rod outer segments (ROS) of bovine retina as measured by the liberation of arachidonate from phosphatidylcholine, in in vitro assays of dark-adapted ROS. A role for GTP-binding proteins (G or N proteins) in the light activation of phospholipase A2 is suggested by the capacity for guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) to activate phospholipase A2 in dark-adapted ROS. In contrast, addition of GTP gamma S coincident with light exposure inhibited the light activation of phospholipase A2, suggesting that phospholipase A2 activity in the ROS is under dual regulation by G proteins. Transducin, the major G protein of the ROS, mediates the activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase by light and is a substrate for both cholera and pertussis toxin. Treatment of dark-adapted ROS with either toxin inhibits both basal and light-activated phospholipase A2, mimicking the action of the toxins on the light-induced cGMP phosphodiesterase activity of ROS. There is a loss of light-sensitive phospholipase A2 activity coincident with extraction of transducin from ROS membranes. In addition, the light-sensitive phospholipase A2 activity can be partially restored by the addition of purified transducin to the extracted ROS membranes. Light activation of phospholipase A2 in ROS membranes thus occurs by a transducin-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2007478510,"Genetic and molecular studies show that the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) locus at Xp21 is large and complex. We have analyzed this region using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and have determined physical distances between Xp21 probes. The sum of the sizes of the Sfil restriction fragments detected by these probes is greater than 4000 kb. The deletion endpoints in two DMD patients were detected by observing changes in these restriction fragments. In addition, the Xp21 breakpoint for the X;1 translocation in an affected female was mapped. These results demonstrate the applicability of PFGE for analysis of Xp21, and should facilitate the mapping of other translocations and deletions in this region, some of which lead to glycerol kinase deficiency and adrenal hypoplasia as well as DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2067445582,"A murine recombinant Neo(r) retrovirus encoding the SV40 small t antigen was used to infect Balb/c 3T3 CIA31 cells. From analyses of G418-resistant clones containing at least as much intact t as Cos-1 cells, we found that t, alone, had no detectable A31 transforming activity. In contrast, we noted that SV40 large T promoted A31 agar colony formation when present over a 5- to 7.5-fold concentration range. However, at the low end of the spectrum, its transforming effect was manifest inefficiently except in the presence of t. Thus a major role for t in the SV40 transforming mechanism is to enhance directly or indirectly the transforming function of T."
https://openalex.org/W1964394713,"The local degradation of fibronectin substrata by Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick embryonic fibroblasts requires cell-contact-related metalloendoprotease and serine-protease activities. Using fibronectin-containing SDS gels, two large proteases with apparent molecular weights of 120K and 150K were found only in the membrane fraction of transformed cells and were absent in normal cells. Both 120K and 150K proteases were active at neutral pH, but showed preferential inhibitor sensitivities of serine and metal proteases, respectively. The 150K protease appeared to account for most of the proteolytic activity since metalloendoprotease inhibitors completely blocked proteolytic activity of the 150K in fibronectin gels, more than 80% of the fibronectin-degrading activity of solubilized membranes, and largely suppressed the appearance of fibronectin degradation spots in cultures of transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021865328,"A c-Ha-ras oncogene, to a lesser extent the c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene, and the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activate the inactive polyoma virus (Py) enhancer in a myeloma cell line and the partially active Py enhancer in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, but have no effect on the áctive Py enhancer in LMTK- fibroblasts. In addition, c-Ha-ras can stimulate the inactive Py enhancer in embryonal carcinoma F9 cells. c-Ha-ras activation in embryonal carcinoma cells does not appear to involve reversal of “E1A-like” inhibition of the enhancer. We suggest that modulation of cellular enhancer activity could play a key role in tumorigenesis by oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W1591106227,"The dynamics of ubiquitin pools within the cultured human lung fibroblast line IMR-90 were examined using solid phase immunochemical methods to quantitate free and conjugated polypeptide. Fetal calf serum was found to contain a nondialyzable factor that induced a transient accumulation of ubiquitin. During the induction, free and conjugated ubiquitin pools changed in concert so that the fraction conjugated remained constant. The induction of ubiquitin by the serum factor resulted from an enhanced rate of protein synthesis. Within experimental error no change in the first order rate constant for intracellular ubiquitin degradation was observed. Pulse-chase studies revealed ubiquitin to turn over with a half-life of 28-31 h in conditioned and freshly fed cultures. Withdrawal of serum from cultures led to a rapid decline in total ubiquitin during which the fractional level of conjugation remained constant. The accelerated ubiquitin turnover following removal of serum likely involves lysosomal autophagy since 10 mM NH4Cl led to an accumulation of the polypeptide. Since no similar effect of the lysosomotropic compound was observed in conditioned or freshly fed cultures, nonlysosomal processes are probably responsible for ubiquitin turnover under nutritional balance. The dynamics of these intracellular pools suggests that the ubiquitin ligation system is subject to regulatory constraints not previously suspected. The short half-life for ubiquitin is consistent with the apparent ability of cells to alter ubiquitin levels in response to external stimuli and stress."
https://openalex.org/W2076355219,"Recombinant retroviruses containing the complete genomic human beta globin gene (under the control of its own promoter) and the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase gene (under the control of the normal or enhancerless viral promoter) were used to derive transgenic mouse strains by infection of preimplantation embryos. Expression of the beta globin gene in hematopoietic tissues was observed in all transgenic strains. In addition, one strain showed ectopic expression of beta globin in the same tissues that also expressed high levels of RNA from the viral promoter. It is likely that expression from the long terminal repeat (LTR), in contrast to expression from the internal promoter, is dependent on the site of integration. Thus, retroviral vectors can be used for tissue-specific expression of foreign genes in transgenic mice, as well as for the identification of loci that allow developmental activation of a provirus."
https://openalex.org/W2072664180,"The hydrophobic NH2 terminus of F1 (FRED) of the simian virus 5 fusion (F) protein is implicated in mediating cell fusion, but in the inactive F0 precursor the FRED is translocated across membranes. Hybrid proteins containing the FRED as a potential membrane anchorage domain and a mutant of F0 lacking the preceding five-arginine cleavage/activation site were used to study the effect of position on the FRED. The experiments indicate that the SV5 F protein has evolved an exquisite control system for biological activity: the FRED is close to the threshold of hydrophobicity required to function as a membrane anchor. The FRED is not sufficiently hydrophobic to halt translocation when in an internal position, but on cleavage/activation the threshold of hydrophobicity is effectively lowered, and the FRED, now the NH2 terminus of F1, is able to interact stably with membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1527083852,"A monospecific polyclonal antiserum to the surface cAMP receptor of Dictyostelium has been developed by immunization with purified receptor immobilized on particles of polyacrylamide and on nitrocellulose paper. In Western blots, the antiserum displays high affinity and specificity for both the R (Mr 40,000) and D (Mr 43,000) forms of the receptor previously identified by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P] cAMP. These bands, labeled with the photoaffinity label or with 32 Pi, were quantitatively and specifically immunoprecipitated, supporting co-purification data that all represent the same polypeptide. The R form, found in unstimulated cells, contained at least 0.2 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor. The D form, generated by cAMP stimulation of intact cells, contained at least 4 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor. In the absence of detergents, the receptor was exclusively located on membranes. The receptor was solubilized effectively in Triton X-100 and sedimented as a broad peak of 5-7 S on sucrose velocity gradients. Western blots of membranes isolated at different times after starvation indicate that the appearance of cell surface cAMP binding sites during the aggregation stage of development (5-6 h) is due to de novo synthesis of receptor protein. Pulse labeling with [35S]methionine indicated that the receptor is most rapidly synthesized during the preaggregation stage of development (1-3 h), prior to its maximal accumulation in membranes. The serum specifically immunoprecipitates a polypeptide of Mr 37,000 from an in vitro translation reaction using RNA isolated from preaggregation stage cells. The time course of expression of the mRNA coding for the Mr 37,000 polypeptide parallels the rate of receptor synthesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2036667563,"We have initiated the molecular definition of the antigens recognized by Gross MuLV-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes on the surface of Gross MuLV-induced tumor cells. A panel of target cells was obtained by the double transfection and expression of a retrovirus gene and a foreign H-2 gene in recipient mouse fibroblasts. Our results show that class I H-2 transplantation antigens have a directive influence in determining the antigenicity of proteins encoded by the gag and env MuLV genes. Genes not linked to H-2 influence the intensity and the specificity of the cytolytic T lymphocyte response to Gross MuLV-induced tumors. Finally, MuLV-induced antigens expressed by transfected fibroblasts induce tumor immunity and lead to accelerated tumor rejection in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1964841886,"""Catch"" is a prolonged state of tension in molluscan smooth muscles shown by mechanical measurements to be associated with the level of protein phosphorylation. Myosin isolated from these muscles is unusual in being phosphorylated in the rod portion by an endogenous kinase, like certain nonmuscle myosins. These findings suggest that the myosin rod is a target for phosphorylation and that this reaction may control the transition from catch to relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W1538264730,"Abstract The zwitterionic detergent CHAPS was used to solubilize functional receptors for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) from guinea pig lung. The solubilized receptors were resolved by high performance gel filtration in 3 mM CHAPS into two active fractions with apparent Stokes radii of 5.9 +/- 0.1 and 2.3 +/- 0.1 nm. The binding of 125I-VIP to the two receptor fractions was time-dependent, reversible, and saturable. Trypsin destroyed the binding activity of the receptor fractions, indicating their proteinic nature. Unlabeled VIP competitively displaced the binding of 125I-VIP to the 5.9-nm fraction (IC50 = 240 pM) and the 2.3-nm fraction (IC50 = 1.2 microM). Scatchard analysis indicated a single class of binding sites in each receptor fraction, with Kd values 300 pM and 0.97 microM for the 5.9- and 2.3-nm Stokes radii fractions, respectively. When the high affinity, 5.9-nm Stokes radius fraction was rechromatographed in 9 nM CHAPS, 46% of the binding activity eluted in the low affinity, 2.3-nm Stokes radius fraction, indicating that the latter is a product of dissociation of the high affinity receptor complex. GTP inhibited the binding of 125I-VIP to the high affinity complex but not the low affinity species. Scatchard plots of VIP binding by the high affinity receptors treated with GTP suggested the presence of two distinct binding sites (Kd 4.4 and 153 nM), compared to a single binding site (Kd = 0.3 nM) obtained in untreated receptors. The nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate, inhibited VIP binding by the high affinity receptor fraction with potency nearly equivalent to that of GTP. These observations suggest that GTP-binding regulatory proteins are functionally coupled to the VIP-binding subunit in the high affinity receptor complex. The peptide specificity characteristics of the two receptor fractions were different. Peptide histidine isoleucine and growth hormone releasing factor, peptides homologous to VIP, were 87.5- and 22.9-fold less potent than VIP in displacing 125I-VIP binding by the high affinity receptor complex, respectively. On the other hand, growth hormone-releasing factor was more potent (22.7-fold) and peptide histidine isoleucine was less potent (31.3-fold) than VIP in displacing the binding by the low affinity species."
https://openalex.org/W1534853312,"A recent study showed that cAMP analogs lowered cAMP levels in rat hepatocytes (Corbin, J.D., Beebe, S.J., and Blackmore, P.F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8731-8735). The present work demonstrates that cAMP analogs also lowered cAMP in a rapid, concentration-dependent manner in heart and fat cells. In order to determine if the cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediated this effect, techniques were developed to assay the protein kinase activity ratio in hepatocytes treated with cAMP analogs. The activation of protein kinase and phosphorylase in hepatocytes by 8-pCl phi S-cAMP (where 8-pCl phi S- indicates 8-parachlorothiophenyl-) was concentration-dependent and occurred in parallel to proportionate decreases in cAMP. More than 20% of the cAMP binding sites on the protein kinase were unoccupied at concentrations of 8-pCl phi S-cAMP that produced maximal cAMP lowering. Thus, the possibility that 8-pCl phi S-cAMP lowered cAMP by displacing it from protein kinase binding sites, making it available for hydrolysis, seemed unlikely. In adipocytes, the lowering of cAMP by 8-pCl phi S-cAMP occurred in parallel with increases in lipolysis and activation of low Km phosphodiesterase, suggesting that the phosphodiesterase was responsible for the cAMP lowering. Further evidence for this assertion was the finding that in hepatocytes preloaded with low concentrations of 8-pCl phi S-cAMP, glucagon lowered 8-pCl phi S-cAMP by about 50%, an amount similar to the cAMP lowering observed with 8-pCl phi S-cAMP treatment. The results were consistent with a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed activation of a phosphodiesterase and suggested that 8-pCl phi S-cAMP-mediated hydrolysis of cAMP mimicked a physiologically significant response. The observation of this phenomenon in several tissues further suggested that it may be a general mechanism for dampening and terminating the hormonal signal through accelerated degradation of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1572444387,"The effect of high intracellular levels of cAMP on the ability of rabbit and human platelets to bind and respond to thrombin was examined. Control rabbit platelets differed from human platelets in two interesting respects: they showed thrombin-dependent up-regulation of thrombin binding, but also a 3- to 5-fold lower thrombin-binding capacity. Nevertheless, treatment with prostaglandin E1 + theophylline or with forskolin decreased thrombin binding to both rabbit and human platelets by 60 to 70%. This effect was associated with a marked increase in the level of cAMP and seemed to depend on a decrease in number rather than affinity of thrombin-binding sites. Changes in thrombin binding correlated closely with changes in thrombin-stimulated incorporation of 32Pi into phosphatidic acid and a 40-kDa protein. However, regardless of the amount of thrombin that bound to treated platelets, thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation of a 20-kDa protein and serotonin secretion were severely inhibited. Thus, increased levels of platelet cAMP are associated with a reduced ability to bind and respond to thrombin. However, thrombin binding to platelets correlates more closely with some responses than others, presumably because cAMP inhibits additional platelet reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2031009546,"We have characterized regulation of a complex Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast (PA) whose activity is stimulated by the DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin, both in the alga itself and in a heterologous Escherichia coli plasmid system. Since novobiocin is known to reduce torsional stress in E. coli DNA, we interpret our results to mean that PA is regulated by torsional stress in the chloroplast DNA. In E. coli, where we could readily manipulate PA, we found that this regulation depends on sequences upstream of PA. These sequences contain at least two different kinds of silencing elements that inhibit PA in the absence of novobiocin. Novobiocin stimulates PA only when the promoter-distal silencing element is present."
https://openalex.org/W1575804960,"Hydrogenase II contains two iron-sulfur clusters, one of the [4Fe-4S] type and one of unknown structure with unusual spectral properties (H-cluster). Using Mossbauer spectroscopy we have studied the H-cluster under a variety of conditions. In the reduced state the cluster exhibits, in zero magnetic field, spectra with the typical 2:1 quadrupole pattern of reduced [3Fe-4S] clusters. However, whereas the latter are paramagnetic (S = 2) the H-cluster is diamagnetic (S = 0). Upon oxidation and exposure to CO the H-cluster exhibits an S = 1/2 EPR spectrum with g values at 2.03, 2.02, and 2.00. In this state, the Mossbauer spectra reveal two cluster subsites with magnetic hyperfine coupling constants AI = +26.5 MHz and AII = -30 MHz. ENDOR data obtained by Hoffman and co-workers (Telser, J., Benecky, M. J., Adams, M. W. W., Mortenson, L. E., and Hoffman, B. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13536-13541) show a 57Fe resonance at AIII approximately equal to 9.5 MHz. Analysis of the Mossbauer spectra shows that this resonance represents one iron site. Our studies of the reduced and CO-bound oxidized states of hydrogenase II suggest that the H-cluster contains three iron atoms. The data obtained for the oxidized H-cluster suggest a novel type of 3-Fe cluster and bear little resemblance to those reported for oxidized [3Fe-4S] clusters with g = 2.01 EPR signals. In the reduced sample the [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster appears to occur in a mixture of two distinct electronic states."
https://openalex.org/W1606583181,"Fragmental Na,K-ATPase from the electric eel forms three phosphorylated intermediates (EP) with MgATP and Na+: ADP-sensitive K+-insensitive EP (E1P), ADP- and K+-sensitive EP (E*P), and K+-sensitive ADP-insensitive EP (E2P). The EP composition varied with the Na+ concentration. In the reconstituted Na,K-ATPase proteoliposomes (PL), the EP composition of the inside-out form was controlled not only by the intravesicular (extracellular) Na+ concentration, but also by the temperature and the cholesterol content of the lipid bilayer. When the lipid bilayer of PL contained less than 30 mol % cholesterol, the E*P content did not change significantly while the E2P content increased with an elevation in temperature (3-20 degrees C). In contrast, when the lipid bilayer contains more than 35 mol % cholesterol, the E*P content increased while the E2P content stayed less than 10% under the same temperature change. These observations suggest that a high cholesterol content in the lipid bilayer interferes with the E*P to E2P conversion. This cholesterol effect was reversed by ionophores (monensin, nigericin, and A23187). Therefore, E1P-rich EP, E*P-rich EP, or E2P-rich EP could be obtained in the PL under a constant Na+ concentration by using various concentrations of cholesterol and ionophores. The reaction between the proteoliposomal EPs and digitoxigenin (lipid-soluble cardiac steroid) occurred in a single turnover, thereby avoiding unphysiologically high Na+ concentrations. The increase in the ADP- and K+-insensitive EP, which indicated formation of the digitoxigenin-Na,K-ATPase complex, was equivalent to the decrease in the E*P under six different sets of conditions, without any significant change in the E1P and E2P contents. This result indicated that E*P is the active intermediate of the Na,K-ATPase for cardiac steroid binding. Although the E2P has been thought to be the active form for binding, it cannot bind with the cardiac steroid in the presence of Na+ and in the absence of free Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1481958642,"The phosphorylated intermediate (EP) of the Na,K-ATPase proteoliposomes (PL) prepared from the electric eel enzyme is composed of an ADP-sensitive K+-insensitive form (E1P), an ADP- and K+-sensitive form (E*P), and a K+-sensitive ADP-insensitive form (E2P). The composition of the intermediate varied with the cholesterol content of the lipid bilayer. The PL containing less than 30 mol % cholesterol (LCPL) formed E2P-rich EP in the presence of 10 mM Na+ on both sides at 15 degrees C, while the PL containing more than 35 mol % cholesterol (HCPL) formed E*P-rich EP under the same condition. In the presence of ionophore (monensin, nigericin, A23187), the HCPL formed E2P-rich EP as reported in the preceding paper. The turnover rate of Na-ATPase activity (the ratio of Na-ATPase to the EP level) in the LCPL was lower than that in the HCPL, and the addition of 20 microM monensin or A23187 to the HCPL reduced the Na-ATPase activity. The coupling ratio of Na+ influx (cellular efflux):Na+ efflux (cellular influx):ATP hydrolysis was 2.8:1.8:1 in the LCPL, although 1.6:0.6:1 in the HCPL. The coupling ratio of Na+ influx:ATP hydrolysis in the HCPL increased to 2.8:1 in the presence of A23187. Moreover, the increase of ATP concentration enhanced not only the Na-ATPase activity in the LCPL and HCPL with monensin but also the Na+ influx in the LCPL. This ATP enhancement was not found, however, in the HCPL without ionophores. The ADP enhancement of the Na+ influx was not observed in either the HCPL or the LCPL. We conclude from these observations that there are at least two different phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles (an E2P cycle and an E*P cycle) in the PL in the absence of K+. The E2P cycle transports three Na+ from the extravesicular (cytoplasmic) to the intravesicular (extracellular) side and two Na+ in the opposite direction per cycle and is similar to the ATP-dependent Na+-Na+ exchange system already reported (Blostein, R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7948-7953; Cornelius, F., and Skou, J. C. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 818, 211-221). However, the E*P cycle transports one Na+ from the extravesicular to the intravesicular side/cycle and has not yet been previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1597530337,"We have previously identified and demonstrated reversible ligand-induced modification of the major cell surface cAMP receptor in Dictyostelium discoideum. The receptor, or a subunit of it, has been purified to homogeneity by hydroxylapatite chromatography followed by two-dimensional preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purification was monitored by following 32Pi incorporated by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P]cAMP or by in vivo labeling with 32Pi. Two interconvertible forms of the receptor, designated R (Mr 40,000) and D (Mr 43,000), co-purified. Two-dimensional peptide maps of independently purified and 125I-iodinated R and D forms of the receptor were nearly identical but did have several distinct peptides. The estimated 6000-fold purification required is consistent with the number of cell surface binding sites assuming there are not multiple binding sites/polypeptide. In the accompanying article we report the generation of a monospecific polyclonal antiserum which has helped to further elucidate the physical properties and developmental regulation of the cAMP receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1983758339,"We have used sedimentation analysis as well as agarose gel electrophoresis to characterize the topological state of the DNA of the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) transcription complex. We found that the complex DNA contained constrained topological tension, presumably resulting from nucleosome-like structures, but no detectable unconstrained (i.e., relaxable) topological tension. These results contradict previous conclusions that the SV40 transcription complex contains only unconstrained topological tension. Our findings are also the opposite of what has been proposed to be the case for the 5S gene analyzed in Xenopus oocytes. Thus the proposal that expression from the 5S gene is associated with substantial topological tension is not valid for expression from the SV40 late gene."
https://openalex.org/W1527247386,"Neoplanocin A, a cyclopentenyl analog of adenosine, has been shown recently to be a tight binding inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1), exhibiting a stoichiometry of one molecule of inhibitor per molecule of the enzyme tetramer (Borchardt, R. T., Keller, B. T., and Patel-Thombre, U. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4353-4358). In the present study a detailed analysis was performed of the possible role of the enzyme-bound NAD+ in the inactivation of AdoHcy hydrolase by neplanocin A. The NAD+/NADH content was quantitated using a fluorescence technique. The native enzyme showed intrinsic fluorescence with an emission maximum at 460 nm when excited at 340 nm, partially due to NADH bound to the enzyme. It was found that the content of NAD+ and NADH in freshly prepared, native enzyme is equal, having a stoichiometry of two nucleotides per enzyme molecule (tetramer). In addition, it was observed that the enzymatic activity of the native enzyme can be increased by about 30% following preincubation with NAD+. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the mechanism of inhibition of AdoHcy hydrolase by neplanocin A involves the reduction of enzymatically bound NAD+ to NADH. Catalytic activity of the inactivated enzyme could be fully recovered in a time-dependent manner by further incubation with NAD+ (but not NADH). It was also found that inhibition by neplanocin A does not involve dissociation of the bound NAD+ or NADH from the enzyme, but simply reduction of the NAD+ to NADH."

https://openalex.org/W1518739783,"The effect of immobilized dye concentration on protein complexation was observed using zonal chromatography. A monomeric protein, octopine dehydrogenase, was retained by a single interaction to a Sepharose CL-6B column containing 11.6 mM immobilized Cibacron blue F3GA. By contrast, a tetrameric protein, lactate dehydrogenase, was retained by the same column by multiple interactions. The degree of multiple interactions was found to systematically increase with increasing immobilized dye concentration. The concentration of immobilized dye accessible to protein was found to be inversely related to the concentration of ionic components in the solvent. Zonal chromatographic measurements of free dye and unconjugated matrix suggest that increasing the concentration of ionic components promotes the adsorption of immobilized dye to the adjacent matrix surface. Such adsorption markedly affects both the capacity of an immobilized dye column and the multiplicity of its interaction with oligomeric proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1585229506,"Phosphorylation of the ascarid phosphofructokinase with the catalytic subunit of beef heart cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase results in the incorporation of 1 mol of P/mol of subunit. Accompanying the phosphorylation there is a 3-4-fold increase in catalytic activity when measured at pH 6.8 with inhibitory levels of ATP. Studies on the effect of phosphorylation on the ATP saturation curve demonstrated that phosphorylation decreased the inhibitory action of ATP. The apparent Km of the catalytic subunit for the phosphofructokinase was 11.2 microM. Chymotryptic or subtilisin digestion of the labeled enzyme released distinct but overlapping phosphopeptides that were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced by gas phase peptide sequencing. The sequence of the chymotryptic peptide was Ala-Lys-Gly-Arg-Ser-Asp-Ser(P)-Ile-Val-Pro-Thr. Based on these results and earlier observations, it is proposed that phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase plays an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism in the parasitic helminth."
https://openalex.org/W1586267098,"Deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase), an enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of dUTP to deoxyuridylate and inorganic pyrophosphate, has been purified approximately 6,000-fold from Drosophila embryos. The enzyme has a native molecular weight of 46,000 and a sedimentation coefficient of 3.5 S. The enzyme is most likely a metalloenzyme. It is specific for dUTP among the DNA nucleotides tested, with an apparent Km of 1 microM. The expression of dUTPase appears stage-specific, with embryos representing the only step in the life cycle of Drosophila with clearly detectable levels of the enzyme. While other possibilities exist, these results suggest an enhanced opportunity for the inclusion of uracil into Drosophila DNA subsequent to embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1503497536,"We constructed a hybrid plasmid expressing yeast tryptophan synthetase in Escherichia coli. Several deletion variants lacking the A or B domains of this polypeptide (recognized by their homology to the alpha and beta subunits of prokaryotic tryptophan synthetase) showed no enzymatic activity and failed to substitute for the corresponding E. coli subunits. To examine the role of a presumed interdomain connecting region in the yeast enzyme, we constructed a variant lacking 18 amino acids in that region. The variant polypeptide was completely inactive. Replacing 14 of the 18 missing amino acids with a segment having a different sequence partially restored activity. A spontaneous revertant was characterized and shown to have a duplication of 16 amino acid residues in this region; the activity of the duplication polypeptide was better than that of the 14-residue replacement. If confirmed by additional studies, our finding that the length of the connecting region is more critical than its sequence has implications for understanding the origin of gene fusions during evolution as well as for designing artificial fusions."
https://openalex.org/W1552714638,"The structure of the lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor has been studied by immunoprecipitating the receptor from biosynthetically labeled cultured Leydig tumor cells (designated MA-10). This was performed by binding human choriogonadotropin (hCG) to the labeled cells, solubilizing the hormone-receptor complex, partially purifying the complex by lectin chromatography, and immunoprecipitating the complex with an antibody that recognizes receptor-bound hCG. The conditions used for the release of the radiolabeled receptor from the immunoprecipitate and the subsequent analysis of this material on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels allowed us to determine directly the structure of the free (not hormone-occupied) LH/CG receptor. From experiments using cells labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, we show that the LH/CG receptor is composed of a single polypeptide chain that migrates as a 92-kDa protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels whether analyzed in the absence or presence of reducing agents. Other studies presented demonstrate that the LH/CG receptor is a glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1488154180,"WRK-1 cells possess a labile, hormone-sensitive pool of phosphatidylinositol which appears to be separate from the stable, hormone-insensitive phosphatidylinositol. It is the sensitive pool which turns over in response to treatment with vasopressin. Addition of the calcium ionophore A23187, on the other hand, selectively stimulates precursor incorporation into the hormone-insensitive pool of phosphatidylinositol, while causing nonspecific breakdown of both pools. The polyphosphoinositides are similarly affected. Ionophore-stimulated breakdown appears to be predominantly phospholipase C-mediated, since there is a concomitant increase in inositol phosphates. These inositol phosphates are localized predominantly in the extracellular medium. Permeabilization of the cells may explain the extracellular location of the breakdown products. When added together with the hormone, A23187, at concentrations greater than 5 X 10(-6) M, inhibits both hormone-induced synthesis and breakdown of phosphatidylinositol. Omission of calcium from the medium abolishes the effects of the ionophore."
https://openalex.org/W1862422995,"Abstract Antibodies to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor of bovine pituitary membranes have been raised in rabbits by immunization with affinity-purified receptor preparations. These antibodies did not compete with 125I-labeled GnRH analog (Buserelin) for binding to the receptors but did precipitate rat and bovine solubilized receptors labeled with 125I-Buserelin. Binding of the antibodies to the receptors was also demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled purified receptors and photoaffinity-labeled receptors. The antibodies did not have a GnRH-like activity but rather inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, GnRH-stimulated luteinizing hormone release from cultured rat pituitary cells. In addition, the antibodies did not inhibit luteinizing hormone release stimulated by high K+ concentration. This suggests that the antibodies recognize domains of the receptor other than the binding site of the hormone and thereby inhibit the biological response. These GnRH receptor antibodies provide a useful tool for studying GnRH receptor structure, function, localization, and biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1568053448,"The expression of the nusA-infB operon has been investigated using an in vitro system based on the formation of the first dipeptide of the gene product. A series of plasmids containing various deletions of the operon were used as templates in this study. Of the four genes coding for protein products, 15Ka, nusA, infB, and 15Kb, only 15Ka was not expressed in this dipeptide system. The initial dipeptides for the other gene products, fMet-Asn (pnusA), fMet-Thr (IF-2 alpha), and fMet-Ala (p15Kb), were synthesized even from plasmids lacking the primary promoters. It appears that secondary (internal) promoters in the operon can efficiently direct the expression of these genes. No regulation of the expression was observed with IF-2 alpha, but pnusA inhibited the expression of the nusA gene (autoregulation) as well as the p15b gene. Experiments using an uncoupled system indicated that the effect of pnusA on nusA expression was at the level of transcription, but that both a transcriptional and a post-transcriptional effect of pnusA was seen on 15Kb expression."
