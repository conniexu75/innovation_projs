https://openalex.org/W1976849281,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has tissue-specific effects on growth, differentiation, and gene expression. We show here that cAMP can activate the transcription factor Elk-1 and induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells via its activation of the MAP kinase cascade. These cell type-specific actions of cAMP require the expression of the serine/threonine kinase B-Raf and activation of the small G protein Rap1. Rap1, activated by mutation or by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA, is a selective activator of B-Raf and an inhibitor of Raf-1. Therefore, in B-Raf-expressing cells, the activation of Rap1 provides a mechanism for tissue-specific regulation of cell growth and differentiation via MAP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2088043742,"We analyzed Pax-3 (splotch), Myf-5 (targeted with nlacZ), and splotch/Myf-5 homozygous mutant mice to investigate the roles that these genes play in programming skeletal myogenesis. In splotch and Myf-5 homozygous embryos, myogenic progenitor cell perturbations and early muscle defects are distinct. Remarkably, splotch/Myf-5 double homozygotes have a dramatic phenotype not seen in the individual mutants: body muscles are absent. MyoD does not rescue this double mutant phenotype since activation of this gene proves to be dependent on either Pax-3 or Myf-5. Therefore, Pax-3 and Myf-5 define two distinct myogenic pathways, and MyoD acts genetically downstream of these genes for myogenesis in the body. This genetic hierarchy does not appear to operate for head muscle formation."
https://openalex.org/W2093115609,"Two highly similar, PtdIns(4,5)P2-selective, Gβγ-activated PI3Ks were purified from pig neutrophil cytosol. Both were heterodimers, were composed of a 101 kDa protein and either a 120 kDa or a 117 kDa catalytic subunit, and were activated greater than 100-fold by Gβγs. Peptide sequence–based oligonucleotide probes were used to clone cDNAs for the p120 and p101 species. The cDNA of p120 is highly related to p110γ, while the cDNA of p101 is not substantially related to anything in current databases. The proteins were expressed in and purified from insect and mammalian cells. They bound tightly to one another, both in vivo and in vitro, and in so doing, p101 amplified the effect of Gβγs on the PI3K activity of p120 from less than 2-fold to greater than 100-fold."
https://openalex.org/W2037804577,"Immunologically privileged sites express Fas ligand (FasL), which protects them from attack by activated T cells that express Fas and die upon contact with FasL. In an attempt to protect nonobese diabetic mice (NOD) from autoimmune diabetes, we made FasL transgenic NOD mice using the β cell-specific rat insulin-1 promoter. Surprisingly, these transgenic mice showed heightened sensitivity to diabetogenic T cells, which was due to self-destruction of β cells upon T cell-mediated induction of Fas. Fas-negative NODlpr/lpr animals were resistant to diabetogenic T cells and to spontaneous diabetes. Thus, induction of Fas expression on β cells and their subsequent destruction constitutes the main pathogenic mechanism in autoimmune diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W1979645700,"An 8-9 bp RNA-DNA hybrid in the transcription elongation complex is essential for keeping the RNA 3' terminus engaged with the active site of E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP). Destabilization of the hybrid leads to detachment of the transcript terminus, RNAP backtracking, and shifting of the hybrid upstream. Eventually, the exposed 3' segment of RNA can be removed through transcript cleavage. At certain sites, cycles of unwinding-rewinding of the hybrid are coupled to reverse-forward sliding of the transcription elongation complex. This explains apparent discontinuous elongation, which was previously interpreted as contraction and expansion of an RNAP molecule (inch-worming). Thus, the 3'-proximal RNA-DNA hybrid plays the dual role of keeping the active site in register with the template and sensing the helix-destabilizing mismatches in RNA, launching correction through backtracking and cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2043775652,"A proline-directed serine/threonine ceramide-activated protein (CAP) kinase mediates transmembrane signaling through the sphingomyelin pathway. CAP kinase reportedly initiates proinflammatory TNF alpha action by phosphorylating and activating Raf-1. The present studies delineate kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), identified genetically in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, as CAP kinase. Mouse KSR, like CAP kinase, renatures and autophosphorylates as a 100-kDa membrane-bound polypeptide. KSR overexpression constitutively activates Raf-1. TNF alpha or ceramide analogs markedly enhance KSR autophosphorylation and its ability to complex with, phosphorylate, and activate Raf-1. In vitro, low nanomolar concentrations of natural ceramide stimulate KSR to autophosphorylate, and transactivate Raf-1. Other lipid second messengers were ineffective. Moreover, Thr269 the Raf-1 site phosphorylated by CAP kinase, is also recognized by KSR. Thus, by previously established criteria, KSR appears to be CAP kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2120690461,"To understand how the skeletal muscle lineage is induced during vertebrate embryogenesis, we have sought to identify the regulatory molecules that mediate induction of the myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and Myf-5. In this work, we demonstrate that either signals from the overlying ectoderm or Wnt and Sonic hedgehog signals can induce somitic expression of the paired box transcription factors, Pax-3 and Pax-7, concomitant with expression of Myf-5 and prior to that of MyoD. Moreover, infection of embryonic tissues in vitro with a retrovirus encoding Pax-3 is sufficient to induce expression of MyoD, Myf-5, and myogenin in both paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm in the absence of inducing tissues as well as in the neural tube. Together, these findings imply that Pax-3 may mediate activation of MyoD and Myf-5 in response to muscle-inducing signals from either the axial tissues or overlying ectoderm and identify Pax-3 as a key regulator of somitic myogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2147065485,"The switch from short-term to long-term facilitation of the synapses between sensory and motor neurons mediating gill and tail withdrawal reflexes in Aplysia requires CREB-mediated transcription and new protein synthesis. We isolated several downstream genes, one of which encodes a neuron-specific ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase. This rapidly induced gene encodes an enzyme that associates with the proteasome and increases its proteolytic activity. This regulated proteolysis is essential for long-term facilitation. Inhibiting the expression or function of the hydrolase blocks induction of long-term but not short-term facilitation. We suggest that the enhanced proteasome activity increases degradation of substrates that normally inhibit long-term facilitation. Thus, through induction of the hydrolase and the resulting up-regulation of the ubiquitin pathway, learning recruits a regulated form of proteolysis that removes inhibitory constraints on long-term memory storage."
https://openalex.org/W2152015543,"Pex14p, an S. cerevisiae peroxin, is attached to the outer face of the peroxisomal membrane and is a component of the protein import machinery. Pex14p interacts with both the PTS1 and PTS2 receptors. It is the only known peroxisomal membrane protein that binds the PTS2 receptor and might thus mediate the membrane docking event of PTS2-dependent protein import. These results suggest that the two import pathways overlap and, furthermore, that Pex14p represents the point of convergence. Pex14p also interacts with two other membrane-bound peroxins including Pex13p, another binding protein for the PTS1 receptor. The data presented here are consistent with the idea of a common translocation machinery for both PTS-dependent protein import pathways in the peroxisomal membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1967167923,"During V(D)J recombination, RAG1 and RAG2 cleave DNA adjacent to highly conserved recombination signals, but nothing is known about the protein–DNA complexes that exist after cleavage. Using a properly regulated in vitro V(D)J cleavage system, together with nuclease sensitivity, mobility shift, and immunoprecipitation experiments, we provide evidence that a stable complex is formed postcleavage between synapsed recombination signals. This complex includes the proteins RAG1, RAG2, HMG-1 or the closely related HMG-2 protein, and the components of the DNA- dependent protein kinase. The existence of such a stable complex explains a number of in vivo observations and suggests that remodeling of postcleavage synaptic complexes is an important step in the resolution of signal ends in V(D)J recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2134247450,"Outer segments of mammalian rod photoreceptor cells contain an abundantly expressed membrane protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 220 kDa by SDS-gel electrophoresis. We have purified the bovine protein by immunoaffinity chromatography, determined its primary structure by cDNA cloning and direct peptide sequence analysis, and mapped its distribution in photoreceptors by immunocytochemical and biochemical methods. The full-length cDNA encodes a 2280-amino acid protein (calculated molecular mass of 257 kDa) consisting of two structurally related, tandem arranged halves. Each half consists of a hydrophobic domain containing six putative transmembrane segments followed by an ATP-binding cassette. A data base homology search showed that the rod outer segment 220-kDa protein is 40-50% identical in amino acid sequence to the ABC1 and ABC2 proteins cloned from a mouse macrophage cell line. Photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-ATP and nucleotide inhibition studies confirmed that both ATP and GTP bind to this protein with similar affinities. Concanavalin A labeling and endoglycosidase H digestion indicated that the rod outer segment protein contains at least one carbohydrate chain. Immunocytochemical and biochemical studies have revealed that the 220-kDa glycoprotein is distributed along the rim region and incisures of rod outer segment disc membranes. From these studies we conclude that the 220-kDa glycoprotein of bovine rod outer segment disc membranes or Rim ABC protein is a new member of the superfamily of ABC transporters and is the mammalian homolog of the frog photoreceptor rim protein.

Outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells are highly specialized subcellular structures that serve as the site for phototransduction. The rod outer segment (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROSrod outer segmentsABCATP-binding cassetteCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidkbkilobase(s). consists of a highly ordered axial array of over 500 discs surrounded by a separate plasma membrane. Each disc is made up of two closely spaced lamellar membranes circumscribed by a hairpin loop or rim region (1Steinberg R.H. Fisher S.K. Anderson D.H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1980; 190: 501-518Google Scholar). The continuous disc membrane encloses a compartment called the disc lumen or intradiscal space. The perimeter of the disc is interrupted by one or more incisures that penetrate toward the center of the disc. Filamentous structures extend from the rim region of the discs to adjacent discs and to the plasma membrane (2Roof D.J. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 487-500Google Scholar, 3Usukura J.

The protein composition of ROS disc membranes differs from that of the plasma membrane (5Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Google Scholar). Although both membranes contain rhodopsin as the major membrane protein, the cGMP-gated channel (6Cook N.J. Molday L.L. Reid D. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6996-6999Google Scholar), the Na/Ca-K exchanger (7Reid D.M. Friedel U. Molday R.S. Cook N.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1601-1607Google Scholar), and the GLUT-1 glucose transporter (8Hsu S-C. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

The peripherin/rds-rom-1 complex in mammalian ROS and the 290-kDa glycoprotein or rim protein of frog ROS each constitute 3-4% of the total ROS membrane protein and are localized to the rim region and incisures of rod and cone disc membranes (10Molday R.S.

Vision Res. 1982; 22: 1417-1428Google Scholar). The frog rim protein has been reported to undergo a light-activated phosphorylation reaction (16Szuts E.Z. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4176-4184Google Scholar); however, the role of this reaction in photoreceptor cell function remains to be determined. An abundant 220-kDa membrane glycoprotein is also present in mammalian ROS disc membranes (17Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4653-4660Google Scholar, 18Converse C.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1979; 29: 409-416Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling studies indicate that this protein specifically binds ATP and GTP (19Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Farber D.B. Exp. Eye. Res. 1988; 46: 647-655Google Scholar). Although the distribution of the 220-kDa protein in mammalian ROS disc membranes has not yet been determined, it is generally thought that this protein may be the homolog of the frog 290- kDa rim protein. The function of the frog rim protein is not currently known. Its large size and distribution along the rim region of ROS discs, however, has led to the suggestion that it may constitute the filament-like structures that link adjacent discs together and/or connect the discs to the plasma membrane (2Roof D.J. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 487-500Google Scholar, 4Corless J.M. Schneider T.G. Exp. Eye. Res. 1987; 45: 883-905Google Scholar). As a first step in defining the role of the rim protein in ROS structure and function and its possible involvement in retinal degenerative diseases, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA for the bovine 220-kDa protein and studied its molecular properties and cellular distribution. In this paper we report that the bovine 220-kDa glycoprotein is a novel member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. Like the frog rim protein, it is localized to the rim region of bovine ROS disc membranes. A λZAPII oligo(dT)-primed retinal cDNA library was a generous gift of W. Baehr, and the pcDNAII random-primed cDNA library was made from bovine retinal poly(A) RNA. Monoclonal antibodies PMc 1D1 and PMs 4B2 against the α- and β-subunits of the bovine cGMP-gated channel, respectively, and PMe 2D9 against the Na/Ca-K exchanger have been reported (6Cook N.J. Molday L.L. Reid D. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6996-6999Google Scholar, 20Molday L.L. Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

ROS were isolated under dim red light from freshly dissected or previously frozen retinas by continuous sucrose gradient centrifugation; ROS membranes were isolated by hypotonic lysis of ROS as described previously (5Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Google Scholar). The ROS membranes resuspended in 0.01 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, at a protein concentration of 8-10 mg/ml were either used immediately or stored at −70°C in light-tight vials. Disc membranes were separated from ricin-gold-dextran labeled plasma membranes by mild trypsin digestion and sucrose gradient centrifugation (5Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody Rim 3F4 against the bovine 220-kDa disc rim protein was generated from a BALB/c mouse that had been repeatedly immunized with a partially purified preparation of the 220-kDa protein by standard procedures (22MacKenzie D. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7100-7105Google Scholar). The immunogen was prepared by solubilizing ROS in 0.02 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 18 mM CHAPS, and 0.15 M NaCl and passing this solution through a DEAE-Fractogel TSK column equilibrated in the same buffer. The flow-through fraction containing the 220-kDa protein, rhodopsin, and other minor proteins was devoid of the cGMP-gated channel and the highly antigenic Na/Ca-K exchanger (23Cook N.J. Hanke W. Kaupp U.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 585-589Google Scholar). Culture fluid from Rim 3F4 hybridoma cells was routinely used at a dilution of 1:40 for Western blotting and 1:5 for immunocytochemical studies. For immunoaffinity chromatography the Rim 3F4 antibody was purified from ascites fluid by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate at 4°C followed by DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography. Polyclonal antibody PrimT1 was obtained by immunizing a New Zealand White rabbit with the 220-kDa rim protein purified on a Rim 3F4 antibody-Sepharose 2B column (see below). For use in Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and library screening, residual contaminating antibodies to other ROS proteins were removed by treating 5 ml of the PrimT1 antiserum containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, with 2 ml of Sepharose 2B conjugated to 4 mg of Triton X-100-solubilized ROS proteins, in which the 220-kDa protein had been first removed by passage through a Rim 3F4 antibody-Sepharose 2B column. For electron microscopy, the PrimT1 antibody was purified by the method of Burton et al (24Burton M.D. Onstott L.T. Polans A.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 225-230Google Scholar). Approximately 100,000 plaque forming units from an oligo(dT)-primed bovine retinal cDNA library were screened with the preadsorbed PrimT1 antiserum diluted 1:5000 (25Helfman D.M. Feramisco J.R. Fiddes J.C. Thomas G.P. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 31-35Google Scholar). Of 11 positive clones detected, 6 were subcloned and found to contain identical sequences. A synthetic oligonucleotide from the 5′ end of the longest clone (λ2) was used to rescreen the library. The 5′ end of the longest clone (λ15) was used to screen the random-primed retinal cDNA library. Overlapping clones were isolated and sequenced in both directions by a combination of the dideoxy chain termination method using [α-35S]dATP and automated fluorescent sequencing (Licor, Inc.). For Northern blots, 10 μg of total RNA from bovine retinas were hybridized at 65°C for 2 h in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham) with 32P-labeled probes synthesized by random-priming (Pharmacia T7Quick Prime Kit). Probes were derived from an EcoRI/SacI fragment of clone p41 (nucleotides 3707-4038 of the full-length cDNA) and an EcoRI/HpaII fragment of clone p55 (nucleotides 2498-2780). For N-terminal peptide sequencing and amino acid analysis, 100-200 μg of the immunoaffinity purified 220-kDa protein or its 115- and 120-kDa tryptic fragments (see below) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon membranes. The immobilized protein was subjected to acid hydrolysis for amino acid analysis or Edman degradation for N-terminal microsequencing. For internal peptide sequences, 80 mg of purified ROS membranes were resuspended in 10 ml of 0.02 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.02 M CaCl2. Ten ml of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (0.4 μg/ml) were added and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at room temperature and then for 30 min on ice. The membranes were sedimented at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor for 10 min and subsequently washed 3 times with 20 ml each of 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor in the same buffer. The final pellet was solubilized at 2 mg/ml in 0.02 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and incubated with 1 ml of Rim 3F4 antibody-Sepharose 2B for 1 h. After the matrix was washed in the same buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, the tryptic fragments of the 220-kDa protein were eluted with 0.6 ml of 0.1 M glycine·HCl, pH 3.5, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. The eluted fraction was concentrated to 0.1 ml using a Centricon 30 (Amicon) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 120- and 115-kDa tryptic fragments were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon or nitrocellulose membrane and either directly subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis or digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) by standard methods (26Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavendra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Google Scholar). Similarly, the immunoaffinity purified rim protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and digested with sequence grade trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim). In either case, peptides were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography using a narrow-bore C18 reverse-phase column and subjected to N-terminal microsequencing. Amino acid analysis and N-terminal peptide gas-phase sequencing were carried out by the Tripartite Microanalytical Center at the University of Victoria. The Rim 3F4 antibody was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 2B at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml of packed beads (20Molday L.L. Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18690-18695Google Scholar). The 220-kDa rim protein was purified by incubating 1 mg of ROS membranes, solubilized in 0.5 ml of 18 mM CHAPS or 1% Triton X-100 in 0.02 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, with 50 μl of Rim 3F4-Sepharose 2B beads at 4°C for 1 h. The unbound fraction was isolated by low speed centrifugation through an Ultrafree filter unit (Millipore Corp.); the beads were then washed twice with 0.5 ml of solubilization buffer. Finally, the bound protein was released from the beads with 0.1 ml of solubilization buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml 3F4 peptide. For endoglycosidase treatment, 100 μl of ROS membranes solubilized in 10 mM CHAPS, 0.02 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2 was treated with endoglycosidase Hf (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The 220-kDa rim protein was photoaffinity labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (ICN; 15 Ci/mmol) using a modified procedure of Shuster et al. (19Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Farber D.B. Exp. Eye. Res. 1988; 46: 647-655Google Scholar). The reaction was performed under dim red light in 25 μl of 0.02 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM ZnCl2, and 0.5 mM MgCl2, 3 μM 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of ROS membranes or approximately 20 ng of Triton X-100 solubilized immunoaffinity purified 220-kDa rim protein with or without the competing nucleotide. The samples were irradiated for 5 min with ultraviolet light (Mineralight UV Lamp; 254 nm) at a distance of 3 cm, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of SDS buffer for SDS-gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to either x-ray film or a phosphoimaging screen. Phosphoimages were analyzed quantitatively by normalizing the intensity of the bands relative to the sample which contained no competitive nucleotide. A glutathione S-transferase fusion peptide containing the C-terminal 128 amino acids of the 220-kDa rim protein was first used to localize the epitope for the Rim 3F4 antibody. This was carried out by subcloning a BamHI/XhoI fragment of clone λ4 (nucleotides 6458-7609) into pGEX-I (Pharmacia) for expression in Escherichia coli (27Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar); antibody binding was detected by Western blotting. To more precisely map the epitope of the Rim 3F4 antibody, peptides (9 amino acids long, 2 amino acid overlap) spanning the C-terminal 128 amino acids were synthesized using the Epitope Scanning Kit (Cambridge Research Biochemicals) for analysis by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. The 3F4 peptide corresponding to amino acids 2252-62 of the rim protein was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (28Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (5Molday R.S. Molday L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2589-2601Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon membranes using the buffer system of Towbin et al (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). The membranes were labeled with the Rim 3F4 or PrimT1 antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit Ig-F(ab′)2 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Alternatively, blots were labeled with concanavalin A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). In either case binding was detected using the ECL system (Amersham). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). For light microscopy, cryosections of bovine retina were labeled with Rim 3F4 or PrimT1 antibodies followed by goat anti-mouse Ig or goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or Cy3 (8Hsu S-C. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21745-21752Google Scholar). In control studies Rim 3F4 antibody labeling was carried out in the presence of excess 3F4 peptide (0.1 mg/ml). For electron microscopy, glutaraldehyde-fixed, LR-White resin embedded bovine retina sections were labeled with the purified PrimT1 antibody overnight and subsequently labeled with 10-nm diameter goat anti-rabbit Ig-gold (12Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 352-362Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody Rim 3F4 and polyclonal antibody PrimT1 were used as probes to clone, characterize, and localize the major 220-kDa protein of bovine ROS membranes. The specificity of these antibodies is shown by Western blotting in Fig. 1. Both antibodies labeled a single protein having an apparent molecular weight of 220,000 in both ROS membranes and the flow-through (unbound fraction) obtained when Triton X-100 solubilized ROS membranes were passed through a DEAE anion exchange column. The labeled protein co-migrated with the prominent Coomassie Blue-stained 220-kDa protein present in both samples. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies PMe 2D9 against the 230-kDa Na/Ca-K exchanger (21Reid D.M. Molday L.L. Mikelberg F. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthal. & Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 78Google Scholar) and PMs 4B2 against the 240-kDa β-subunit of the cGMP-gated channel (20Molday L.L. Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18690-18695Google Scholar, 30Körschen H.G. Illing M. Seifert R. Sesti F. Williams A. Gotzes S. Colville C. Muller F. Dosé A. Molday L.L. Godde M. Molday R.S. Kaupp U.B. Neuron. 1995; 15: 627-636Google Scholar) each labeled a high molecular mass polypeptide in ROS membranes, but not in the unbound DEAE fraction (Fig. 1). The 220-kDa protein was cloned by initially screening an oligo(dT)-primed bovine retinal cDNA expression library with the PrimT1 antibody. Of the six cDNA clones isolated in the initial screen, the longest clone (λ2) was 1.8 kb in length and had a polyadenylation signal and a poly(A) tail. Rescreening of the oligo(dT)-primed library and a random primed retinal cDNA library with oligonucleotide probes resulted in the isolation of several overlapping clones (Fig. 2). Upstream clone (p114) contained an ATG start codon with an adjacent upstream Kozak consensus sequence (31Kozak M. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence immediately downstream from this ATG coded for an amino acid sequence that was identical to that determined by direct N-terminal sequencing of the isolated 220-kDa protein (see below). The overlapping clones contained an open reading frame of 6843 base pairs that encodes a protein of 2280 amino acids having a calculated molecular mass of 257,000 daltons (Fig. 3). The predicted amino acid sequence consists of two structurally related, tandemly arranged halves: each half of the protein has a cluster of hydrophobic segments followed by a conserved ATP-binding cassette (32Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar). Hydropathy profiles (33Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) predict at least 12 transmembrane segments, six in each half of the protein. Fourteen consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation are present (Fig. 3). Data base homology searches indicate that the ROS 220-kDa protein is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily. Overall, it is 40-50% identical in amino acid sequence to the ABC1 and ABC2 proteins from a mouse macrophage cell line (34Luciani M-F. Denizot F. Savary S. Mattei M.G. Chimini G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 150-159Google Scholar) and 37% identical to ABC-C, a putative transporter recently cloned from a human medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line (35Klugbauer N. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 61-65Google Scholar). The ABC-binding domains of these proteins display an even higher degree of identity (>60%), particularly within the two short stretches of the Walker motifs and the active transport signature located upstream of the Walker B pattern (32Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar). The ROS 220-kDa protein is more distantly related to other well studied members of the ABC transporter superfamily such as the cystic fibrosis transregulator and the multi-drug resistance protein (MDR1 P-glycoprotein), showing a sequence identity of 20-22% overall and 20-26% for the ABC domains. A 43% sequence identity is observed between the N- and C-terminal ABC domains of the bovine ROS 220-kDa protein, a value similar to that between the two cassettes within ABC1 and MDR1 P-glycoprotein. However, a high degree of conservation is found for the C-terminal ABC domain from different mammalian ROS 220-kDa proteins; for example, the bovine and human proteins are 94% identical in this region. 2M. Illing, I. Nassonkin, and R. S. Molday, unpublished results. The size of the mRNA transcripts for the 220-kDa protein was estimated by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 4, an EcoRI/SacI fragment from clone p41 (see Fig. 2) hybridized to transcripts of ∼9.5 and 6.8 kb in length. An upstream fragment from clone p55 gave a similar labeling pattern (data not shown). Peptide sequences of the 220-kDa ROS protein were obtained to confirm that the cDNA clones code for the protein sequence of the major 220-kDa protein of bovine ROS membranes. The N-terminal 18 amino acids of the immunoaffinity purified 220-kDa protein was found to be identical to a sequence derived from clone p114 and immediately downstream from a methionine (Fig. 3). Mild trypsin digestion of the 220-kDa protein in ROS membranes followed by purification on a Rim 3F4 antibody affinity column resulted in two large peptide fragments having apparent molecular masses of 120 and 115 kDa (see Fig. 8). The N-terminal sequence of the 120-kDa fragment was identical to the N-terminal sequence of the full-length 220-kDa, whereas the sequence of the 115-kDa fragment was identical to a sequence starting at position 1311, close to the middle of the 220-kDa protein (Fig. 3). These results indicate that mild trypsin digestion cuts the 220-kDa protein essentially in half, producing tryptic fragments corresponding to two homologous domains. Trypsin digestion has also been reported to split MDR1 P-glycoprotein into two homologous halves (36Georges E. Zhang J.-T. Ling V. J. Cell Physiol. 1991; 148: 479-484Google Scholar). In addition, nine smaller peptide fragments were derived from trypsin and/or endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of the purified, detergent-solubilized 220-kDa protein. The N-terminal sequences of these peptides were identical to sequences found within the 220-kDa protein sequence deduced from cDNA cloning (Fig. 3). The sequence of peptide number 21 was of particular interest. Although 36 of the 37 amino acids of this peptide correspond to positions 1564-1600 of the full-length 220-kDa protein sequence, the amino acid at position 23 of the peptide sequence (position 1586 of the 220-kDa sequence) could not be identified. Since this residue is an Asn that is part of a N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence, it is likely that this residue is covalently modified with an oligosaccharide chain, and therefore, not identifiable by sequencing. Further evidence that the immunoaffinity purified 220-kDa protein is the same as the protein encoded by the cloned cDNA was obtained from amino acid analysis. In general, the experimentally determined amino acid composition of the purified 220-kDa protein is within 15% of the amino acid composition determined from the deduced protein sequence (data not shown). The 220-kDa protein could be efficiently purified from detergent-solubilized ROS by immunoaffinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 5A, the 220-kDa protein was quantitatively adsorbed to a Rim 3F4-Sepharose column and eluted with an 11 amino acid peptide corresponding to the Rim 3F4 epitope localized near the C terminus of the protein (see Fig. 3). No other prominent proteins in the immunoaffinity purified sample were detected on SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Concanavalin A labeling and endoglycosidase H digestion were carried out to determine if the ROS 220-kDa protein is glycosylated. As shown in Fig. 5A, concanavalin A labeled the 220-kDa protein in both ROS membranes (lane a) and immunoaffinity purified preparations (lane c). Monomeric and oligomeric forms of rhodopsin were also labeled with concanavalin A in ROS membranes (lane a) and in the unbound fraction from the affinity column (lane b). The immunoaffinity purified 220-kDa protein fraction, however, appears to be largely free of rhodopsin. Endoglycosidase H digestion was carried out to further evaluate the extent to which the 220-kDa protein is glycosylated. As shown in Fig. 5B, only a slight increase in mobility of the 220-kDa protein was observed after treatment with endoglycosidase H. These results indicate that the 220-kDa protein contains at least one N-linked oligosaccharide chain, but it is unlikely to be highly glycosylated. Photoaffinity labeling was carried out to determine if the putative ATP-binding domains of the 220-kDa protein bind nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 6A, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP covalently labeled the 220-kDa protein in both ROS membranes and immunoaffinity purified preparations. Labeling could be largely inhibited by the addition of 1 mM cold ATP or 1 mM GTP (Fig. 6, A and B). These studies are in agreement with the earlier studies of Shuster et al (19Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Farber D.B. Exp. Eye. Res. 1988; 46: 647-655Google Scholar) indicating that a high molecular weight polypeptide in ROS is covalently labeled by this reagent. Inhibition studies were carried out to determine the binding specificity of the ROS 220-kDa protein for ATP and GTP. As shown in Fig. 6B both ATP and GTP inhibited 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP labeling. Half-maximum inhibition occurred at a slightly lower GTP concentration (∼70 μM) than ATP concentration (∼95 μM), in general agreement with an earlier study (19Shuster T.A. Nagy A.K. Farber D.B. Exp. Eye. Res. 1988; 46: 647-655Google Scholar). These results further support the view that the ROS 220-kDa protein is an ABC transporter capable of binding both ATP and GTP. The distribution of the 220-kDa protein in retina tissue was examined using immunocytochemical labeling methods. The Rim 3F4 antibody labeled the outer segments of rod, but not cone, photoreceptor cells in bovine retinal cryosections (Fig. 7A). Weak staining was observed in the inner segment layer, but no staining was det"
https://openalex.org/W1969676666,"The lls1 (lethal leaf spot1) locus of maize is defined by a recessive mutation characterized by the initiation, in a developmentally programmed manner, of necrotic lesions that expand to kill leaves cell autonomously. The loss-of-function nature of all lls1 mutants implies that the Lls1 gene is required to limit the spread of cell death in mature leaves. We have cloned the Lls1 gene by tagging with Mutator, a transposable element system in maize, and we show that it encodes a novel protein highly conserved in plants. Two consensus binding motifs of aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases are present in the predicted LLS1 protein, suggesting that it may function to degrade a phenolic mediator of cell death."

Mutant muscles in vivo showed significantly impaired tetanic force output, increased relaxation times, altered mitochondrial volume and location, and conspicuous tubular aggregates of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, as seen in myopathies with electrolyte disturbances. In depolarized myotubes cultured in vitro, CK absence influenced both the release and sequestration of Ca2+.

The complex appears to recapitulate vesicle docking interactions of proteins originating from distinct compartments, since syntaxin 5, rbet1, and GOS-28 localize to Golgi membranes, whereas mouse sec22b and membrin accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein interactions in the complex are dramatically rearranged by N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. The complex consists of two or more subcomplexes with some members (rat sec22b and syntaxin 5) in common and others (rbet1 and GOS-28) mutually exclusively associated.

https://openalex.org/W2068143425,"Overexpression of the Escherichia coli msbB gene on high copy plasmids suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth associated with mutations in thehtrB gene. htrB encodes the lauroyl transferase of lipid A biosynthesis that acylates the intermediate (Kdo)2-lipid IVA (Brozek, K.

In contrast to htrB, extracts of strains with insertion mutations in msbB are not defective in transferring laurate from lauroyl acyl carrier protein to (Kdo)2-lipid IVA. However, extracts ofmsbB mutants do not efficiently acylate the product formed by HtrB, designated (Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-lipid IVA.

Presumably, the acyloxyacyl group generated by excess MsbB substitutes for the one normally formed by HtrB. The htrB gene was first described by Karow and Georgopoulos (1Karow M. Fayet O.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as essential for rapid growth of Escherichia coli on nutrient broth above 33 °C. At elevated temperatures, peculiar morphological changes are observed inhtrB-deficient strains, including bulging of the cell surface and filamentation (1Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol.

At permissive temperatures,htrB mutants display increased resistance to bile salts (3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on these phenotypes, Karow and Georgopoulos (1Karow M. Fayet O. Cegielska A. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Karow M. Fayet O.

We have recently demonstrated (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that the htrB gene ofE. coli encodes the lauroyl transferase that acylates the key lipid A biosynthesis intermediate (Kdo 1The abbreviation used is: Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid. )2-lipid IVA(7Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This conclusion is based on assays of extracts prepared from htrB-deficient mutants, in which lauroyl transferase activity is undetectable (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Conversely, cells overexpressing thehtrB gene on hybrid plasmids overproduce the transferase several hundredfold (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have purified the overproduced enzyme to homogeneity and have shown by N-terminal sequencing thathtrB is indeed the structural gene for the lauroyl transferase. 2S. Carty and C. R. H. Raetz, manuscript in preparation. Identification of htrBas the lauroyl transferase is further supported by fatty acid analyses of lipopolysaccharide isolated from htrB-deficient strains of E. coli, in which the amount of laurate is reduced (4Karow M. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7407-7418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid A from htrB-deficient Hemophilus influenzaeis also under-acylated (8Lee N.-G. Sunshine M.G. Engstrom J.J. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27151-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Karow and Georgopoulos (3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) identified several genes that, when introduced on hybrid plasmids, suppress the temperature-sensitive growth associated with htrB mutations. The msbAsuppressor encodes a putative transport protein with a remarkable similarity to the mammalian mdr genes (5Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Most Mdr proteins pump hydrophobic drugs out of animal cells, but some are involved in secretion of phospholipids into bile (9Oude-Elferink R.P.J. Ottenhoff R. van Wijland M. Smit J.J.M. Schinkel A.H. Groen A.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 31-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biochemical function of msbA is unknown, the sequence similarity ofmsbA to mdr suggests that MsbA might be involved in a translocation process, such as the movement of newly made lipid A from the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane to the periplasm (10Osborn M.J. Inouye M. Bacterial Outer Membranes. Wiley Interscience, New York1979: 15-34Google Scholar, 11Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). Whatever its role, the msbA gene is essential for growth (5Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A second suppressor gene, designated msbB, was found to have 27.5% sequence identity and 42.2% similarity to htrB (3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) suggesting a biochemical function related to htrB. MsbBreverses the temperature sensitivity associated with htrBmutations when introduced on plasmids that are maintained at high copy number (3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The msbB gene itself is not essential for growth (3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MsbB knockouts greatly reduce the amount of myristate attached lipid A, but they do not affect the laurate content (13Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Bainbridge B. Cunningham M.D. Darveau R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide isolated from msbB mutants contains penta-acylated lipid A (designated (Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-lipid IVA in Fig. 1) (13Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Bainbridge B. Cunningham M.D. Darveau R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). MsbB was discovered independently by Somerville et al. (13Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Bainbridge B. Cunningham M.D. Darveau R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), who found that whole E. coli cells harboring msbB insertions are orders of magnitude less immunostimulatory than are wild-type cells. Using direct enzymatic assays, we now demonstrate that themsbB gene of E. coli encodes a distinct, late-functioning acyltransferase of lipid A assembly (7Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MsbB functions optimally after laurate incorporation by HtrB has taken place (Fig. 1). The slow, but significant, rate at which MsbB acylates (Kdo)2-lipid IVA explains whymsbB + works only as a high multi-copy suppressor of htrB mutations (3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our findings support the view that at least one acyloxyacyl residue must be present on a significant fraction of the lipid A moieties of E. coli to allow rapid growth above 33 °C.

(Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was synthesized from lauroyl-ACP and (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA using a DEAE-Sepharose purified HtrB that was isolated from anmsbB-deficient strain (MLK1067) containing thehtrB overexpressing plasmid, pKS12 (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The preparative reaction contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 μm (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (2 × 103 dpm/nmol), 50 μm lauroyl-ACP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 8 μg of lauroyl transferase (specific activity, 2200 nmol × min−1 × mg−1) per ml. The total reaction volume was 150 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was applied as a single line onto a 20 × 20-cm Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate. After air drying, the plate was developed to the top in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v). The product was detected by a brief autoradiography, and the region of the silica plate containing the desired, more rapidly migrating product was scraped off into a scintered glass funnel. The silica chips were washed once with 4 ml of chloroform. The product, (Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, was then eluted with three 3.8-ml portions of a single phase, acidic Bligh and Dyer solvent mixture consisting of chloroform, methanol, 0.1 m HCl (1:2:0.8, v/v) (22Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7837-7844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluted material (12 ml) was converted to a two-phase, acidic Bligh and Dyer system by the addition of 3 ml each of chloroform and 0.1 mHCl. The tube was mixed vigorously, and the phases were separated by a brief centrifugation. The lower phase was transferred to a new glass tube, and 18 drops of pyridine were added before the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. The dried lipid was resuspended in 10 mm Tris chloride, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmEDTA. It was stored at −80 °C and was resuspended by brief (1 min) sonic irradiation prior to use. Acyl-ACPs containing various acyl chains were synthesized from the corresponding free fatty acids and acyl carrier protein using solubilized membranes from the acyl-ACP synthase overproducing strain,E. coli LCH109/pLCH5/pGP1-2, as described previously (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Crude cell-free extracts were made from 1–2 liters of logarithmically growing cultures. After harvesting by low speed centrifugation at 2 °C, cells were washed once in 30 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmEGTA (half the volume of the original culture). The washed cell pellet was resuspended in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA (a volume approximately equal to the volume of the cell pellet). Cells were broken using an ice-cold French pressure cell (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 20,000 psi. The broken cell suspension was adjusted to 10 mmMgSO4, and DNase I was added to 1 μg/ml. After a brief sonic irradiation on an ice water bath to decrease the viscosity, the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Membranes and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was centrifuged a second time to remove residual contaminating membranes. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of 30 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmEGTA, and it was centrifuged again as above to generate the final, washed membrane fraction (∼40 mg/ml). The membrane suspension was stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as the standard (23Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). HtrB-catalyzed acylation was assayed using Method I described earlier (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In most cases, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 μm (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (∼2 × 103 dpm/nmol), 25 μm lauroyl-ACP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1–1000 μg/ml enzyme at 30 °C in a final volume of 10–20 μl. With highly purified preparations of HtrB, enzyme stability is increased by including 50 mm NaCl and 5 mmMgCl2 in the assay mixture (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The MsbB-catalyzed acylation of the product generated by HtrB, designated (Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA, was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Unless otherwise indicated, 25 μm(Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (∼2 × 103 dpm/nmol) was used as the acceptor, and 25 μm myristoyl-ACP was the donor. Under these conditions, MsbB displays a slight kinetic preference for myristoyl-ACP over lauroyl-ACP. MsbB functions about 100-fold more rapidly with (Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-[4′-32P]lipid IVA than with (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the acceptor. Since studies using partially purified MsbB showed a stabilizing effect of sodium chloride, 50 mm NaCl was also included in the reaction in some experiments. MgCl2inhibited MsbB slightly. Reactions were stopped by spotting a 4–5-μl sample onto a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate. After air drying and developing the thin layer chromatography plate in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (30:70:16:10, v/v), the plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. The amount of radioactivity present in the labeled spots corresponding to substrate and product were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Imager. The specific activity of both HtrB and MsbB was expressed in terms of nmol/min/mg protein. Cells were grown and labeled by the method of Galloway and Raetz (24Galloway S.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6394-6402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with several modifications. Briefly, bacteria from 30 °C overnight cultures were inoculated into 20 ml of fresh LB broth and grown for several hours at 30 °C until A 600 had reached ∼0.1. Next, two 5.0-ml portions of each culture were transferred into two new culture tubes, and 32Pi (5 μCi/ml) was added to both. One was grown for 3 h at 30 °C, and the other was grown for 3 h at 42 °C. 32P-Labeled cells were washed twice with 5.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 0.8 ml of the same buffer. Washed cells were extracted at room temperature for 60 min with a single phase Bligh and Dyer mixture, formed by the addition of 2 ml of methanol and 1 ml of chloroform. After centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge at top speed for 20 min, the pellets were recovered and washed once with 5.0 ml of a single phase of Bligh and Dyer mixture, consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8, v/v). The pellets were resuspended in 3.6 ml of 0.2 m HCl by sonic irradiation in a bath. The resuspended pellets were incubated at 100 °C for 90 min. The acid-hydrolyzed material was converted to a two-phase Bligh and Dyer system by addition of 4 ml of chloroform and 4 ml of methanol. After centrifugation at low speed, the upper phases were removed, and the lower phases were washed twice with 4.0 ml of pre-equilibrated acidic upper phase of a two-phase Bligh and Dyer system, generated by mixing chloroform, methanol, 0.2 m HCl (2:2:1.8, v/v). The washed lower phases were dried under a nitrogen stream. The lipid A 4′-monophosphates were redissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v), and approximately 1000 cpm of the samples was applied to each lane of a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate. The plate was developed in the solvent of chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v). The plate was dried and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen. Extracts of strains bearinghtrB mutations do not catalyze lauroyl-ACP-dependent acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, as shown in Fig. 2 by the absence of (Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-lipid IVA formation (producta in lane 2). The transfer of laurate from lauroyl-ACP to (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was efficient in extracts of strains harboring an insertion in msbB (Fig. 2, lane 6), as in the wild type (Fig. 2, lane 4). A similar pattern was observed when myristoyl-ACP was substituted for lauroyl-ACP (not shown), except that the initial rates of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVAacylation were 5–10-fold slower with myristoyl-ACP, given the selectivity of HtrB for laurate (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In crude extracts or membrane preparations from wild-type cells one observes two distinct acylations of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (7Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With lauroyl-ACP as the donor, the first acylation is relatively rapid compared with the second (7Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With myristoyl-ACP, the first acylation is 5–10-fold slower than with lauroyl-ACP, but the second acylation is slightly faster than with lauroyl-ACP (7Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that purified HtrB catalyzes only one rapid acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it seemed plausible that MsbB might encode the second acyltransferase (Fig. 1) that we previously observed in cell extracts (7Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15410-15417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To approach this problem, we initially incubated membranes of wild-type cells that overexpress either htrB + ormsbB + with (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA and lauroyl-ACP. As shown in Fig. 3, panel B,overexpression of htrB + in the presence ofmsbB + on the chromosome resulted in very rapid formation and accumulation of a monoacylated product at the relatively low extract concentrations employed (4 μg/ml). Alternatively, overexpression of msbB + in the presence ofhtrB + on the chromosome (Fig. 3, panel A) did not increase the overall extent of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVAacylation compared with wild-type (hence the need to use 100 μg/ml membranes), but it did result in the accumulation of the diacylated material (product b) at the expense of the monoacylated product a. The difference between HtrB and MsbB overproduction in a wild-type background is especially apparent when comparing the product distribution at the 40-min time point inpanel A of Fig. 3 (excess MsbB) to the 10-min time point inpanel B of Fig. 3 (excess HtrB). In both cases the conversion of substrate to product is similar (∼30%), but diacylated material is generated in strains overproducing MsbB, whereas monoacylated product is formed when HtrB is overproduced. The results of Fig. 3 provide support for the idea that MsbB catalyzes the second acylation and can use lauroyl-ACP as the donor under the in vitro assay conditions employed. To evaluate further the function of MsbB and its relationship to HtrB, we prepared membranes from strains of msbB orhtrB-deficient cells overexpressing htrB andmsbB, respectively (6Clementz T. Bednarski J.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12095-12102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this way, we could study cell extracts that contained only one or the other enzyme. As shown in Fig. 4, panel A, membranes of strain MLK53/pBS233 (containing only msbB +) did not catalyze any measurable acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA under the conditions employed. Membranes of cells containing only HtrB (Fig.4, panel B) catalyzed mainly the formation of producta. In Fig. 4, panel A, the (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA and acyl-ACP were first preincubated for 60 min with 10 μg/ml membranes of MLK53/pBS233. At time 0, a second 60-min incubation was started. Samples were then withdrawn during the second incubation period for product analysis at the indicated times. In Fig. 4, panels Band C, membranes of strain MLK1067/pKS12 (containing onlyhtrB +) were preincubated for 60 min with (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA and acyl-ACP to generate significant amounts of (Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (product a). At time 0, only a small volume of buffer was added to the reaction mixture in panel B. Inpanel C, a 10 μg/ml portion of membranes of MLK53/pBS233 (containing only msbB +) was added at time 0. The incubations were continued for another 60 min and analyzed as inpanel A. The system containing only HtrB (panel B) catalyzed the formation of more product a, whereas the system containing both HtrB and MsbB (panel C) resulted in very rapid accumulation of the diacylated product bderived from product a. These findings show that MsbB functions efficiently only after HtrB-catalyzed acylation of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA has taken place (Fig. 4, panel A compared with panel C). A direct assay for MsbB was developed using 25 μm(Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the acceptor and 25 μm acyl-ACP as the donor (see “Experimental Procedures”). Acylation was detected by thin layer chromatography and PhosphorImager analysis as in Fig. 4. With the direct assay, the specific activity of MsbB in extracts of wild-type cells was ∼0.3 nmol/min/mg, but in extracts ofmsbB-deficient mutants, the activity was below the limits of detection (∼0.03 nmol/min/mg). Overexpression ofmsbB + on multi-copy hybrid plasmids resulted in ∼100-fold higher specific activity of MsbB in cell extracts or membranes compared with wild-type, as shown in Table II. The large size of the observed effects on MsbB-specific activity supports the proposal that msbB is the structural gene encoding the MsbB acyltransferase.Table IIPurification of MsbB from E. coli MLK53/pBS233Total volumeTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldmlmgnmol × min−1 × mg−1%Membranes5.020827100Triton X-100 extract24846596Triton X-100-insoluble5.0903.66DEAE-Sepharose1.55.164057Myristoyl transferase activities were assayed in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 25 μm myristoyl-ACP, and 25 μm(Kdo)2-[lauroyl]-[4′-32P]-lipid IVA (2 × 103 dpm/nmol) at 30 °C.

https://openalex.org/W1972303909,"We examine transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling at the PHO5 promoter in yeast by fusion proteins that are thought to act by recruiting the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme to DNA in the absence of a classic activating region. These hybrid proteins (e.g., Gal11+Pho4 or Gal4(58-97)+Pho4 in the presence of a GAL11P allele) efficiently activated transcription and remodeled chromatin. Similar chromatin remodeling was observed at a PHO5 promoter deleted for TATA and thus unable to support transcription. We conclude that recruitment of the holoenzyme or associated proteins suffices for chromatin remodeling. We also show that the SWI/SNF complex is required neither for efficient transcription of the wild-type PHO5 nor the GAL1 promoters, and we observe nearly complete chromatin remodeling at PHO5 in the absence of Snf2."
https://openalex.org/W2052748706,"Site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibodies are useful to analyze spatiotemporal distribution of site-specific phosphorylation of target proteins in vivo. Using several polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that can specifically recognize four phosphorylated sites on glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), we have previously reported that Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-34 on this intermediate filament protein are phosphorylated at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. This observation suggests that there exists a protein kinase named cleavage furrow kinase specifically activated at metaphase-anaphase transition (Matsuoka, Y., Nishizawa, K., Yano, T., Shibata, M., Ando, S., Takahashi, T., and Inagaki, M.

Here we report that GFAP is phosphorylated specifically at Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-34 by Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), which binds to the small GTPase Rho in its GTP-bound active form.

This IF reorganization is thought to be regulated by site-specific phosphorylation of IF proteins at serine and threonine residues, and several protein kinases have been shown to act as IF kinases in vivo (for review, see Ref. 4Inagaki M.

Recently, we reported two distinct types of mitotic phosphorylation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an IF protein expressed in the cytoplasm of astroglia, using antibodies that react with four distinct phosphorylated sites on GFAP (7Matsuoka Y.

One type is the phosphorylation of Ser-8 on GFAP, which appeared at G2-M phase transition in the entire cytoplasm. The other type is the phosphorylation of Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-34, which appeared at metaphase-anaphase transition at the cleavage furrow. This GFAP phosphorylation specifically localized at the cleavage furrow was observed not only in astroglial cells but also in other cultured cells transfected with GFAP cDNA (8Sekimata M. Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Takeuchi Y. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings suggested the existence of a protein kinase specifically activated at the cleavage furrow and its important role in cytokinesis. We tentatively termed this kinase cleavage furrow (CF) kinase (8Sekimata M. Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Takeuchi Y. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. J.

Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Recently, Rho was shown to play a critical role in cytokinesis by inducing and maintaining the contractile ring, an actin-based cytoskeletal structure (18Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Mabuchi I. Hamaguchi Y. Fujimoto H. Morii N. Mishima M. Narumiya S. Zygote. 1993; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho was reported to be translocated from the cytosol to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (20Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that Rho may also be implicated in the regulation of CF kinase and thereby in the efficient separation of IFs to daughter cells. As a first step toward defining this possibility, we have examined whether protein kinase N and/or Rho-kinase can phosphorylate GFAP at the same sites as CF kinase. Protein kinase N was found to phosphorylate GFAP mainly at Ser-8, a site that is not phosphorylated by CF kinase. 2K. Matsuzawa, H. Kosako, N. Inagaki, M. Amano, Y. Nishi, H. Mukai, Y. Ono, Y.

In this report, we show that GFAP can serve as an excellent substrate for Rho-kinase and that the GFAP phosphorylation by Rho-kinase prevents its filament formation in vitro. Furthermore, we present evidence that Rho-kinase phosphorylates GFAP at Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-34 in vitro, the same sites that are phosphorylated by CF kinase in vivo. Recombinant human GFAP was prepared fromEscherichia coli as described previously (8Sekimata M. Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Takeuchi Y. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. J.

Rho-kinase was purified from bovine brain (13Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

Constitutively active GST-Rho-kinase, a GST fusion protein of the catalytic fragment of Rho-kinase, was purified from Sf9 cells as described previously (15Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y.

The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) was prepared from bovine heart by the method of Beavo et al. (23Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cdc2 kinase was prepared from FM3A cells by the method of Kusubata et al. (24Kusubata M. Tokui T. Matsuoka Y.

Protein concentrations were measured according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (210811) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The phosphorylation reaction for Rho-kinase was performed for 30 min at 25 °C in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.2% CHAPS, 4 mmMgCl2, 3.6 mm EDTA, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi), 0.1 μm calyculin A, 130 μg/ml GFAP, and 0.5 μg/ml purified Rho-kinase in the presence of GST, GDP·GST-RhoA, or GTPγS·GST-RhoA (each 1 μm). The phosphorylation reaction for GST-Rho-kinase, protein kinase A, or Cdc2 kinase was performed for 30 min at 25 °C in 100 μl of the reaction mixture (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.4 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 0.1 μm calyculin A, and 130 μg/ml GFAP) in the presence of 8.5 μg/ml GST-Rho-kinase, 5 μg/ml protein kinase A, or 0.5 μg/ml Cdc2 kinase. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling. GFAP (130 μg) was incubated with GST-Rho-kinase (8.5 μg) and [γ-32P]ATP (50 μCi) for 120 min at 25 °C in 1 ml of the reaction mixture described above. The phosphorylated GFAP was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and digested with 5 μg of lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 4m urea at 30 °C for 2 h. The phosphorylated head domain of GFAP was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and treated with 1/50 (w/w) l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma), as described by Tsujimura et al. (26Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Ando S. Matsuoka Y. Kusubata M. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The obtained peptides were separated by HPLC on a Zorbax C8 (0.46 × 25 cm) column equilibrated with 5% (v/v) 2-propanol/acetonitrile (7:3) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was carried out with a 60-min linear gradient of 5–50% 2-propanol/acetonitrile followed by a further 10-min linear gradient of 50–80% 2-propanol/acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. All the procedures for immunoblotting have been described elsewhere in detail (8Sekimata M. Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Takeuchi Y. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Yano T. Taura C. Shibata M. Hirono Y. Ando S. Kusubata M. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (8Sekimata M. Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Takeuchi Y. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences were analyzed with an ABI 476A gas-phase sequencer. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (27Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was carried out as described (28Inagaki M. Gonda Y. Nishizawa K. Kitamura S. Sato C. Ando S. Tanabe K. Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Nishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4722-4729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently developed four monoclonal antibodies, YC10 (21Yano T. Taura C. Shibata M. Hirono Y. Ando S. Kusubata M. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), KT13, KT34, and MO389 (8Sekimata M. Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Takeuchi Y. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) against four distinct phosphopeptides corresponding to the partial amino acid sequences of porcine GFAP. YC10, KT13, and KT34 react with GFAP phosphorylated at Ser-8, Ser-13, and Ser-34, respectively. MO389 reacts with both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GFAPs and stains filamentous structures in both mitotic and interphase cells. MO389 immunostained an intricate mesh of glial filaments in the entire cytoplasm of both metaphase and anaphase cells, but YC10 stained filamentous structures throughout the cytoplasm of metaphase but not anaphase cells (Fig.1 A). In contrast, the immunoreactivities of KT13 and KT34 were observed specifically between the daughter nuclei and at the cleavage furrow of anaphase cells (Fig. 1 A). Immunocytochemical studies with KT13 (Fig. 1 B) and KT34 (data not shown) using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that GFAP phosphorylated at Ser-13 and Ser-34 is associated with the cleavage furrow to form a ring-like structure but not a disc-like structure, such as the telophase disc reported by Andreassen et al. (29Andreassen P.R. Palmer D.K. Wener M.H. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 523-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To search for the putative CF kinase responsible for the cleavage furrow-specific phosphorylation described above, we examined whether Rho-kinase purified from bovine brain can phosphorylate GFAP in vitro. The results indicated clearly that Rho-kinase phosphorylated GFAP in a GST-RhoA-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). GDP-bound GST-RhoA enhanced the phosphorylation of GFAP by Rho-kinase 13-fold, and GTPγS-bound GST-RhoA enhanced it 291-fold (Fig. 2 A). We then examined the phosphorylation sites on GFAP by Rho-kinase using the anti-phosphoGFAP antibodies described above. After the phosphorylation reaction, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with MO389, YC10, KT13, or KT34. As shown in Fig.2 B, Rho-kinase phosphorylated GFAP at Ser-13 and Ser-34 but not at Ser-8 in a GTPγS·GST-RhoA-dependent manner. We also used the constitutively active GST-Rho-kinase, a fusion protein between GST and the catalytic fragment of Rho-kinase produced in Sf9 cells by recombinant baculovirus infection. Analyses with the anti-phosphoGFAP antibodies revealed that GST-Rho-kinase also phosphorylated GFAP at Ser-13 and Ser-34 but not at Ser-8 (Fig.2 C). These results suggest that catalytic characteristics of GST-Rho-kinase are similar to those of native Rho-kinase activated by GTPγS·GST-RhoA. In contrast, the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylated all three serine residues, and Cdc2 kinase weakly phosphorylated only Ser-8 (Fig.2 C). To confirm phosphorylation sites on GFAP by Rho-kinase, GFAP (130 μg) was phosphorylated by GST-Rho-kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP to approximately 2.7 mol of phosphate/mol of GFAP (Fig. 3 A). The radioactive GFAP was then digested with lysyl endopeptidase to generate about a 6.5-kDa fragment consisting mainly of the amino-terminal head domain. Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10393) Google Scholar) revealed that all radioactivity associated with GFAP was retained in this 6.5-kDa head domain (Fig. 3 B). This phosphorylated head domain was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC, digested with trypsin, and then again subjected to reverse-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 4 A, three major radioactive peaks, R1 to R3, were obtained. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed the presence of phosphothreonine in R1 and phosphoserine in both R2 and R3 (Fig.4 B). Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that R1 was the peptide containing Thr-7, R2 was the peptide containing Ser-34, and R3 was the peptide containing Ser-13 (Fig. 4 A). Ethanethiol treatment of R2 and R3, a procedure that converts specifically phosphoserine into S-ethylcysteine (31Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorske E. Korte H. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), suggested that phosphates were located on Ser-34 and Ser-13, respectively (data not shown). Therefore, GFAP was shown to be phosphorylated at Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-34 by GST-Rho-kinase. By using a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated Thr-7, we have previously reported that Thr-7 is also phosphorylated at the cleavage furrow (7Matsuoka Y. Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Figure 4Phosphorylation of Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-34 on GFAP by GST-Rho-kinase. A, the phosphorylated 6.5-kDa fragment derived from GFAP was digested with trypsin and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three radioactive peaks (R1, R2, andR3) were analyzed with a gas-phase sequencer. The determined amino acid sequences of R1 (residues 5–11), R2 (residues 37–41), and R3 (residues 13–29) are indicated on the right. Note that we describe Ser-38 of human GFAP as Ser-34 because Ser-38 of human GFAP corresponds to Ser-34 of porcine GFAP. B, aliquots of R1, R2, and R3 in A were subjected to two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then examined the effect of phosphorylation of GFAP by Rho-kinase on the filament forming ability of GFAP. Soluble GFAP was preincubated with or without GST-Rho-kinase for 30 min, and the samples were incubated under conditions of polymerization (25 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 6.75, and 100 mm NaCl at 37 °C) (28Inagaki M. Gonda Y. Nishizawa K. Kitamura S. Sato C. Ando S. Tanabe K. Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Nishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4722-4729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for a further hour. Then the NaCl- and pH-dependent filament formation of GFAP in these samples was analyzed by centrifugation (Fig. 5 A) and electron microscopy (Fig. 5 B). As shown in Fig. 5, the phosphorylation of GFAP by GST-Rho-kinase resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of its filament formation. These results increase the possibility that GFAP phosphorylation at Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-34 during cytokinesis may induce the fragmentation of glial filaments at the cleavage furrow. In the present study, we obtained evidence that GFAP can serve as an excellent substrate for Rho-kinase in a GTP·Rho-dependent manner. So far, MBS (12Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar) and myosin (15Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y.

The phosphorylated GFAP lost its ability to form filaments in vitro. The in vitrophosphorylation sites on GFAP by Rho-kinase were Thr-7, Ser-13, and Ser-34, which are the same sites that CF kinase phosphorylates at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. We are considering that Rho-kinase may be CF kinase itself, and if so it may play an important role in the cleavage furrow-specific reorganization of IFs during cytokinesis. Because Rho-kinase was recently reported to act downstream of Rho in the regulation of myosin phosphorylation (12Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), Rho-kinase may also mediate the regulation of cytokinesis by Rho (18Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Mabuchi I. Hamaguchi Y. Fujimoto H. Morii N. Mishima M. Narumiya S. Zygote. 1993; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Whether Rho-kinase is activated during cytokinesis is the subject of ongoing studies. Because Rho-kinase belongs to a family of related serine/threonine kinases including myotonic dystrophy kinase, these kinases may phosphorylate the similar sites on GFAP. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the relationship between CF kinase and Rho-kinase or its family members. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful to Dr. H.

We report here the isolation and characterization of new cDNAs (<i>odf2</i>) that identifies a highly variable gene locus encoding outer dense fiber proteins. Transcription of <i>odf2</i> is restricted to testis and more specifically to round spermatids. Transcription starts in step 6 spermatids, which coincides with transcription of the major outer dense fiber protein gene <i>odf1</i> (Burmester, S., and Hoyer-Fender, S. (1996) <i>Mol. Reprod.

Affinity-purified anti-Odf2 antibodies identified isolated outer dense fibers immunocytochemically and detected at least three protein bands in the molecular mass range of 65,000 to 70,000 Da in total Odf protein preparations. Presence of several protein bands correlates with the presence of several transcripts and the isolation of slightly different cDNA clones, whereas Southern blot hybridization does not indicate the presence of multiple genes. Computer analyses of the structure of the encoded Odf2 protein revealed an overall α-helical structure with two regions identical to the dimerization region of the leucine zipper motif."
https://openalex.org/W2012000393,"Several Escherichia coli proteins participate in protein disulfide bond formation. Among them, DsbA is the primary factor that oxidizes target cysteines. Biochemical evidence indicates that DsbC has disulfide isomerization activity. To study intracellular functions of DsbA and DsbC, we used an alkaline phosphatase mutant, PhoA[SCCC], with the most amino-terminal cysteine replaced by serine. It was found that the remaining 3 cysteines in PhoA[SCCC] form a disulfide bond of incorrect as well as correct combinations. An aberrant disulfide bond was preferentially formed in wild-type cells, which was converted slowly to the normal disulfide bond. This conversion did not occur in the dsbC-disrupted cells. Overproduction of DsbC stimulated the formation of the correct disulfide bond. In contrast, the inefficiently formed disulfide bonds in the dsbA-disrupted cells, and the more efficiently formed disulfide bonds in the same strain in the presence of oxidized glutathione were mostly in the correct form. These results suggest that the DsbA-catalyzed reaction can be too rapid for some proteins. DsbA may simply oxidize available pairs of cysteines, which happen to be in an incorrect combination in the case of PhoA[SCCC].

Disulfide bonds are found in many extracytosolic proteins in all organisms and contribute to folding and stability of these proteins.

DsbC is a periplasmic protein with 4 cysteines among which Cys98 and Cys101 forms a thioredoxin-like motif. Creighton and his colleagues (16Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) characterized the redox activity of DsbC using a model substrate. They showed that while DsbA merely oxidized cysteines on the substrate, DsbC efficiently isomerized preformed disulfide bonds.Bacterial alkaline phosphatase, a periplasmic protein, is a dimer of the phoA gene product (PhoA) with two intramolecular disulfide bonds (Cys168-Cys178 and Cys286-Cys336) (17Bradshaw R.A. Cancedda F. Ericsson L.H. Neumann P.E. Piccoli S.P. Schlesinger M.J. Shriefer K. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond formation is essential for the correct folding of this enzyme (3Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J.

We found that, of the two disulfide bonds in PhoA, the carboxyl-terminal one (Cys286-Cys336) is required and sufficient for the active conformation of this enzyme (20Sone M. Kishigami S. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, a mutant form of PhoA, termed PhoA[SSCC], with the two NH2-terminally located cysteines replaced by serine is as active as the wild-type enzyme, although it is no longer resistant to a protease. Interestingly, the presence of an additional cysteine at residue 178 lowered the enzymatic activity significantly (20Sone M. Kishigami S. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We show here that this mutant PhoA, termed PhoA[SCCC], forms an aberrant disulfide bond among Cys178, Cys286, and Cys336.Using this unique experimental system, we investigated into thein vivo roles played by DsbA and DsbC. It was found that DsbA principally introduced an aberrant disulfide bond into PhoA[SCCC], whereas DsbC stimulated the eventual formation of the correct disulfide bond in vivo. Thus, DsbC functions, in concert with DsbA, as a disulfide isomerase in vivo.DISCUSSIONArtifacts in the determination of in vivo redox states of proteins can be minimized by examining them after acid denaturation (23Pollitt S. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the method employed in this study. Of the two disulfide bonds of PhoA, the amino-terminal disulfide (Cys168-Cys178) constrains a loop of only 9 amino acids, while the carboxyl-terminally located disulfide (Cys286-Cys336) constrains a loop of 49 amino acids. The fast migration of the oxidized PhoA in SDS-PAGE can essentially be ascribed to the Cys286-Cys336disulfide bond (Fig. 1). Since any incorrect disulfide bonds that can be formed in PhoA should connect cysteines that flank at least 107 amino acids (in the case of Cys178-Cys286), they are expected to confer even more increased mobility in gel electrophoresis. The ox2 species we observed in PhoA[SCCC] meets this expectation, although we have not determined whether it contains Cys178-Cys286 or Cys178-Cys336 disulfide bond.Why does PhoA[SCCC] form an aberrant disulfide bond in the presence of DsbA? Disulfide bond formation is essential for the folding of alkaline phosphatase in vivo (3Bardwell J.C.A. McGovern K. Beckwith J.

The fact that PhoA[SSCC] has almost 100% enzymatic activity (20Sone M. Kishigami S. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) indicates that the PhoA molecule without the NH2-terminal disulfide bond retains the ability to position the active site residues in proper geometry, but this event is incomplete until the carboxyl-terminal disulfide bond has been formed. In PhoA[SCCC], kinetic competition may occur between different combinations of the 3 cysteines for disulfide bond formation, and it should be modulated by ongoing folding reactions (28Frech C. Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11386-11395Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, extremely rapid disulfide bond formation may be more random than slower disulfide bond formation. Furthermore, DsbA may be so potent and efficient that it introduces or initiates to introduce a disulfide while a substrate polypeptide chain is still in the process of membrane translocation; the first translocating cysteine, Cys178, will be committed for disulfide bond formation when it reaches the periplasm and forms a transient disulfide with the reactive Cys30 residue (29Nelson J.W.

In contrast, “spontaneous” or glutathione-driven disulfide bond formation in the absence of DsbA will be less efficient and slower such that the correct combination is preferred due to the local folding properties of the polypeptide chain. DsbA-dependent formation of aberrant disulfide bonds was implicated previously (but not demonstrated) in a system where a foreign protein was expressed in E. coli (32Alksne L.E. Keenney D. Rasmussen B.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 462-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Alksne L.E. Rasmussen B.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4306-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We obtained two kinds of results that suggest that DsbC functions to stimulate the formation of the correct disulfide bond. First, slow conversion occurs from the aberrant to the correct disulfide bonds of pulse-labeled PhoA[SCCC] in wild-type cells, but not in thedsbC deletion strain. This observation clearly indicates that DsbC-dependent isomerization of disulfide bond occurs in the cell. Second, overproduction of DsbC in thedsbA + cells enhanced the rapid formation of the correct disulfide bond. This observation could be interpreted in terms of either very rapid isomerization in the presence of excess DsbC orde novo introduction of the correct disulfide bond in the presence of excess DsbC. In view of the biochemical demonstration of isomerization activity of DsbC (16Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we think it reasonable to assume the rapid isomerization. This is consistent with the observation (Fig.3, D and H) that DsbA is required for DsbC to exhibit the correct disulfide-introducing function.Recently, Rietsch et al. (34Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) reported in vivoresults that a dsbC disruption had no effect on OmpA (normally with a single disulfide bond), that it resulted in accumulation of a small amount of reduced PhoA 4Although these authors suggest that it was an aberrant form, we believe that it must have been the reduced form because of the discussion already given about the electrophoretic mobilities of PhoA. That it disappeared when the culture received dithiothreitol before pulse labeling (34Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) could be explained. For instance, if dithiothreitol can access the periplasm freely but iodoacetamide is somehow restricted, the low concentration of dithiothreitol might antagonize the action of iodoacetamide added after sampling, leaving free cysteines unmodified, which will then be oxidized after cell pelleting and solubilization in SDS. , and that it resulted in greatly diminished production of active urokinase (normally with 12 disulfide bonds). Although these results are consistent with their interpretation that DsbC has a disulfide isomerizing role in vivo, the evidence for the aberrant disulfide bond formation in the absence of DsbC was inconclusive.Our results provide some additional information about the DsbC functions in vivo. Excess DsbC was inhibitory against the background disulfide bond formation that occurs inefficiently in the absence of DsbA. Probably, the reducing character of DsbC might dominate the air oxidation. It was also found, however, that excess DsbC can exhibit DsbA-like function when GSSG was supplemented to the medium. This is consistent with another finding of Rietsch et al. (34Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) that the suppression of dsbA null mutation by loss-of-function dsbD (dipZ) mutations requires the functional DsbC. They proposed that DsbD (DipZ) together with thioredoxin normally keeps DsbC in the partially reduced state, and the loss of reducing factor leads to the production of oxidized DsbC, which in turn substitutes for DsbA. This model is consistent with our results; excess DsbC is oxidized by GSSG and then it substitutes for DsbA.We have now demonstrated that the principal role of DsbC is to facilitate disulfide bonds that are formed between correct pairs of cysteines. This demonstration was made possible by using a unique model protein, PhoA[SCCC]. The results of Rietsch et al. (34Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These in vivoresults establish that the cellular role of DsbC lies in the isomerization of disulfide bonds until the protein has been folded into a stable conformation. Disulfide bonds are found in many extracytosolic proteins in all organisms and contribute to folding and stability of these proteins. While disulfide bond formation is a simple reaction of oxidation of cysteine residues, and it can be reproduced in vitro under appropriate conditions (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5079) Google Scholar), recent studies established that it does not occur effectively in vivo without the aid of other proteins (2Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, a periplasmic protein, DsbA, is required for disulfide bond formation in vivo (3Bardwell J.C.A.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It directly oxidizes cysteines on the target proteins in vitro(5Zapun A. Creighton T.E.

Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DsbB, an integral membrane protein, is also required for the processes (8Bardwell J.C.A. Lee J.-O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) indicates that the PhoA molecule without the NH2-terminal disulfide bond retains the ability to position the active site residues in proper geometry, but this event is incomplete until the carboxyl-terminal disulfide bond has been formed. In PhoA[SCCC], kinetic competition may occur between different combinations of the 3 cysteines for disulfide bond formation, and it should be modulated by ongoing folding reactions (28Frech C. Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11386-11395Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, extremely rapid disulfide bond formation may be more random than slower disulfide bond formation. Furthermore, DsbA may be so potent and efficient that it introduces or initiates to introduce a disulfide while a substrate polypeptide chain is still in the process of membrane translocation; the first translocating cysteine, Cys178, will be committed for disulfide bond formation when it reaches the periplasm and forms a transient disulfide with the reactive Cys30 residue (29Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E.

In contrast, “spontaneous” or glutathione-driven disulfide bond formation in the absence of DsbA will be less efficient and slower such that the correct combination is preferred due to the local folding properties of the polypeptide chain. DsbA-dependent formation of aberrant disulfide bonds was implicated previously (but not demonstrated) in a system where a foreign protein was expressed in E. coli (32Alksne L.E. Keenney D. Rasmussen B.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 462-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Alksne L.E. Rasmussen B.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4306-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We obtained two kinds of results that suggest that DsbC functions to stimulate the formation of the correct disulfide bond. First, slow conversion occurs from the aberrant to the correct disulfide bonds of pulse-labeled PhoA[SCCC] in wild-type cells, but not in thedsbC deletion strain. This observation clearly indicates that DsbC-dependent isomerization of disulfide bond occurs in the cell. Second, overproduction of DsbC in thedsbA + cells enhanced the rapid formation of the correct disulfide bond. This observation could be interpreted in terms of either very rapid isomerization in the presence of excess DsbC orde novo introduction of the correct disulfide bond in the presence of excess DsbC. In view of the biochemical demonstration of isomerization activity of DsbC (16Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we think it reasonable to assume the rapid isomerization. This is consistent with the observation (Fig.3, D and H) that DsbA is required for DsbC to exhibit the correct disulfide-introducing function. Recently, Rietsch et al. (34Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) reported in vivoresults that a dsbC disruption had no effect on OmpA (normally with a single disulfide bond), that it resulted in accumulation of a small amount of reduced PhoA 4Although these authors suggest that it was an aberrant form, we believe that it must have been the reduced form because of the discussion already given about the electrophoretic mobilities of PhoA. That it disappeared when the culture received dithiothreitol before pulse labeling (34Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) could be explained. For instance, if dithiothreitol can access the periplasm freely but iodoacetamide is somehow restricted, the low concentration of dithiothreitol might antagonize the action of iodoacetamide added after sampling, leaving free cysteines unmodified, which will then be oxidized after cell pelleting and solubilization in SDS. , and that it resulted in greatly diminished production of active urokinase (normally with 12 disulfide bonds). Although these results are consistent with their interpretation that DsbC has a disulfide isomerizing role in vivo, the evidence for the aberrant disulfide bond formation in the absence of DsbC was inconclusive. Our results provide some additional information about the DsbC functions in vivo. Excess DsbC was inhibitory against the background disulfide bond formation that occurs inefficiently in the absence of DsbA. Probably, the reducing character of DsbC might dominate the air oxidation. It was also found, however, that excess DsbC can exhibit DsbA-like function when GSSG was supplemented to the medium. This is consistent with another finding of Rietsch et al. (34Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) that the suppression of dsbA null mutation by loss-of-function dsbD (dipZ) mutations requires the functional DsbC. They proposed that DsbD (DipZ) together with thioredoxin normally keeps DsbC in the partially reduced state, and the loss of reducing factor leads to the production of oxidized DsbC, which in turn substitutes for DsbA. This model is consistent with our results; excess DsbC is oxidized by GSSG and then it substitutes for DsbA. We have now demonstrated that the principal role of DsbC is to facilitate disulfide bonds that are formed between correct pairs of cysteines. This demonstration was made possible by using a unique model protein, PhoA[SCCC]. The results of Rietsch et al. (34Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) that the formation of active urokinase, a natural (but still foreign toE. coli) protein with multiple disulfide bonds, depends absolutely on DsbC also supports this notion. These in vivoresults establish that the cellular role of DsbC lies in the isomerization of disulfide bonds until the protein has been folded into a stable conformation.

Cellular Ras is concentrated in the caveolae, a microdomain of the plasma membrane that is highly enriched in caveolin, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, and signal transduction molecules. Growth factor stimulation recruits Raf1 to this membrane domain. Whether Ras simply promotes Raf1 association with caveolae membranes or also modulates subsequent activation events is presently unclear. We have identified a ras variant, ras12V,37G, that does not interact with Raf1 but does interact with a mutant raf1, raf1(257L). To examine the role of Ras in the activation of membrane-bound Raf1, raf1CAAX, and raf1(257L)CAAX, membrane-targeted variants of Raf1 and raf1(257L), respectively, were expressed in fibroblasts with or without coexpression of ras12V,37G. Cell fractionation localized both raf1CAAX and raf1(257L)CAAX to caveolae membranes independent of ras12V,37G expression; however, coexpression of ras12V,37G enhanced the activation of raf(257L)CAAX, but not raf1CAAX, as monitored by induction of cellular transformation, increased Raf kinase activity, and induction of activated MAP kinase.

Raf1 proteins with carboxyl-terminal fusions to the Ki-ras membrane localization signals (rafCAAX) are targeted to the plasma membrane when expressed in cells and are enzymatically active independently of Ras activation (10Leevers S.J.

These results suggest that the primary role of Ras in Raf1 activation is to mediate translocation of Raf1 to the plasma membrane (20Hall A. Science. 1994; 264: 1413-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, a number of observations suggest that the regulation of Raf1 by activated Ras is more complex. Mutant forms of Ras have been identified that effectively activate MAP kinase from the cytosol (21Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. Macdonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell.

To determine if Ras contributes to Raf1 activation subsequent to membrane recruitment, we have utilized membrane-targeted versions of raf1 in conjunction with a ras variant, ras12V,37G, that is defective in Raf1 interaction, but that can interact with the compensatory raf variant, raf1(257L) (27White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Using stably transfected cell lines, we show that ras12V,37G facilitates the activation of membrane-targeted raf1(257L), but not membrane-targeted Raf1. The membrane localization sequences from Ki-ras, used to create the membrane-targeted raf1 variants, are sufficient to promote localization of the raf1 variants to a specific plasma membrane microdomain independently of ras12V,37G interaction. These results demonstrate that the association of Ras with Raf1 is important not only for plasma membrane recruitment of Raf1 but also for subsequent activation events on Raf1. Raf1CAAX and raf1(257L)CAAX were expressed from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp.). A polynucleotide encoding the carboxyl-terminal 5 amino acids of Raf1 fused to the carboxyl-terminal 17 amino acids of Ki-ras was ligated onto the AvaI restriction site inraf1(257L), generating a cDNA encoding the complete raf1(257L) protein fused to the Ki-Ras membrane localization sequences. This cDNA was inserted as an EcoRI/XbaI fragment into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp.) to make pcDNA3-raf1(257L)CAAX. pcDNA3-raf1CAAX is identical to pcDNA3-raf1(257L)CAAX except that it encodes an entirely wild-type Raf1 protein fused to the Ki-ras membrane targeting signal (provided by J. Stolarov and M. Wigler Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). ras12V,37G was expressed from pSRa-ras12V,37G described previously (27White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Stable transfections of NIH 3T3 cells were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (28Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and one-half of each transfection was plated into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for focus assays and the other half into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.) to select for stable transfectants. The number of foci of growth and morphologically transformed cells was scored under magnification after 14 days of incubation in 5% serum. G418-resistant colonies were counted after 10 days of growth in selective media. Stably transfected cells lines were isolated by cloning and expanding individual G418 resistant colonies and by pooling mass populations of G418-resistant colonies. Transfected cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Plasma membrane, low density, and high density plasma membrane fractions were prepared using a detergent-free method as described previously (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Protein samples were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membrane and subjected to Western blotting as described elsewhere (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Raf1 kinase activity in whole cell lysates was measured as described previously (30James G.L. Brown M.S. Cobb M.H. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27705-27714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of glycine for glutamic acid at position 37 of oncogenic ras (rasV12,G37) prevents association with full-length Raf1. A compensatory change in Raf1 was identified, raf1(257L), that rescues productive interaction with ras12V,37G (27White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To determine if Ras participates in Raf1 activation via mechanisms distinct from membrane recruitment, we tested the ability of ras12V,37G to enhance the activity of membrane-targeted variants of Raf1 (raf1CAAX) and raf1(257L) (raf1(257L)CAAX)in vivo. If the association of Ras and Raf1 is important for Raf1 activation events subsequent to membrane recruitment, then ras12V,37G should enhance the activation of raf1(257L)CAAXbut not raf1CAAX. Raf1CAAX and raf1(257L)CAAX are full-length Raf1 proteins with carboxyl-terminal fusions containing the membrane localization sequences of Ki-ras. Raf1CAAX has been shown to be sufficient to induce cellular transformation when expressed in some fibroblast cell lines (31Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the raf variants alone and in combination with ras12V,37G. Both raf1CAAX and raf1(257L)CAAX were weakly transforming as determined by induction of foci of growth and morphologically transformed cells. ras12V,37G did not induce foci when expressed alone and did not cooperate with raf1CAAX. Coexpression of ras12V,37G with raf1(257L)CAAX, however, resulted in an 8-fold increase in focus formation frequency above the level induced by raf1(257L)CAAX alone (Fig.1). To test if the synergy in cellular transformation observed upon expression of ras12V,37G with raf1(257L)CAAX correlated with enhanced activation of raf1(257L)CAAX enzymatic activity, stably transfected cells were assayed for levels of Raf1 kinase activity and for levels of activated MAP kinase. Stable cell lines selected for equivalent expression of raf1CAAX or raf1(257L)CAAX were derived from each of the above transfections (see Fig. 3 A). Raf1 variants were immunoprecipitated from lysates of serum-starved cells, and kinase activity was assayed by in vitro phosphorylation of kinase-inactive MEK1. A 3-fold elevation of Raf kinase activity, relative to control cells, was observed in immunoprecipitates from cells coexpressing ras12V,37G and raf1(257L)CAAX. Surprisingly, no significant Raf kinase activity above background was observed in any other cell line despite significant expression of raf1CAAX or raf1(257L)CAAX (Fig.2 A). Transient expression of Raf1CAAX has been shown to result in significant levels of Raf kinase activity (10Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Whole cell lysates from cell lines selected for equivalent expression of raf and ras variants (see Fig. 3 A) were assayed for levels of Raf1 kinase activity and levels of activated MAP kinase. A, Raf1 kinase activity. Raf1 was immunoprecipitated from 300 μg of whole cell lysate from serum-starved cells transfected with vector alone (lane 1), raf1CAAX (lane 2), raf1(257L)CAAX (lane 3), raf1CAAX + ras12V,37G (lane 4); and raf1(257L)CAAX + ras12V,37G (lane 5). The immunoprecipitated raf protein was incubated with recombinant kinase-inactive MEK1 protein in an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized on a PhosphorImager. Images were quantitated by densitometry from three separate experiments, and values were normalized to the activity measured in vector transformed cells. Error bars represent standard deviation from the mean. A representative experiment is shown below the graph. Similar results were obtained with independently isolated cell lines and with pooled G418-resistant colonies from independent transfections (data not shown). B, levels of activated cellular MAP kinase in 35 μg of cell extract were visualized by Western blotting using the anti-active MAP kinase antibody which selectively recognizes the activated phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK1 that recognizes both active and inactive forms of ERK1 and ERK2. The lane designations are the same as in A. Similar results were obtained with independently isolated cell lines and with pooled G418-resistant colonies from independent transfections (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Levels of activated MAP kinase were visualized by Western blot, using an antibody that selectively recognizes the phosphorylated activated forms of the Raf-regulated MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2. Although little Raf kinase activity was detected in lysates from cells expressing raf1CAAX or raf1(257L)CAAX alone, these cells contained a population of activated ERK1 and ERK2 that was greater than that observed in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig.2 B). This may result from a low level of activated Raf1 that is below the threshold of detection in our kinase assays. Alternatively, some persistent MAP kinase activation in these stable cell lines may no longer be dependent on the presence of activated Raf1. Importantly, cells expressing both raf1(257L)CAAX and ras12V,37G contained a substantially greater population of active ERK1 and ERK2 than cells expressing the raf variants alone or cells expressing both raf1CAAX and ras12V,37G (Fig.2 B). Targeting of Raf1 to the plasma membrane is a critical step in Raf1 activation (10Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The observed increase in raf1(257L)CAAX activity upon coexpression with ras12V,37G suggests that Ras can participate in Raf1 activation events distinct from membrane recruitment. However, the interaction of raf1(257L)CAAX with ras12V,37G could potentially result in enhanced recruitment of raf1(257L)CAAX to the plasma membrane due to targeting signals present on ras12V,37G. To test this, we examined the subcellular localization of the raf1CAAXvariants with and without expression of ras12V,37G. Following serum starvation, detergent-free extracts prepared from the stable cell lines described above were separated into plasma membrane and cytosol fractions on Percoll gradients. Consistent with previous observations (12Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

In contrast, the majority of detectable Raf1 was observed in the plasma membrane fraction of cells expressing raf1CAAX or raf1(257L)CAAX (Fig. 3,lanes 2–5). All cell lines had similar amounts of Raf1 in the cytosol, suggesting that virtually all expressed raf1CAAX and raf1(257L)CAAX is membrane-bound (Fig. 3 C). The bulk plasma membranes were further separated into high and low density membrane fractions using density gradient centrifugation. Previous work has demonstrated that cellular Ras is found exclusively in the low density membrane fraction and that cellular Raf1 is recruited to this fraction upon Ras activation (12Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The low density membrane fraction is highly enriched in the caveolae marker protein caveolin and is believed to be composed primarily of caveolae membrane microdomains (29Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Virtually all of the raf1CAAX and raf1(257L)CAAX in the plasma membrane copurified with the low density membrane fraction independently of ras12V,37G expression (Fig. 3, D andE, compare lanes 2 and 3 tolanes 4 and 5). These results demonstrate that the targeting signals conferred by the amino terminus of Ki-ras are sufficient to efficiently promote localization of the raf1 chimeras to the caveolae membrane fraction. Using mutants of ras and raf1 that affect physical association, we have shown that activated ras will stimulate the kinase activity of membrane-targeted raf1 only when these molecules can physically interact. ras12V,37G interacts with raf1(257L) but not Raf1 (27White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Membrane-targeted variants of raf1(257L) and Raf1 (raf1(257L)CAAX and raf1CAAX, respectively) were efficiently localized to the caveolae fraction of the plasma membrane independently of ras12V,37G interaction. Consistent with other published studies (10Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 19Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), these raf1 variants induced a low level of cellular transformation and MAP kinase activation. However, coexpression of ras12V,37G resulted in the elevation of raf1(257L)CAAX kinase activity and enhanced induction of cellular transformation. ras12V,37G expression did not alter Raf1CAAX activity. Therefore, the ability of Ras to physically interact with Raf1 at the plasma membrane is an important determinant of Raf1 function in addition to membrane recruitment. Cells transiently expressing membrane-targeted raf1 have activated raf1 at the plasma membrane independently of ras activation (10Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 19Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). With stably expressing cell lines, however, we have detected a Ras-dependent component of membrane-targeted Raf1 activation. We suggest that there may be differences in the regulation of Raf1 activity during transient versus stable expression. Raf1 is a substrate for negative regulation by membrane bound phosphatases (32Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of ras on membrane-targeted raf1 activation that we observe in stable cell lines most likely reflect a balance between Raf1 activation and deactivation. This balance may be very different in transient expression assays, particularly if the negative regulatory machinery must be induced. If Ras is not required for, but participates in, Raf1 activation at the plasma membrane, then the absence of negative regulation coupled with high levels of expression of membrane-targeted Raf1 may mask the contribution of Ras. Observations made in stably transfected cell lines may more closely mimic the cellular responses to oncogenic ras during tumorogenesis. Consistent with this, we have observed that native Raf1 is transiently recruited to caveolae upon mitogen stimulation, but is constitutively associated with caveolae in oncogenic ras-transformed cells (12Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). ras12V,37G retains productive interactions with effector molecules other than Raf1 that mediate transforming activity which is independent of, but cooperates with, activation of the Raf/MAP kinase cascade (27White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar,33White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Expression of Raf1CAAX or raf1(257L)CAAXalone resulted in a low level of MAP kinase activation, while ras12V,37G cooperated with only raf1(257L)CAAX in focus formation assays. The lack of cooperation between ras12V,37G and raf1CAAX in these assays was unexpected, since we had previously observed cooperativity between ras12V,37G and rafBXB (33White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), a constitutively active raf variant lacking the amino-terminal regulatory domain (34Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Raf1CAAX activity may be below the threshold required to cooperate with ras12V,37G to transform cells, possibly owing to negative regulation through the Raf1 amino terminus. Consistent with this, significantly more Raf1 kinase activity was detected in cells expressing both raf(257L)CAAX and ras12V,37G, where enhanced focus formation was also observed. The mechanism by which Ras interaction with Raf1 at the plasma membrane enhances Raf1 activity remains to be determined. It may involve the induction of a conformational change in Raf1, exposing residues that are substrates for activating kinases (25Drugen J.K. Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Der C.J. Sung Y.-J. Hwang Y.-W. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 233-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Ras may participate in the assembly of a signaling complex between Raf1 and other proteins such as KSR1 and TPL2 which positively modulate Raf1 activity (35Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 36Patriotis C. Makris A. Chernoff J. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9755-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism, the results presented here demonstrate that the physical interaction of Ras and Raf1 in caveolae membrane is important for sustained Raf1 activation.

Although seen as coupled events, our study demonstrates that membrane ruffling and pinocytosis are regulated by distinct Ras signal transduction pathways. Ras controls membrane ruffling via the small GTPase Rac. In BHK-21 cells, expression of the constitutively active Rac1(G12V) mutant, via a Sindbis virus vector, resulted in a dramatic stimulation of membrane ruffling without affecting the uptake of horseradish peroxidase. Expression of Ha-Ras(G12V), an activated Ras mutant, stimulated both membrane ruffling and horseradish peroxidase uptake. The Ha-Ras(G12V)-stimulated pinocytosis but not membrane ruffling was abolished by either wortmannin or co-expression with a dominant negative mutant of Rab5, Rab5(S34N). Expression of the activated Rab5(Q79L) mutant mimics the stimulatory effect of Ha-Ras(G12V) on pinocytosis but not membrane ruffling. Our data indicate that Ha-Ras(G12V) separately activates Rab5-dependent pinocytosis and Rac1-dependent membrane ruffling. Activation of Ras stimulates cell surface membrane ruffling and pinocytosis.

Ras protein is the prototype of a large family of 20–35-kDa monomeric GTPases that serve as molecular switches in regulating diverse cell functions (1Bokoch G.M. Der C.J.

Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is triggered by a direct interaction between Ras-GTP and Raf (10Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M.

In addition to Raf, Ras-GTP also directly interacts with other effector molecules and activates multiple signal transduction pathways. In mammalian cells, the putative Ras effectors include Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) (15Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ral-GDS (GDP dissociation stimulator) (16Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(18Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that multiple Ras functions contribute to mammalian cell proliferation (19White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Aelst L.V. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Parallel to the activation of nuclear gene expression, Ras-GTP also triggers profound changes in the cytoplasm. The Ras signaling cascade involving the small GTPase Rac1 plays an important role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell surface membrane ruffles (20Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar). Ras activation also stimulates pinocytosis (21Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and transport to endosomes and lysosomes. This process involves the small GTPase, Rab5 (22Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.M. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 23Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cell surface ruffling and pinocytosis both involve organized movements of the plasma membrane, and because Ras stimulates both processes, the two processes have long been thought to be linked (21Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). We have found that membrane ruffling and pinocytosis are regulated by distinct Ras signal transduction pathways. Whereas Ras-stimulated ruffling depends on Rac1 and is independent of PI 3-kinase and Rab5, Ras-stimulated pinocytosis depends on Rab5 and probably PI 3-kinase and is independent of Rac1. BHK-21 cells were grown as described previously (23Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin (Sigma) in dimethyl sulfoxide at 1 mg/ml (stock solution) was freshly diluted with α-MEM and added to previously rinsed cell monolayers. The wortmannin treatment (15 min, 37 °C) was followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) uptake. Dimethyl sulfoxide (<0.1% after dilution) had no effect on pinocytosis or membrane ruffling (data not shown). cDNAs of Ha-Ras, Rac1, and Rab5 were subcloned into the unique XbaI restriction site of the Sindbis vector Toto1000:3′2J (23Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hahn C.S. Hahn Y.S. Braciale T.J. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2679-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The plasmid was then linearized by XhoI digestion and used as a template for in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase. The resulting RNA transcripts were used for transfection of confluent BHK-21 cell monolayers using a Lipofectin-mediated procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained at 37 °C, and the media containing released viruses were harvested 40 h after transfection. Virus titers were generally between 108 and 109 plaque-forming units per ml. Virus stocks were aliquoted and kept frozen at −80 °C before use. Cell lysates (5 μl) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% acrylamide), and the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad semi-dry transfer apparatus. The membrane was probed with an Ha-Ras specific monoclonal antibody (AB1, from Oncogene Science), and the immunoblot was developed using the ECL reagents from Amersham Corp. Confluent BHK-21 monolayers were mock-infected or infected with the vector or recombinant viruses as described (23Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 4 h post-infection or otherwise indicated, cells were washed twice with serum-free α-MEM, and HRP uptake was initiated by adding HRP (5mg/ml) in α-MEM (1ml) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cell lysates were assayed for HRP activity as described (23Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 4 h post-infection, early endosomes were marked by a 10-min HRP uptake. Cells were rinsed four times with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde (in PBS) for 30 min, and washed four more times with PBS. HRP reaction was developed for 10 min by incubating with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mg/ml diaminobenzidine (Sigma) and 0.01% H2O2 (Sigma). Cells were then processed for Poly/Bed (Polysciences, Inc.) embedding, semi-thick section (∼200 nm) preparation, and electron microscopy. At 4 h post-infection, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 30 min, peameabilized, and quenched with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 nNH4Cl, and 0.2% gelatin, followed by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin (25Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The coverslips were mounted in 70% glycerol (in PBS), and the actin localization and cell edge membrane ruffles were visualized by a Zeiss axiovert microscope and a Bio-Rad confocal scanning imaging system. Pinocytosis is regulated by serum growth factors but the molecular mechanisms and biological significance are not well understood. Many growth factors also stimulate cell surface membrane ruffling via rearrangement of actin filaments (20Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar). It has long been thought that membrane ruffling contributes to increased pinocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 26Swanson J.A. Watts C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 424-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). One example is oncogenic Ras-stimulated pinocytosis and membrane ruffling (21Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of the two processes, we used a combination of reagents that specifically alter pinocytosis and membrane ruffling and found, to our surprise, that pinocytosis and membrane ruffling are independent cellular processes regulated by distinct Ras signal transduction pathways. To determine the effect of Ras activation on pinocytosis, we transiently expressed a constitutively active Ras mutant, Ha-Ras(G12V), in cultured BHK-21 cells (23Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hahn C.S. Hahn Y.S. Braciale T.J. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows immunoblot analysis of Ha-Ras(G12V) expression at different times after virus infection. At 4 h after infection, abundant Ha-Ras(G12V) expression was detected. Thereafter, the protein accumulated throughout virus infection (Fig. 1 A). Endogenous Ras protein was not detected. HRP accumulation increased dramatically in cells expressing Ha-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 1 B). At 4 h after infection, cells expressing Ha-Ras(G12V) showed a 3-fold stimulation of HRP uptake compared with the control cells (Fig. 1 B). Ha-Ras(G12V) also increased the rate of HRP uptake (Fig. 1 C). By electron microscopy, HRP was identified in intracellular endosomes (Fig.2), which were significantly enlarged in cells expressing Ha-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 2), suggesting increased endosome activity.Figure 2Electron microscopy of early endosomal structures.

To identify the Ras pathway(s) leading to the stimulation of pinocytosis, we expressed an effector domain mutant of Ha-Ras(G12V), Ha-Ras(G12V,D38A), and tested the effect on HRP uptake. Ras(G12V,D38A) completely abolished the ability of Ha-Ras(G12V) to stimulate HRP uptake (Fig.3 A). Since the D38A mutation can abolish the interaction between Ha-Ras(G12V) and its effector molecules including PI 3-kinase (18Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I.

Early endosome fusion immediately follows the internalization step at the plasma membrane and appears to be rate-limiting (22Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.M. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B.

A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), a GTPase essential for early endosome fusion. Expression of the constitutively active Rab5 mutant, Rab5(Q79L), leads to increased early endosome fusion and increased pinocytosis while expression of the dominant negative Rab5(S34N) mutant results in decreased early endosome fusion and decreased pinocytosis (23Li G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The positive correlation between early endosome fusion activity and cellular pinocytic activity led us to suggest that Ha-Ras(G12V) sequentially activates a wortmannin-sensitive function (possibly PI 3-kinase) and Rab5, leading to an increase in early endosome fusion and pinocytosis. We found that Rab5(Q79L) mimicked the stimulatory effect of Ha-Ras(G12V) on HRP uptake, and this stimulation could be blocked neither by wortmannin (33Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) nor by the dominant negative Ha-Ras(S17N) mutant (Fig.3 C). Co-expression of the activated Rab5(Q79L) and Ha-Ras(G12V) mutants did not lead to a synergistic stimulation of HRP uptake (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, like cells expressing Rab5(Q79L) (Fig. 2 C), cells expressing Ha-Ras(G12V) exhibited enlarged endosomal structures (Fig. 2 B), indicative of enhanced endosome fusion. Finally, co-expression of the dominant negative Rab5(S34N) mutant completely blocked the stimulatory effect of Ha-Ras(G12V) on HRP uptake (Fig. 3 D). The pioneering work of Hall and colleagues (20Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar) has partially defined the Ras signal transduction pathway regulating membrane ruffling. Our study begins to shed light on this important aspect of Ras signal transduction. We show that oncogenic Ras-stimulated pinocytosis is sensitive to wortmannin and is dependent on Rab5 function. Because Ras can directly activate a PI 3-kinase (18Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar) and PI 3-kinase activity can stimulate Rab5-dependent early endosome fusion in vitro (33Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C. Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10207-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we suggest that Ras sequentially activates PI 3-kinase and Rab5, leading to a quantitative increase in endosome fusion and pinocytosis. Ridley et al. (20Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar) previously characterized a Ras signal transduction pathway that promotes membrane ruffling via activation of the small GTPase Rac1. To further examine the relationship of Ras-stimulated membrane ruffling and pinocytosis, we expressed the constitutively active and dominant negative Rac1 mutants. As shown in Fig. 3 E, expression of Rac1(G12V) did not stimulate HRP uptake while under the same conditions Ha-Ras(G12V) stimulated HRP uptake 3-fold. Fig. 3 F shows the co-expression of constructs used in this study. These data immediately suggested that membrane ruffling and pinocytosis are controlled by distinct Ras signal transduction pathways. We then examined membrane ruffling (Fig. 4). Consistent with previous reports (20Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar,25Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of Rac1(G12V) resulted in a dramatic production of cell surface membrane ruffles (Fig. 4 C). Under the same conditions, expression of Ha-Ras(G12V) also stimulated membrane ruffling (Fig. 4 D). Cells expressing the activated Rab5(Q79L) mutant, a strong stimulator of pinocytosis, did not show membrane ruffling (Fig. 4 E), nor did the vector virus-infected (Fig. 4 B) or mock-infected control cells (Fig. 4 A). In agreement with Nobes et al. (25Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that wortmannin (100 nm) failed to block Rac(G12V)-induced or Ha-Ras(G12V)-induced membrane ruffling (data not shown), under conditions where Ha-Ras(G12V)-stimulated pinocytosis was completely inhibited (Fig. 3 B). From these data, we conclude that the Ras signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of Rac1 and membrane ruffling does not contribute to the stimulation of pinocytosis. Taken together, as summarized in Fig. 5, it is clear that pinocytosis and membrane ruffling are regulated by distinct sets of molecules during Ras signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2032056136,"Syk (p72syk) is a 72-kDa cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase that serves as an essential component of the signal transduction machinery coupled to the B-cell antigen receptor. Syk is recruited to the receptor when it is cross-linked and, in response, becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated before it dissociates from the receptor and appears in the cytoplasm. To begin to explore how tyrosine phosphorylation affects Syk activation and receptor binding, Tyr-130, which is localized within the Syk inter-Src homology 2 domain region, was substituted with Phe or Glu. Substitution of Tyr-130 with Phe enhanced the binding of Syk to the receptor and increased receptor-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, while substitution with Glu greatly reduced this interaction. Replacement of Tyr-130 with Glu also increased the basal activity of the kinase, while replacement with Phe decreased its activity and uncoupled kinase activation from receptor engagement. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of Tyr-130 normally plays an important role in mediating both the activation of Syk and its release from the antigen receptor."

Young J.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA1969: 62-63Google Scholar). Melting points were determined with a Büchi apparatus and are uncorrected. After acid hydrolysis, amino acid analyses were kindly carried out by Dr. Thomas J. Lukas of the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Biochemistry, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL. Elemental analyses were performed by G. D. Searle Laboratories, Skokie, IL. To a stirred and cooled (0°C) 0.5-0.8 M solution of the pertinent Boc amino acid in dry DMF were added equimolar amounts of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 40 min and then added to a solution of the trifluoracetate salt of the peptide benzyl ester (obtained by acidolytic deblocking of the Boc-peptide benzyl ester described below) in dry DMF, which was pre-neutralized with N-methylmorpholine. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 1 h and then at room temperature for 18-36 h. The mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure to remove DMF, and the residue was stirred with 3% sodium bicarbonate for 15 min. The precipitated product was filtered off, or separated by centrifugation, washed with 5% NaHCO3, water, cold 0.5 N HCl, water and dried in vacuo in a P2O5 desiccator for ∼18 h. When necessary, the product was reprecipitated from DMF-water. Alternatively, the product was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic extract was washed as above, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent evaporated to give the product. To 1.0 mmol of the Boc-peptide benzyl ester was added 2 ml of 50% trifluoroacetic acid in anhydrous dichloromethane. The solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h, and excess trifluoroacetic acid was removed by adding fresh dichloromethane to the mixture followed by evaporation under reduced pressure, then by addition of anhydrous ether to the residue. The precipitated trifluoroacetic acid salt of the peptide benzyl ester was filtered off, washed with anhydrous ether, and dried under vacuum in a desiccator for 2 h before proceeding with the coupling reaction. The blocked peptide benzyl ester was dissolved in a mixture of DMF/ethanol/water in the approximate volume ratio of 10:20:2 at 50°C and hydrogenated in presence of 10% Pd/C catalyst for 3.5 h at 50°C with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, water and 1 N NH4OH to pH 9 were added and the mixture filtered to remove the catalyst through a Celite filter pad. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure, the residue was taken up in a minimum volume of absolute ethanol, and about 10 volumes of anhydrous ether added and cooled to 0°C. The precipitated product was filtered off, washed with anhydrous ether, and dried in vacuo This was synthesized as described in Ref. 27Lorand L. Velasco P.T. Murthy S.N.P. Wilson J. Parameswaran K.N.

First, Boc-Glu-α-benzyl ester was coupled to mono-Z-cadaverine (24Clark D.D. Mycek M.J. Neidle A. Waelsch H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 79: 338-354Google Scholar), essentially according to the general procedure above and the product isolated from an ethyl acetate extract of the reaction mixture to give an 80% yield of Boc-Glu[γ-(Cad-Z)]-α-benzyl ester, melting point (m.p.) 68-71°C, RF 0.91 (B), 0.92 (C), 0.87 (D), and 0.89 (E). Catalytic hydrogenation of this intermediate followed by reaction with N-(benzyloxycarbonyloxy)succinimide in presence of NaHCO3 according to the general procedures gave Boc-Glu-[γ-(Cad-Z)] in 75% yield, RF 0.34 (B), 0.80 (C), 0.66 (D), and 0.72 (E). This was coupled by the above general procedure with the trifluoracetate salt of Gln-Ile-Val-O-Bzl (28Lorand L. Parameswaran K.N. Velasco P.T. Murthy S.N.P. Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 37-41Google Scholar) to give an 83% yield of Boc-Glu[γ-(Cad-Z)]-Gln-Ile-Val-O-Bzl, m.p. 229-231°C, RF 0.91 (A), 0.89 (C), 0.82 (D), and 0.89 (E). This material was deblocked to remove the Boc group and coupled with equimolar amount of Dns-Eaca according to the general procedures to give the fluorescent peptide intermediate, Dns-Eaca-Glu[γ-(Cad-Z)]-Gln-Ile-Val-O-Bzl, yield 81%, m.p. (dec.) 238-240°C, RF 0.94 (A), 0.88 (C), 0.86 (D), and 0.91 (E). This was catalytically hydrogenated to give Dns-Eaca-Glu-(γ-Cad)-Gln-Ile-Val, RF 0.26 (A), 0.31 (C), 0.55 (D), and 0.63 (E). This was then reacted in 50% aqueous ethanol with a 40% molar excess of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene and NaHCO3. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 0.5 h and at room temperature for 14 h while protected from light. About 15 drops of concentrated Na2CO3 solution were added to the mixture to raise the pH to 9-9.5 (for decomposing excess 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene), and ethanol was evaporated under reduced pressure. After adding 5 ml of water, the solution was centrifuged to remove a small amount of precipitate. The clear supernatant was separated, cooled (0°C), and acidified to pH 2.5 with cold 2 N HCl with stirring. The yellow precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with cold water (3 × 3 ml), and finally washed with ether (5 × 5 ml). The precipitate was triturated with ethanol-ether (1:10) to remove the contaminating 2,4-dinitrophenol and dried in vacuo to give a 40% yield of the titled quenched fluorescent peptide, Dns-Eaca-Glu[γ-(Cad-Dnp)]-Gln-Ile-Val, as a yellow solid, m.p. (dec.) 223-225°C, RF 0.77 (A), 0.74 (C), 0.69 (D), and 0.83 (E). 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) was in agreement with the structure. Amino acid analysis gave Glu 2.17 (2Lorand L. Stenberg P. Fasman G.D.

First, Z-Lys(ϵ-Boc) was coupled with methylamine hydrochloride in presence of N-methylmorpholine by the general method to give Z-Lys(ϵ-Boc)-NHCH3, yield 92%, m.p. 125-127°C, RF 0.94 (B), 0.87 (C), 0.77 (D), and 0.85 (E). Removal of Boc group followed by coupling with Boc-Glu-α-O-Bzl gave a 94% yield of Boc-Glu-[γ-ϵ-(α-Z-Lys-NHCH3)]-α-O-Bzl, m.p. 162-164°C, RF 0.92 (B), 0.86 (C), 0.82 (D), and 0.87 (E). Further reactions similar to those described for peptide II gave Dns-Eaca-Glu-[γ-ϵ(α-Z-Lys-NHCH3)]-Gln-Ile-Val-O-Bzl in about 60% yield, m.p.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3703-3711Google Scholar) in presence of two equivalents of N-methylmorpholine by a slightly modified peptide coupling method.

https://openalex.org/W1977034717,"Initial folding is a prerequisite for subunit assembly in oligomeric proteins. In this study, we have compared the role of co-translational modifications in the acquisition of an assembly-competent conformation of the β subunit, the assembly of which is required for the structural and functional maturation of the catalytic Na,K-ATPase α subunit. Cysteine or asparagine residues implicated in disulfide bond formation or N-glycosylation, respectively, in the Xenopus β1 subunit were eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis, and the assembly efficiency of the mutants and the functional expression of Na+,K+ pumps were studied after expression in Xenopus oocytes. Our results show that lack of each one of the two most C-terminal disulfide bonds indeed permits short term but completely abolishes long term assembly of the β subunit. On the other hand, lack of the most N-terminal disulfide bonds allows the expression of a small number of functional Na+,K+ pumps at the cell surface. Elimination of all three but not of one or two glycosylation sites produces β subunits that remain stably expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, in association with binding protein but not as irreversible aggregates. The assembly efficiency of nonglycosylated β subunits is decreased but a reduced number of functional Na+,K+ pumps is expressed at the cell surface. The lack of sugars does not influence the apparent K+ or ouabain affinity of the Na+,K+ pumps. Thus, these data show that disulfide bond formation and N-glycosylation may play important but qualitatively distinct roles in the initial folding of oligomeric protein subunits. Moreover, the results suggest that an endoplasmic reticulum degradation pathway exists, which is glycosylation-dependent."

The structure was supported by the data obtained for desulfation products and the Smith degradation of the polysaccharide. The acrosome reaction is a prerequisite for fertilization in various animals including mammals. In starfish, three components of the egg jelly, namely a highly sulfated glycoprotein of an extremely large molecular size named acrosome reaction-inducing substance (ARIS), 1The abbreviations used are: ARIS, acrosome reaction-inducing substance; P-ARIS, Pronase digest of ARIS; DS, desulfated fraction; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; HPAEC-PAD, high-performance anion exchange chromatograph with pulsed amperometric detector. a steroid saponin named Co-ARIS, and a sperm-activating peptide (asterosap) are responsible for triggering the acrosome reaction (1Hoshi M. Nishigaki T. Ushiyama A. Okinaga T. Chiba K. Matsumoto M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). Three saponins consisting of a sulfated steroid and a pentasaccharide chain (Co-ARIS 1–3) were isolated from the egg jelly and structurally characterized (2Nishiyama I. Matsui T. Fujimoto Y. Ikekawa N. Hoshi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1987; 29: 171-176Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A mixture of glutamine-rich peptides consisting of 34 amino acid residues was isolated as asterosap, and the structures of 11 of them were determined (3Nishigaki T. Chiba K. Miki W. Hoshi M. Zygote. 1996; 4: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ARIS alone induces the acrosome reaction only in high calcium or high pH seawater, whereas either Co-ARIS or asterosap is also required in normal seawater (3Nishigaki T. Chiba K. Miki W. Hoshi M. Zygote. 1996; 4: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Ikadai H. Hoshi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1981; 23: 73-80Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Matsui T. Nishiyama I. Hino A.

A tripartite of ARIS, Co-ARIS, and asterosap provides the best condition for the induction of the acrosome reaction in normal seawater. A Pronase digest of ARIS (P-ARIS) shows similar activity to that of ARIS (23Ikadai H. Hoshi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1981; 23: 81-88Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory resulted in the isolation (as ARIS) of a sulfated glycoprotein of an apparent molecular mass of 107 daltons (23Ikadai H. Hoshi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1981; 23: 81-88Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent work involved isolation of a trisaccharide Xyl1→3Gal1→(SO3−)3,4Fuc from P-ARIS after mild acid hydrolysis (6Okinaga T. Ohashi Y. Hoshi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since the protein content of ARIS was reduced by about 50% by the Pronase digestion, which made it easier to handle in comparison with ARIS, P-ARIS was used as the starting material in this analysis. This study was carried out in an attempt to understand the structure-activity relationship of ARIS, and we now report the structural study of the main saccharide chain of P-ARIS. Water was purified with a Milli-Q reagent water system (Millipore Corp.). Sample concentrations were performed under diminished pressure at <40 °C or in a stream of nitrogen. For gas-liquid chromatography, a Shimadzu GC-7A instrument fitted with a flame ionization detector was used. Gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on a Shimadzu GC-14A instrument coupled with a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2000A instrument. A Dionex HPAEC-PAD was used to determine sugar compositions. Alditol acetates and partiallyO-methylated alditol acetates were analyzed on a HP-5 capillary column using a temperature program (170 °C (2 min) → 250 °C (2 °C/min)). Gel filtrations were performed on a Bio-Gel P-2 column using deionized Milli-Q filtered water as the eluent unless otherwise specified. Fractions were monitored either by the Dubois method (7Dubois M. Gelles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar) or by the Park and Johnson method (8Park T.J. Johnson M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 181: 149-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfate contents were determined according to Terho and Hartiala (9Terho T.T. Hartiala K. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 41: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). P-ARIS was prepared by ethanol precipitation of the egg jelly solution of the starfish, Pronase digestion, and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE Toyopearl 650M described by Matsui et al. (5Matsui T. Nishiyama I. Hino A. Hoshi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1986; 28: 339-348Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A suspension of P-ARIS (30 mg) in water (10 ml) was sonicated using a Bransonic Ultrasonics apparatus model for 30 min and then filtered, and the product was freeze-dried. The sample was chromatographed on a column of DEAE Toyopearl 650M using water followed by a linear gradient of 0–1.0m NaCl in water. The major fraction, eluted at ∼0.9m NaCl concentration, was dialyzed and freeze-dried to give purified Fragment 1 (12.6 mg, 42%). The native and degraded polysaccharide samples were hydrolyzed with 2 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 120 °C for 1 h. After evaporation to dryness, the products were analyzed as alditol acetates either by direct injection to the HPAEC-PAD or by gas-liquid chromatography (10Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Methylation analysis was performed by a modified Hakomori procedure (11Harris P.J. Henry R.L. Blackeney A.B. Stone B.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Since the prolonged base and CH3I treatments improved the stoichiometry of the partiallyO-methylated alditol acetates, the same procedure has been followed in all methylation analyses. The absolute configurations of the sugar residues were determined according to Gerwig et al. (12Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 349-357Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar). All 1H and 13C nmr spectra of solutions in D2O were recorded either at 20 °C or at 70 °C using either a Varian UNITY-plus 400-MHz or a JEOL GX 270-MHz instrument. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm using sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propanoate-d 4 (δ 0.00 ppm) for 1H as the external reference and acetone (δ 31.07) for 13C as the internal reference. A solution of Fragment 1 was dialyzed against 0.1 m pyridinium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) for 2 days. The resulting pyridinium salt (12 mg) was treated with 10% methanol in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 12 h at 50 °C (13Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), concentrated to dryness, and passed through a column of Bio-Gel P-2. The fraction that eluted in the void volume (DS-1) was analyzed for its composition of sugars and their linkages. Another sample of the pyridinium salt (12 mg) was treated with 10% methanol in Me2SO for 5 h at 80 °C (14Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu T. J. Biochem. (Toyko). 1979; 86: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and treated in a similar manner as above to obtain DS-2. The Smith degradation (15Hey G.W. Lewis B.A. Smith F.

Namely, a dried sample of Fragment 1 (3 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer containing 9.0 m urea at pH 4.0. NaIO4 (0.5 ml of a 1% solution) and isopropyl alcohol (6 μl) were added to the Fragment 1 solution and stirred in the dark at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was stored in the dark for 7 days at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ethylene glycol, and the mixture was dialyzed against water. The nondialyzable fraction was freeze-dried and reduced with NaBH4 (1 ml of a 1% solution) for 16 h at room temperature. The product was dialyzed against water and then hydrolyzed with 0.1 ntrifluoroacetic acid (0.5 ml) at 100 °C for 30 min. After evaporation to dryness, the mixture was chromatographed on a column of Bio-Gel P-2 using 0.1 m NaCl as the eluent. The tri-, di-, and monosaccharide fractions obtained were desalted by passing through Dowex 50W, and the samples were hydrolyzed with 2 ntrifluoroacetic acid at 120 °C for 1 h and then analyzed for their sugar compositions using a Dionex HPAEC-PAD. The acrosome reaction-inducing capacities were scored with the starfish spermatozoa for ARIS, P-ARIS, Fragment 1, DS-1, and DS-2. The sperm suspension was prepared by diluting 5 μl of “dry” sperm in 495 μl of artificial seawater. The samples were dissolved in water at the concentration of 1 μg of fucose/μl, and aliquots of 10 μl were used for the assay. Water (10 μl) was used as the negative control, and 10 μl of the egg jelly solution was used as the positive control. To each sample, 10 μl of 2-fold artificial seawater, 5 μl of high calcium solution, 55 μl of artificial seawater, and 20 μl of sperm suspension were added so that the final concentration of the sample was 10 μg of fucose/100 μl. After mixing and incubating the mixture for 5 min, spermatozoa were fixed by the addition of 20 μl of 5% glutaraldehyde in artificial seawater. The samples were stained with erythrosine and observed using a Nomarski microscope. A total of 200 spermatozoa were randomly scored, and the ratio of reacted spermatozoa was calculated. Starfish egg jelly solution (pH 8.2) was dialyzed against water and passed through a column of Sepharose CL-4B, and the void volume fraction was collected as ARIS. Another sample of egg jelly solution was precipitated with ethanol and then treated with actinase E for 4 days with repeated addition of the enzyme. P-ARIS was collected by fractionation of the actinase digest by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B and DEAE Toyopearl 650M, respectively (5Matsui T. Nishiyama I. Hino A. Hoshi M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1986; 28: 339-348Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Preliminary analyses of ARIS and P-ARIS suggested the presence of fucose, xylose, galactose, glucosamine, and galactosamine as constituent monosaccharides (Table I). The determination of sulfate content (9Terho T.T. Hartiala K. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 41: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) showed clear evidence for the presence of sulfate even though the exact percentage was not obtained. The1H nmr spectrum of ARIS in D2O solution was complicated but showed signals for anomeric, acetamido, and 6-deoxy protons, all of which showed better resolution in the spectrum of P-ARIS. Since the D2O solution of P-ARIS was also of high viscosity, which caused difficulties in obtaining more information based on nmr experiments, P-ARIS was sonicated to obtain a good nmr sample. After sonication and fractionation of P-ARIS by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE Toyopearl 650M, Fragment 1 was obtained. Fragment 1 retained the acrosome reaction-inducing activity to a significant extent; therefore, the structure of Fragment 1 was studied further.Table ISugar composition analysis of ARIS, P-ARIS, and Fragment 1Sugar residueARISP-ARISFragment 1mol %Fucose405256Xylose141519Galactose262424GlcNAc93GalNAc114 Open table in a new tab The average molecular mass of Fragment 1 was about 10.4 kDa as determined by gel filtration on a calibrated column of Sephacryl S-400. Hydrolysis of Fragment 1 and analysis of component sugars showed the presence of fucose, xylose, and galactose in a molar ratio of 3:1:1 (Table I). The absolute configurations, determined by gas-liquid chromatography of the trimethylsilylated (+)-2-butyl glycosides (12Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 349-357Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar), were l for fucosyl and d for xylosyl and galactosyl residues. Methylation analysis (11Harris P.J. Henry R.L. Blackeney A.B. Stone B.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) under reported conditions was not satisfactory due probably to the steric hindrance caused by the O-sulfation. Therefore, the base and methyl iodide treatments were prolonged by 24 and 5 h, respectively, to obtain a satisfactory stoichiometry of the analysis. The methylation analysis of Fragment 1 revealed the presence of 4-linked xylopyranosyl, 4-linked fucopyranosyl, 3,4-linked fucopyranosyl, and 3-linked galactopyranosyl residues in a molar ratio of 1:1:2:1 (TableII). The presence of 3,4-linked fucopyranosyl residues suggested a branching or substitution.Table IIMethylation analysis of Fragment 1 and desulfation products, DS-1, and DS-2Alditol2-a2,3-Xyl, 2,3-di-O-methyl-1,4,5-tri-O-acetyl xylitol.Fragment 1DS-1DS-2mol %2,3-Xyl1817172,3-Fuc1814202,4-Fuc27432-Fuc40142,4,6-Gal2228192-a 2,3-Xyl, 2,3-di-O-methyl-1,4,5-tri-O-acetyl xylitol. Open table in a new tab The 1H nmr spectrum of Fragment 1 recorded at 20 °C in D2O solution showed five anomeric signals at δ (ppm) 5.28 (1H, d, J = 3.5 Hz), 5.09 (1H, d, J = 3.4 Hz), 5.03 (1H, d, J = 3.8 Hz), 5.00 (1H, d,J = 4.0 Hz), and 4.63 (1H, d, J = 6.3 Hz) in an intensity ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 that were assigned for α-galactopyranosyl, α-fucopyranosyl, α-fucopyranosyl, α-fucopyranosyl, and β-xylopyranosyl residues, respectively (Fig.1). The 1H nmr integral was in good agreement with the sugar composition data. Two unresolved signals appearing between δ (ppm) 1.23 (6H, dd, J = 6.7 Hz) and 1.32 (3H, d,J = 6.7 Hz) were attributed to C-6 methyl groups. The13C nmr spectrum showed anomeric carbon signals at δ (ppm) 104.1, 100.1, 99.2, and 96.8 that could be assigned to β-xylopyranosyl, α-galactopyranosyl, α-fucopyranosyl, and α-fucopyranosyl residues, respectively (Fig. 1). Furthermore, this observation suggested that the signals at δ (ppm) 4.76 and 4.70 in the 1H nmr spectrum of Fragment 1 recorded at 70 °C are non-anomeric (Fig. 2). Since Fragment 1 showed the presence of sulfate as a possible substituent, these two signals were assigned to the ring protons shifted downfield due to theO-sulfation of the fucosyl residues. This observation was supported by the presence of 2 mol of 3,4-linked fucosyl residues in the methylation analysis of Fragment 1. Furthermore, this observation confirmed that the presence of 3,4-linked fucopyranosyl residues was not due to a branching of the main saccharide chain. All the information that we obtained suggested that Fragment 1 has a repeating unbranched structure of five sugar residues. The isolation of a trisaccharide, Xylp-(1→3)-Galp-(1→(SO3−)3,4)-Fucp, after mild acid hydrolysis of P-ARIS (in our laboratory, Okinagaet al. (6Okinaga T. Ohashi Y. Hoshi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) was a positive clue of a five-sugar repeating unit in Fragment 1. Fragment 1 was subjected to desulfation to determine the position of O-sulfation and the structure-activity relationship. Two desulfation products (DS-1 and DS-2) were obtained by the treatment of 10% methanol in dimethyl sulfoxide for 12 h at 50 °C (13Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and 5 h at 80 °C (14Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu T. J. Biochem. (Toyko). 1979; 86: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), respectively. DS-1 showed the removal of 1 mol of sulfate by the disappearance of a proton signal at δ 4.70 (ppm) in its1H nmr spectrum (Fig. 2). This was corroborated by the methylation analysis in which an approximate mole of 3,4-linked fucosyl residue was replaced by 3-linked fucosyl residue (Table II). However, in the case of DS-2, total desulfation was achieved as indicated by the disappearance of both non-anomeric proton signals from the anomeric region in its 1H nmr spectrum (Fig. 2). Moreover, complete replacement of 3,4-linked fucosyl residues by 3-linked fucosyl residues in the methylation analysis of DS-2 was also observed. All these observations indicated possible 4-O-sulfation of two of the fucosyl residues present in Fragment 1. The biological activity of the sample was determined by means of the acrosome reaction-inducing capacity in high-calcium seawater. The acrosome reaction induced by egg jelly, ARIS, P-ARIS, Fragment 1, and DS-1 under the conditions used was found to be 77, 64, 70, 63, and 7%, respectively (Fig. 3). The near-base-line level of activity of DS-1 suggests that the removal of 1 mol of sulfate/repeating unit destroys the biological activity of Fragment 1 and, thus, displays the importance of that particular sulfate group for activity. The location of the activity-determining sulfate group was achieved with the aid of nmr spectrometry. Analyses of H, H-COSY, two-dimensional HOHAHA, and one-dimensional HOHAHA difference spectra recorded at 20 °C in D2O solutions led to the identification of almost all ring protons quite unambiguously (Table III). Comparative analyses of two-dimensional H-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra revealed the linkage positions and the exact sequence of some monosaccharide residues in the polymer chain (Table IV). Strong NOE contacts were obtained from H-1 of the xylosyl residue (E) 2For use of capital letters, see Tables III andIV and Fig. 4. to H-3 of the galactosyl residue (A) and from galactosyl H-1 to H-3 of one of the sulfated fucosyl residues (B), supporting the previous determination of the trisaccharide sequence by Okinaga et al (6Okinaga T. Ohashi Y. Hoshi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The desulfation studies showed that it was the 4-O-sulfate of fucosyl residue B that showed a higher liability toward the desulfation. With the removal of the 4-O-sulfate of residue B, Fragment 1 showed a total loss of biological activity. These observations suggest the presence of a more potent sulfate group in the interior fucosyl residue.Table IIIChemical shifts (ppm) in 1H nmr spectrum of Fragment 13-Gal (A)3-Fuc (B)4-Fuc (C)3-Fuc (D)4-Xyl (E)H-15.325.125.065.034.66H-23.984.003.863.963.40H-34.174.213.924.083.62H-44.314.743.744.803.76H-53.824.524.404.703.44H-5′4.16H-63.661.261.341.26H-6′3.60Measured at 400 MHz, 20°C in D2O.

Chemical shifts are referenced to external sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propanoate-d 4 at 0 ppm. H-1 of the fucosyl residue B showed a NOE contact to the H-3 of the second sulfated fucosyl residue (D) together with a somewhat stronger cross-peak with H-4 of the same residue (D), suggesting that the two sulfated fucosyl residues are next to each other in the polymer chain. Therefore the remaining unsulfated fucosyl residue (C) should be placed as the last residue in the pentasaccharide repeating unit. Even though the possible NOE contact between the H-1 of sulfated fucosyl residue D and the H-4 of the non-sulfated fucosyl residue was not observed, a strong NOE contact was obtained from H-1 of residue C to H-4 of the xylosyl residue (E), supporting the position of residue C in the pentasaccharide repeating unit. To confirm the sequence of monosaccharides in the structure of Fragment 1, the Smith degradation was carried out. In the Smith degradation, vicinal diols are oxidized by periodate, resulting in an opening of C-C bonds. Therefore, the sugar residues susceptible to periodate oxidation in the pentasaccharide repeating unit should be the 4-linked xylosyl residue (E) and the 4-linked fucosyl residue (C). Thus the products by the Smith degradation of Fragment 1 should be a trisaccharide if the sequence E-A-B-D-C is correct or a disaccharide if the sequence E-A-B-C-D is correct. A dry sample of Fragment 1 was treated with sodium metaperiodate in ammonium acetate buffer containing urea at pH 4.0 in the dark at 4 °C. Urea was added to maximize the reaction, presumably by reducing hydrogen bonding. Indeed, in the absence of urea, the oxidation proceeded to a very limited extent. The product of Smith degradation was subjected to chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-2 column. A fraction corresponding to the elution volume of a trisaccharide contained galactosyl and fucosyl residues in an approximate ratio of 1:2, suggesting the trisaccharide A-B-D. A disaccharide fraction consisting only of fucosyl residues and a monosaccharide fraction galactose were also isolated, suggesting that the di- and monosaccharides resulted from further hydrolysis of the trisaccharide Gal-Fuc(SO3-)-Fuc(SO3−). This observation confirmed the exact sequence of the monomer units in the repeating unit of Fragment 1. All the data on Fragment 1 indicate that the structure should be the one shown in Fig. 4. The study of the acrosome reaction in the fertilization of the starfish, Asterias amurensis, has been a major research project in our laboratory. Previous work in our laboratory resulted in isolation of ARIS, Co-ARIS, and asterosap from starfish egg jelly as the components responsible for the induction of the acrosome reaction. ARIS has been thought to be most important among them for the induction of the acrosome reaction because only it alone is able to induce the acrosome reaction in high calcium or high pH seawater. This study has revealed that a saccharide polymer consisting of pentasaccharide repeating units as shown in Fig. 4 is responsible for the biological activity of ARIS."

Tryptic removal of the 9 carboxyl-terminal residues of rhodopsin revealed that a major fraction of the phosphates incorporated by protein kinase C are in a region containing Ser334, Thr335, and Thr336. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the tryptic product established that Ser334 accounts for approximately 65% of the phosphorylation in this region. Analysis of the endoproteinase Asp-N-generated carboxyl terminus of rhodopsin by mass spectrometry and peptide sequencing revealed that Ser338 is also a primary phosphorylation site, with minor phosphorylation of Ser343. Quantitation of high pressure liquid chromatography-separated phosphopeptides, taken together with phosphoamino acid analysis of the tryptic product, revealed that Ser334 and Ser338 were phosphorylated equally and each accounted for approximately 35% of the total phosphorylation; Thr335/336 accounted for just under 20% of the phosphorylation, and Ser343 accounted for 10%. Thus, the primary protein kinase C sites are Ser334 and Ser338, with minor phosphorylation of Thr335/336 and Ser343. Ser334and Ser338 have recently been identified as the primary sites of phosphorylation of rhodopsin in vivo (Ohguro, H., Van Hooser, J. P., Milam, A. H., and Palczewski, K. (1995)J. Biol. Chem.270, 14259–14262). Of these sites, only Ser338 is a significant substrate for rhodopsin kinasein vitro. Identification of Ser334 as a primary protein kinase C target in vitro is consistent with protein kinase C modulating the phosphorylation of this site in vivo.

Identification of Ser334 as a primary protein kinase C target in vitro is consistent with protein kinase C modulating the phosphorylation of this site in vivo. Phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors, where phosphorylation by both Gprotein receptor kinases (GRKs) and second messenger-regulated kinases mediate receptor desensitization (1Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In phototransduction, phosphorylation of the visual receptor, rhodopsin, is the first step in desensitization of this archetypal G protein-coupled receptor (2Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 3Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of laboratories have established that Ser338 and Ser343 on the carboxyl terminus of bovine rhodopsin are the primary phosphorylation sites of this kinase in vitro(6Papac D.I. Oatis Jr., J.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5930-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7McDowell J.H. Nawrocki J.P. Hargrave P.A.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recently, Palczewski and co-workers showed that mouse rhodopsin is phosphorylated on Ser338 and also on a novel site, Ser334, in vivo (same numbering in mouse and bovine rhodopsin) (9Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although rhodopsin kinase has now been reported to phosphorylate Ser334 in vitro (10Ohguro H. Johnson R.S. Ericsson L.E. Walsh K.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), this phosphorylation is minor relative to that of the primary sites and has not been consistently observed (6Papac D.I. Oatis Jr., J.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5930-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7McDowell J.H. Nawrocki J.P. Hargrave P.A.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, a kinase other than rhodopsin kinase likely regulates rhodopsin at Ser334. One candidate for modulating rhodopsin phosphorylation at the nonrhodopsin kinase site is protein kinase C. The enzyme phosphorylates the carboxyl terminus of dark-adapted rhodopsin, photoexcited rhodopsin, and opsin with equal affinity in vitro (11Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4749-4757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6710-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that its phosphorylation site(s) is equally exposed in all three receptor conformations. 1Palczewski and co-workers recently reported that they were unable to phosphorylate rhodopsin with protein kinase C (13Ohguro H. Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Buczylko J. Zhao X. Taylor J.A. Walsh K.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5215-5224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); this may have arisen because an irreversibly oxidized form of protein kinase C was used in their experiments. Evidence that this phosphorylation is physiologically relevant was first supported by the finding that phorbol esters, potent activators of protein kinase C, modulate the phosphorylation of rhodopsin in intact retinas (14Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17725-17728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18181-18186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the extent of protein kinase C's involvement in rhodopsin phosphorylation in situ was established using a highly selective protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C; treatment of retinas with calphostin C was shown to cause a 50% reduction in the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin in intact frog retinas (16Udovichenko I.P. Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar). This contribution shows that Ser334 and Ser338are the major protein kinase C phosphorylation sites on bovine rhodopsin and Ser343 and Thr335 and/or Thr336 are minor sites. The finding that protein kinase C phosphorylates Ser334, coupled with the finding that protein kinase C contributes to approximately half the phosphorylation of rhodopsin in situ (16Udovichenko I.P. Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that this is the kinase that is responsible for the physiological regulation of rhodopsin at Ser334.

Urea-stripped membranes were phosphorylated by protein kinase C purified from bovine retinas, baculovirus-expressed protein kinase C α, or baculovirus-expressed rhodopsin kinase under dim red light or under room light, as stated in the figure legends. Reaction mixtures (80 μl) containing 10 pmol of rhodopsin and 2 pmol of protein kinase C or 1 pmol of rhodopsin kinase were incubated in buffer containing 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (3 Ci mmol−1), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 30 °C unless otherwise noted. CaCl2 (500 μm) and phorbol myristate acetate (0.5–1 μm) were included in protein kinase C reaction mixtures; 100 μm EDTA and 100 μm EGTA were included in rhodopsin kinase reaction mixtures. Reactions proceeded for 60 min at 30 °C, followed by centrifugation at 500,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membranes were resuspended in buffer and analyzed as described in appropriate sections below. Rhodopsin (70 pmol) phosphorylated by protein kinase C or rhodopsin kinase was resuspended in 700 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 50 μm CaCl2; 10 pmol (100 μl) were removed as the zero time point. Proteolysis was initiated by the addition of 145 μl of 57 units ml−1 trypsin, and samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2–60 min. Aliquots (125 μl) were removed into SDS-PAGE buffer (40 μl; 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.008% bromphenol blue, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, labeled with antibodies to opsin via incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG, and labeling detected by chemiluminescence. Antibodies were removed by incubation of blots in 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, for 60 min at 55 °C, and blots were analyzed by autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Rhodopsin (70 pmol) phosphorylated by protein kinase C or rhodopsin kinase was proteolyzed by trypsin (17 units ml−1) as described above. Intact rhodopsin and cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P. Bands corresponding to intact (36 kDa) and proteolyzed (35 kDa) opsin were separately excised from the Immobilon-P membrane, hydrolyzed in 500 μl of 6 m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C, and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis as described (18Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Hydrolyzed sample was mixed with 1 μg each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine, spotted onto a thin layer chromatography plate, and electrophoresed horizontally (2000 V for 30 min) in pH 3.5 buffer (5% acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine). Amino acid standards were visualized with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone and 32P comigrating with standards detected by autoradiography. 1 nmol of rhodopsin was phosphorylated by protein kinase C as described above except the ATP concentration was 250 μm. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, at 30 °C. The carboxyl terminus was released by the addition of 200 μl of a 20 μg ml−1 solution of endoproteinase Asp-N in 10 mm HEPES, 50% glycerol and incubation at 30 °C for 60 min. The solution was centrifuged again for 20 min at 500,000 × g at 4 °C to separate the 19-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail from the membrane-bound fragment of rhodopsin. The supernatant containing the carboxyl-terminal peptide was applied to a reverse phase HPLC C-18 column. Masses of peaks of interest were determined by laser desorption mass spectrometry; peptides with masses corresponding to the phosphorylated tail of rhodopsin were sequenced by automated Edman degradation or tandem mass spectrometry. In determining the protein kinase C phosphorylation site(s) on rhodopsin, we took advantage of the finding that phosphorylation on Ser338 prevents cleavage by trypsin at the adjacent Lys339 (8Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4 A). Thus, cleavage of rhodopsin at this site serves as a diagnostic for whether Ser338 has been phosphorylated and provides a measure for what fraction of the phosphorylation occurs amino-terminal to Ser338. Fig. 1 A (left) shows that trypsin treatment of rhodopsin phosphorylated by protein kinase C resulted in the appearance of a 32P-labeled product that migrated slightly faster (35 kDa) than native rhodopsin (36 kDa); this product corresponds to rhodopsin cleaved at Lys339 to release a 9-amino acid peptide. Fig. 1 C (left) reveals that at least 40% of the radioactivity incorporated on rhodopsin was recovered in the 35-kDa cleaved product (the product is a transient intermediate, setting a lower limit on the fraction of rhodopsin modified amino-terminal to Ser338). Approximately 15% of the radioactivity was associated with uncut rhodopsin after 60 min of trypsin treatment, consistent with additional phosphorylation on Ser338 to yield a population of receptor that was proteolyzed more slowly (presumably at sites other than Lys339). Similar data were obtained regardless of whether light-adapted (Fig. 1) or dark-adapted (not shown) rhodopsin served as the substrate and whether protein kinase C α (Fig. 1) or retinal protein kinase C was used. In contrast to protein kinase C-phosphorylated rhodopsin, only one radioactive band was detected when rhodopsin kinase-phosphorylated rhodopsin was treated with trypsin under the same conditions; this band corresponds to uncut rhodopsin (Fig. 1 A, right). The 35-kDa product, although present (Western blot in Fig.1 B, right), was not radioactive. Fig.1 C shows that the half-time for cleavage of rhodopsin kinase-phosphorylated rhodopsin was approximately 30 min; this is at least ten times slower than the half-time for cleavage of protein kinase C-phosphorylated rhodopsin (Fig. 1 C,right), consistent with phosphorylation on Ser338 preventing proteolysis at Lys339. To identify the residue on the tryptic fragment that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, the 35-kDa product was subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 2). Compilation of data from 13 independent experiments, with stoichiometries varying from 0.2 to 1.0 mol phosphate/mol rhodopsin, revealed an average of 65 ± 9% phosphoserine on the 35-kDa tryptic product; the remaining radioactivity was on phosphothreonine with no detectable phosphotyrosine. Simlar results were obtained whether rhodopsin was phosphorylated by recombinant protein kinase C α from baculovirus (Fig. 2) or protein kinase C purified from bovine retinas (not shown). Thus, Ser334 is the primary phosphorylation site on the tryptic fragment of rhodopsin, with some phosphorylation observed on one or both of the adjacent Thr residues. Additional phosphorylation sites (i.e. not present in the tryptic product) were identified by analysis of a carboxyl-terminal peptide, released by endoproteinase Asp-N (20Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains all thein vivo (15Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18181-18186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase C in vitro (12Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6710-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) phosphorylation sites. Reverse phase HPLC resolved the sample of the carboxyl-terminal fragment into three peaks labeled 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in Fig. 3. Peak 3 had a more quickly eluting shoulder that was not resolved into a separate peak; this shoulder was collected for analysis (referred to as Peak 3 shoulder). Electrospray mass spectrometry revealed the presence of two species in Peak 3 shoulder with masses corresponding to unphosphorylated peptide and monophosphorylated peptide (Table I). Peak 1 and Peak 2 each contained a single peptide with a mass corresponding to monophosphorylated peptide (Table I). Multiply phosphorylated species, which elute earlier than monophosphorylated species (6Papac D.I. Oatis Jr., J.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5930-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), were not detected and could account for no more than 3% of the sample based on the sensitivity of the detection. Similar results were obtained whether dark-adapted (Fig. 3) or light-adapted (not shown) rhodopsin was phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The carboxyl-terminal fragment of unphosphorylated rhodopsin eluted as a single peak with the same retention time as Peak 3 above; it had a mass of 1938.1, establishing no phosphorylation prior to protein kinase C treatment (not shown).Table ISummary of mass spectrometric and sequencing analyses of carboxyl terminus of protein kinase C-phosphorylated rhodopsinPeakMass1-aMasses for Peaks 1 and 2 were determined by laser desorption mass spectroscopy; masses for Peak 3 shoulder were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS).Phosphorylated residueMethod12015.5Ser343Edman22015.4Ser338Edman3 shoulder2017.1Ser334EdmanSer334 or Thr335 or Thr336ES-MS1937.0None1-a Masses for Peaks 1 and 2 were determined by laser desorption mass spectroscopy; masses for Peak 3 shoulder were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). Open table in a new tab Sequencing by Edman degradation identified the phosphorylated residues as Ser343 and Ser338 in Peaks 1 and 2, respectively. The order of elution of these peptides relative to unphosphorylated peptide was as reported previously (6Papac D.I. Oatis Jr., J.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5930-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The presence of unphosphorylated peptide in Peak 3 shoulder confounded the unambiguous identification of the phosphorylation site on the monophosphorylated peptide; the signal for detection of released derivatized amino acid dropped from 3.2 to 0.2 pmol in the cycle from residues 333 to 334, consistent with modification at Ser334. Further analysis of Peak 3 shoulder by tandem mass spectroscopy confirmed that phosphate was present at one of the 3 adjacent residues Ser334–Thr336. The stoichiometry of the analyzed phosphorhodopsin was 0.6 mol phosphate/mol rhodopsin. Based on this and the areas of the three peaks, we calculated the relative distribution of phosphates on the identified phosphorylation sites. Peaks 1, 2, and 3 represented 6, 23, and 71%, respectively, of the total peak area in the chromatogram in Fig. 3. Given that 60% of the sample was phosphorylated, we calculated that the phosphopeptide component in Peak 3 (Ser334-Thr335) accounted for 31% of the total peak area. Expressed relative to the total phosphorylation, Ser343 (Peak 1) incorporated 10% of the phosphate in the sample, Ser338 (Peak 2) incorporated 38% of the phosphate, and Ser334-Thr335-Thr336(phosphorylated component of Peak 3) accounted for 52% of the phosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that 65 ± 9% of the phosphate in the Ser334–Thr336region was on Ser334 (Fig. 2), so that phosphate on Ser334 accounted for 34% of the total phosphate and phosphate on Thr335 and/or Thr336 accounted for 18%. Thus, the phosphorylation preference was: Ser334 = Ser338 > Thr335/336 > Ser343. The foregoing results reveal that 1) the primary in vitro protein kinase C phosphorylation sites of bovine rhodopsin are Ser334 and Ser338 (Fig.4 A), with minor phosphorylation on Ser343 and Thr335 and/or Thr336, 2) a single phosphate is incorporated per molecule of rhodopsin, and 3) light has no significant effect on the sites phosphorylated. Importantly, Ser334 and Ser338 are the majorin vivo phosphorylation sites of rhodopsin (9Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, of these two sites, only Ser338 is phosphorylated significantly by rhodopsin kinase in vitro (6Papac D.I. Oatis Jr., J.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5930-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7McDowell J.H. Nawrocki J.P. Hargrave P.A.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5718-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This suggests that protein kinase C is the primary kinase that modulates Ser334 in vivo. This possibility is also supported by kinetic data; the contribution of protein kinase C to the phosphorylation of rhodopsin in intact retinas is slower than that of rhodopsin kinase (16Udovichenko I.P. Newton A.C. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar), and Ser334 is phosphorylated more slowly than Ser338 in vivo (9Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recent elucidation of the solution structure of a domain of rhodopsin encompassing the seventh transmembrane span and carboxyl terminus (21Yeagle P.L. Alderfer J.L. Albert A.D. Mol. Vis. 1996; 2: 12PubMed Google Scholar) reveals that Ser334 and Ser338 are surface exposed (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the secondary protein kinase C sites Thr335 and Thr336 are less exposed; and the least favored site, Ser343 is on the opposite face of the surface containing the primary sites. Because the protein kinase C phosphorylation is unaffected by light (12Greene N.M. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6710-6717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), Ser334 is likely to be equally exposed in all conformations of the receptor. Although protein kinase C has a preference for basic residues near the phosphoacceptor site (22Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.-J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), accessibility, rather than a defined consensus sequence, appears to determine substrate specificity (23Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Thus, orientation and proximity to the membrane interface, where protein kinase C binds (23Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar), may be the driving force in promoting rhodopsin phosphorylation. The identification of the two in vivo phosphorylation sites on rhodopsin as protein kinase C phosphorylation sites underscores the importance of this second messenger-regulated kinase in regulation of rhodopsin function. The phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase and protein kinase C at distinct sites, in addition to the shared phosphorylation of Ser338, should allow mechanistic insight into what promotes the activity of each kinase under specific conditions.

Among the four AChR subunit genes, the ε subunit gene is strictly expressed in nuclei localized to the synaptic region of the muscle. To understand mechanisms of the regulation of synapse-specific transcription, we studied the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the AChR ε subunit gene in response to ARIA. Transgenes containing the wild type or mutant 5′-flanking regions upstream of a luciferase gene were transfected in C2C12 muscle cells. The promoter activity of these transgenes was determined by assaying activity of expressed luciferase. Analyzing a combination of 5′ deletion and site-directed mutants, we identified a 10-nucleotide element (position −55/−46), which was crucial for ARIA-induced expression from the ε subunit promoter. This element was named ARE for ARIA-responsiveelement. Mutation of ARE greatly diminished ARIA-induced transgene expression and deletion of ARE abolished completely the ARIA response. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses revealed a DNA binding activity in muscle nuclear extract that interacted with ARE. Such interaction was enhanced by ARIA stimulation of muscle cells and appeared to be dependent on nuclear protein phosphorylation.

The development and maintenance of a functional neuromuscular junction require that expression of all the molecular components be temporally and spatially regulated at the nerve-muscle contact. For example, the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ARIA, AChR-inducing activity; ARE, ARIA-responsive element; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SRE, serum-responsive element. 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; ARIA, AChR-inducing activity; ARE, ARIA-responsive element; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SRE, serum-responsive element.is highly enriched at the crests of the postjunctional folds at a concentration 3 orders of magnitude higher than in the extrasynaptic membrane (1Froehner S.C.

There are at least three mechanisms that contribute to control of AChR subunit gene expression. Myogenic factors, including MyoD, myogenin, myf5, and MRF4, appear to play an important role in the regulation of AChR gene expression during the myogenic differentiation program by binding directly to the E-box element located in sequences upstream of the transcription initiation site of AChR subunit genes (3Cheng T.C. Hanley T.A. Mudd J. Merlie J.P. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Piette J. Bessereau J.L. Huchet M. Changeux J.P.

Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This regulation is critical for muscle-specific expression of AChR subunit genes. Second, electrical activity of muscle fibers, resulting from motor nerve firing, appears to down-regulate transcription of AChR subunit genes in extrasynaptic nuclei (7Gilmour B.P. Goldman D. Chahine K.G. Gardner P.D. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 416-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Walke W. Xiao G. Goldman D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation by electrical activity is unclear. It has been suggested that the reduced rates of transcription may result from suppression of the transcriptional activation mediated by members of the MyoD family (9Duclert A. Changeux J.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Third, elevated transcription in those nuclei localized to the synaptic region of the muscle contributes to the maintenance of a high level of AChR mRNAs at the neuromuscular junction (9Duclert A. Changeux J.P. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Nature. 1985; 317: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Such synapse-specific transcription is believed to be mediated by ARIA, the trophic factor utilized by motoneurons to stimulate AChR synthesis (11Jessell T.M. Siegel R.E. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5397-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 12Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D.

ARIA binds to and activates its receptor, one or two members of the ErbB family of protein tyrosine kinases (14Jo S.A. Zhu X. Marchionni M.A. Burden S.J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) recently found that ARIA-induced AChR gene expression requires activation of the MAP kinase signal pathway. To characterize further the molecular mechanisms of synapse-specific transcription, we have analyzed the promoter of the AChR ε subunit. The mRNA coding for the ε subunit is restricted to junctional areas from the outset of its expression (19Brenner H.R. Witzemann V. Sakmann B. Nature. 1990; 344: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The synaptic localization of ε mRNAs is not affected by denervation, which produces a reappearance of other AChR subunit mRNAs in extrajunctional areas (19Brenner H.R. Witzemann V. Sakmann B. Nature. 1990; 344: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Witzemann V. Brenner H.R. Sakmann B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 125-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore a study of the ε subunit promoter activity in response to ARIA would provide a better understanding how expression of ε subunit is regulated during development. In addition, the ε subunit promoter is an excellent model for the study of synapse-specific transcription. In this report, we provide evidence that a 10-nucleotide element in the sequence upstream of the transcription initiation site, termed ARE, is required for ARIA-induced ε subunit expression in muscle cells. We also demonstrate that ARE binds specifically to a nuclear protein(s) in a manner dependent on ARIA stimulation of muscle cells and phosphorylation of nuclear proteins.

Calf intestinal phosphatase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals, including okadaic acid, were purchased from Sigma. Deletion mutants of the ε subunit promoter were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the pε3500-nlacZ plasmid as a template.

The downstream primer (Primer 2) was 5′-GGG AGA AGC TTG AGG GAA CAG G with aHindIII site. Point and internal deletion mutants of the ε subunit promoter were generated by the method of PCR overlap extension (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The pε3500-nlacZ plasmid was used as a template in the first PCR reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The sense oligonucleotides of the internal overlapping primers (with mutated bases underlined) were 5′-GGG ACA ACT TCG GGG GCA GCT G (position −89/−68) for the ets mutant, 5′-ATG GGG CAG CTG CCT CAT AAA CCC CCA CAG CAG GGG C (position −79/−43) for the AP-2 mutant, 5′-CTG CCT CCC CCA CCC AAG CAG CGT TGG CAG AGG ATT AGG TGA (position −70/−28) for the ARE mutant, 5′-CTG CCT CCC CCA CCC GGC AGA GGA TTA GGT GA (position −70/−28) for the ARE deletion mutant, and 5′-GGT GAC AGT CCC CAA ACC TAG CGA TAT CCT AAC ACC CTC CTC CCC TTC ACA (position −33/+18) for the N-box mutant. The two overlapping DNA fragments from the first PCR reaction were used as templates in the second PCR reaction with Primers 1 and 2. After digestion with HindIII, the PCR products were subcloned in pGL2-Basic (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene. The authenticity and orientation of the synthetic promoter fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. C2C12 cells were cultured as described previously (17Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts at approximately 50% confluence were co-transfected with an ε subunit promoter-luciferase transgene (20 μg of DNA) and a control plasmid (1 μg of DNA) (pCMVβ, which encodes β-galactosidase), by the standard calcium phosphate technique (23Sambrook J.

Luciferase assay was performed using a kit from Promega following the manufacturer's instruction. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (17Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol.

Luciferase activity of transgenes was normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. C2C12 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Cell nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were extracted in DNA binding buffer containing 12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 4 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Nuclear extract protein (10 μg) was incubated with 2 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI·dC), 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (∼10,000 cpm) in a final volume of 15 μl of DNA binding buffer. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of loading buffer and run onto a 4% acrylamide gel (24Ausubel F.M. Brent P. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc. and Greene Publishing Associates,Inc, 1994: 12.1.1-12.2.10Google Scholar). The radiolabeled probes were 5′-CCC CAC AGC AGG GG for ARE or 5′-CTA GCC CGG AAC TAA for N-box (25Duclert A. Servitor N. Schemer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In some experiments, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as a competitor, including the ARE or N-box wild type, ARE mutant (5′-CCA AGC AGC GTT GG), or SRE wild type (5′-CCC CAT ATT AGG GG). To determine the minimum length of the 5′ regulatory region required for promoter activity in response to ARIA, we generated transgenes containing a series of deletion mutants in the 5′-flanking region of the ε subunit gene. Transgenes were transfected in C2C12 muscle cells, and promoter activity was characterized by luciferase assay in ARIA-stimulated C2C12 myotubes. Expression of the −416-Luc transgene, which contains 416 nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site, was increased by ARIA stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The maximal response (around 2-fold) was achieved with 1 nmARIA, which agrees well the our previous observation using pε3500nlacZ in which expression of β-galactosidase is driven by the 3.5-kilobase 5′-flanking sequence of the ε subunit gene (17Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the promoter element(s) required for the ARIA response is contained within 416 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site. Therefore, the −416-Luc transgene was considered as equivalent to wild type for the purposes of this study. The ARIA response was specific to the ε subunit promoter, since the promoter of rat skeletal muscle voltage-sensitive sodium channel subtype 2 (skm-2) did not respond to ARIA stimulation (Fig.1 C). Promoter activities of the transgene deletion constructs −170-Luc, −78-Luc, and −45-Luc in myotubes in response to 1 nm ARIA are shown in Fig. 1 C. Seventy-eight nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site of the ε subunit gene was sufficient to confer an ARIA response. This is in agreement with previous observations that 150 and 83 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site of the ε subunit gene are sufficient to respond to ARIA (15Chu G.C. Moscoso L.M. Sliwkowski M.X. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and to confer preferential synaptic expression (25Duclert A. Servitor N. Schemer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), respectively. The transgene containing 45 nucleotides, however, failed to respond to ARIA, even at concentrations up to 10-fold higher than required for a maximal response with the wild type transgene (Fig. 1 D). The difference in the promoter activities between −78-Luc and −45-Luc indicated that the element required for ARIA response could be localized in the 34 nucleotides between −78 and −45. We previously demonstrated that ARIA-stimulated AChR gene expression requires MAP kinase activation (17Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Major transcription factors mediating MAP kinase action in mammalian cells include ternary complex factor proteins (for the ets element) (26Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and SRF (for the SRE element) (27Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Anticipating that the ARE-responsive element might be localized between −78 and −45, we identified and selectively mutated a number of sites in this region, concentrating on elements that could potentially bind transcription factors regulated by the MAP kinase pathway. Among the sites mutated, a ten-nucleotide element (CCA CAG CAG G, position −55/−46) was included. This element was chosen because it resembles SRE, having two cytidines on the 5′ end and two guanosines on the 3′ end (27Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). However, it differs from SRE in that the intervening 6 nucleotides have two cytidines and one guanosine instead of purely adenosines or thymidines as in the consensus SRE. Replacement of adenosines or thymidines with cytidines or guanosines in the internal 6 nucleotides dramatically decreases or diminishes SRE binding activity (28Johansen F.-E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, the putative ets site (CAG GAT), which we identified at −83/−78, the putative AP-2 element (position −64/−54), and the N-box element (−11/−6), which was recently found to be required for synapse-specific expression (28Johansen F.-E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), were also mutated. All mutants were made in the −416-Luc construct. While ets and AP-2 mutants diminished basal expression, they had no effect on ARIA-stimulated expression. By contrast, mutation of the 10-nucleotide SRE-like element attenuated greatly or abolished the ε promoter activity in response to ARIA (Fig. 2). Myotubes possessing this mutant transgene failed to respond to concentrations of ARIA sufficient to activate the wild type transgene (Fig. 3 A). However, an increase in mutant transgene expression was observed at 10 nm ARIA. These data strongly suggested that this 10-nucleotide element may be required for the ARIA-induced ε subunit gene expression. We named this element ARE forARIA-responsive element. To confirm that ARE is required for the ARIA response, we tested the promoter activity of an ARE deletion mutant (ARE.Δ). As shown in Fig.3 B, the ARE.Δ mutant promoter failed to confer ARIA response even at 10 nm of ARIA. While this work was in progress, Duclert et al. (25Duclert A. Servitor N. Schemer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reported that the N-box is crucial for synaptic expression of AChR ε subunit gene. Using anin vivo expression assay in intact muscles, the authors observed that 5′ deletion mutants (−83 and −75) of ε subunit promoter provided approximately the same level of expression, whereas −63 and −52 5′ deletion mutants gave a decreased expression and the −36 nucleotide construct did not express. This observation prompted that authors to suggest “the presence of an activating element” in this region. In addition, site-directed mutation in this region diminished synaptic expression of the ε subunit gene (25Duclert A. Servitor N. Schemer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We believe that ARE may be the activating element in this region crucial for synaptic expression.Figure 3Response of ARE-mutated transgenes to ARIA stimulation. A, response of ARE point mutant transgene (ARE.m) to indicated concentration of ARIA. B, response of ARE-deletion mutant transgene (ARE.Δ) to indicated concentration of ARIA. The mutant transgenes were co-transfected with pCMVβ in C2C12 myoblasts. After ARIA treatment, C2C12 myotubes were lyzed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. The presented luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Open histogramsindicate the basal activity, whereas hatched histogramsindicate the promoter activity in response to ARIA stimulation. These data represent the mean ± S.D. of three or more independent experiments. **, p < 0.01 in comparison with basal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses were performed to determine if ARE was able to interact with nuclear proteins in ARIA-stimulated myotubes. Using [γ-32P]ATP-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the ARE element as a probe, we detected a prominent complex on the autoradiogram of a 4% acrylamide gel (Fig. 4 A). The interaction between the ARE probe and nuclear binding protein was specific. First, formation of the complex was competitively inhibited by a 10- or 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded wild type ARE oligonucleotides. In contrast, ARE mutant oligonucleotides required a much higher concentration to disrupt the complex formation. Second, 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a typical SRE element had little, if any, inhibitory effect on the ARE nuclear protein binding complex (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that ARE interacted with a protein different from those that interact with SRE. Interestingly, formation of the specific complex was enhanced by ARIA stimulation of C2C12 myotubes. Treatment of myotubes with ARIA increased the binding activity by at least 2-fold (Fig.4 B). These results suggested that ARE interacted with a nuclear protein(s). Knowing that activation of MAP kinase is required for ARIA-induced AChR gene expression (17Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 18Tansey M.G. Chu G.C. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we attempted to determine whether the ARE nuclear binding activity was regulated by MAP kinase activity. Myotubes were treated with PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase, which is able to disrupt MAP kinase activation and ARIA-induced AChR gene expression in C2C12 cells (17Si J. Luo Z. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19752-19759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ARE binding activity was decreased in PD98059-treated myotube nuclear extract (Fig. 4 B). Incubation of myotube nuclear extract with calf intestinal phosphatase to dephosphorylate nuclear proteins attenuated the ARE binding activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C). There appeared to be a high level of endogenous phosphatase activity in myotube nuclear extract. Preincubation of myotube nuclear extract at 30 °C for 15 min alone, without the addition of exogenous phosphatase, was able to decrease ARE binding activity (Fig.4 C). Moreover, the preincubation-induced decrease in ARE nuclear binding activity was blocked by 2 nm okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases (Fig.4 C). Thus the ARE binding activity may derive from a phosphoprotein that has an enhanced DNA binding activity in the phosphorylated state. The phosphatase activity in C2C12 myotubes may be due to protein phosphatase 2A, a phosphatase which is specifically inhibited by okadaic acid at a nanomolar concentration (29Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). Recently, a cis-element of 6 nucleotides (−11/−6) in the ε subunit promoter was identified and implicated in compartmentalized expression of AChR genes at the neuromuscular junction (25Duclert A. Servitor N. Schemer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We found that although mutating the N-box dramatically decreased basal expression of the transgene, the N-box mutant promoter was still able to respond to ARIA stimulation (Fig.2 C). Using the N-box probe, we detected a binding activity in the C2C12 myotube nuclear extract (Fig.5 A), confirming the previous observation (25Duclert A. Servitor N. Schemer L. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This binding activity was specific, since it was inhibited by excess unlabeled double-stranded N-box oligonucleotides (Fig.5 A). Stimulation of C2C12 cells with ARIA, or with ARIA in the presence of PD98059, did not appear to affect the N-box binding activity (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that N-box may not be crucial for ARIA-induced ε subunit gene expression in C2C12 cells. In summary, we have identified ARE, a 10-nucleotide element (CCA CAG CAG G, position −55/−46) in the ε subunit promoter, which was required for ARIA-induced expression of ε subunit gene in C2C12 muscle cells. ARE was able to interact with a nuclear protein(s). Furthermore, interaction between ARE and the nuclear protein was enhanced by ARIA stimulation of muscle cells and seemed to depend on phosphorylation of nuclear proteins. Experiments to elucidate the identity of the ARE binding protein are currently in progress. We thank Dr. Wen C. Xiong for advice; Drs.
