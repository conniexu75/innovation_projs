In the present report these methods are employed to study the influence of amino acids. peptides, and other compounds upon the reaction. In addition, we present the results of attempts to account for all the main products formed in the reaction in both the presence and absence of the amino acid, arginine. Data on the distribution of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in a variety of organs and animal species are also given."

https://openalex.org/W185660783,"Recent studies on the enzymic mechanisms of protein synthesis have emphasized the importance of the “activation” of the cu-carboxyl groups of amino acids, i.e. the conversion of the amino acids into reactive acylating agents. The work of numerous investigators (for a recent review, see Chantrenne (1)) has suggested that this activation process, which requires the participation of adenosine 5’-triphosphate, involves the formation of a-aminoacyladenylates, which are thought to be the reactive amino acid derivatives in the biosynthesis of proteins from free amino acids. In view of the present state of our knowledge, it is desirable to consider the possible role, in protein synthesis, of other low molecular weight derivatives of amino acids. In previous publications from this laboratory (2, 3), it was reported that intracellular proteolytic enzymes catalyze transamidation reactions of the type,"
