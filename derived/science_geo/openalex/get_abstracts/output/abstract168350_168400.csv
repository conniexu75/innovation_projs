https://openalex.org/W2007998678,"Previous studies demonstrate that interleukin-6 (IL-6) mediates growth and survival in human multiple myeloma (MM) cells via the MEK/MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, respectively. IL-6 also confers protection against Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis via activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2). In the current study, we characterized IL-6 triggered phophatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt kinase (PI3-K/Akt) signaling in MM cells. IL-6 induces Akt/PKB phosphorylation in a time and dose dependent manner in MM.1S MM cells. IL-6 also induced phosphorylation of downstream targets of Akt, including Bad, GSK-3β, and FKHR, confirming Akt activation. Inhibition of Akt activation by the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 partially blocked IL-6 triggered MEK/MAPK activation and proliferation in MM.1S cells, suggesting cross-talk between PI3-K and MEK signaling. We demonstrate that Dex-induced apoptosis in MM.1S cells is mediated by downstream activation of caspase-9, with resultant caspase-3 cleavage; and conversely, that IL-6 triggers activation of PI3-K and its association with SHP2, inactivates caspase-9, and protects against Dex-induced apoptosis. LY294002 completely abrogates this signaling cascade, further confirming the importance of PI3-K/Akt signaling in conferring the protective effect of IL-6 against Dex-induced apoptosis. Finally, we show that IL-6 triggered PI3-K/Akt signaling in MM.1S cells inactivates forkhead transcriptional factor (FKHR), with related G1/S phase transition, whereas LY294002 blocks this signaling, resulting in upregulation of p27KIP1 and G1 growth arrest. Our data therefore suggest that PI3-K/Akt signaling mediates growth, survival, and cell cycle regulatory effects of IL-6 in MM."

https://openalex.org/W1983645982,"Resistance of tumors to treatment with cytotoxic drugs, irradiation or immunotherapy may be due to disrupted apoptosis programs. Here, we report in a variety of different tumor cells including Ewing tumor, neuroblastoma, malignant brain tumors and melanoma that caspase-8 expression acts as a key determinant of sensitivity for apoptosis induced by death-inducing ligands or cytotoxic drugs. In tumor cell lines resistant to TRAIL, anti-CD95 or TNFalpha, caspase-8 protein and mRNA expression was decreased or absent without caspase-8 gene loss. Methylation-specific PCR revealed hypermethylation of caspase-8 regulatory sequences in cells with impaired caspase-8 expression. Treatment with the demethylation agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-dAzaC) reversed hypermethylation of caspase-8 resulting in restoration of caspase-8 expression and recruitment and activation of caspase-8 at the CD95 DISC upon receptor cross-linking thereby sensitizing for death receptor-, and importantly, also for drug-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-8 activity also inhibited apoptosis sensitization by 5-dAzaC. Similar to demethylation, introduction of caspase-8 by gene transfer sensitized for apoptosis induction. Hypermethylation of caspase-8 was linked to reduced caspase-8 expression in different tumor cell lines in vitro and, most importantly, also in primary tumor samples. Thus, these findings indicate that re-expression of caspase-8, e.g. by demethylation or caspase-8 gene transfer, might be an effective strategy to restore sensitivity for chemotherapy- or death receptor-induced apoptosis in various tumors in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2330545449,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is common and is a major cause of renal failure. Although the genetics of ADPKD are well known and have led to the discovery of polycystins, a new protein family, the pathogenesis of the disease remains largely unknown. Recent studies have indicated that the β-catenin signaling pathway is one of the targets of the transduction pathway controlled by the polycystins. We have generated transgenic mice that overproduce an oncogenic form of β-catenin in the epithelial cells of the kidney. These mice developed severe polycystic lesions soon after birth that affected the glomeruli, proximal, distal tubules and collecting ducts. The phenotype of these mice mimicked the human ADPKD phenotype. Cyst formation was associated with an increase in cell proliferation and apoptosis. The cell proliferation and apoptotic indexes was increased 4–5-fold and 3–4-fold, respectively, in cystic tubules of the transgenic mice compared to that of littermate controls. Our findings provide experimental genetic evidence that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway causes polycystic kidney disease and support the view that dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in its pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2079729042,"Under hypoxia, HIF-1alpha binds to aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT, also called HIF-1beta) to activate expression of genes important for cell survival. Alternatively, HIF-1alpha can bind to the tumor suppressor p53 and promote p53-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that the opposite functions of HIF-1alpha are distinguished by its phosphorylation status. Two distinguishable forms of HIF-1alpha, phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, were induced during hypoxia-induced apoptosis. The phosphorylated HIF-1alpha was the major form that bound to ARNT. Ectopically expressed ARNT was consistently able to enhance HIF-1alpha phosphorylation in a binding-dependent manner. In contrast, the dephosphorylated HIF-1alpha was the major form that bound to p53. Depletion of the dephosphorylated HIF-1alpha, by using the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin A that had little effect on the phosphorylated HIF-1alpha expression, suppressed p53 induction and subsequent apoptosis. Depletion of dephosphorylated HIF-1alpha also prevented hypoxia-induced nuclear accumulation of HDM2, a negative regulator of p53. Our results indicate that the functions of HIF-1alpha varied with its phosphorylation status and that dephosphorylated HIF-1alpha mediated apoptosis by binding to and stabilizing p53."
https://openalex.org/W1988070591,"The 100-kDa “a” subunit of the vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) is encoded by two genes in yeast, VPH1 and STV1. The Vph1p-containing complex localizes to the vacuole, whereas the Stv1p-containing complex resides in some other intracellular compartment, suggesting that the a subunit contains information necessary for the correct targeting of the V-ATPase. We show that Stv1p localizes to a late Golgi compartment at steady state and cycles continuously via a prevacuolar endosome back to the Golgi. V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p and Stv1p also differ in their assembly properties, coupling of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis, and dissociation in response to glucose depletion. To identify the regions of the a subunit that specify these different properties, chimeras were constructed containing the cytosolic amino-terminal domain of one isoform and the integral membrane, carboxyl-terminal domain from the other isoform. Like the Stv1p-containing complex, the V-ATPase complex containing the chimera with the amino-terminal domain of Stv1p localized to the Golgi and the complex did not dissociate in response to glucose depletion. Like the Vph1p-containing complex, the V-ATPase complex containing the chimera with the amino-terminal domain of Vph1p localized to the vacuole and the complex exhibited normal dissociation upon glucose withdrawal. Interestingly, the V-ATPase complex containing the chimera with the carboxyl-terminal domain of Vph1p exhibited a higher coupling of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis than the chimera containing the carboxyl-terminal domain of Stv1p. Our results suggest that whereas targeting and in vivo dissociation are controlled by sequences located in the amino-terminal domains of the subunit a isoforms, coupling efficiency is controlled by the carboxyl-terminal region.

Acidification of these compartments is crucial for such processes as receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, the processing and degradation of macromolecules, and the coupled transport of small molecules. In addition, V-ATPases in the plasma membrane of specialized cells function in such processes as pH homeostasis (9Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7645-7654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bone resorption (10Chatterjee D. Chakraborty M. Leit M. Neff L. Jamsa-Kellokumpu S. Fuchs R. Baron R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The V-ATPase complex is composed of the following two domains: a soluble V1 domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis and an integral V0 domain responsible for proton translocation (1Stevens T.H.

The V1 domain is a 500-kDa complex composed of eight different subunits (subunits A–H) of molecular masses 70 to 14 kDa, whereas the V0 domain is a 250-kDa complex containing five different subunits (subunits a, d, c, c′, and c“) of molecular masses 100 to 16 kDa (1Stevens T.H.

The V-ATPases thus resemble in domain structure the F-ATPases (or ATP synthases) that normally function in ATP synthesis (18Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J.

An evolutionary relationship between these classes has been established by the sequence homology that exists between several subunits in these ATPases (24Bowman E.J. Tenney K. Bowman B. J. Biol.

The 100-kDa “a” subunit of the V0 domain has a bipartite structure containing a hydrophilic amino-terminal domain of ∼50 kDa and a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal domain containing multiple transmembrane helices (27Perin M.S.

Topological studies employing cysteine mutagenesis and chemical labeling have led to a model for the a subunit containing nine transmembrane helices, with the amino-terminal domain on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and the carboxyl terminus on the luminal side of the membrane (30Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), although data suggesting a cytoplasmic orientation of the carboxyl terminus have also been reported (31Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have identified several buried charged residues in the last two transmembrane helices that appear to play some role in proton transport (32Leng X.H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Leng X.H. Manolson M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that the 100-kDa subunit functions analogously to subunit a of the F-ATPases. It is the interaction between the F-ATPase a subunit and the ring of proteolipid c subunits that is thought to facilitate proton movement through the F0 domain (19Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vik S.B. Long J.C. Wada T. Zhang D. Biochim. Biophys.

In yeast the a subunit is encoded by two genes (VPH1 andSTV1), which show ∼50% identity at the amino acid level (28Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vph1p has been shown to associate with V-ATPases targeted to the vacuole, whereas Stv1p is present in V-ATPase complexes localized to some other intracellular compartment (29Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the signal responsible for this differential localization is not known, but the role of the a subunit in targeting is supported by data from mammalian cells. Thus, in mouse, the a subunit is also encoded by multiple genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (36Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 37Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), whereas the a4 isoform localizes to the plasma membrane of renal intercalated cells (38Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S. Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Lifton R.P. Scherer S.W. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition to differences in localization, the a subunit isoforms in yeast have also been shown to differ in their ability to assemble with the V1 domain, in the coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis and in their ability to undergo in vivodissociation in response to glucose depletion (39Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This latter process has been shown to play an important role in regulation of V-ATPase activity in yeast cells (40Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been suggested to function in regulation in higher eukaryotes as well (41Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Early F.G.

Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To identify the regions of the a subunit responsible for these differences, chimeric proteins have been constructed containing the amino-terminal domain of one isoform and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the other. Our results suggest that intracellular targeting and in vivodissociation of the V1 domain are controlled by signals residing within the amino-terminal domain. In contrast, the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation is controlled by the carboxyl-terminal domain. Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku America (Ijamsville, MD).

The plasmids pSKN14 and pSKN25 were generated by digestion of pSKN11 and pSKN23 with XbaI andBamHI followed by subcloning of the insert into the 2-μm plasmid YEp352. pSKN34 was generated by deletion of the region corresponding to Pro165–Pro208 of Vph1p. Yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table I. Strains were constructed by standard genetic techniques and grown in rich medium (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% dextrose; YEPD) or synthetic dextrose minimal medium with appropriate supplements (SD; see Ref. 44Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 207-217Google Scholar). YEPD buffered to pH 5.0, 5.5, or 7.5 and YEPD with 100 mm CaCl2 were also used for the selection and growth of Vma− strains (16Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Strains KEBY2, KEBY4, and KEBY9 were derived from SF838-1D, and all other strains were from SF838−9D. Strain KEBY4 was generated by transforming KEBY2 withSalI- and NotI-cut pKEB11. Kanamycin-resistant colonies were selected on YEPD with 200 μg/ml geneticin sulfate (G418). Insertion of the Kan r gene into theSTV1 ORF was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides complementary to the STV1sequence and to a sequence within Kan r . Loss of Stv1p-HA was assessed by Western blot using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. KEBY4 (stv1Δ::Kan r ) was then transformed with ApaI/BamHI-digested pBJ6714, and Leu+ colonies were selected for lack of growth on YEPD with 100 mm CaCl2, producing KEBY9. Strain KEBY44 was created by transformation of NBY72 withEcoRI-digested pDJ74. Colonies were selected on medium lacking uracil and were then plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing minimal medium to select for Ura− loop outs. The presence of Stv1p-HA was confirmed by Western blot. Strain KEBY45 was derived from KEBY44 by transformation with BamHI- andPstI-digested pKJH2. Colonies selected on medium lacking leucine were screened for deletion of VPS27 by colony overlay assay to detect CPY secretion (45Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and by immunofluorescence with anti-Pep12p to screen for class E Vps− vacuolar morphology (46Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (45Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in YEPD or YEPD, pH 5.0, at 30 °C to 1A 600/ml, fixed by the addition of 3% formaldehyde, incubated for 1 h, and then followed by a 16-h incubation at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde, 50 mm KPO4, pH 6.5. Cells were converted to spheroplasts using 250 μg/ml Zymolyase 100T and permeabilized by treatment with 5% SDS for 5 min or 1% SDS for 2 min, as described in the figure legends. Cells were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated multiwell slides. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation of the cells in phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum. All antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, which was also used for all washes. Antibodies against ALP, Pep12p, and HA were pre-absorbed to yeast proteins (to remove nonspecific binding) by incubation withpho8Δ,pep12Δ or cells without an HA-tagged protein, respectively. Antibody incubations were performed at room temperature as follows: 2 h for primary antibodies (except 4 h for anti-ALP) and 1 h for secondary and tertiary antibodies. The affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against the HA epitope was used at a dilution of 1/200 and the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11) at 1/500. Monoclonal antibodies against ALP and Pep12p were used at dilutions of 1/3 for anti-ALP tissue culture supernatant and 1/1000 for purified anti-Pep12p. Images were generated using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Yeast cells transformed with pSKN11 (Stv1p-HA), pSKN13 (Vph1p-HA), pSKN23 (Stv1-Vph1p-HA), or pSKN24 (Vph1-Stv1p-HA) were grown to log phase at 30 °C in selective medium; whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (39Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide gels. The expression of the 100-kDa subunits was detected by Western blotting using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA. To evaluate assembly of the V-ATPase, the complex was detergent-solubilized from whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against subunit A of the V1 domain, as described previously (39Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Following separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide gels, Western blotting was performed using antibodies against both subunit A and the HA epitope. Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). The assembly competence of the chimeric proteins was reflected by their ability to be immunoprecipitated using the anti-A subunit antibody. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated as described previously (39Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Yeast transformed with pSKN13 (Vph1p-HA), pSKN14 (Stv1p-HA), pSKN24 (Vph1-Stv1p-HA), or pSKN25 (Stv1-Vph1p-HA) were grown overnight at 30 °C to 1 × 107 cells/ml in 1 liter of selective medium. Cells were pelleted, washed once with water, and resuspended in 10 mmdithiothreitol and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, cells were pelleted and washed once with YEPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm Mes-Tris, pH 7.5. Cells were then resuspended in YEPD medium containing 0.7 msorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm Mes-Tris, pH 7.5, and 50 μg/ml of Zymolase 100T and incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 60 min. The resulting spheroplasts were osmotically lysed, and the vacuoles were isolated by flotation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients. Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Vacuolar membranes isolated from each of the mutants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were probed with the mouse monoclonal antibodies 3F10 against HA, 8B1-F3 against the A subunit (Vma1p), and 13D11-B2 against the B subunit (Vma2p). Blots were also probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Vma6p, Vma7p, Vma8p, Vma10p, and Vma13p, as well as Vma4p (a generous gift of Dr. Daniel J. Klionsky), and a mouse monoclonal antibody against Vma5p (a generous gift of Dr. Patricia M. Kane). Following removal of unbound primary antibodies by washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and developed using chemiluminescence as above. Dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion was measured as described previously (39Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The vph1Δ stv1Δ strain KEBY9 expressing Vph1p-HA, Stv1p-HA, Vph1-Stv1p-HA, or Stv1-Vph1p-HA from the single copy plasmid pRS316 was grown in selective medium overnight to an absorbance at 600 nm of <1.0. The cells were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with Zymolase 100T and incubated in YEP media with or without 2% glucose for 40 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% C12E9, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). An aliquot (corresponding to ∼6 × 105cells) was removed to allow analysis of proteins present in the whole cell lysate. The V-ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated from the remainder of the lysate (corresponding to ∼3 × 106cells) using 8B1-F3 against the A subunit and protein G-agarose followed by separation on 8% acrylamide gels and transfer to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was then performed separately"

https://openalex.org/W1983638975,"Secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) encodes a member of a protein family that contains a cysteine-rich domain similar to the WNT-binding site of Frizzled receptors and regulates the WNT pathway. The WNT pathway is frequently altered in human cancers. We have defined the pattern of SFRP1 mRNA expression in the progression of breast cancer. We show that SFRP1 is expressed in the epithelial component of normal breast, in the in situ component of ductal carcinomas and is lost in more than 80% of invasive breast carcinomas except the medullary type. Loss of SFRP1 expression is correlated with the presence of hormonal receptors. Conversely, the maintenance of SFRP1 in carcinomas is correlated with the presence of lymphoplasmocytic stroma. No significant association was observed between SFRP1 status and the level of apoptosis in tumoral cells."

https://openalex.org/W2326886626,"SHP-2 is a ubiquitously expressed non-transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains. Multiple reverse-genetic studies have indicated that SHP-2 is a required component for organ and animal development. SHP-2 wild-type and homozygous mutant mouse fibroblast cells in which the N-terminal SH2 domain was target-deleted were used to examine the function of SHP-2 in regulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K) activation by growth factors. In addition, SHP-2 and various mutants were introduced into human glioblastoma cells as well as SHP-2(-/-) mouse fibroblasts. We found that EGF stimulation and EGFR oncoprotein (DeltaEGFR) expression independently induced the co-immunoprecipitation of the p85 subunit of PI3K with SHP-2. Targeted deletion of the N-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 severely impaired PDGF- and IGF-induced Akt phosphorylation. Ectopic expression of SHP-2 in U87MG gliobastoma cells elevated EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation, and the effect was abolished by mutation of its N-terminal SH2 domain. Likewise, the reconstitution of SHP-2 expression in the SHP-2(-/-) cells enhanced Akt phosphorylation induced by EGF while rescuing that induced by PDGF and IGF. Further lipid kinase activity assays confirmed that SHP-2 modulation of Akt phosphorylation correlated with its regulation of PI3K activation. Based on these results, we conclude that SHP-2 is required for mediating PI3K/Akt activation, and the N-terminal SH2 domain is critically important for a ""positive"" role of SHP-2 in regulating PI3K pathway activation."

https://openalex.org/W1999374104,"Disulfide forms of homocysteine account for >98% of total homocysteine in plasma from healthy individuals. We recently reported that homocysteine reacts with albumin-Cys34-S–S-cysteine to form homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide and albumin-Cys34thiolate anion. The latter then reacts with homocystine or homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide to form albumin-bound homocysteine (Sengupta, S., Chen, H., Togawa, T., DiBello, P. M., Majors, A. K., Büdy, B., Ketterer, M. E., and Jacobsen, D. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 30111–30117). We now extend these studies to show that human albumin, but not ceruloplasmin, mediates the conversion of homocysteine to its low molecular weight disulfide forms (homocystine and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide) by thiol/disulfide exchange reactions. Only a small fraction of homocystine is formed by an oxidative process in which copper bound to albumin, but not ceruloplasmin, mediates the reaction. When copper is removed from albumin by chelation, the overall conversion of homocysteine to its disulfide forms is reduced by only 20%. Ceruloplasmin was an ineffective catalyst of homocysteine oxidation, and immunoprecipitation of ceruloplasmin from human plasma did not inhibit the capacity of plasma to mediate the conversion of homocysteine to its disulfide forms. In contrast, ceruloplasmin was a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidation of cysteine and cysteinylglycine to cystine and bis(-S-cysteinylglycine), respectively. However, when thiols (cysteine and homocysteine) that are disulfide-bonded to albumin-Cys34 are removed by treatment with dithiothreitol to form albumin-Cys34–SH (mercaptalbumin), the conversion of homocysteine to its disulfide forms is completely blocked. In conclusion, albumin mediates the formation of disulfide forms of homocysteine by thiol/disulfide exchange, whereas ceruloplasmin converts cysteine to cystine by copper-dependent autooxidation. Disulfide forms of homocysteine account for >98% of total homocysteine in plasma from healthy individuals.

In healthy individuals plasma total homocysteine (tHcy)1 concentrations range from 5 to 12 μm, and >98% of tHcy is in a disulfide form (7Jacobsen D.W. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein disulfide-bound homo-cysteine accounts for ≥70% of tHcy, and the remaining homo-cysteine is found as free low molecular weight disulfide forms including homocystine and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide (HCMD) (8Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Less than 2% of tHcy in circulation exists in the free reduced sulfhydryl (−SH) form (8Mansoor M.A. Svardal A.M. Ueland P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In addition a small amount of homocysteine (∼10% tHcy) may be present as “homocystamide,” the reaction product formed between homocysteine thiolactone and protein lysine residues (9Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that homocysteine is exported from cells into circulation in the free reduced sulfhydryl form due to the low redox potential of the intracellular milieu. However, there are few detailed mechanistic studies on the formation of the disulfide forms of homocysteine in circulation. It has been reported that ceruloplasmin catalyzes the autooxidation of cysteine to cystine (10Feldman S.L. Hunter J.S.V. Zgirski A. Chidambaram M.V. Frieden E. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1982; 17: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the autooxidation of homocysteine to homocystine with the production of hydrogen peroxide (11Starkebaum G. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms proposed for homocysteine-induced vascular dysfunction involves the generation of reactive oxygen species during the presumed transition metal-catalyzed oxidation of circulating homocysteine (11Starkebaum G. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 12Wall R.T. Harlan J.M. Harker L.A. Striker G.E. Thromb.

However, this proposal seems unlikely because the concentration of cysteine in normal plasma exceeds that of homocysteine by 20–30-fold, and although it undergoes similar oxidative chemistry, cysteine is usually not considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (17Jacobsen D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that HCMD is preferentially formed when homocysteine reacts with albumin-Cys34-S–S-Cys (albumin-bound cysteine) (18Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The other product of the reaction, albumin-Cys34-S− (albumin thiolate anion), then reacts with either HCMD or homocystine to form albumin-Cys34-S–S-Hcy (albumin-bound homocysteine). This reaction, which occurs by thiol/disulfide exchange, mechanistically accounts for the formation of albumin-bound homocysteine, the major form of homocysteine in circulation (18Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize that albumin could play a critical role in the formation of homocystine and other low molecular weight disulfide forms of homocysteine as well. In the current report, we provide evidence showing that albumin drives homocysteine chemistry in circulation largely through thiol/disulfide exchange mechanisms, whereas ceruloplasmin drives cysteine chemistry largely through oxidative mechanisms. This study proposes a unified mechanism to account for the formation of the circulating forms of cysteine and homocysteine. A better understanding of the thiol/disulfide exchange chemistry of homocysteine and its disulfide forms may provide insight into the true atherothrombogenic potential of this important risk factor for vascular disease. l-Homocysteine thiolactone,l-cysteine, glutathione, cysteinylglycine, TES, Trizma® (Tris base), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB or Ellman's reagent), and dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from Sigma. Ceruloplasmin was purchased from Calbiochem. Monobromobimane was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Perchloric acid, HPLC grade acetonitrile, and HPLC grade methanol were from Fisher. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human ceruloplasmin IgG was obtained from Accurate Chemical (Westbury, NY). All other chemicals used in this study were of reagent grade. Blood was collected from healthy donors by venipuncture into heparinized vacutainer tubes. The tubes were placed on ice and processed within 1 h as follows. After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, the clear supernatant was transferred to cryo tubes and stored at −70 °C. Crystalline human serum albumin (Sigma A-1653; lot number 88H7610) was used in these studies. The albumin preparation contained 0.23 mol of –SH/mol protein, 0.33 mol of –S–S-cysteine/mol protein, and 0.015 mol of –S–S-homocysteine/mol protein as determined by analytical high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) (19Jacobsen D.W.

The metal content of this preparation was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) (20Houk R.S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 333-339Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were digested in nitric acid using polytetrafluoroethylene test tubes with71Ga as an internal standard. The crystalline albumin preparation was found to contain 3.62 ppm copper, 12.96 ppm iron, 0.015 ppm cobalt, and 0.35 ppm nickel.

Briefly,l-homocysteine thiolactone was hydrolyzed with 5.0m NaOH for 5 min at 37 °C to open the thiolactone ring. The solution was then neutralized with 2.0 n HCl and diluted with 0.05 m TES buffer (pH 7.3) to obtain the desired stock concentration of l-homocysteine. The concentration of l-homocysteine was determined by the method of Ellman (22Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21374) Google Scholar). Human albumin thiolate anion (albumin-Cys34–S−) was prepared as described by Sogami et al. (23Sogami M. Nakoga S. Era S. Honda M. Noguchi K. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1984; 24: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 mm human serum albumin in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl (pH 6.86) was treated with 5.0 mm DTT at 25 °C for 45 min. It was then dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against 0.05 m TES buffer (pH 7.3) to remove excess DTT. By using the method of Ellman (22Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21374) Google Scholar), the dialyzed albumin was found to contain 1 mol of free thiol per mol of albumin suggesting that, under these conditions, none of the 17 intrachain disulfide bonds of human albumin were reduced. This form of albumin is referred to as “mercaptalbumin.” Because the pKa of albumin-Cys34-SH is unusually low (−5), it exists primarily as albumin thiolate anion at a physiological pH. Ceruloplasmin was immunoprecipitated from human plasma by treatment with rabbit anti-human ceruloplasmin antiserum for 2 h at room temperature in 0.05 m TES buffer (pH 7.3) followed by incubation with protein G-agarose for 2 h in the same buffer and centrifugation. The ceruloplasmin-deficient supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon-10 filters (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and stored at −20 °C. Control plasma was treated in the same manner, except that the anti-ceruloplasmin antibody was omitted. Complete removal of the ceruloplasmin was verified by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gel (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) followed by Western blotting with rabbit anti-human ceruloplasmin antiserum. Albumin was removed from human plasma by affinity chromatography (25Travis J. Bowen J. Tewskesbury D. Johnson D. Pannell R. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) using Cibacron blue-agarose (Sigma) that was equilibrated with 0.05 mTris-HCl containing 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.0). Human plasma was applied to the column, and fractions were collected until the absorbance (A 280) was less than 0.1. Bound albumin was then eluted from the column with the same buffer containing 0.2 m NaSCN. Both the albumin-deficient fraction and the albumin-rich fraction were concentrated by freeze-drying, redissolved in 0.05 m TES buffer (pH 7.3), and dialyzed against the same buffer to remove residual NaSCN. Protein concentrations in the two fractions were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18586) Google Scholar). A dose-dependent study on the ability of CuSO4 to catalyze the autooxidation of 500 μml-homocysteine was carried out by monitoring the levels of homocysteine remaining in the reaction mixture with DTNB. Additional oxidation studies on cysteine, cysteinylglycine, glutathione, and homocysteine were carried out by incubating 500 μmsolutions of either thiol with 25 μm CuSO4 in 0.05 m TES buffer (pH 7.3). Aliquots (0.05 ml) were withdrawn at various time points and added directly to tubes containing DTNB reagent (22Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21374) Google Scholar). The amount of free thiol remaining was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 at 412 nm. The DTNB method for determining sulfhydryl compounds is unreliable in solutions containing protein. For this reason an HPLC method using the sulfhydryl-specific reagent monobromobimane was employed (19Jacobsen D.W. Gatautis V.J. Green R. Robinson K. Savon S.R. Secic M. Ji J. Otto J.M. Taylor Jr., L.M. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Solutions (500 μm) ofl-homocysteine, l-cysteine, cysteinylglycine, or glutathione were incubated with either human plasma or physiological concentrations of human serum albumin or ceruloplasmin in 0.05m TES buffer (pH 7.3) for different times. Aliquots of the sample were withdrawn and directly added to tubes containing 7.0 mm monobromobimane in 4.0 mm EDTA (pH 7.0). The tubes were incubated at 42 °C for 12 min, allowed to cool to room temperature for 20 min, and then 0.025 ml of 1.5 mperchloric acid was added. The tubes were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to pellet precipitated protein. The supernatant was then adjusted to pH 4.0 by addition of 0.006 ml of 2.0m Trizma® base. Samples (0.10 ml) were transferred to injector vials for the determination of thiols by HPLC-FD as described by Jacobsen et al. (19Jacobsen D.W. Gatautis V.J. Green R. Robinson K. Savon S.R. Secic M. Ji J. Otto J.M. Taylor Jr., L.M. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Standard curves were generated with known amounts of l-homocysteine,l-cysteine, cysteinylglycine, and glutathione to calculate the concentrations of the two thiols in the reaction mixtures. The same protocol was used to study the oxidation of homocysteine by albumin thiolate anion, human plasma, ceruloplasmin-depleted human plasma, and albumin-deficient human plasma. For experiments designed to study the effect of protein-bound transition metals on the oxidation of thiols, human plasma, ceruloplasmin-depleted human plasma, or human serum albumin were incubated with 5.0 mm DTPA for 3 h in 0.05m TES buffer (pH 7.3) at 25 °C and then dialyzed exhaustively. Control plasma, albumin, or ceruloplasmin-depleted plasma (without the addition of DTPA) were processed similarly. The protein preparations were then incubated with biological thiols, and the amounts of free thiol remaining in the reaction mixtures were determined by HPLC-FD as described above. The content of homocysteine covalently bound to albumin by disulfide linkage (albumin-Cys34-S–S-homocysteine) was determined by HPLC-FD as described previously (18Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T.

Briefly, reaction mixtures (0.05 ml) containing albumin preparations were added to tubes containing 0.1 ml of 1.5 m perchloric acid, vortexed, incubated in an ice-bath for 10 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The protein pellet was washed three times with 0.1 ml of 1.5 m perchloric acid. The washed pellet was solubilized in 0.1 ml of 0.5 m Tris buffer (pH 8.5), treated with 0.035 ml of 1.43 m sodium borohydride in 0.10 m NaOH, and neutralized with 0.035 ml of 1.0 m HCl. Then 0.05 ml of 7.0 mm monobromobimane in 4.0 mm sodium EDTA (pH 7.0) was added, and the solution was incubated at 42 °C for 12 min. After incubation, the albumin was precipitated by the addition of 0.05 ml of 1.5 m perchloric acid and pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 4.0 by addition of 0.025 ml of 2.0m Trizma® base, and aliquots (0.1 ml) were transferred to injector vials for automated HPLC-FD analysis. p values were calculated with Quatro Pro for Windows using a two-tailed Student's ttest. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. We recently reported that albumin-Cys34 thiolate anion plays an essential role in the formation of albumin-bound homocysteine (18Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). During this study we obtained evidence indicating that purified human albumin played a role in the conversion of homocysteine to its low molecular weight disulfide forms by a mechanism that involved thiol/disulfide exchange. When 750 μm human serum albumin was incubated with 500 μml-homocysteine, little or nol-homocysteine could be detected after 3 h (Fig. 1). The fate of thel-homocysteine was determined by product analysis after 3 h. Of the initial 500 μml-homocysteine in the reaction mixture, only 170 μm was bound to albumin (Fig. 1). The remaining 330 μm homocysteine was converted into its low molecular weight disulfides, HCMD (90 μm) and homocystine (240 μm) (18Sengupta S. Chen H. Togawa T. DiBello P.M. Majors A.K. Büdy B. Ketterer M.E. Jacobsen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30111-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of albumin, thel-homocysteine concentration remained essentially unchanged after 3 h (data not shown). Because a previous report (11Starkebaum G. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) showed that copper catalyzed the autooxidation of homocysteine, we determined the amount of copper in our purified albumin preparation and buffer solutions using ICPMS (Table I). The purified albumin used in these experiments contained 2.9 μm copper per 750 μm albumin, whereas the buffer used was essentially copper-free.Table ICopper concentrations by ICPMSSampleCu2+μmTES buffer0.002Plasma20.5Commercial albumin2.9DTPA-treated albumin0.08Albumin thiolate anion0.16The concentrations of Cu2+ in the samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The concentrations of Cu2+ in the samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To determine whether the copper associated with our purified albumin preparation was sufficient to catalyze the oxidation ofl-homocysteine, we incubated 500 μml-homocysteine with various concentrations of cupric sulfate. As shown in Fig. 2, free Cu2+ catalyzes the oxidation of homocysteine in a dose-dependent manner. However, the conversion ofl-homocysteine to l-homocystine by 3 μm free Cu2+ (equivalent to the concentration of copper in the albumin preparation used above) was less than 10% of that seen with albumin (Fig. 1). Even with 50 μm cupric sulfate, only 60% of the l-homocysteine was converted tol-homocystine after 3 h of reaction (Fig. 2). Other transition metals (Fe3+, Co3+, Ni2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+) were even less efficient in catalyzing homocysteine autooxidation (data not shown) and were not considered for further study. We determined the relative ability of free Cu2+ to catalyze the autooxidation of l-homocysteine and other biological thiols under standardized conditions. As shown in Fig. 3 A, 25 μmCu2+ catalyzed the conversion of 45% of the 500 μml-homocysteine tol-homocystine in 3 h. This rate of oxidation was amazingly slow compared with the oxidation of l-cysteine (Fig. 3 B) and cysteinylglycine (Fig. 3 C), in which there was complete conversion to the respective disulfides within 30 min. The rate of oxidation of glutathione (Fig. 3 D) was considerably slower than that of l-cysteine and cysteinylglycine but faster than that observed forl-homocysteine. Thus, although Cu2+ catalyzes the autooxidation of all four thiols, the rate of autooxidation is fastest for cysteine and cysteinylglycine followed by glutathione and then l-homocysteine. In the absence of Cu2+(buffer only), there was no appreciable oxidation (<1%) of the four thiols over the 5-h time course. In circulation 90–95% of the copper is bound to the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin (27Yoshida K. Furihata K. Takeda S. Nakamura A. Yamamoto K. Morita H. Hiyamuta S. Ikeda S.-I. Shimizu N. Yanagisawa N. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Most of the remaining copper is bound to albumin with little or no copper existing in the free form. Because it has been shown that ceruloplasmin catalyzes thiol oxidation (10Feldman S.L. Hunter J.S.V. Zgirski A. Chidambaram M.V. Frieden E. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1982; 17: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Starkebaum G. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), we repeated the above experiments with the four thiols (all at 500 μm final concentration) using a physiological concentration of ceruloplasmin (300 μg/ml) in place of cupric sulfate. As shown in Fig. 4 A, ceruloplasmin was a poor catalyst of homocysteine autooxidation with only 20% of the homocysteine being oxidized in 3 h at an initial rate of 1.08 μmol/liter/min. In contrast ceruloplasmin rapidly catalyzed the complete autooxidation of cysteine (Fig. 4 B) and cysteinylglycine (Fig. 4 C) in ∼12 min at an initial rate of 63.2 and 38.2 μmol/liter/min, respectively; ∼70% of the glutathione (1.56 μmol/liter/min) was oxidized by ceruloplasmin after 3 h (Fig. 4 D). Additional studies were carried out to assess the role of plasma ceruloplasmin in catalyzing homocysteine oxidation. Ceruloplasmin was immunoprecipitated from the plasma as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated plasma revealed little or no detectable ceruloplasmin (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). The ability of ceruloplasmin-depleted plasma to mediate the oxidation ofl-homocysteine (500 μm, final concentration) was then investigated. Both control plasma and ceruloplasmin-depleted plasma were found to mediate the oxidation of homocysteine to an equal extent (Fig. 5 B), again indicating that ceruloplasmin may have little or no physiological role in the formation of homocystine in vivo. Control plasma and ceruloplasmin-depleted plasma were then treated with the metal chelator DTPA and tested again for their capacity to mediate the oxidation of homocysteine. As shown in Fig. 5 B, there was a similar 20% inhibition of homocysteine oxidation in the presence of DTPA for both plasma samples. These results indicate that although copper may play a minor role in the oxidation of homocysteine, the copper bound to ceruloplasmin probably does not contribute substantially to the process. Albumin is known to carry 5–10% of the total copper in circulation (28Suzuki K.T. Karasawa A. Yamanaka K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The 20% inhibition of homocysteine oxidation by DTPA-treated plasma observed in the previous experiment (Fig. 5 B) could have been due to the chelation and removal of copper from albumin. To study the relative abilities of albumin and ceruloplasmin to mediate the conversion of homocysteine to homocystine, we initiated the oxidation of l-homocysteine with 300 μg/ml ceruloplasmin as shown in Fig. 6 A. At 2 h albumin was added, and this triggered a dramatic increase in the rate of conversion of homocysteine to its disulfide forms (Fig. 6 A). It should be noted that the concentrations of ceruloplasmin and albumin used in this experiment are physiological. The conversion of homocysteine to its disulfide forms was then studied using concentrations of albumin from 15 to 750 μm. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the extent of conversion of homocysteine to its disulfide forms increases with increasing concentrations of albumin up to 600 μm after which the process appears to saturate. To determine whether other proteins in plasma apart from albumin played any significant role in the oxidation of homocysteine, albumin was separated from human plasma by affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both the albumin-deficient plasma and the albumin-rich fraction obtained after affinity chromatography were incubated with 500 μml-homocysteine for 2 h. The albumin-rich fraction (final protein concentration was 15 mg/ml) catalyzed the oxidation of homocysteine much more efficiently than an equivalent protein concentration of the albumin-deficient plasma (Fig. 7). The data shown in Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 suggest that the copper associated with albumin in plasma might be responsible for ∼20% of the overall conversion of homocysteine to homocystine. To investigate whether the copper associated with albumin is responsible for homocysteine autooxidation, we treated albumin with the metal chelator DTPA. After treatment of albumin with DTPA and dialysis, >97% of the copper associated with albumin was removed as determined by ICPMS (Table I). DTPA treatment also removed >97% of other metals present in the albumin preparation (data not shown). The conversion of homocysteine to its disulfides was inhibited by ∼20% with DTPA-treated albumin as compared with the native albumin (Fig. 8 A), similar to that observed with DTPA-treated plasma (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that copper-dependent autooxidation of homocysteine is a minor pathway in the overall conversion to disulfide forms and that thiol/disulfide exchange reactions are much more important. However, the oxidation of cysteine (Fig. 8 B) and cysteinylglycine (Fig. 8 C) by copper-free albumin was inhibited by more than 50% within the first 15 min of the reactions. In addition, the rates of cysteine and cysteinylglycine oxidation in the presence of native albumin were faster than that of homocysteine. These results are consistent with the data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 wher"

However, excessive collagen formation interferes with normal tissue function and can give rise to pathological fibrosis. Collagen is a super polymer made up of fibers containing large numbers of well organized cross-linked trimeric peptides. These assemblies have an enormous tensile strength and are the major insoluble, fibrous component of the extracellular matrix. Collagen is made up of three polypeptide pro-α chains, coiled together to form a triple helix (4Rich A. Crick F.H.C. J. Mol.

This conformation is stabilized by a large number of Gly-Pro-X (where X represents any amino acid) repeats.Nascent monomeric procollagen chains are synthesized with N- and C-terminal propeptides. Collagen assembly begins with the folding and association of C-terminal propeptides into trimeric assemblies (7Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F.

This initial docking is aided by the formation of disulfides and is modulated by the presence of protein-disulfide isomerase (8Kellokumpu S. Suokas M. Risteli L. Myllyla R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that Hsp47 will bind to fully formed helical trimers in vivo, perhaps thereby stabilizing the triple helix and preventing chain dissociations. This functional hypothesis is supported by a recent demonstration that Hsp47 binds specifically to stretches of non-hydroxylated Pro-Gly-X repeats (20Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), regions of low structural stability within the full-length collagen triple helices. After binding there is clear evidence that triple helical procollagen-Hsp47 complexes are eventually transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to cis-Golgi (21Smith T. Ferreira L.R. Hebert C.

Serpin family members have a highly conserved secondary structure that is made up of a core of three β-sheets surrounded by nine α-helices (Fig. 1a) (29Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 30Schreuder H.A. Deboer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Hol W.G.J. Nat.

Des. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The central β-sheet (A-sheet) typically exists in a 5- or 6-stranded form. The 5-stranded form occurs as a result of normal folding but is metastable. Proteolytic cleavage or partial protein denaturation leads to the formation of the 6-stranded form that is hyperthermostable (Fig.1b). Work on the characteristics of the metastable nature of the serpin fold has shown that the 5-stranded A-sheet may also be filled by exogenous peptides to form a binary complex with a heterologous 6-stranded A-sheet (3Skinner R.

In addition, serpins have the ability to self-assemble via a number of β-strand/β-strand interactions to form homopolymers (32Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W.

CNBr-activated Sepharose, MonoS ion exchange, and Superdex S200 column were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Collagen was provided from Cellon S.A., Strassen, Luxembourg. Active MrmHsp47 (from recombinant Escherichia coli DHlλhind-pKS26 incorporating themrmHsp47 gene) was a generous gift from Professor Kazuhiro Nagata (Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Kyoto University, Japan). The peptide (PPG)10 was synthesized by Peptides International. Anti-MrmHsp47 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies, Canada.Purification of mrmHsp47Recombinant E. coli DHlλhind-pKS26 incorporating the mrmHsp47 gene was grown at 32 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The cells were then heat-shocked at 42 °C and harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 15 min) followed by resuspension in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 30% (v/v) glycerol. Pepstatin and aprotinin were added along with lysozyme and Igepal (non-ionic detergent, 2.45 ml of 10% (v/v) solution in water). Cells were stirred for a further 60 min. The resulting suspension was sonicated for a total of 8 min (2-s pulses and 7-s intervals) at 4 °C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 1 h) at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a collagen-Sepharose 4β column at 4 °C, previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA and 150 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mmEDTA and 400 mm NaCl to remove any nonspecifically bound material. mrmHsp47 was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.8, containing 5 mm EDTA and 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing mrmHsp47 were combined, and the pH was readjusted to pH 8.0. The protein was loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, and the two peaks containing mrmHsp47 were collected. The oligomeric variants were also separated using a MonoS HR 10/10 column equilibrated in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA. mrmHsp47 was eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient of 10–1000 mm NaCl, in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA. Protein preparations were stored at −80 °C.Native, Denaturing PAGE and Transverse Urea Gradient Electrophoresis GelsNative PAGESamples were dissolved in NOVEX (UK) Tris glycine native sample buffer. Native PAGE was carried out on 14% Tris glycine homogenous gels run for 12 h at 4 °C, using Tris glycine native running buffer (25 mm Tris base, pH 8.3, containing 192 mm glycine).Denaturing PAGESamples were dissolved in 2% SDS sample buffer and heated at 90 °C for 5 min before loading onto the gels. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 15% Tris glycine homogenous native gels. The gels were run at 125 constant voltage for 90 min at room temperature, using Tris glycine SDS running buffer (25 mmTris base, pH 8.3, containing 192 mm glycine and 0.1% SDS).Transverse Urea Gradient Gel Electrophoresis6% w/v polyacrylamide gels were cast with using a gradient maker to give a linear gradient from 0 to 8 m urea left to right across the gel. The gels were made using a high pH non-denaturing PAGE buffer system (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5). The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by silver staining.Western BlottingProteins were transferred overnight from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose blots were probed with monoclonal mouse IgG2b mrmHsp47-specific primary antibody and A0168 monoclonal anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase, conjugate peroxidase, and secondary antibody.Size Exclusion ChromatographySize exclusion chromatography was carried out using a Superdex 200 resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in an XK16/60 column with a total bed volume of 120 ml. The separation was performed using a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and samples were loaded (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA) in a total volume not exceeding 2 ml.Measurement of Intrinsic FluorescenceFluorescence measurements were made using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorimeter using a method modified from Ref.39Macdonald J.R.

The solution was excited at a wavelength of 295 nm; photons emitted at 90° to the excitation beam were detected at 340 nm. Wherever possible the slits controlling the intensity of the excitation light source were kept at the minimum machine-permissible limit of 2.5 nm; any other values for these slit widths were as detailed in the text. Emission slit widths were varied between 2.5 and 15 nm dependent on the experimental conditions to give an optimal emission signal. The samples (in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) were incubated in a 0.5-ml cuvette with a path length of 1 cm on the excitation axis and 0.2 cm on the emission axis, and throughout all experiments the sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C by a heated water jacket within the cuvette holder. The data were fitted to a single site weak binding hyperbola function using Grafit (version 3.00, 1992, Erithracus Software Ltd.).Circular DichroismCD measurements were performed using a Jasco J-810 and J-720 spectropolarimeter in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 20 °C using a 0.05- and 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette for wavelength scans and titrations, respectively. All scans were performed over 20 repetitions with the presented data being the average.Melting points were obtained by monitoring the change in dichroic signal at a single wavelength, whereas the temperature of the sample was increased from 25 to 95 °C at a constant rate of 1 °C/min. Melting points were calculated using the method of Ref. 40Lawrence D.A. Olsen S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D.

Protein concentration varied from 0.5 to 1.2 mg/ml. To analyze functions of excess heat capacity (ΔCp), Microcal Origin 5 software package was used. The samples were prepared in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA and 150 mm NaCl. Aliquots of the sample buffer were used as a DSC reference and for base-line corrections. Sample and reference solution were degassed for a total of 8 min under vacuum with gentle stirring before being loaded and were kept under 26–27-mPa pressure during DSC to inhibit degassing and bubble formation at higher temperatures.Homology Model BuildingA homology model of mrmHsp47 was constructed using the program MODELLER (41Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10390) Google Scholar). A basis set of homologous structures was constructed with reference to alignment of the mrmHsp47 sequence (45Davids J.W. ElThaher T.S.H. Nakai A. Nagata K. Miller A.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 427-438Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) against a data base of known structures (ovalbumin (code 1OVA), human plasminogen activator inhibitor II (code 1BY7), and human α1-antitrypsin (code 1QLP)). These structures were combined with multiple sequence alignment data obtain using ClustalW (42Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar) in conjunction with the primary amino acid sequence of mrmHsp47. These data were then used by the MODELLER routines to produce a homology model.DISCUSSIONHsp47 is a molecular chaperone protein derived from the serpin family of proteins, essential for collagen biogenesis. Extensive evidence has suggested that Hsp47 may associate with nascent procollagen polypeptide chains (17Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), unhydroxylated non-triple helical chains, and even hydroxylated triple helices (16Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.I. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) in the endoplasmic reticulum during the early stages of collagen biosynthesis. However, there has been little evidence to date to suggest how Hsp47 might actually function as a molecular chaperone in these early stages of collagen biosynthesis. Tasab and co-workers (16Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have suggested that Hsp47 acts by binding to fully formed hydroxylated triple helices to stabilize these triple helices and prevent chain dissociation in the endoplasmic reticulum. We present here data that combine the extensive studies of other members of the serpin superfamily with the already established behavior of Hsp47.Implications of Peptide and Protein Datum StateIn this type of study, it was important that the conformational and configurational states of the reactants be determined. In particular, members of the serpin family are highly conformationally mobile. It is also true that “model” peptides such as (PPG)10 that are used throughout the study of collagen-binding proteins are not conformationally static (1Go N. Suezaki Y. Biopolymers. 1973; 12: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 47Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bachinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed the oligomerization state of (PPG)10 varies with both concentration and temperature. Thus we have begun our study by carefully defining these “datum” states using a range of biochemical techniques.Hsp47 Conformation, Configuration, and Collagen-binding SiteCritical to the process of defining the functional capacity of Hsp47 has been the generation of well characterized protein preparations. Our attempts to establish such a preparation has led to the novel discovery that Hsp47 can adopt both monomeric and trimeric forms. Monomeric Hsp47 (mrmHsp47s) possesses all the classic hallmarks of metastable, sheet-exposed serpins conformation with a 5-strand A-sheet (Fig. 1a). CD, DSC, temperature, and urea titration/transverse gel data all agree to support this view (Fig. 3). This is in disagreement with our previous model that represented monomeric mrmHsp47 in a conformation comparable with that of latent non-inhibitory PAI-1 (Fig. 1e), possessing an A-sheet with six strands (45Davids J.W. ElThaher T.S.H. Nakai A. Nagata K. Miller A.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 427-438Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The new proposal is also consistent with the amino acid sequence of the “hinge region” of mrmHsp47. This sequence in Hsp47 consists of a large number of residues with bulky side chains that preclude the formation of the hyperstable 6-stranded form characterized by the latent form of PAI-1 (Fig. 1a). The discovery that Hsp47 is in the 5-stranded metastable conformation may have implications for our past model of the collagen-binding site in a cleft between helices hA and hG/hH (45Davids J.W. ElThaher T.S.H. Nakai A. Nagata K. Miller A.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 427-438Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is well established that the metastable form of a serpin can bind peptides (which could conceptually include collagen) in the vacant strand 4 position of the A-sheet (Fig. 1c) (3Skinner R. Chang W.S.W. Jin L. Pei X. Huntington J.A. Abrahams J.P. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) producing a hyperstable species. However, the observation by us and Thomson and Ananthanarayanan (48Thomson C.A. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that the collagen-Hsp47/(PPG)10-Hsp47 complex does not alter the stability of Hsp47 (Fig.4e) suggests that the collagen/peptide do not bind to the A-sheet.The Hsp47 trimer identified as a component of mrmHsp47c is potentially fascinating in both structural and functional terms for both molecular chaperones and serpins. A number of serpin family proteins are known to undergo oligomerizations; however, the formation of only two discrete forms (i.e. monomer and trimer) is unusual. Only the serpin, antithrombin, has been described previously as forming a small set of discrete oligomers. Circulating antithrombin forms dimers by a linkage involving an interaction of the RCL of one molecule into β-sheet C of a second conformationally stabilized (latent state) molecule (3Skinner R. Chang W.S.W. Jin L. Pei X. Huntington J.A. Abrahams J.P. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, the Hsp47 trimer does not conform to the antithrombin model as no stabilized monomeric species equivalent to the latent form was observed at any time. The structure of the trimer is, however, indicated by virtue its high stability. This indicates that the RCL of one molecule is at least partially inserted into the β-sheet A of a second, creating A-sheets with six strands and consequently hyperstability. This configuration is the same as that seen for polymers α1-antitrypsin (32Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 51Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33663-33668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The observation that Hsp47 trimer appears to be as ready to bind collagen as the Hsp47 monomer (Fig. 5) has further implications on the position of the collagen-binding site. The filling of the vacant strand 4 position of the A-sheet to form the link within the trimer means that peptide binding in this position is no longer possible, and yet the protein retains activity. Thus it appears that our original proposal of a collagen-binding site between helices hA and hG/hH (45Davids J.W. ElThaher T.S.H. Nakai A. Nagata K. Miller A.D. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 427-438Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) seems all the more viable.Implications of Hsp47 Mechanism in BiologyOur study of the self/self and self/substrate interactions of Hsp47 has allowed us to propose, in more detail than before, possible roles for Hsp47 in biology. We have demonstrated that Hsp47 is able to bind to a monomeric prolyl peptide inducing the formation of a polyproline type II conformation. We have also shown that in doing so Hsp47 is able to induce the formation of higher order assemblies of the peptide with increased stabilities similar to those observed by Frank and co-workers (47Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bachinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) for a stabilized (PPG)10 trimer. Translation of these activities into biological function provides a number of possibilities for what is a multifunctional chaperone. It might be proposed that Hsp47 may bind to nascent monomeric polypeptide chains as observed by Sauk et al. (17Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269:"
https://openalex.org/W1983072845,"Escherichia coli lipoproteins are anchored to either the inner or outer membrane through fatty acyl chains covalently attached to an N-terminal cysteine. Aspartate at position 2 functions to retain lipoproteins in the inner membrane, although the retention is perturbed depending on the residue at position 3. We previously revealed that LolCDE and LolA play critical roles in this lipoprotein sorting. To clarify the sorting signals, the LolA-dependent release of lipoprotein derivatives having various residues at positions 2 and 3 was examined in spheroplasts. When the residue at position 3 was serine, only aspartate at position 2 caused the retention of lipoproteins in spheroplasts. We then examined the release of derivatives having aspartate at position 2 and various residues at position 3. Strong inner membrane retention occurred with a limited number of species of residues at position 3. These residues were present at position 3 of native lipoproteins having aspartate at position 2, whereas residues that inhibited the retention were not. It was also found that a strong inner membrane retention signal having residues other than aspartate at position 2 could be formed through the combination of the residues at positions 2 and 3. These results indicate that the inner membrane localization of native lipoproteins is ensured by the use of a limited number of strong inner membrane retention signals."
https://openalex.org/W2315658233,"FasL and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) belong to a subgroup of the TNF superfamily which induce apoptosis by binding to their death domain containing receptors. In the present study we have utilized a panel of seven cell lines derived from human malignant gliomas to characterize molecular pathways through which FasL and TRAIL induce apoptosis in sensitive glioma cells and the mechanisms of resistance in cell lines which survive the death stimuli. Our findings indicate that FADD and Caspase-8 are essential for FasL and TRAIL mediated apoptosis in glioma cells. One sensitive cell line (D270) can be protected from FasL and TRAIL induced death by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members while another (D645) cannot, implying that these lines may represent glioma examples of type II and type I cells respectively. For the first time we demonstrate resistance to FasL but not to TRAIL within the one glioma cell line. Furthermore, we report distinct mechanisms of resistance within different glioma lines, including downregulation of Caspase-8 in U373MG. Cycloheximide sensitized four of the resistant cell lines suggesting the presence of labile inhibitors. None of the known apoptosis inhibitors examined accounted for the observed resistance, suggesting novel inhibitors may exist in glioma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2137575413,"Recent studies have identified two p53 homologues, p63 and p73. They activate p53-responsive promoters and induce apoptosis when overexpressed in certain human tumors. Here, we report that p63, like p53 and p73, induces replicative senescence when expressed in a tetracycline-regulated manner in EJ cells lacking a functional p53. In addition to transcription activation of p53-responsive genes, we found that p63 and p73 repress transcription of the cdk1 and cyclin B genes, both of which are irreversibly repressed in senescent human fibroblast. In transient transfection assay, p63 and p73 repress the cdk1 promoter regardless of the presence of a dominant negative mutant form of p53. Furthermore, we found that DNA binding activity of NF-Y transcription factor, which is essential for transcription of the cdk1 and cyclin B genes and inactivated in senescent fibroblast, is significantly decreased by expression of either of p53, p63, or p73. Since NF-Y binds to many promoters besides the cdk1 and cyclin B promoters, inactivation of NF-Y by p53 family genes may be a general mechanism for transcription repression in replicative senescence."

The enzyme is expressed in many mammalian species but is absent from humans, apes, and old world monkeys as a result of the mutational inactivation of the gene; in humans, a large fraction of natural antibodies are directed against its product, the α-galactose epitope. α3GT is a member of a family of metal-dependent retaining glycosyltransferases including the histo-blood group A and B synthases. A crystal structure of the catalytic domain of α3GT was recently reported (Gastinel, L. N., Bignon, C., Misra, A. K., Hindsgaul, O., Shaper, J. H., and Joziasse, D. H. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 638–649). However, because of the limited resolution (2.3 Å) and high mobility of the atoms (as indicated by high B-factors) this structure (form I) does not provide a clear depiction of the catalytic site of the enzyme. Here we report a new, highly ordered structure for the catalytic domain of α3GT at 1.53-Å resolution (form II). This provides a more accurate picture of the details of the catalytic site that includes a bound UDP molecule and a Mn2+ cofactor. Significantly, in the new structure, the C-terminal segment (residues 358–368) adopts a very different, highly structured conformation and appears to form part of the active site. The properties of an Arg-365 to Lys mutant indicate that this region is important for catalysis, possibly reflecting its role in a donor substrate-induced conformational change.

Here we report a new, highly ordered structure for the catalytic domain of α3GT at 1.53-Å resolution (form II). This provides a more accurate picture of the details of the catalytic site that includes a bound UDP molecule and a Mn2+ cofactor. Significantly, in the new structure, the C-terminal segment (residues 358–368) adopts a very different, highly structured conformation and appears to form part of the active site. The properties of an Arg-365 to Lys mutant indicate that this region is important for catalysis, possibly reflecting its role in a donor substrate-induced conformational change. β-galactosyl α-1,3-galactosyltransferase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Specific hetero-oligosaccharides on glycoproteins and glycolipids play important roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, affect the stability and structure of proteins, and modulate cellular interactions with viruses, toxins, and other proteins; they are also epitopes that are recognized by the immune system (1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar). The range and types of carbohydrate structures present on a cell vary in different tissues and species as a reflection of the specificity of glycosyltransferases, enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a specific monosaccharide from an activated derivative (such as UDP-galactose) into a defined linkage with a specific acceptor (2Natsuka S. Lowe J.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 683-686Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Paulson J.C. Colley K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates have an enormous potential for variation because of the range of different sugars and the large number of alternative glycosidic linkages. Consequently, they are carriers of large amounts of biological information that originates from the specificity of glycosyltransferases. In addition to their biosynthetic roles, some glycosyltransferases also function directly in cellular interactions and regulation (4Gijsen H.J.M. Qiao L. Fitz W. Wong C-H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 443-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 5Shi X. Amindari S. Paruchuri K. Skalla D. Burkin H. Shur B.D. Miller D.J. Development. 2001; 128: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). The limited information currently available regarding the structural basis of molecular recognition and catalysis by these important enzymes precludes a clear understanding of the molecular basis of their various biological functions. High resolution structural data are also needed to inform the design of inhibitors and to facilitate the engineering of new catalysts for the enzymatic synthesis of natural and novel glycoconjugates for therapeutic uses (4Gijsen H.J.M. Qiao L. Fitz W. Wong C-H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 443-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 6Nixon B. Lu Q. Wassler M.J. Foote C.I. Ensslin M.A. Shur B.D.

Biol. 1997; 7: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The majority of glycosyltransferases are type-II membrane proteins with short N-terminal cytosolic domains, a membrane-spanning region, a stem, and a C-terminal catalytic region (3Paulson J.C. Colley K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Classification schemes have been proposed for them based on sequence similarity and specificity; however, localized similarities between the sequences of different galactosyltransferases (8Breton C. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), mannosyl, and other glycosyltransferases (9Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 10Zhou D. Dinter A. Gallego R.G. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) suggest that such schemes may eventually be simplified into larger groups with similar folds and conserved binding sites (see also Ref. 11Ünligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Rini J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5269-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A priori mechanistic considerations divide glycosyltransferases into two large groups, those that catalyze a reaction in which the anomeric configuration of the transferred sugar is inverted and those that catalyze a retaining reaction (12Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). While the former are likely to act through a displacement (SN2) mechanism that necessarily produces an inversion at C-1, a retaining reaction is expected to involve a double displacement mechanism with formation of an intermediate such as a β-glycosyl-enzyme covalent complex. UDP-galactose β-galactoside α-1,3 galactosyltransferase (α3GT1; EC 2.4.1.151) is an enzyme found in many mammalian species but not in humans and their closest relatives because of the mutational inactivation of its gene (13Galili U. Swanson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7401-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar); in species lacking the enzyme, about 1% of circulating endogenous antibodies are directed against the product of its action, the α-galactose epitope (14Galili U. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1993; 15: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These protect against pathogens but are a barrier to the xenotransplantation of organs from species with active α3GT to humans. α3GT is a model for several paralogous retaining glycosyltransferases of varying substrate specificity including the histo-blood group A and B glycosyltransferases (15Yamamoto F-I. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S-I. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), Forssman glycolipid synthase (16Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and isogloboside 3 synthase (17Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25308-25314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the catalytic domain of α3GT (in tetragonal form, P41212 space group, one molecule/asymmetric unit, form I) was recently reported at 2.3- and 2.5-Å resolution in UMP- and Hg-UDP-galactose-bound forms, respectively (18Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These structures identified binding sites for UDP and a Mn2+ cofactor. A region of electron density in the Hg-UDP-galactose-bound structure was interpreted as a β-galactosyl moiety covalently attached to Glu-317, suggesting a covalent catalytic mechanism. However, no direct evidence was obtained for a glycosyl-enzyme covalent bond, and the limited resolution of the structure, reflected also in the high B-factors for all atoms and the disordered C-terminal region of the polypeptide chain, raises questions about this interpretation. To clarify unresolved issues regarding the structure of α3GT and the specific roles of different amino acid residues in the reaction mechanism, we sought to obtain crystals with improved resolution using different crystallization conditions. Here we report the structure of a new crystal form of α3GT obtained with polyethylene glycol as the precipitating agent instead of a high salt concentration buffer (pH 6.0, monoclinic form, P21 space group, dimer/asymmetric unit, form II) at 1.53 Å. The entire structure is highly ordered, with the C terminus (residues 358–368) adopting what appears to be an “active” conformation in the structure. A possibly analogous conformational change in a region of other glycosyltransferases that are unrelated in amino acid sequence to α3GT (12Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), including β-4-galactosyltransferase-I (19Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), has been noted that may have an important role in the catalytic mechanism (12Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of α3GT indicates that this region is important for catalysis. We discuss the implications of our results for the mechanism of α3GT and its homologues. The catalytic domain of bovine α3GT (residues 80–368) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified as previously described (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and stored at −20 °C in 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6) in 50% glycerol. Crystals were grown at 16 °C by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method by mixing 2 μl of the protein at 5 mg/ml in 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, 10% glycerol, containing 10 mm UDP and 0.1 mm MnCl2, with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 5% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. Single crystals appeared after 2–3 days. Before data collection, crystals were flash-cooled at 100 K in a cryoprotectant containing 10% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 25% glycerol. A high resolution data set to 1.53 Å was collected using a 30-cm MAR research image plate at DESY, EMBL outstation (Hamburg, Germany). The crystals belong to the P21 space group, with two molecules (a noncrystallographic dimer) in the asymmetric unit and some 58% of the crystal volume occupied by the solvent. Raw data images were indexed and scaled using the DENZO and SCALEPACK modules of the HKL Suite (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The structure of α3GT dimer was determined by the molecular replacement method using the 2.5-Å tetragonal (form I, monomer) structure (18Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) with the program AMoRe (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The structure was initially refined using the program CNS (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar), with temperature factors for all atoms kept isotropic. The behavior of the cross-validation R-factor (R free) was monitored throughout the refinement (24Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). Several rounds of energy minimization, individualB-factor refinement, simulated annealing using CNS, and model building using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) were performed until convergence of the R free value. The water molecules were picked using the program ARP/wARP (26Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 129-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These water molecules were manually inspected carefully with the aid ofF o − F c and 2F o − F c difference electron density maps and accepted only if peaks existed in both the maps at the 3ς and 1ς level, respectively, and were at hydrogen bonding distance from the appropriate atoms. The model during CNS refinement converged to a crystallographic R-factor (R cryst) of 18.4 and R free of 20.0%. Further refinement was carried out using SHELXL-97 (27Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). CGLS refinement in SHELXL-97 was carried out restraining all of the 1,2 and 1,3 distances with the Engh and Huber (28Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) restraints. Initially, all of the atomic displacement parameters were kept isotropic. The data to parameter ratio >2 enabled us to carry out anisotropic refinement on atomic displacement parameters, which was subsequently justified by a 1.3% drop inR free and an improved Fourier map. All of the alternate conformations were modeled after the initial anisotropic refinement. Any new atoms added to the molecule were refined isotropically for at least two cycles before they were refined anisotropically. The multiple conformation site occupation factors were refined constraining their sum to be unity. The model converged to anR cryst/R free of 14.82/20.09%. The final refinement was carried out with hydrogens included in the calculated positions (for protein atoms alone, except for multiple conformations). The addition of hydrogen atoms as riding model was justified by a drop in R free of 1.03%, leading to a final model withR cryst/R free of 14.05/19.06%. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically including water molecules (excluding protein atoms with multiple conformations). The final model of α3GT comprises residues 82–368 for both molecules and contains one UDP molecule and one Mn2+ ion per monomer at the active site. The structure contains 757 water molecules and two glycerol molecules (from the crystallization medium or cryoprotectant). All of the residues of the dimer lie in allowed regions of the Ramachandran (ϕ-ψ) map. The expression vector for wild type α3GT, pET15b-α3GT, was constructed as described previously (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mutant coding sequence was generated by amplification of pET15b-α3GT using a T7 promoter and the mutagenic primer, 5′­CGCGGATCC¯TCA GAC ATT ATTTTT¯AAC CAC ATT ATA CTC­3′BamHIR365KSequence 1 The amplification product was cleaved with Xba I and Bam HI and cloned into a pET42b vector that had been previously treated with the same enzymes. The mutant was characterized by automated DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence. The enzyme was expressed as described for wild-type α3GT (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Steady state kinetic studies were carried out as described previously (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using a radiochemical assay; enzyme activity was measured at varying concentrations of lactose (acceptor substrate) and a series of fixed concentrations of UDP-galactose, and the data were analyzed by fitting to the equation, v=Vm[A][B]/(KiaKb+Ka[B]+Kb[A]+[A][B])Eq. 1 using the Curvefitter program of SigmaPlot™. [A] and [B] represent the concentrations of UDP-galactose and lactose, respectively. The Arg-365 to Lys mutant was much less active than wild type enzyme and was assayed at a concentration of 92 μg/ml, as compared with 4.6 μg/ml for α3GT. Near and far UV CD spectra of the mutant enzyme were determined with a JASCO J-710/720 spectropolarimeter as described (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using protein (0.5 mg/ml) dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50% glycerol. The structures of the two α3GT monomers are virtually identical to one another with a root mean square deviation of 0.14 Å over all Cα atoms. Alternate conformations are found for Glu-145, Phe-184, Val-229, Glu-241, and Trp-249 in molecule A and Glu-145, Phe-184, Glu-241, and Glu-360 in molecule B. The overall structure of α3GT-form II (dimer) is similar to the previously reported structure of α3GT (form I, monomer) except at the catalytic site (Fig. 1,a and c). Briefly, the molecule exhibits a α/β fold and encompasses a central region with a “Rossmann fold” similar to those found in nucleotide binding domains (29Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The active site is identified as a deep tunnel inside the molecule based on the presence of a bound UDP molecule and a Mn2+ ion (Fig.2, a and b). It contains several regions of sequence that are conserved between different homologues of α3GT. If the C-terminal 10 residues are excluded, the form II structure (residues 82–358) superimposes closely with that of form I, exhibiting a root mean square deviation of 0.31 Å for backbone atoms and 0.92 Å for all atoms. However, the C-terminal region comprising residues 358–368, which is highly disordered in form I (18Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), has undergone a large positional change in form II. The mean root mean square deviation for the Cα atoms for the two structures in this segment is 15.2 Å with a maximum of 21 Å for Arg-365 and Asn-366. This stretch of the molecule is also highly ordered in form II as evidenced by the B-factors; in general, both molecules in form II are well ordered, reflecting the high resolution and much lower mobility for all residues (TableI). In form II, the C terminus forms a lid to the active site of the molecule (Fig. 1 c) so that the large change in structure between the two forms is associated with reduced active site accessibility.Figure 2a, schematic figure showing the main hydrogen bond interactions between UDP and α3GT residues at the catalytic site of the enzyme.

The new structure shows highly ordered, clear binding of UDP molecule through the conserved DVD motif (9Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and a Mn2+ ion. Some interactions of the UDP moiety with α3GT are similar to those in form I (Fig. 2, Table II) and involve residues that are located at the end of strands β2 and β5, helix α4, and the D225VD227 motif (Fig. 1 B). In addition, in the present structure (form II), the C-terminal region (β10 and α7) also constitutes part of the active site and makes direct interaction with the UDP phosphates (Fig.2, Table II) (see below). The C terminus (residues 358–368) that is shown by the present structure to be important for UDP binding is also highly conserved in all currently known α3GT amino acid sequences (30Shetterly S.

Open table in a new tab Mn2+ is required for catalysis by many UDP-sugar-utilizing glycosyltransferases, and activity has been shown to be dependent on two metal ions in both β-4-galactosyltransferase-I (31Powell J.T. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3645-3652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and α3GT (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the α3GT (both forms I and II) structure, one Mn2+ ion was identified. This Mn2+ forms an octahedral coordination through interactions with two oxygen atoms from the α- and β-phosphates of the UDP molecule, a single interaction with the OD2 atom of Asp-225, bidentate coordination with OD1 and OD2 atoms of Asp-227, and an interaction with a water molecule (Table II). The Mn2+ ion appears to stabilize the DVD sequence motif and binds the diphosphate moiety of the UDP molecule. Previous studies have shown that mutants of α3GT in which either aspartate of the motif is changed to asparagine have undetectable catalytic activity, in keeping with its key role in Mn2+ and donor substrate binding and catalysis (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The location of the binding site for the second Mn2+ cofactor in our structure was not identified. The last 11 residues at the C terminus (residues 358–368) adopt distinct conformations in the form I and form II structures (Fig. 1 c). In the form I structure, this loop is disordered, with high B-factors of about 90 Å2, suggesting more than one conformation. In the present form II structure, residues 354–356 form a short β-strand, and residues 361–364 adopt a definite α-helical structure and are well defined in the electron density map. The conformational change observed in the present structure is associated with the formation of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts between the α- and β-phosphates of UDP and Lys-359, Tyr-361, and Arg-365 and increased rigidity of all residues in this region (Fig. 2, Table II). The averageB-factors for the above contact residues are 15.0, 14.9, and 16.2 Å2, respectively, significantly less than the averageB-factor for the overall structure of 17.05 Å2. The conformational change in the C terminus between the two structures, the sequence conservation among other α3GT, and analogous transconformations in other glycosyltransferases (12Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) all suggest that this region could have a key role in the catalytic action. To test this, we constructed and characterized a mutant enzyme with a structurally conservative substitution, Lys for Arg-365, a residue in this region that is conserved in all homologues of α3GT. R365K was constructed as described and expressed as soluble protein in good yield (11 mg/liter of cell culture). Both far and near UV CD spectra of this mutant are closely similar to those of the wild type enzyme (data not shown), indicating that the mutation does not introduce any global conformational change. The kinetic parameters of this mutant determined at 10 mm Mn2+ are summarized in TableIII. Compared with wild type,k cat of the mutant is reduced 38-fold, while parameters associated with the binding of donor and acceptor substrate showed insignificant or minor changes. The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K ia ×K b) is also reduced 44-fold, reflecting the reduction in k cat; thus, this highly conservative substitution specifically reduces the stabilization of the transition state by the enzyme with essentially no effect on substrate binding in the α3GT·Mn2+·UDP-galactose·lactose complex.Table IIIEffects of the Arg-365 to Lys mutation on the catalytic properties of α3GTEnzymeα3GTaData for wild-type α3GT are taken from Zhang et al.

Open table in a new tab In the present structure, Arg-365 directly interacts with the α-phosphate of UDP and the OH atom of Tyr-139, which in turn interacts with the α-phosphate of UDP and makes stacking interactions against the uracil ring (Table II, Fig. 2). Furthermore, Arg-365 is involved in van der Waals interactions with UDP, Tyr-361, and Trp-195. Based on modeling studies, we predict that Arg-365 Lys substitution would not provide all of the interactions observed in the present structure. Among the 10 or so currently known glycosyltransferase structures, five, including bovine α3GT, are from eukaryotes: bovine β-4 galactosyltransferase (32Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the complex of mouse β-4-galactosyltransferase with mouse α-lactalbumin (19Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), human glucuronyltransferase (33Pederson L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and rabbitN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (11Ünligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Rini J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5269-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows a comparison of these and two relevant prokaryotic transferases, the retaining galactosyltransferase LgtC from Neisseria meningitidis (34Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and nucleotide diphosphosugar transferase, SpsA, from Bacillus subtilis (35Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These enzymes share a “Rossmann fold” topology in their UDP-binding region together with a metal-binding cluster of aspartates. Similarities have been noted in the mode of interaction with UDP (or UDP-sugar), particularly the interaction of the uridine moiety with the β-sheet and the phosphates with Mn2+ and the aspartate cluster (12Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The presence of a contiguous flexible loop that undergoes a conformational change to a more rigid structure on UDP or donor substrate binding also appears to be a common feature (12Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), although the structure and location of this region differs in the various transferases. For example, in β-4 galactosyltransferase-I, a flexible loop interacts with UDP in an analogous fashion to that of α3GT upon binding to α-lactalbumin, the modulator protein of β-4 galactosyltransferase-I, in the presence of glucose (19Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in α3GT and the only other structurally characterized retaining glycosyltransferase, LgtC, the UDP (UDP component of UDP- 2-F-galactose in LgtC) is buried in the enzyme complex. It has been suggested that in LgtC, the C-terminal loop would adopt an alternate conformation in the absence of UDP (34Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This may reflect a need to protect a reactive intermediate in catalysis from solvent in retaining transferases. However, it has also been suggested that the flexible region in both retaining and inverting glycosyltransferases has a role in product release (12Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The new crystal form of α3GT described here provides the structure of the UDP complex at far higher resolution than those reported previously for a UMP complex and a Hg-UDP-galactose complex (18Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); the more ordered structure is also highlighted by the much lower B-factors for all atoms in the structure. A major conformational change relative to the previous structures results in greater order in the C-terminal 10 residues and new enzyme-ligand contacts in this region. This may reflect, in part, the different uridine nucleotides present in the complex. Previous work suggests that the reaction mechanism of α3GT may be ordered with donor substrate binding preceding acceptor binding, but conclusive proof of this is lacking (see Zhang et al. (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for a discussion). In this context, it is possible that the observed conformational change could be linked to the formation of the binding site for the acceptor substrate. Previously, Henion et al. (36Henion T.R. Macher B.A. Anaraki F. Galili U. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) found that deletion of as few as 3 amino acid residues from the C terminus of a primate α3GT results in complete loss of catalytic activity. This supports the view that the C terminus is crucial for catalysis, although the physical properties of the truncated enzyme were not characterized. Here we show that the substitution of lysine for the highly conserved Arg-365 does not affect substrate binding but specifically reduces the stability of the transition state in the reaction. This is distinct from the effects of a previously described mutation, Val-226 → Ala, within the D225VD227motif, which perturbs metal cofactor and UDP-galactose binding as well as catalytic efficiency (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), in keeping with the role of this region in interacting with phosphates of UDP and metal ion. Additional work is needed to fully understand the role of the flexible C terminus in the reaction mechanism. The catalytic mechanism of α3GT is currently unknown. Although the formation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is a plausible mechanism for a retaining glycosyltransferase, this type of mechanism is difficult to reconcile with steady state kinetic studies that indicate a sequential mechanism in which all substrates bind prior to catalysis (20Zhang Y. Wang P.G. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, structural and mutational studies of the LgtC also do not support the formation of a covalent β-galactosyl-enzyme or even a β-galactosyl-substrate intermediate (34Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The structural evidence for a covalent intermediate in α3GT is not compelling, and an SN i mechanism, as suggested for LgtC, is possible in which nucleophilic attack by the acceptor substrate occurs simultaneously with UDP release and on the same side of the galactose ring (34Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The present high resolution crystal form and structure provide a platform for further direct structural studies to establish the binding modes of donor and acceptor substrates that may help to unravel the details of the mechanism of action of α3GT."
https://openalex.org/W2327955942,"The HMGI proteins (HMGI, HMGY and HMGI-C) have an important role in the chromatin organization and interact with different transcriptional factors. The HMGI genes are expressed at very low levels in normal adult tissues, whereas they are very abundant during embryonic development and in several experimental and human tumours. In order to isolate proteins interacting with the HMGI(Y) proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the HMGI(Y) protein as bait. This analysis led to the isolation of homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2), a serine/threonine nuclear kinase. HIPK2 co-immunoprecipitates with the HMGI(Y) protein in 293T cells. The interaction between HIPK2 and HMGI(Y) occurs through the PEST domain of HIPK2 and it is direct because in vitro translated HIPK2 binds HMGI(Y). We also show that HIPK2 is able to phosphorylate the HMGI(Y) protein by an in vitro kinase assay. In order to understand a possible role of HIPK2 gene in cell growth we performed a colony assay which showed an impressive HIPK2 inhibitory effect on normal thyroid cells. Flow cytometric analysis would indicate the block of cell growth at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Since normal thyroid cells do not express detectable HMGI(Y) protein levels, we assume that the HIPK2 inhibitory effect is independent from the interaction with the HMGI(Y) protein."
https://openalex.org/W2060143541,"Curcumin, an important inhibitor of carcinogenesis, is an inhibitor of the ATPase activity of the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Inhibition by curcumin is structurally specific, requiring the presence of a pair of –OH groups at the 4-position of the rings. Inhibition is not competitive with ATP. Unexpectedly, addition of curcumin to SR vesicles leads to an increase in the rate of accumulation of Ca2+, unlike other inhibitors of the Ca2+-ATPase that result in a reduced rate of accumulation. An increase in the rate of accumulation of Ca2+ is seen in the presence of phosphate ion, which lowers the concentration of free Ca2+ within the lumen of the SR, showing that the effect is not passive leak across the SR membrane. Rather, simulations suggest that the effect is to reduce the rate of slippage on the ATPase, a process in which a Ca2+-bound, phosphorylated intermediate releases its bound Ca2+ on the cytoplasmic rather than on the lumenal side of the membrane. The structural specificity of the effects of curcumin on ATPase activity and on Ca2+ accumulation is the same, and the apparent dissociation constants for the two effects are similar, suggesting that the two effects of curcumin could follow from binding to a single site on the ATPase.

The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. Wiley Interscience, New York1981: 1-163Google Scholar). In the transport process the Ca2+-ATPase binds two Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasmic side of the SR membrane, followed by the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate from which two bound Ca2+ ions are released into the lumen of the SR. Efficient coupling of hydrolysis of ATP to the transport of Ca2+ requires that the rate of leak of Ca2+ of the lumen be slow and that Ca2+ions only be released from the phosphorylated intermediate of the ATPase to the lumenal side of the membrane; any release of Ca2+ from the phosphorylated intermediate to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane will result in futile hydrolysis of ATP (Scheme FS1). SR vesicles produced by homogenization of muscle show the expected ratio of two Ca2+ ions accumulated per ATP molecule hydrolyzed during the first cycle of the ATPase, before the lumenal concentration of Ca2+ has increased to a high level (2Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Verjovski-Almeida S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 307: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expected ratio of 2 Ca2+ ions accumulated per ATP molecule hydrolyzed is also observed in the presence of oxalate, which leads to precipitation of calcium oxalate in the lumen of the SR, thus maintaining a low free lumenal concentration of Ca2+ (1de Meis L. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. Wiley Interscience, New York1981: 1-163Google Scholar). However, under conditions where the lumenal Ca2+concentration reaches millimolar concentrations, the level of Ca2+ accumulated becomes less than 2:1 with respect to ATP hydrolyzed (3Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4McWhirter J.M. Gould G.W. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both passive leak and slippage have been suggested to contribute to this lower than expected stoichiometry for accumulation of Ca2+ by SR. Although there is no evidence for IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels in SR membranes (5Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 6Scherer N.M. Ferguson J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1064-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Mikos G.J. Snow T.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the SR does contain ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+channels, concentrated in the terminal cisternae region of the SR, close to the T-tubules (5Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). However, on homogenizing SR the terminal cisternae form a heavy fraction that can be separated on sucrose gradients from the light fraction that makes up the majority of the SR and that is largely free of ryanodine receptor (5Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+ is observed to leak from Ca2+-loaded light SR vesicles lacking the ryanodine receptor, it has been suggested that the Ca2+-ATPase itself provides a pathway for passive leak across the SR membrane (3Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Passive leak of Ca2+ has also been observed from vesicles reconstituted from purified Ca2+-ATPase again suggesting that leak of Ca2+can occur through the Ca2+-ATPase (8Inesi G. Nakamoto R. Hymel L. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14804-14809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gould G.W. Colyer J. East J.M. Lee A.G. J. Biol.

Acta. 1987; 904: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Evidence also exists for a slippage pathway in which Ca2+ is released from the phosphorylated ATPase to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (3Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Slippage can be modeled as shown in Scheme FS1 (12Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-bound phosphorylated form of the ATPase (E2PCa2) can either follow the normal pathway, releasing Ca2+ into the lumen of the SR followed by dephosphorylation of the ATPase, or E2PCa2can release Ca2+ on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and dephosphorylate to E2. The relative amounts ofE2PCa2 following these two pathways will depend on the relative rates of the two steps leading to release of Ca2+ from the ATPase and on the concentration of Ca2+ in the lumen of the SR; the higher the internal concentration of Ca2+ the larger the proportion ofE2PCa2 that will follow the slippage pathway. Evidence for the importance of slippage comes from experiments showing that uptake of Ca2+ by SR vesicles on addition of ATP is followed by spontaneous release of some of the accumulated Ca2+, even in the continued presence of ATP and external Ca2+, conditions under which simple passive leak is inhibited (4McWhirter J.M. Gould G.W. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This spontaneous release is also observed in the presence of acetyl phosphate instead of ATP so that release does not correspond to the back reaction of the Ca2+-ATPase (1de Meis L. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. Wiley Interscience, New York1981: 1-163Google Scholar) in which Ca2+ efflux is linked to the conversion of ADP to ATP (4McWhirter J.M. Gould G.W. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Changes in the stoichiometry of Ca2+ accumulation with time in reconstituted vesicles have also been interpreted in terms of slippage on the ATPase (11Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The rate of slippage for the Ca2+-ATPase in reconstituted vesicles is dependent on the phospholipid composition of the membrane, with high rates of slippage in phosphatidylcholines but much slower rates of slippage in the presence of anionic phospholipids (12Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The presence of leak and slippage pathways in the SR initially seems surprising because the primary role of SR is as a store for Ca2+ in muscle cells. However, SR also has an important role in non-shivering thermogenesis (13Block B.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 535-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In animals lacking brown adipose tissue, the principle source of heat during non-shivering thermogenesis is the hydrolysis of ATP by the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle SR (13Block B.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 535-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Part of the energy released when ATP is hydrolyzed is dissipated as heat, and part is used to drive Ca2+ across the membrane, against its concentration gradient (14de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 598-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Mitidieri F. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28344-28350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). de Meis (16de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) has shown that the heat produced during ATP hydrolysis and the uncoupled ATPase activity is dependent on the ADP/ATP ratio in the medium and that when the ADP concentration is low, the uncoupled ATPase activity is the dominant route for heat production. We show that curcumin, an important inhibitor of carcinogenesis (17Manson M.M. Holloway K.A. Howells L.M. Hudson E.A. Plummer S.M. Squires M.S. Pugent S.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), inhibits the ATPase activity of the Ca2+-ATPase but increases the level of Ca2+ accumulation by the ATPase, because of a reduction in the rate of slippage. BHQ was obtained from Aldrich and ruthenium red from Sigma. Curcumin was from ICN, and xestospongin C was from Calbiochem. Curcumin analogues were the generous gift of Professor W. Hänsel of the Pharmazeutisches Institut, University of Kiel. SR vesicles containing predominantly light SR were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle mainly as described by Saito et al. (18Saito K. Imamura Y. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Muscle was homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mmimidazole, pH 7.4, and the homogenate was spun for 10 min at 8300 × g; the pellet was rehomogenized and spun as before. The supernatants were pooled, filtered through muslin, and spun for 90 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of the homogenization buffer and frozen until use. SR was fractionated into light, intermediate, and heavy fractions on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (7 ml of 27% (w/v), 7 ml of 32% (w/v), 7 ml of 38% (w/v), and 7 ml of 45% (w/v) sucrose in 5 mmimidazole, pH 7.4), spun 95,000 × g overnight, and followed by a final wash spin at 125,000 × g for 2 h. Protein concentrations were determined using the absorption coefficient given by Hardwicke and Green (19Hardwicke P.M. Green N.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Accumulation of Ca2+ by SR vesicles (0.08 mg of protein/ml) was measured at 25 °C using the indicator antipyrylazo III (80 μm) to monitor the external Ca2+concentration, measuring the absorption difference 720–790 nm in an Aminco-Bowman DW2000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer. The assay buffer was 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.1, 100 mmK2SO4, 5 mm MgSO4. The absorption change was calibrated by the incremental addition of Ca2+ to a final concentration of 120 μm. Accumulation of Ca2+ was initiated by addition of 0.8 mm ATP. Some experiments employed an ATP-regenerating system of pyruvate kinase (7.5 IU) and phosphoenolpyruvate (1.5 mm). Accumulation of Ca2+ was also monitored using 50 μm arsenazo III, monitoring the absorption difference 675–685 nm. Simulations of Ca2+ accumulation were performed using the program FACSIMILE (UKEA). ATPase activities were determined at 25 °C using a coupled enzyme assay in a medium containing 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 2.1 mm ATP, 1.1 mm EGTA, 0.52 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mm NADH, pyruvate kinase (7.5 IU), lactate dehydrogenase (18 IU), and 5 μg of A23187 in a total volume of 2.5 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an aliquot of a 50 mm CaCl2 solution to a cuvette containing the ATPase and the other reagents to give a maximally stimulating concentration of Ca2+ (free Ca2+concentration was ∼10 μm). Free concentrations of Ca2+ were calculated using the binding constants for Ca2+, Mg2+, and H+ to EGTA given by Godt (20Godt R.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 63: 722-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the case of simple non-competitive inhibition the measured rate k I in the presence of a concentration [I] of inhibitor is simply given by Equation 1, kI=k/(1+[I]/K1)Equation 1 where k is the uninhibited rate, andK 1 is the dissociation constant for binding the inhibitor. As described below, addition of curcumin results in a small increase in activity at low concentrations, and inhibition appears at higher concentrations. The simplest model is to assume that the inhibitor binds to a single site on the protein to cause stimulation, according to Scheme 2. E→k1E+PKs⇅EsI→k2E+P SCHEME2If the dissociation constant for the inhibitor at the stimulatory site is K s, then the stimulated rate is given as a function of the concentration of I by Equation 2, ks=k11+[I]/Ks+k2[I]/Ks1+[I]/KsEquation 2 If binding at the stimulatory site is totally independent of binding at the inhibitory site, then the two can be treated separately, and the final rate is given by Equation 1 with k replaced byk s. However, a complication of this analysis follows from the fact that stimulation occurs at low concentrations of inhibitor. When the concentration of inhibitor is comparable with the concentration of protein, binding to the protein could significantly decrease the unbound concentration of inhibitor, and it is then necessary to use the full, quadratic form of the binding equation. If [E] t is the total concentration of enzyme and [I] t is the total concentration of inhibitor, then the concentration of complex [EI] is as shown in Equation3, [EI]=B−B2−4C2Equation 3 where B = [E] t + [I] t + Ks and C = [E] t [I] t . The stimulated rate is shown in Equation 4. kstim=(([E]t−[EI])kI+[EI]k2)/[E]tEquation 4 Because inhibition occurs at much higher concentrations of inhibitor (where the concentration of bound inhibitor will be negligible compared with the total concentration of inhibitor), the simple form of the binding equation (Equation 1) can be used to describe inhibitor binding at the inhibition site. Experimental data were fitted to the above equations using the non-linear least squares fitting routine in SigmaPlot. Addition of low concentrations of curcumin (up to ∼0.8 μm) to the Ca2+-ATPase results in a small (∼10%) increase in activity, followed by a decrease in activity at higher concentrations so that at ∼3 μm curcumin the activity is half the initial activity (Fig. 1). To account for the initial stimulation, the data were fitted to a model assuming binding of curcumin to a stimulatory site and to an inhibitory site, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The value of the stimulated rate constant (k s) relative to the unstimulated rate constant was well defined at 1.17 ± 0.03, but because stimulation occurred at very low concentrations of curcumin where most of the added curcumin will be bound, the dissociation constant describing binding to the stimulatory site (K s) was not well defined. Any value for K s less than about 0.1 μmgave an equally good fit. The value for K s was therefore fixed at 0.01 μm, giving a value for the dissociation constant at the inhibitory site of 3.0 ± 0.5 μm (Table I).Table IEffects of curcumin analogues on ATPase activityInhibitorDissociation constant for stimulatory siteDissociation constant for inhibitory siteStimulated fractional rateμmCurcumin0.01 (fixed)3.0 ± 0.51.17 ± 0.03Bisdesmethoxy/curcumin1.23 ± 0.13The assay conditions are given under “Materials and Methods.” The dissociation constants and rate constants were obtained by fitting of the data in Fig. 1, as described in the text. Open table in a new tab The assay conditions are given under “Materials and Methods.” The dissociation constants and rate constants were obtained by fitting of the data in Fig. 1, as described in the text. Fig. 2 A shows the effect of 6 μm curcumin on ATPase activity, measured as a function of the concentration of ATP. The level of inhibition is almost independent of the concentration of ATP, varying from 50% at 0.5 mmATP to 40% at 4.1 mm ATP, showing that binding of curcumin does not show simple competition with binding of ATP. ATPase activity as a function of Ca2+ concentration shows the typical bell-shaped dependence on Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 2 B). The presence of 6 μm curcumin had no significant effect on the concentrations of Ca2+ causing stimulation of ATPase activity and had only a small effect in the high concentration range where Ca2+ causes inhibition. Effects of curcumin are structurally specific; structures of curcumin analogues tested are shown in Fig. 3. Bisdesmethoxycurcumin is also an inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase. In this case stimulation at low concentrations, although still present, is less marked than for curcumin. The data were therefore fitted to a simple inhibition curve, giving dissociation constant for bisdesmethoxycurcumin slightly less than that for curcumin (Table I). The curcumin analogue A (Fig. 3) lacking –OH groups gave a maximum of 40% inhibition at a concentration of 20 μm (data not shown), but analogue B lacking –OH groups at the 4-position gave no inhibition at concentrations up to 30 μm. Addition of ATP to SR vesicles leads to accumulation of Ca2+, the final level of accumulation varying significantly between preparations (4McWhirter J.M. Gould G.W. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows ATP-driven accumulation of Ca2+ by a sample of fractionated, light SR vesicles incubated in the presence of Ca2+. The inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-dihydroxybenzene (BHQ) inhibits ATPase activity of the Ca2+-ATPase with 50% ATPase activity observed at about 0.3 μm BHQ. As expected, the addition of 2 μm BHQ leads to a reduced rate of accumulation of Ca2+, the final level of accumulation being little affected (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, however, addition of 15 μmcurcumin, despite being an inhibitor of ATPase activity, leads to an increased rate of accumulation of Ca2+ and a small increase in the final level of accumulation (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the concentration dependence of the effect of curcumin on an unfractionated sample of SR vesicles. Accumulation of Ca2+ is non-linear with time but gave reasonable fits to a single exponential process, allowing the curves to be characterized by a single rate constant, shown in Fig. 1. The dependence of these rate constants on the concentration of curcumin fits to a simple Michaelis-Menten scheme with the concentration of curcumin causing a half-maximal effect of 2.48 ± 0.80 μm, with a maximum rate of accumulation of Ca2+ of 0.054 ± 0.004 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/s, compared with an unstimulated rate of 0.030 ± 0.002 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/s (Fig. 1).Figure 5The concentration-dependent effect of curcumin on accumulation of Ca2+. A, ATP-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ was determined for unfractionated SR vesicles (0.08 mg of protein/ml), at curcumin concentrations (μm) as follows: a, 0; b, 0.5; c, 1.0; andd, 2.0. B and C show results of simulations of accumulation of Ca2+ according to Scheme FS1, as described in the text. B, the rate of passive leak (Cai → Cao) was fixed at 7 × 10−7 s−1 with values for the rate of the slippage step (s−1) as follows: a, 65;b, 55; c, 40; and d, 35. C,the rate of slippage was fixed at zero, and rates of passive leak (s−1) are as follows: a, 5 × 10−6; b, 4 × 10−6; andc, 3 × 10−6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of curcumin on the accumulation of Ca2+ are structurally specific (Fig. 3). Analogues lacking the –OH groups at position 4 of the two rings fail to inhibit ATPase activity at 6 μm and also have no effect on the level of accumulation of Ca2+. However, analogue C (bisdesmethoxycurcumin), which lacks the methoxy groups at position 3 on the two rings, is both an inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase and increases the rate of accumulation of Ca2+ as shown in Fig. 3 and Table I. Hydrolysis of ATP by the ATPase during the process of accumulation of Ca2+ generates concentrations of ADP that can have significant effects on the accumulation process (21Gould G.W. McWhirter J.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The generated ADP can be removed by addition of an ATP-regenerating system. Ca2+ accumulation under these conditions increases almost linearly with time after the first 100 s (Fig. 6 A), whereas in the absence of the regenerating system the level of Ca2+ accumulated hardly increases after about 100 s (Fig. 4). An increase in the initial rate of accumulation of Ca2+ is seen in the presence of curcumin (Fig. 6 A), similar to that seen in the absence of the regenerating system (Fig. 4). Accumulation of Ca2+ by SR vesicles can also be driven by acetyl phosphate rather than ATP, although the rate of accumulation is slower than with ATP (Fig. 6 B). The initial rate of accumulation of Ca2+ driven by acetyl phosphate is increased by addition of curcumin, although the effect is less marked than with ATP as substrate (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, addition of BHQ (2 μm) results in a marked reduction in the rate of accumulation of Ca2+ (Fig. 6 B). The membrane of the SR contains a transporter for phosphate (22Stefanova H.I.

Membrane Proteins in Transport and Phosphorylation. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1974: 103-111Google Scholar). In the presence of phosphate in the external medium, phosphate ions diffuse through the SR membrane and, because of the low solubility of calcium phosphate, form precipitates of calcium phosphate within the lumen of the SR. This lowers the internal concentration of free Ca2+ and reduces the rate of either Ca2+leak or Ca2+ slippage, resulting in higher levels of accumulation of Ca2+ (12Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S.

In the presence of 5 mm Pi accumulation of Ca2+increases almost linearly with time (Fig. 7).

Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). We have found that 2-APB causes a large decrease in the absorbance of the dye antipyrylazo III, which could not therefore be used to monitor changes in Ca2+ concentration. However, no interaction was observed between 2-APB and arsenazo III. By using arsenazo III to monitor Ca2+ concentrations, concentrations of 2-APB up to 50 μm were found to have no effect on accumulation of Ca2+ by SR vesicles; higher concentrations could not be used because of precipitation of 2-APB (data not shown). Light SR vesicles contain no ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels as shown by the lack of reaction with antibodies specific for the channel (data not shown). Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channel (26Chamberlain B.K. Volpe P. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2006983701,"The receptor tyrosine kinase Ron is a member of the receptor family that includes the proto-oncogene Met and the avian oncogene Sea. The interaction of Ron with its ligand, known as hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (HGFL) or macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), induces crucial cellular responses including invasive growth, proliferation, cell scattering, and branching morphogenesis. Based on the homology and functional similarities between Met and Ron it was hypothesized that Ron may be important in tumor formation and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, wild-type mouse Ron and three mutant forms of Ron containing mutations similar to those found in the Met gene in human hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC), were expressed in NIH3T3 cells. A transformed phenotype was produced in cell lines expressing either wild-type Ron or the mutated Ron proteins. Further, these cell lines displayed oncogenic potential by exhibiting increased proliferation and constitutive phosphorylation of Ron. These cell lines were also tested for the ability to form solid tumors. Cells expressing wild-type Ron and the three proteins with single amino acid substitutions were highly tumorigenic in vivo. In a model of experimental metastasis, two of the cell lines with altered Ron protein formed highly aggressive tumors in the lungs. These results suggest that Ron may be an aggressive oncogene when either overexpressed or when activated by mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1993612200,"The contribution of the short wavelength ultraviolet (UV) component of sunlight to the aetiology of skin cancer has been widely acknowledged, although its direct contribution to tumour initiation or progression is still poorly understood. The loss of normal cell cycle controls, particularly checkpoint controls, are a common feature of cancer. UV radiation causes both G1 and G2 phase checkpoint arrest in vitro cultured cells. In this study we have investigated the cell cycle responses to suberythemal doses of UV on skin. We have utilized short-term whole organ skin cultures, and multi parameter immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis to demonstrate that basal and suprabasal layer melanocytes and keratinocytes undergo a G2 phase cell cycle arrest for up to 48 h following irradiation. The arrest is associated with increased p16 expression but no apparent p53 involvement. This type of organ culture provides a very useful model system, combining the ease of in vitro manipulation with the ability to perform detailed molecular analysis in a normal tissue environment."
https://openalex.org/W2064241321,"Cell cycle control by pRb requires the integrity of the pocket domain, which is a region necessary for interactions with a variety of proteins, including E2F and LXCXE-motif containing proteins. Through knowledge of the crystal structure of pRb we have prepared a panel of pRb mutant derivatives in which a cluster of lysine residues that demark the LXCXE peptide binding domain were systematically mutated. One of the mutant derivatives, Rb6A, exhibits significantly reduced LXCXE-dependent interactions with HPV E7, cyclinD1 and HDAC2, but retained LXCXE-independent binding to E2F. Consistent with these results, Rb6A could down-regulate E2F-1-dependent activation of different E2F responsive promoters, but was compromised in Rb-dependent repression. Most importantly, Rb6A retained wild-type growth arrest activity, and colony forming activity similar to wild-type pRb. It is compatible with these results that directly targeting HDAC2 to E2F responsive promoters as an E2F/HDAC hybrid protein failed to effect cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that LXCXE-dependent interactions are not essential for pRb to exert growth arrest."

A wide variety of external stimuli, including neurotransmitters, hormones, phospholipids, photons, odorants, taste ligands, and growth factors, can activate specific members of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Besides essential functions in fully differentiated cells and tissues, GPCRs are also involved in embryogenesis, tissue regeneration, cell growth stimulation, and cell proliferation. In this study, we identified a novel prostate-specific G-protein coupled receptor that interacts with Gα12 in our yeast two-hybrid assays. The expression of the receptor protein is highly restricted to human prostate tissues using multiple-tissue Northern blot analysis, and tissue expression array. Furthermore, the expression of prostate-specific receptor is increased significantly in prostate tumors in comparison with the matched normal prostate tissues using PCR and Southern blot analysis, suggesting a potential role of this tissue-specific G-protein coupled receptor in prostate cancer development."

To understand the molecular mechanism by which c-Myc is down-regulated due to overexpression of PU.1, we performed luciferase reporter assays using the mouse c-myc promoter. PU.1 repressed the activities of not only the c-myc promoter but also several other promoters. Experiments with deletion mutants of PU.1 revealed that the C-terminal region spanning amino acids (aa) 123-272 including the PEST and ETS domains but not the activation domain was sufficient for this transcriptional repression. It was unlikely that the repression was due to sequestration of a limited amount of CBP/p300 nor pCAF, because overexpression of these co-activators did not relieve PU.1-mediated transcriptional repression. Instead, it was found that the C-terminal aa 101-272 of PU.1 formed a complex with mSin3A and HDAC1 in vivo, which was speculated to be associated with the repression. The C-terminal region of PU.1 also formed a complex with the basic transcription factor TBP in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that overexpression of PU.1 induces transcriptional repression in several gene promoters including the c-myc promoter which may be mediated by its complex formation with HDACs."
https://openalex.org/W2109017018,"Blockage of transcription has been shown to induce the tumor suppressor p53 in human cells. We here show that RNA synthesis inhibitors blocking the phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, such as DRB and H7, induced rapid nuclear accumulation of p53 proteins that were not phosphorylated at ser15 or acetylated at lys382. In contrast, agents that inhibit the elongation phase of transcription, such as UV light, camptothecin or actinomycin D, induced the accumulation of nuclear p53 proteins that were modified at both of these sites. Furthermore, using a panel of DNA repair-deficient cells we show that persistent DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes are responsible for the induction of the ser15 and lys382 modifications following UV-irradiation. We conclude that inhibition of transcription is sufficient for the accumulation of p53 in the nucleus regardless of whether the ser15 site of p53 is phosphorylated or not. Importantly, blockage of the elongation phase of transcription triggers a distinct signaling pathway leading to p53 modifications on ser15 and lys382. We propose that the elongating RNA polymerase complex may act as a sensor of DNA damage and as an integrator of cellular stress signals."

Leishmaniaspecies have a digenetic life cycle, passing between a sandfly vector and mammalian hosts. Leishmania exist as extracellular flagellated promastigotes within the alimentary canal of the insect, and these differentiate into the highly infectious metacyclic form that is found within the mouth parts of the insect. Parasites are transmitted to a mammal when the vector takes a blood meal, and following macrophage invasion they reside within phagolysosomes as aflagellated amastigotes (1Molyneux D.H. Hide G.

To date, there is no evidence for the existence of promoter elements for an α-amanitin-sensitive RNA polymerase II (5Myler P.J. Audleman L. DeVos T. Hixson G. Kiser P. Lemley C. Magness C. Rickel E. Sisk E. Sunkin S. Swartzell S. Westlake T. Bastien P. Fu G.L. Ivens A. Stuart K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2902-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus transcription of protein coding genes is considered to be constitutive inLeishmania and related trypanosomatids, and the regulation of gene expression is believed to occur predominantly at the post-transcriptional level (14Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stiles J.K. Hicock P.I. Shah P.H. Meade J.C. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1999; 93: 781-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polycistronic precursor mRNAs of trypanosomatids are converted into monocistronic mRNAs by two cleavage reactions that occur within the intercistronic regions. One cleavage is associated withtrans-splicing of a capped 39-nucleotide spliced leader sequence to the 5′-end of the mature mRNA (16Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The second cleavage occurs in a region several hundred bases upstream of the splice acceptor site and is necessary for polyadenylation (17LeBowitz J.H. Smith J. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 7: 996-1007Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thetrans-splicing and polyadenylation reactions are tightly coupled and regulated by polypyrimidine tracts present within the intercistronic sequences (17LeBowitz J.H. Smith J. Rusche L. Beverley S.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 7: 996-1007Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that differential gene expression in Leishmania can be mediated by sequence elements in the 3′-UTRs1 that affect mRNA stability (13Charest H. Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12133-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), probably by mediating the events involved in pre-mRNA processing (trans-splicing and cleavage/polyadenylation), but nocis-regulatory elements have been defined (22Ramamoorthy R.

The precise mechanisms that govern leishmanial gene expression are still not well understood, although the recent identification and characterization of the L. major poly(A)-binding protein I (23Bates E.J. Knuepfer E. Smith D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) should shed some light on this area. Leishmania mexicana contain numerous lysosomal cysteine proteases, the majority of which are cathepsin L-like and are expressed in increasing amounts during life cycle progression from promastigotes to amastigotes (24Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Mottram J.C. Brooks D.R. Coombs G.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The type I cysteine proteases are encoded by the CPB genes (26Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which map to one genomic locus as a tandem array of 19 copies (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L.

Targeted deletion of this array to generate the null mutant ΔCPB has shown that the genes encode virulence factors (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc.

Parasitology. 2000; 121: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Re-expression of differentCPB genes in the ΔCPB cell line and analyses of enzyme substrate preferences have shown that some CPBs have differing substrate specificities (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J.

Moreover, the first two genes of the array, CPB1 and CPB2, are atypical because they encode enzymes that lack the C-terminal domain characteristic of trypanosomatid type I cysteine proteases (10Mottram J.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7411-7420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore,CPB1 and CPB2 are expressed almost exclusively in the infective metacyclic stage, whereas the remaining isogenes are expressed predominantly in amastigotes (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism controlling this differential stage regulation of CPBs. The strategy utilized was to restore by genetic manipulation CPBrepeat units, and variants thereof, into the endogenousCPB-depleted locus of ΔCPB. Importantly, this allowed gene expression to be analyzed in its correct chromosomal context. The resulting stage-regulated CPB activities of these mutants demonstrated that the differential gene expression profile of theCPB array is dependent upon the presence or absence of short sequence elements in the respective intercistronic regions and that these sequence elements influence processing of precursor mRNA. This mechanism of stage-regulated control differs significantly from previous findings that stage-regulated expression inLeishmania is regulated post-transcriptionally by mRNA stability and translation. L. mexicana (MNYC/BZ/62/M379) promastigotes were grown at 25 °C in complete modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, pH 7.5 (31Mottram J.C. Robertson C.D.

This fragment was sequenced (Applied Biosystems, Inc. 373 DNA Sequencer) on both strands by primer walking, and the data were analyzed using the Wisconsin GCG package. For episomal re-expression, CPB2 was excised from pGL26 as a 1951-bpEcoRV fragment and subcloned into the SmaI site of pX (33LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The parental plasmid used to generate the constructs for targeting to the CPB-depleted locus of ΔCPB was plmcpb2-hyg (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A number of subcloning steps were performed. (i) Digestion of plmcpb2-hyg withSpeI/BamHI released the HYG gene that was replaced with SAT by SpeI/BamHI digestion of plmcpa-sat (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J.

The resulting plasmid, pGL146, contains the original 436-bp unique 5′-flank of theCPB array and an additional 199 bp of non-unique 5′-flank that includes the sequences required for spliced leader addition. (iii) To complete the upstream control sequence (from theSalI site to the ATG start codon of the CPBs), a PCR product was generated with primers lmcpb5′5′ (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E.

Parameters for thermocycling with Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (20 times); 72 °C for 5 min. The resulting 803-bp PCR product was cloned into pGEM T-vector (Promega) to generate plasmid pGL157. (iv) The 168-bp SalI-SpeI fragment from pGL157 (which contains the remainder of the upstream sequence to the start codon that is required for expression of CPBs) was subcloned into pGL146 to generate pGL159. Plasmid pGL159 was subsequently used to integrate the native and chimeric CPBs by cloning into theSalI site.

(ix) The SalI fragment of pGL154 was subcloned into theSalI site of pGL159 to generate the chimericCPB2.8 re-integration plasmid pGL168. The bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was amplified from pHD52 (34Hug M. Carruthers V.B. Hartmann C. Sherman D.S. Cross G.A.M. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using primers OL221 (CTCGAGATGGAGAAAAAAATCACTGGATATACC) and OL222 (GATATCTTACGCCCCGCCCTGCCACTCATC) with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) (20 cycles; annealing 60 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 40 s). The 725-bp PCR product was cloned into pPCR-Script Amp(SK+) (Stratagene) to generate pGL294. The CPB2 EcoRV-SalI fragment from the non-coding region of pGL26 was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGL294 to generate pGL298. The CPB 5′-sequence that includes thetrans-splicing site was subcloned into pGL298 as aSacI-SacII fragment derived from pGL157 (a pGEM T-vector clone of the CPB 5′-flank region) to generate pGL299. The CPB 5′-flank CAT-CPB2non-coding region was excised from pGL299 as a SalI fragment and subcloned into the corresponding site of pGL159 to generate the construct used for re-integration (pGL300) into the ΔCPBcell line. Further details on the sequence of the plasmids can be obtained from the authors upon request. Transfection of L. mexicana was as described previously (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E.

Briefly, 4 × 107 late-log phase ΔCPB promastigotes were subjected to electroporation with either 2 μg of pXCPB2 (pGL67) or 10 μg of the purified re-integration cassette obtained by restriction digestion (HindIII and BglII) from the appropriate plasmids (pGL165–pGL168 and pGL300). After overnight incubation in medium lacking antibiotics, the cell line transfected with the episome pGL67 was selected in 25 μg ml−1 G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell lines transfected for integration were spread onto modified Eagle's medium plates supplemented with 10 μg ml−1 phleomycin (Cayla, France) and 25 μg ml−1 nourseothricin hydrosulfate (Hans-Knöll Institute, Germany). Colonies, visible following 10–14 days incubation at 25 °C, were picked and inoculated into complete liquid modified Eagle's medium containing appropriate antibiotics. Parasites that were found to be resistant to 10 μg ml−1 phleomycin and 25 μg ml−1 nourseothricin hydrosulfate, but sensitive to 50 μg ml−1 hygromycin B, were grown to stationary phase, and DNA was prepared according to Medina-Acosta and Cross (35Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The DNA (5 μg) was digested with restriction enzymes and processed as described previously (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The probe consisted of a 1:1 ratio of a 203-bp KpnI-SacI fragment derived from pGL26 and pGL28 that composed part of the ORFs of CPB2 andCPB2.8. Total RNA was prepared fromLeishmania cells using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples from 2 × 107 cells were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% (w/v) agarose, 0.66 m formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (10Mottram J.C.

Filters were hybridized at 42 °C and washed at 55 °C as described previously (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol.

The labeled filters were exposed to storage phosphor screens and scanned using a Typhoon 8600 Imager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Levels of mRNA were measured using ImageQuant software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and normalized using α-tubulin mRNA. Total RNA was isolated fromL. mexicana stationary phase promastigotes (containing a high proportion of metacyclics) as described previously (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L.

First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) adaptor primer (5′-TGACGTCTTGGAGCTCGGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′), and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus Superscript II reverse transcriptase as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Aliquots were subsequently analyzed by 2 rounds of PCR usingTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The initial PCR used OL98 (5′-CGGGAGAGTGCCGCCCCTGGC-3′) in conjunction with the 3′adapter primer (5′-TGACGTCTTGGAGCTCGGC-3′). Re-amplification used CPB1–CPB2-specific primer DB1 orCPB3–CPB18-specific primer DB3 (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol.

The annealing temperature was increased to 60 °C for re-amplification with OL699 (5′-CGAGCCCGCTATTCTGCCTTCG-3′) and the 3′-adapter. PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-vector (Promega) and sequenced to localize the poly(A) addition sites. Parasite cysteine protease activity was determined using substrate SDS-PAGE as described previously (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, parasite cell lysates (107 cells) were subjected to electrophoresis under reducing conditions using 12% (w/v) acrylamide gels incorporating 0.2% (w/v) gelatin. Following electrophoresis, the gel was washed for 1 h with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 to allow refolding of proteins and then incubated in 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Hydrolysis of gelatin was detected by staining with 0.25% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-250. The CAT assay was performed using the CAT assay system (Promega). Metacyclics and axenic amastigotes were lysed at 109 cells ml−1 and 50 μl assayed at 37 °C for 3 h as described by the manufacturer. Reactions were terminated by addition of 300 μl of mixed xylenes (Sigma), and the organic phase, containingn-butyryl-[14C]chloramphenicol, was subjected to liquid scintillation counting. The 19 CPB genes of L. mexicanaare arranged in a tandem array of 2.8-kb repeat units (Fig. 1 A). In previous work (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E.

In expectation that sequence elements regulating the stage-specific expression of the CPB genes would reside in the 3′-UTR or intercistronic regions of the genes, the complete repeat unit (defined as a 2.8-kb SalI fragment, Fig. 1) was sequenced for CPB1 and CPB2.8(additional sequence deposited as updates to EMBL data base accession numbers Z49962 and Z49963). As both CPB1 and CPB2were found to be metacyclic specific, the SalI repeat unit containing the CPB2 gene was subcloned from a bacteriophage λ clone (λ13, see “Experimental Procedures”) (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol.

A high level of nucleic acid sequence identity exists in theSalI repeat units of CPB1, CPB2, andCPB2.8, with the exception of two regions (Fig. 1 B, the CPB1 sequence is identical toCPB2 over these two regions). First, there is significant sequence divergence in the region comprising the CTE of CPB2.8 (Fig. 1 C and Ref. 10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Second, a region of 120 bp (termed the insertion sequence (InS), defined in Fig. 1 D) is characterized by 4 short insertions, totaling 57 bp, in theCPB2 and CPB1 sequences. The final insertion of 32 bp is composed predominantly of GT and GC repeats (12 repeats in total). Additionally, CPB1 and CPB2 have a 31-bp region within the diverged sequence that is 90% AT-rich and includes 14 TA repeats. In contrast, comparison of CPB1 andCPB2 sequences from the stop codon to the downstreamSalI site (a region comprising 1490 bp) revealed only 4 nucleotide changes (not shown). In addition, in the 1183 bp of sequence between the stop codon of CPB2.8 and the downstreamSalI site (excluding the 120 bp InS), only 7 nucleotides differed from CPB1 and 3 differed from CPB2. cpb2 is predicted to encode a protein, CPB2, of 359 amino acids with a high degree of sequence identity to CPB1. In the pre-pro region, CPB2 shows absolute identity to that of CPB2.8, whereas there are 4 amino acid changes relative to the pre-pro-region of CPB1 (Table I). The primary amino acid sequence of the mature domain of CPB2 is the most divergent of the isoenzymes of the CPB array examined so far and encodes four amino acids that are unique to date: Glu21, Ser30, Ser115, and Glu160. Nevertheless, the mature domain of CPB2 is 95% identical to that of CPB2.8 and 98% identical to that of CPB1. TheCPB2 coding region, like CPB1 (10Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L.

Thus, both of the metacyclic-specific genes encode CPB enzymes with truncated CTEs, whereas those genes expressed at a high level in amastigotes (CPB2.8, CPB cDNA (26Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H.

https://openalex.org/W2312795792,"Two specific inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), roscovitine and olomoucine, have been shown recently to induce nuclear accumulation of wt p53 and nucleolar unravelling in interphase human untransformed IMR-90 and breast tumor-derived MCF-7 cells. Here, we show that the early response of MCF-7 cells to roscovitine is fully reversible since a rapid restoration of nucleolar organization followed by an induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1), a downregulation of nuclear wt p53 and normal cell cycle resumption occurs if the compound is removed after 4 h. Interestingly, similar reversible effects are also induced by the casein kinase II (CKII) inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole. Upon short-term treatment also, both compounds significantly, but reversibly, reduce the level of 45S precursor ribosomal RNA. Cells exposed to the two types of protein kinase inhibitors for longer times keep exhibiting altered nucleolar and wt p53 features, yet they strikingly differentiate in that most roscovitine-treated cells fail to ever accumulate high levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in contrast with DRB-treated ones. In both cases, however, the cells eventually fall into an irreversible state and die. Moreover, we found that constitutive overexpression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) alters the nucleolar unravelling process in the presence of DRB, but not of roscovitine, suggesting a role for this physiological Cdk inhibitor in the regulation of nucleolar function. Our data also support the notion that both roscovitine- and DRB-sensitive protein kinases, probably including Cdk2 and CKII, via their dual implication in the p53-Rb pathway and in ribosomal biogenesis, would participate in coupling cell growth with cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2317191293,"In search of human homologues of the anti-apoptotic protein Nr-13, we have characterized a human EST clone that potentially encodes a protein, which is the closest homologue of Nr-13 among the Bcl-2 family members, to date known, in humans. Phylogenetic analyses suggest Human nrh, Mouse diva/boo and Quail nr-13 to be orthologous genes. The nrh gene has the same overall organization as nr-13 and diva/boo with one single intron interrupting the ORF at the level of the Bcl-2-homology domain BH2. RT–PCR-based analysis of nrh expression indicated that this gene is preferentially expressed in the lungs, the liver and the kidneys. Interestingly, two in frame ATG codons can lead potentially to the synthesis of two products, one of them lacking 10 aminoacids at the N-terminal end. Sequence alignment with Nr-13 and Diva/Boo in addition to secondary structure prediction of the nrh transcript suggested that the shortest protein will be preferentially synthetized. Immunohistochemical analyses have revealed that Nrh is associated with mitochondria and the nuclear envelope. Moreover, Nrh preferentially associates with the apoptosis accelerator Bcl-Xs and behaves as an inhibitor of apoptosis both in yeast and vertebrate cells."
https://openalex.org/W2008266440,"A novel gene, pHyde, was recently cloned from Dunning rat prostate cancer cells. A recombinant adenovirus containing pHyde cDNA gene (AdpHyde) was generated to investigate the biological function of pHyde protein. AdpHyde inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer cells. Apoptosis was induced in AdpHyde transduced cells as demonstrated by DAPI (4′, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole), TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick and labeling) staining, and flow cytometry assays. Apoptosis was also induced in human xenograft prostate cancer tumors growing in nude mice following treatment with AdpHyde. AdpHyde transduction resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of caspase-3 activity in DU145 cells which was blocked by DEVD (succinyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde) and VAD (benzyloxycarbonyl - Val - Ala - Asp -fluoromethylketone), inhibitors specifically against caspase-3. Moreover, cancer cells that lacked expression of endogenous caspase-3 were not or barely inhibited by pHyde. These results taken together suggest that pHyde inhibits cancer growth by inducing apoptosis through a caspase-3 dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2041565884,"To address the molecular mechanism of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, we have formulated a model for T cell activation, termed the 2D-affinity model, in which the density of TCR on the T cell surface, the density of ligand on the presenting surface, and their corresponding two-dimensional affinity determine the level of T cell activation. When fitted to T cell responses against purified ligands immobilized on plastic surfaces, the 2D-affinity model adequately simulated changes in cellular activation as a result of varying ligand affinity and ligand density. These observations further demonstrated the importance of receptor cross-linking density in determining TCR signaling. Moreover, it was found that the functional two-dimensional affinity of TCR ligands was affected by the chemical composition of the ligand-presenting surface. This makes it possible that cell-bound TCR ligands, despite their low affinity in solution, are of optimal two-dimensional affinity thereby allowing effective TCR binding under physiological conditions, i.e. at low ligand densities in cellular interfaces.

T cell receptor major histocompatibility complex complexes of peptides bound to MHC molecules immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin fluorescence-activated cell sorting antigen-presenting cells transcription factor of activated T cells Staphylococcus enterotoxin C3 hemagglutinin immunological synapse Most T cells present αβ T cell receptors (TCR)1 on their surface. The natural ligands for these receptors are small antigenic peptides bound to MHC molecules (pep·MHC) on the surface of other cells with which T cells interact (1Davis M.M. Boniface J.J. Reich Z. Lyons D. Hampl J. Arden B. Chien Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 523-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Antigen recognition can result in various protective functions, including release of cytokines to cause local inflammation and specific killing of virus-infected cells (2Germain R.N. Stefanova I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 467-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The TCR comprises the α/β subunits that recognize pep·MHC and the signal-transducing subunits δ, ε, γ, and ζ (CD3-ζ complex), which contain the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) (3Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Signaling of the TCR·CD3-ζ complex can be viewed as a dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation equilibrium of ITAMs where the steady-state levels of phosphorylated ITAMs are low in unstimulated T cells (4Acuto O. Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which ligand-bound TCR perturbs this equilibrium is unknown. One way to help identify the molecular features underlying TCR signaling is to develop mathematical models capable of simulating TCR signaling. Describing TCR signaling as a dynamic equilibrium indicates that it should be possible to model T cell behavior using mathematical expressions involving the binding constants of TCR·ligand interactions. Moreover, as recently discussed (5van der Merwe P.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 194-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), such models are attractive because they allow for simulation of T cell responses and thus help guide future research, and because they can assist in optimizing clinical immunomodulatory strategies. Previous mathematical analysis of T cell responses have been successful in modeling specific features such as fast ligand dissociation kinetics (6Valitutti S. Lanzavecchia A. Immunol.

Current models favor a discrimination between the potency of TCR ligands based on the life-time of the interaction, i.e. the off-rate (6Valitutti S. Lanzavecchia A. Immunol.

In Support, recent studies suggest that TCR signaling correlates to ligand dissociation rate (11Sykulev Y. Vugmeyster Y. Brunmark A. Ploegh H.L. Eisen H.N.

This is, however, still a matter of controversy, because conflicting reports exists, which favor ligand affinity as the determining factor for TCR signaling (14Alam S.M. Travers P.J. Wung J.L.

Recently, we have compared the stimulatory efficacy of a panel of anti-TCR antibodies and a panel of superantigens varying 10,000- and 150-fold in TCR affinity, respectively, with corresponding changes in binding kinetics as well (20Andersen P.S.

Stimulation of T cells with ligand-coated plastic surfaces revealed that the biological activity primarily matched the affinity of the TCR·ligand interaction. It therefore appeared that it was the density of bound receptors in the contact area that determined the strength of the T cell stimulus. This prompted us to develop a theoretical framework in which T cell responsiveness was expressed in mathematical terms. We present here a mathematical model, termed the 2D-affinity model, that allows for direct computation of T cell responses based on receptor and ligand densities and their corresponding solution affinity. A5 T cell hybridomas expressing the 14.3.d TCR (I-Ed/HA 110–119; Vα4.2, Vβ8.2) and carrying the reporter gene plasmid were grown in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with penicillin, 2 × 105 units/liter (Leo Pharmaceutical Products, Ballerup, Denmark), streptomycin, 50 μg/ml (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies Inc., Paisley, UK) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Antibodies and I-Ed chimeras were produced in Drosophilacells basically as previously described (21Wallny H.J. Sollami G. Karjalainen K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was purified from culture supernatant using affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography. Superantigen were produced inEscherichia coli and isolated from the periplasm as previously described (22Andersen P.S. Lavoie P.M. Sekaly R.P. Churchill H. Kranz D.M. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K.

Maxisorb microtiter plates (NUNC A/S Denmark) were termed surface A and treated with 50 μl of PBS containing 10 μg/ml protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) over night at +4 °C prior to use with antibodies. Plates were blocked for >1 h with PBS containing 2% BSA (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Antibodies at 10 μg/ml in PBS + 0.2% BSA were diluting against a non-TCR-binding antibody at similar concentration to keep the level of protein A binding constant and thereby secure that the dilution factor was also represented on the surface. Antibody dilutions were incubated together with immobilized protein A for >2 h after which excess antibody was removed by washing. Alternatively, surface A was prepared by coating Maxisorb plates with serial dilutions of each superantigen (SEC3) variants. To ensure uniform coating at different concentrations, SEC3 molecules were diluted into PBS containing 5 μg/ml BSA. Surface B was prepared by coating antibodies directly on the surface of nunclon microwell plates (NUNC A/S Denmark). As above, antibodies were diluting against a non-TCR-binding antibody to keep the total concentration of protein (10 μg/ml) constant. TCR binding to surfaces A and B was compared by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 3A). Antibody at 10 μg/ml was incubated with protein A-coated surface A or coated directly onto surface B. Serial dilutions of soluble TCRβ (Vβ8.2+) (23Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 1984-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) were thereafter added and left to bind for >1 h. Bound TCRβ chain was detected using a biotinylated antibody against the Cβ mixed with excess mouse serum to compete for unwanted binding to protein A. The assay was developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and the TMB-plus peroxidase substrate (Kem-En-Tech, Copenhagen, Denmark). A5 T cell hybridomas, expressing green fluorescence protein upon activation of the interkeulin-2 promoter, were stimulated for 4.0–4.5 h, and cellular activation was determined by the presence of intracellular green fluorescence protein. Fluorescent cells were detected by FACS and recorded as positive. Two-dimensional affinities are best expressed as molecules per μm 2P. S. Andersen and K. Karjalainen, unpublished results. .

The total amount of TCR was determined by a calibrated FACS analyses using phycoerythrin-conjugated 2C11 antibody and calibrated PE-conjugated beads (BD Biosciences). Receptor density was determined by dividing the average surface area with the average number of receptors per cell ([TCR]total = 9200 molecules × cell−1/360 μm2 = 25 molecules/μm2). Ligand densities were determined by radioimmunoassays, as previously reported (20Andersen P.S. Geisler C. Buus S. Mariuzza R.A. Karjalainen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33452-33457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Curves were fitted using the Sigma Plot software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Fits were done using the least-square Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. T cell stimulation experiments were fitted directly using a combined expression of Equation 6 or Equations 6 and 7, as indicated in the text. Background values from unstimulated cells were subtracted prior to the fitting analysis. As an alternative tofac, fits could also be improved by assuming the density of TCR ([TCR]total) as variable (data not shown). However, these fits were not considered further because 1) fitted values of [TCR]total were significantly larger than measured values and 2) Kstim varied between different data sets and showed a strong mathematical dependence on [TCR]total in the fitting procedure. T cells are activated when brought into contact with surfaces displaying ligands that interact with the TCR. The natural stimulus is other cells displaying antigenic pep·MHC complexes on their surface. However, purified TCR ligands coated onto surfaces composed of materials such as glass, agarose, or plastic (polystyrene) are generally found to be effective mimics of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and thus able to activate T cells. Regardless of surface, it appears reasonable to assume that laws of mass action guard initial contacts between TCR and ligand. Only few and relative specialized methods exist for measuring binding constants between molecules attached to surfaces (25Piper J.W. Swerlick R.A. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 492-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J.

J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To bypass this difficulty, we propose to use affinities, i.e.equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd), measured in solution as basis for estimates of affinities in cellular interfaces. On theoretical grounds, Bell (28Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar) suggested that the affinity in solution (Kd(3D)) and the affinity in a cellular contact area (Kd(2D)) are related by a constant (ς), which is proportional to the height of the confined region in which binding occurs.Kd(2D)=ς·Kd(3D)Equation 1 Theoretically, the confinement region height has been predicted to be in the 1- to 10-nm range (29Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors. Models for Binding, Trafficking and Signaling. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar) and, furthermore, recently demonstrated experimentally by Dustin and colleagues (24Dustin M.L. Golan D.E. Zhu D.M. Miller J.M. Meier W. Davies E.A. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30889-30898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). Having determined a relationship between the affinities measured in solution and the affinity between molecules attached to apposing surfaces, we are able to compute the density of bound receptors using the law of mass action (Equation 2) and the law of mass conservation (Equations 3 and 4),[TCR]·[L]/[TCR/L]=Kd(2D)Equation 2 [TCR]total=[TCR]+[TCR/L]Equation 3 [L]total=[L]+[TCR/L]Equation 4 where [TCR], [L], and [TCR/L] are the density of free TCR, free ligand, and bound TCRs in the contact area, respectively. The total density of TCR and ligand ([L]total and [TCR]total) can be determined experimentally independent of the biological experiments. Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 can be solved with respect to [TCR/L] and thus used to estimate the density of bound TCR in the contact zone. To translate binding events into response units, we assumed that subsequent cellular responses were directly proportional to the density of bound receptors expressed as,R=Kstim·[TCR/L]Equation 5 where R is the response level andKstim is the proportionality constant expressing the increase in stimulation per TCR·ligand complex in the initial contact area. Thus, Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 allows us to make a single equation (Equation 6), which describes the relationship between ligand density, receptor density, solution affinity, and cellular response.R=Kstim·0.5·(ETCR]total+[L]total+Kd(3D)·ς)+([TCR]total+[L]total+Kd(3D)·ς)2−4·[TCR]total·[L]totalEquation 6 Because the 2D-affinity model promises the ability to fit cellular responses directly, initial analysis could be done using existing datasets, which described activation of T cells as a function of ligand affinity and ligand density (20Andersen P.S. Geisler C. Buus S. Mariuzza R.A. Karjalainen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33452-33457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The TCR ligand was a panel of antibodies of predetermined affinity against the variable domain of the TCR β-chain, and T cell activation was determined by activation of the transcription factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (31Bot A. Bot S. Antohi S. Karjalainen K. Bona C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3436-3442PubMed Google Scholar). To become biologically active, the antibodies were immobilized on polystyrene plastic surfaces (surface A) coated with protein A. Ligand and receptor densities were determined independently of the biological assays by radioimmunoassays and FACS, respectively. Results in Fig.1A demonstrate that antibody-coated surfaces were potent activators of T cells. Response curves showed that high TCR affinity activated most cells with a gradual drop in potency as the affinity of the antibody decreased. For antibodies of highest affinity, an optimum was reached after which the response started to decline. This decline was only evident at unphysiologically high ligand densities (>200 sites/μm2), and it therefore appeared reasonable to exclude the declining phase to simplify the modeling. Response curves for the whole antibody panel were fitted globally to Equation 6 using the predetermined values forKd(3D), TCR density, and ligand densities. Plotting the fitted lines together with the experimental data points (Fig. 1B) showed that the 2D-affinity model was able to model many of the observed features of the response curves. First, it described the relative ranking in potency of the ligands of different TCR affinity. Second, it described the increase in steepness of the response curves as the affinity of the ligand increases in contrast to the flatter profile of the low affinity response curves. In addition, statistical analysis (Table II) of the fits showed that the coefficient of determination (R2) was relatively close to unity and that the probability of being wrong was low (p < 0.05), which demonstrated that fits were of good quality and that the fitted values, ς and Kstim, were statistically well defined.Table IIFitting of T cell responses by the 2D-affinity modelLigandSurfaceAverage of fitted parameters2-aEach parameter is the average of five or in the case of superantigens four independent estimates.Average statistics of fitsςKstim, stimulus × [TCR/L]−1facR2p2-bp values indicate the upper limit for the total parameter set.

Open table in a new tab On closer examination, the residuals (i.e. the difference between the theoretical and measured values; see bottom of Fig. 1B) showed that the 2D-affinity model was less capable of fitting the potency of high affinity antibodies, notably at low ligand density. One possible complication was that ligand density on the plastic surfaces was measured using soluble TCR molecules. Roughness of the plastic surface could exclude potential binding sites from T cell contact and thereby lower the density of biologically active ligand. Thus, we included an additional variable,fac, that described the fraction of active ligand on the plastic surface,[L]ac=[L]total·facEquation 7 Substituting the total ligand density, [L]total, with the density of active ligand, [L]ac, results in a new version of Equation 6 that was able to compensate for functional variability of immobilized ligands. Fitting of cellular responses revealed a significant improvement in the fits in the high affinity range (Fig. 1C), and ∼57% of the plastic bound antibodies were estimated to be biological active (Table II). Residual plots showed that antibodies of high affinity were now fitted with equal quality as those of low affinity. The increase in fitting quality was also evident by statistical analysis where theR2 became closer to one while Pvalues were still significantly small (Table II). Inclusion offac had no effect onKstim and caused a marginal 2-fold decrease of ς to 1.4 μm. A ς value of 1.4 μm suggests that binding is confined to a relative large volume, several times the height of an antibody or a TCR. This contrasts theoretical predictions and the few experimental estimates of ς that were in the 1- to 10-nm range (discussed above). Regardless, the antibody-coated plastic surfaces were able to stimulate T cells with only a few ligands per μm2 demonstrating the high sensitivity of the experimental approach. To address the role of ligand topology and to test the generality of the 2D-affinity model we tested the fitting procedures on T cells stimulated by bacterial superantigens. The superantigens were variants of Staphylococcus enterotoxin C3 (SEC3), which had been selected for enhanced binding to TCR (20Andersen P.S. Geisler C. Buus S. Mariuzza R.A. Karjalainen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33452-33457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cellular assays were the same as that used with the antibodies: T cells were stimulated by serial dilutions of superantigens coated onto surface A, and cellular activation was determined by NFAT activity (Fig.2A). The completeness of the data set was not sufficient to allow estimates offac (data not shown). However, fitting of response curves using Equation 6 gave nice fits as judged by graphical (Fig. 2B) and statistical (Table II) analyses. As for the antibodies, ς was determined to be relative large, andKstim was almost identical for the two sets of ligands (Table II). It therefore appeared that immobilized anti-TCR antibodies and superantigens were equal in their ability to activate T cells. The 10-fold higher ς values of the SEC3 variants relative to the antibodies could be explained by the inability of the relative hydrophobic surface A to co-align with the negatively charged cell surface. Precise membrane alignment has previously been suggested to be an important factor in enhancing the affinity between membrane proteins (24Dustin M.L. Golan D.E. Zhu D.M. Miller J.M. Meier W. Davies E.A. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30889-30898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The smaller size of SEC3 relative to the antibody would therefore make the interaction more sensitive to poor alignment of the apposing surfaces and hence increase the ς level. In their attempt to develop theoretical models for cellular adhesion, Bell and colleagues (32Bell G.I. Dembo M. Bongrand P. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 1051-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) predicted that the two-dimensional affinity of surface-bound proteins could be affected by electrostatic forces acting on the apposing surfaces. Also, a recent study has demonstrated that membrane roughness can modulate the effective affinity of membrane proteins (33Williams T.E. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13283-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together with the unexpectedly high ς values for antibodies and SEC3 variants on surface A, it appeared possible that chemical changes of the ligand-presenting surface could enhance the 2D-affinity of immobilized ligands. Accordingly, another plastic surface (surface B) was tested for its ability to present ligands to T cells. Surface B was chemically equivalent to the surface A but subjected to stronger irradiation (i.e. stronger oxidation) in the manufacturing process and therefore less hydrophobic and more electronegative. To exclude that surface charge had any direct effect on antibody affinity, the two surfaces were compared by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay approach. Antibody variants of medium affinity were immobilized on the two plastic surfaces and assayed for binding to soluble TCRβ chain (Fig. 3A). TCR binding of the two surfaces were similar and fitted well to equations for one-to-one interactions demonstrating the intactness of the binding sites. To address the functional affinity, serial dilutions of each antibody were coated directly on surface B and used to stimulate T cells (Fig. 3B). The most prominent difference to the previous results was the relative small difference in potency among the high affinity antibodies indicating that ligand binding was approaching a plateau. Thus, making the ligand-presenting surface more electronegative clearly affected the functional affinity of the antibodies, and the appearance of a potency limit at lower affinity indicated an overall increase in 2D-affinity of the antibodies attached to surface B (see Fig. 5). To test if the 2D-affinity model could simulate this phenomenon, response curves were fitted globally to Equations 6 and 7 using predetermined values for Kd(3D), [TCR]total, and [L]total (Fig.3C). Fits were similar in quality to those obtained by the SEC3 variants as judged by the residuals (Fig. 3C) and the statistical analysis (Table II). The value of ς was estimated to be 98 nm, which corresponds to a 15-fold increase in 2D-affinity relative to surface A, and the theoretical curves showed signs of approaching an affinity limit. Kstim matched the previous results indicating that the biological activity of each receptor·ligand complex was the same on the two surfaces. The active fraction of antibodies dropped to ∼20%, which was 3-fold lover than on surface A. Excluding protein A by attaching the antibodies directly to surface B would lead to a more random orientation of antibodies thus explaining the drop in activity. Nevertheless, the results showed that the 2D-affinity was dependent on the chemical composition of the presenting surface. To further test the generality of the 2D-model, T cells were stimulated with purified pep·MHC. I-Ed was expressed as bivalent molecules fused to human Fcγ1 domains and subsequently loaded with HA peptide. The Fc domains made it possible to repeat the comparison of surface A and B using pep·MHC as immobilized ligand (Fig. 4A). As with the antibodies, I-Ed·HA complexes were more potent on surface B relative to surface A. Fitting of the 2D-affinity model to the cellular responses gave estimates of the confinement region heights of 1.5 μm and 46 nm, which matched the estimates for the antibodies. Thus, the"
https://openalex.org/W2319549623,"The erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is frequently implicated in neoplasia. Amplification and overexpression of erbB2/neu has been found in 20 to 40% of human breast cancers. Previous studies using MMTV/c-neu transgenic mice have linked rat neu overexpression to mammary tumor development. In this study, we provide evidence that rat neu overexpression in mammary tumors of MMTV/c-neu transgenic mice is always associated with demethylation of the MMTV promoter, whereas the normal mammary glands of these transgenic mice always contain specific methylated regions of the MMTV promoter. In addition, after exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), the latency of mammary tumor development is significantly reduced and again is also associated with MMTV promoter demethylation. Thus, the transition from methylation to hypomethylation of the MMTV promoter induces high-level expression of c-neu and appears to be a prerequisite for transformation from normal to malignant mammary epithelium, either spontaneously or after carcinogen exposure. Expression of transgenic c-neu from the demethylated MMTV promoter appears to be an early event that allows outgrowth of mammary epithelium predisposed to malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2065705216,"In addition to c-myc rearrangement, over 50% of Burkitt's lymphoma cases present clustered mutations in exon 2, where many of the functional activities of c-Myc protein are based. This report describes the functional consequences induced by tumour-derived c-myc mutations located in c-myc box II. Two mutated alleles were studied, focusing on the P138C mutation, and compared to wild-type c-myc. The c-Myc transformation, transactivation and apoptosis activities were explored based on cells over-expressing c-Myc. While the transcriptional activation activity was not affected, our experiments exploring the anchorage-independent growth capacity of c-Myc-transfected Rat1a cells showed that c-Myc box II mutants were less potent than wild-type c-Myc in promoting cell transformation. Considering the possibility that these mutations could be interfering with the ability of c-Myc to promote apoptosis, we tested c-Myc-transfected Rat1a fibroblasts under several conditions: serum deprivation-, staurosporine- and TNFalpha-induced cell death. Interestingly, the mutated alleles were characterized by an overall decrease in ability to mediate apoptosis. Our study indicates that point mutations located in c-Myc box II can decrease the ability of the protein to promote both transformation and apoptosis without modifying its transactivating activity."

https://openalex.org/W2323063338,"DNA multiploidy may involve specific DNA ploidy states with respect to genetic alterations such as oncogenes, tumor suppressor gene mutation and microsatellite instability. To clarify the role of DNA multiploidy in colorectal cancer, we analysed allelic imbalance involving the ATM gene, localized to chromosome 11q22-23 and thought to be involved in genetic stability, in a series of multiploid colorectal carcinomas. In addition, p53 gene mutation (exons 5-8) and allelic imbalance at 11q24 loci distal to the ATM locus were also examined. The crypt isolation technique coupled with DNA cytometric sorting and polymerase chain reaction assay using 10 microsatellite markers tightly linked to the ATM gene were used to study ATM allelic imbalance in 55 colorectal carcinomas (15 diploid, 13 aneuploid, 27 multiploid). While allelic imbalance at the ATM locus was rarely observed in diploid and aneuploid carcinomas, multiploid carcinomas exhibited a high frequency of ATM allelic imbalance. In multiploid carcinoma samples, diploid subpopulations showed a smaller range of allelic imbalance at the loci tested compared to aneuploid subpopulations that demonstrated allelic imbalance over a relatively large region. Also, the frequency of AI at 11q24 showed a similar tendency to that at the ATM locus for each DNA ploidy state. An association between p53 gene mutation and ATM allelic imbalance in multiploid carcinoma was also observed. Our results suggest that ATM allelic imbalance and p53 gene mutations occur during the progression from diploid to aneuploid cell populations in multiploid colorectal carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2313723815,"Msh2 deficiency and food-borne carcinogen PhIP have been implicated as genetic and environmental factors, respectively, in human colon carcinogenesis. It is not clear whether loss of one or both alleles of Msh2 gene increases the mutational sensitivity in colon when exposed to environmental carcinogens. In the current study, Msh2(+/-)/lacI and Msh2(-/-)/lacI double transgenic mice were treated with PhIP and mutations in the lacI gene were studied in the colon. The spontaneous mutation frequency (MF) is approximately eightfold higher in Msh2(-/-) mice than in Msh2(+/+) mice, while Msh2(+/-) mice display similar levels of spontaneous mutation as the Msh2 wild type mice. PhIP induced a significant increase in MF in all genotypes of mice. However, induced MF is much higher in Msh2(-/-) mice compared to Msh2(+/+) and Msh2(+/-) mice. Msh2(+/-) mice displayed an increased level of G:C>T:A transversions and -1 frameshifts upon PhIP treatment. In contrast, loss of both Msh2 alleles mainly results in increased frequency of G:C>A:T transitions when exposed to PhIP. These results suggest that a defect in mismatch repair may result in an enhanced sensitivity from exposure to a dietary carcinogen. It also provides insight into interaction between genetic and environmental factors in human carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2316148317,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) induced growth arrest of cells involves regulation of the activities of both D- and E-type cyclin kinase complexes thought to be mediated primarily by the regulation of p15(Ink4b) and p27(Kip1) cyclin kinase inhibitors. We show here that TGF-beta downregulates Cdk6 and that transient and stable expression of Cdk6 in Mv1Lu mink epithelial cells overrides TGF-beta mediated arrest. The main effect of the ectopic Cdk6 expression was to sequester TGF-beta induced p15(Ink4b) and to maintain more p27(Kip1) in cyclin D-complexes preventing the complete shift of p27(Kip1) to Cdk2 invoked by TGF-beta. This led to the presence of an active cyclinD-Cdk6-p27(Kip1) complex and partially active cyclin E-Cdk2 complex and resulted in the failure of TGF-beta to fully arrest Mv1Lu cell growth. Though dominant negative Cdk6, expressed similarly in the cells, sequestered both p15(Ink4b) and p27(Kip1), it lacks kinase activity and was unable to override the TGF-beta arrest. The results demonstrate that downregulation of Cdk6 kinase is required for the enforcement of the G(1)-phase arrest by TGF-beta and results in changes in association of the p15(Ink4b) and p27(Kip1) inhibitors with D- and E-type cyclin kinase complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2329143335,"Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation transiently stabilizes p53 through a mechanism that may require a decrease in the activity of the ubiquitin ligase, p90(MDM2). Conversely, the recovery of low levels of p53 following UV exposure may depend on an increase in p90(MDM2). The level of p90(MDM2) is increased by UV light following the p53-dependent induction of an internal mdm2 promoter, P2. If this induction of mdm2 were critical for the recovery of low levels of p53 following UV exposure, defects in mdm2's transcription would result in a prolonged increase in p53. Cells defective in transcription coupled repair (TCR) maintain high levels of p53 for a prolonged period following UV exposure. Such cells also have defects in general transcription after UV irradiation. We investigated whether TCR-deficient cells express diminished levels of mdm2 mRNA and p90(MDM2) following UV exposure. We found that transcription of mdm2 was reduced in TCR-deficient cells. The uninducible mdm2 promoter, P1, was more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of UV irradiation than the P2 promoter. The decrease in transcription from the P1 promoter was sufficient to reduce the level of p90(MDM2) and correlated with a prolonged increase in p53. Thus, p53-independent transcription of mdm2 appears critical to p53's regulation."
https://openalex.org/W203884732,"We investigated the attachment and spreading of v-Crk-transformed cells, v-Crk3Y1, on fibronectin. Transformation by v-Crk virtually suppressed the spreading, but not the attachment, of cells on fibronectin. This suppression of cell spreading was not correlated with the suppression of integrin alpha5 and beta1 expression. However, the spreading of v-Crk3Y1 on fibronectin was dramatically restored by either expression of dominant-negative Ras or treatment with manumycin A, a Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Moreover, both expression of dominant-negative MEK1 and treatment of cells with U0126, a MEK1 inhibitor, restored the cell spreading of v-Crk3Y1. In contrast, neither treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, nor expression of dominant-negative C3G showed no effect on cell spreading on fibronectin. Taken together, our results suggest that, among multiple signaling pathways activated by v-Crk, the Ras-MEK1-MAP kinase cascade plays a pivotal role in the suppression of cell spreading on fibronectin, but C3G and the PI3 kinase do not."
