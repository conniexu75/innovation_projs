https://openalex.org/W2013172220,"Spin-orbit (SO) coupling -- the interaction between a quantum particle's spin and its momentum -- is ubiquitous in nature, from atoms to solids. In condensed matter systems, SO coupling is crucial for the spin-Hall effect and topological insulators, which are of extensive interest; it contributes to the electronic properties of materials such as GaAs, and is important for spintronic devices. Ultracold atoms, quantum many-body systems under precise experimental control, would seem to be an ideal platform to study these fascinating SO coupled systems. While an atom's intrinsic SO coupling affects its electronic structure, it does not lead to coupling between the spin and the center-of-mass motion of the atom. Here, we engineer SO coupling (with equal Rashba and Dresselhaus strengths) in a neutral atomic Bose-Einstein condensate by dressing two atomic spin states with a pair of lasers. Not only is this the first SO coupling realized in ultracold atomic gases, it is also the first ever for bosons. Furthermore, in the presence of the laser coupling, the interactions between the two dressed atomic spin states are modified, driving a quantum phase transition from a spatially spin-mixed state (lasers off) to a phase separated state (above a critical laser intensity). The location of this transition is in quantitative agreement with our theory. This SO coupling -- equally applicable for bosons and fermions -- sets the stage to realize topological insulators in fermionic neutral atom systems."
https://openalex.org/W2059378220,"Defined transcription factors can induce epigenetic reprogramming of adult mammalian cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Although DNA factors are integrated during some reprogramming methods, it is unknown whether the genome remains unchanged at the single nucleotide level. Here we show that 22 human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell lines reprogrammed using five different methods each contained an average of five protein-coding point mutations in the regions sampled (an estimated six protein-coding point mutations per exome). The majority of these mutations were non-synonymous, nonsense or splice variants, and were enriched in genes mutated or having causative effects in cancers. At least half of these reprogramming-associated mutations pre-existed in fibroblast progenitors at low frequencies, whereas the rest occurred during or after reprogramming. Thus, hiPS cells acquire genetic modifications in addition to epigenetic modifications. Extensive genetic screening should become a standard procedure to ensure hiPS cell safety before clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W1975593978,"Caspase-8 has two opposing biological functions--it promotes cell death by triggering the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, but also has a survival activity, as it is required for embryonic development, T-lymphocyte activation, and resistance to necrosis induced by tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and related family ligands. Here we show that development of caspase-8-deficient mice is completely rescued by ablation of receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3). Adult animals lacking both caspase-8 and RIPK3 display a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling that seen with defects in CD95 or CD95-ligand (also known as FAS and FASLG, respectively), and resist the lethal effects of CD95 ligation in vivo. We have found that caspase-8 prevents RIPK3-dependent necrosis without inducing apoptosis by functioning in a proteolytically active complex with FLICE-like inhibitory protein long (FLIP(L), also known as CFLAR), and this complex is required for the protective function."
https://openalex.org/W2042577315,"Caspase-8 mediates apoptosis induced by 'death receptors' on the cell's surface. At the same time, it is able to prevent receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-dependent necrosis. Without caspase-8, mice die during embryonic development, but why this happens is not clear. Two groups show that this lethality is not caused by the absence of apoptosis, but by the RIPK3-dependent necrosis that is unleashed without caspase-8. Mice lacking both caspase-8 and RIP3 develop into viable, immunocompetent adults, but have a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease similar to that in mice that lack the CD95 death receptor. Oberst et al. also show that caspase-8 forms a proteolytically active complex with FLICE-like inhibitory protein long (FLIPL), and that this complex is required for protection against RIP3-dependent necrosis. Caspase-8 mediates apoptosis induced by death receptors. At the same time, this protease is able to prevent RIP-dependent necrosis. Without caspase-8 mice die during their embryonic development. Two papers now show that lethality is not caused by the absence of apoptosis, but by RIP3-dependent necrosis that is unleashed without caspase-8. Mice that lack both caspase-8 and RIP3 develop into viable, immunocompetent, fertile adult mice, but suffer from a progressive lymphoaccumulative disease similar to mice that lack the death receptor CD95. Apoptosis and necroptosis are complementary pathways controlled by common signalling adaptors, kinases and proteases; among these, caspase-8 (Casp8) is critical for death receptor-induced apoptosis. This caspase has also been implicated in non-apoptotic pathways that regulate Fas-associated via death domain (FADD)-dependent signalling and other less defined biological processes as diverse as innate immune signalling and myeloid or lymphoid differentiation patterns1. Casp8 suppresses RIP3–RIP1 (also known as RIPK3–RIPK1) kinase complex-dependent2,3,4 necroptosis5 that follows death receptor activation as well as a RIP3-dependent, RIP1-independent necrotic pathway that has emerged as a host defence mechanism against murine cytomegalovirus6. Disruption of Casp8 expression leads to embryonic lethality in mice between embryonic days 10.5 and 11.5 (ref. 7). Thus, Casp8 may naturally hold alternative RIP3-dependent death pathways in check in addition to promoting apoptosis. We find that RIP3 is responsible for the mid-gestational death of Casp8-deficient embryos. Remarkably, Casp8−/−Rip3−/− double mutant mice are viable and mature into fertile adults with a full immune complement of myeloid and lymphoid cell types. These mice seem immunocompetent but develop lymphadenopathy by four months of age marked by accumulation of abnormal T cells in the periphery, a phenotype reminiscent of mice with Fas-deficiency (lpr/lpr; also known as Fas). Thus, Casp8 contributes to homeostatic control in the adult immune system; however, RIP3 and Casp8 are together completely dispensable for mammalian development."

https://openalex.org/W1987821813,"Loss of the tumour suppressor FBW7 is frequently observed in various types of human cancers, but its mechanism of action as a tumour suppressor remains unclear. Two groups demonstrate that in several cancer types, including ovarian cancer and T-cell leukaemias, the apoptosis regulator MCL1 is targeted for degradation by FBW7. Inuzuka et al. find that this mechanism can determine the response to drugs targeting BCL2 family apoptosis factors, and Wertz et al. show that it is activated during mitotic arrest and determines the response to anti-tubulin chemotherapeutics. Deletion or mutation of FBW7 in patients with cancer can therefore render tumours resistant to these therapies. This is one of two papers demonstrating that in several cancer types including ovarian cancer and T-cell leukaemias, the apoptosis regulator MCL1 is targeted for degradation by the FBW7 tumour suppressor. This study finds that this mechanism can determine the response to drugs targeting BCL2 family apoptosis factors. Deletion or mutation of FBW7 found in cancer patients therefore can render tumours resistant to these therapies. The effective use of targeted therapy is highly dependent on the identification of responder patient populations. Loss of FBW7, which encodes a tumour-suppressor protein, is frequently found in various types of human cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer1 and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL)2. In line with these genomic data, engineered deletion of Fbw7 in mouse T cells results in T-ALL3,4,5, validating FBW7 as a T-ALL tumour suppressor. Determining the precise molecular mechanisms by which FBW7 exerts antitumour activity is an area of intensive investigation. These mechanisms are thought to relate in part to FBW7-mediated destruction of key proteins relevant to cancer, including Jun6, Myc7, cyclin E8 and notch 1 (ref. 9), all of which have oncoprotein activity and are overexpressed in various human cancers, including leukaemia. In addition to accelerating cell growth10, overexpression of Jun, Myc or notch 1 can also induce programmed cell death11. Thus, considerable uncertainty surrounds how FBW7-deficient cells evade cell death in the setting of upregulated Jun, Myc and/or notch 1. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFFBW7 (a SKP1–cullin-1–F-box complex that contains FBW7 as the F-box protein) governs cellular apoptosis by targeting MCL1, a pro-survival BCL2 family member, for ubiquitylation and destruction in a manner that depends on phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3. Human T-ALL cell lines showed a close relationship between FBW7 loss and MCL1 overexpression. Correspondingly, T-ALL cell lines with defective FBW7 are particularly sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib but resistant to the BCL2 antagonist ABT-737. On the genetic level, FBW7 reconstitution or MCL1 depletion restores sensitivity to ABT-737, establishing MCL1 as a therapeutically relevant bypass survival mechanism that enables FBW7-deficient cells to evade apoptosis. Therefore, our work provides insight into the molecular mechanism of direct tumour suppression by FBW7 and has implications for the targeted treatment of patients with FBW7-deficient T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2163401417,"Chromosomal translocations are critically involved in the molecular pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas, and highly recurrent and specific rearrangements have defined distinct molecular subtypes linked to unique clinicopathological features. In contrast, several well-characterized lymphoma entities still lack disease-defining translocation events. To identify novel fusion transcripts resulting from translocations, we investigated two Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines by whole-transcriptome paired-end sequencing (RNA-seq). Here we show a highly expressed gene fusion involving the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator CIITA (MHC2TA) in KM-H2 cells. In a subsequent evaluation of 263 B-cell lymphomas, we also demonstrate that genomic CIITA breaks are highly recurrent in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (38%) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) (15%). Furthermore, we find that CIITA is a promiscuous partner of various in-frame gene fusions, and we report that CIITA gene alterations impact survival in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). As functional consequences of CIITA gene fusions, we identify downregulation of surface HLA class II expression and overexpression of ligands of the receptor molecule programmed cell death 1 (CD274/PDL1 and CD273/PDL2). These receptor-ligand interactions have been shown to impact anti-tumour immune responses in several cancers, whereas decreased MHC class II expression has been linked to reduced tumour cell immunogenicity. Thus, our findings suggest that recurrent rearrangements of CIITA may represent a novel genetic mechanism underlying tumour-microenvironment interactions across a spectrum of lymphoid cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2025367550,"Regulation of cell death is vital for embryonic development and homeostasis in somatic cells, and the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) is a critical signalling adaptor for extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In a study of potential interactions between FADD and receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIP1/RIPK1), double deficiency of FADD and RIPK1 is shown to rescue the defects in embryonic development and lymphocyte proliferation seen in mice with single gene deficiencies. This suggests that FADD (presumably in conjunction with caspase-8 and c-FLIP) keeps necrosis in check by causing cleavage of RIPK1. Double deficiency of FADD and RIPK1 is shown to rescue the defects in mouse embryonic development and lymphocyte proliferation that are characteristic for mice with single gene deficiencies. This work suggests that the activity of FADD (presumably in conjunction with caspase-8 and c-FLIP) is to keep necrosis in check by causing the cleavage of RIPK1. FADD is a common adaptor shared by several death receptors for signalling apoptosis through recruitment and activation of caspase 8 (refs 1–3). Death receptors are essential for immune homeostasis, but dispensable during embryogenesis. Surprisingly, Fadd−/− mice die in utero4,5 and conditional deletion of FADD leads to impaired lymphocyte proliferation6,7. How FADD regulates embryogenesis and lymphocyte responses has been a long-standing enigma. FADD could directly bind to RIP1 (also known as RIPK1), a serine/threonine kinase that mediates both necrosis and NF-κB activation. Here we show that Fadd−/− embryos contain raised levels of RIP1 and exhibit massive necrosis. To investigate a potential in vivo functional interaction between RIP1 and FADD, null alleles of RIP1 were crossed into Fadd−/− mice. Notably, RIP1 deficiency allowed normal embryogenesis of Fadd−/− mice. Conversely, the developmental defect of Rip1−/− lymphocytes was partially corrected by FADD deletion. Furthermore, RIP1 deficiency fully restored normal proliferation in Fadd−/− T cells but not in Fadd−/− B cells. Fadd−/−Rip1−/− double-knockout T cells are resistant to death induced by Fas or TNF-α and show reduced NF-κB activity. Therefore, our data demonstrate an unexpected cell-type-specific interplay between FADD and RIP1, which is critical for the regulation of apoptosis and necrosis during embryogenesis and lymphocyte function."
https://openalex.org/W2093048712,"Protein acetylation is mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), which influence chromatin dynamics, protein turnover and the DNA damage response. ATM and ATR mediate DNA damage checkpoints by sensing double-strand breaks and single-strand-DNA-RFA nucleofilaments, respectively. However, it is unclear how acetylation modulates the DNA damage response. Here we show that HDAC inhibition/ablation specifically counteracts yeast Mec1 (orthologue of human ATR) activation, double-strand-break processing and single-strand-DNA-RFA nucleofilament formation. Moreover, the recombination protein Sae2 (human CtIP) is acetylated and degraded after HDAC inhibition. Two HDACs, Hda1 and Rpd3, and one HAT, Gcn5, have key roles in these processes. We also find that HDAC inhibition triggers Sae2 degradation by promoting autophagy that affects the DNA damage sensitivity of hda1 and rpd3 mutants. Rapamycin, which stimulates autophagy by inhibiting Tor, also causes Sae2 degradation. We propose that Rpd3, Hda1 and Gcn5 control chromosome stability by coordinating the ATR checkpoint and double-strand-break processing with autophagy."

https://openalex.org/W2046861581,"The development and function of many organs depend not only on biochemical signals, but also on the ability of cells and tissues to respond biochemically to mechanical forces — mechanotransduction. Here, Michel Labouesse and colleagues describe a mechanotransduction pathway that links the body wall with the epidermis in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. The pathway involves the p21-activated kinase PAK-1, an adaptor GIT-1 and its partner PIX-1. Tension exerted by muscles or external pressure keeps GIT-1 on station at hemidesmosomes — the small rivet-like bodies that attach epidermal cells to the underlying musculature — and stimulates PAK-1 through PIX-1 and Rac GTPase. The C. elegans hemidesmosome is therefore more than a passive attachment structure — it is a sensor that responds to tension by triggering signalling processes. This study describes a mechanotransduction pathway that links the body wall with the epidermis in Caenorhabditis elegans. The pathway involves the p21 activated kinase PAK 1, an adaptor GIT 1 and its partner PIX 1. Tension exerted by muscles or external pressure keeps GIT 1 on station at hemidesmosomes — the small rivet like bodies that attach epidermal cells to the underlying musculature — and stimulates PAK 1 through PIX 1 and Rac GTPase. The C. elegans hemidesmosome is more than a passive attachment structure, therefore, but a sensor that responds to tension by triggering signalling processes. Mechanotransduction refers to the transformation of physical forces into chemical signals. It generally involves stretch-sensitive channels or conformational change of cytoskeleton-associated proteins1. Mechanotransduction is crucial for the physiology of several organs and for cell migration2,3. The extent to which mechanical inputs contribute to development, and how they do this, remains poorly defined. Here we show that a mechanotransduction pathway operates between the body-wall muscles of Caenorhabditis elegans and the epidermis. This pathway involves, in addition to a Rac GTPase, three signalling proteins found at the hemidesmosome: p21-activated kinase (PAK-1), the adaptor GIT-1 and its partner PIX-1. The phosphorylation of intermediate filaments is one output of this pathway. Tension exerted by adjacent muscles or externally exerted mechanical pressure maintains GIT-1 at hemidesmosomes and stimulates PAK-1 activity through PIX-1 and Rac. This pathway promotes the maturation of a hemidesmosome into a junction that can resist mechanical stress and contributes to coordinating the morphogenesis of epidermal and muscle tissues. Our findings suggest that the C. elegans hemidesmosome is not only an attachment structure, but also a mechanosensor that responds to tension by triggering signalling processes. We suggest that similar pathways could promote epithelial morphogenesis or wound healing in other organisms in which epithelial cells adhere to tension-generating contractile cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966877548,"The largest products of magmatic activity on Earth, the great bodies of granite and their corresponding large eruptions, have a dual nature: homogeneity at the large scale and spatial and temporal heterogeneity at the small scale. This duality calls for a mechanism that selectively removes the large-scale heterogeneities associated with the incremental assembly of these magmatic systems and yet occurs rapidly despite crystal-rich, viscous conditions seemingly resistant to mixing. Here we show that a simple dynamic template can unify a wide range of apparently contradictory observations from both large plutonic bodies and volcanic systems by a mechanism of rapid remobilization (unzipping) of highly viscous crystal-rich mushes. We demonstrate that this remobilization can lead to rapid overturn and produce the observed juxtaposition of magmatic materials with very disparate ages and complex chemical zoning. What distinguishes our model is the recognition that the process has two stages. Initially, a stiff mushy magma is reheated from below, producing a reduction in crystallinity that leads to the growth of a subjacent buoyant mobile layer. When the thickening mobile layer becomes sufficiently buoyant, it penetrates the overlying viscous mushy magma. This second stage rapidly exports homogenized material from the lower mobile layer to the top of the system, and leads to partial overturn within the viscous mush itself as an additional mechanism of mixing. Model outputs illustrate that unzipping can rapidly produce large amounts of mobile magma available for eruption. The agreement between calculated and observed unzipping rates for historical eruptions at Pinatubo and at Montserrat demonstrates the general applicability of the model. This mechanism furthers our understanding of both the formation of periodically homogenized plutons (crust building) and of ignimbrites by large eruptions."
https://openalex.org/W2107621349,"The hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are the aggregates of amyloid-β (Αβ) peptide and tau protein. Autophagy is one major cellular pathway leading to the removal of aggregated proteins. We examined the possibility of inducing autophagy to reduce Aβ peptide and the amyloid precursor protein (APP)-derived fragment APP-CTF levels in cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. We found that induction of autophagy either by small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMER)28, a small-molecule enhancer of autophagy, or following starvation greatly decreased the levels of Aβ peptide (apparent EC(50) of ∼10 μM) and APP-CTF (apparent EC(50) of ∼20 μM) in a γ-secretase-independent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy led to a significant accumulation of Aβ peptide and APP-CTF and diminished the effect of SMER28. Three essential components of the autophagic pathway, autophagy-related protein (Atg)5, Beclin1, and Ulk1, were shown to be involved in the degradation of Aβ and APP-CTF, and Atg5 was necessary for the effect of SMER28. In addition, the autophagic marker light chain 3-II cocompartmentalized with APP-CTF. These results support the involvement of autophagy in the clearance of Aβ and APP-CTF. We therefore propose that small molecule enhancers of autophagy, such as SMER28, may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other proteinopathies."

Their quantum version of the Metropolis algorithm could find widespread application in many-body quantum physics, such as computing the binding energies of complex molecules or determining hadron masses in gauge theories. Simulations of interacting particles in classical systems generally involve the Metropolis algorithm. A quantum version of this approach has been hindered by the lack of a means to simulate the equilibrium and static properties of quantum systems. This study overcomes this problem. Its quantum version of the Metropolis algorithm could find widespread application in many body quantum physics, such as computing the binding energies of complex molecules or determining hadron masses in gauge theories. The original motivation to build a quantum computer came from Feynman1, who imagined a machine capable of simulating generic quantum mechanical systems—a task that is believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a machine could have far-reaching applications in the simulation of many-body quantum physics in condensed-matter, chemical and high-energy systems. Part of Feynman’s challenge was met by Lloyd2, who showed how to approximately decompose the time evolution operator of interacting quantum particles into a short sequence of elementary gates, suitable for operation on a quantum computer. However, this left open the problem of how to simulate the equilibrium and static properties of quantum systems. This requires the preparation of ground and Gibbs states on a quantum computer. For classical systems, this problem is solved by the ubiquitous Metropolis algorithm3, a method that has basically acquired a monopoly on the simulation of interacting particles. Here we demonstrate how to implement a quantum version of the Metropolis algorithm. This algorithm permits sampling directly from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, and thus evades the sign problem present in classical simulations. A small-scale implementation of this algorithm should be achievable with today’s technology."
https://openalex.org/W2110638928,"The evolution of sex chromosomes has resulted in numerous species in which females inherit two X chromosomes but males have a single X, thus requiring dosage compensation. MSL (Male-specific lethal) complex increases transcription on the single X chromosome of Drosophila males to equalize expression of X-linked genes between the sexes. The biochemical mechanisms used for dosage compensation must function over a wide dynamic range of transcription levels and differential expression patterns. It has been proposed that the MSL complex regulates transcriptional elongation to control dosage compensation, a model subsequently supported by mapping of the MSL complex and MSL-dependent histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation to the bodies of X-linked genes in males, with a bias towards 3' ends. However, experimental analysis of MSL function at the mechanistic level has been challenging owing to the small magnitude of the chromosome-wide effect and the lack of an in vitro system for biochemical analysis. Here we use global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) to examine the specific effect of the MSL complex on RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) on a genome-wide level. Results indicate that the MSL complex enhances transcription by facilitating the progression of RNAP II across the bodies of active X-linked genes. Improving transcriptional output downstream of typical gene-specific controls may explain how dosage compensation can be imposed on the diverse set of genes along an entire chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2115612732,"The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that remodeling of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in protecting human muscle against injury. Biopsies were obtained from medial gastrocnemius muscles after a single bout of electrical stimulation (B) or a repeated bout (RB) 30 d later, or 30 d after a single stimulation bout (RBc). A muscle biopsy was collected from the control leg for comparison with the stimulated leg. Satellite cell content, tenascin C, and muscle regeneration were assessed by immunohistochemistry; real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of collagens, laminins, heat-shock proteins (HSPs), inflammation, and related growth factors. The large responses of HSPs, CCL2, and tenascin C detected 48 h after a single bout were attenuated in the RB trial, indicative of protection against injury. Satellite cell content and 12 target genes, including IGF-1, were elevated 30 d after a single bout. Among those displaying the greatest difference vs. control muscle, ECM laminin-β1 and collagen types I and III were elevated ∼6- to 9-fold (P<0.001). The findings indicate that the sequenced events of load-induced early deadhesion and later strengthening of skeletal muscle ECM play a role in protecting human muscle against future injury."
https://openalex.org/W2000801609,"Direct observations over the past four centuries show that the number of sunspots observed on the Sun's surface vary periodically, going through successive maxima and minima. Following sunspot cycle 23, the Sun went into a prolonged minimum characterized by a very weak polar magnetic field and an unusually large number of days without sunspots. Sunspots are strongly magnetized regions and are generated by a dynamo mechanism which recreates the solar polar field mediated via plasma flows. Here we report results from kinematic dynamo simulations which demonstrate that a fast meridional flow in the early half of a cycle, followed by a slower flow in the latter half, reproduces both the characteristics of the minimum of sunspot cycle 23 - a large number of spotless days and a relatively weak polar field. Our model predicts that, in general, very deep minima are associated with weak polar fields. Sunspots govern the solar radiative energy and radio flux, and in conjunction with the polar field, modulate the solar wind, heliospheric open flux and consequently cosmic ray flux at Earth; our results therefore provide a causal link between solar internal dynamics and the atypical values of these heliospheric forcing parameters during the recently concluded solar minimum."

The goal of our study was to determine the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in PAVSM cell proliferation, a major pathological manifestation of vascular remodeling in PAH. Our data demonstrate that chronic hypoxia promoted mTOR(Ser-2481) phosphorylation, an indicator of mTOR intrinsic catalytic activity, mTORC1-specific S6 and mTORC2-specific Akt (Ser-473) phosphorylation, and proliferation of human and rat PAVSM cells that was inhibited by siRNA mTOR. PAVSM cells derived from rats exposed to chronic hypoxia (VSM-H cells) retained increased mTOR(Ser-2481), S6, Akt (Ser-473) phosphorylation, and DNA synthesis compared to cells from normoxia-exposed rats. Suppression of mTORC2 signaling with siRNA rictor, or inhibition of mTORC1 signaling with rapamycin and metformin, while having little effect on other complex activities, inhibited VSM-H and chronic hypoxia-induced human and rat PAVSM cell proliferation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that up-regulation of mTOR activity and activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are required for PAVSM cell proliferation induced by in vitro and in vivo chronic hypoxia and suggest that mTOR may serve as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit vascular remodeling in PAH."

Although we showed previously that RAG1/RAG2 shepherd the broken DNA ends to classical non-homologous end joining for proper repair12,13, roles for the RAG proteins in preserving genomic stability remain poorly defined. Here we show that the RAG2 carboxy (C) terminus, although dispensable for recombination14,15, is critical for maintaining genomic stability. Thymocytes from ‘core’ Rag2 homozygotes (Rag2c/c mice) show dramatic disruption of Tcrα/δ locus integrity. Furthermore, all Rag2c/c p53−/− mice, unlike Rag1c/c p53−/− and p53−/− animals, rapidly develop thymic lymphomas bearing complex chromosomal translocations, amplifications and deletions involving the Tcrα/δ and Igh loci. We also find these features in lymphomas from Atm−/− mice. We show that, like ATM-deficiency3, core RAG2 severely destabilizes the RAG post-cleavage complex.

Both the cells deficient in p63 gene expression by RNA interference and cells that overexpressed the N-terminally truncated p63 isoform α (ΔNp63α), a dominant-negative variant of TAp63α, by gene transfection, survived TLR3 activation. Taken together, TAp63α is a crucial regulator downstream of TLR3 to induce cell death via death receptors and mitochondria. Toll-like receptors (TLR) 4The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; BH3, Bcl-2 homology 3; ΔNp63α, N-terminally truncated p63 isoform α; DR4/5, death receptor 4/5; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; PI, propidium iodide; poly(I-C), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid; TAp63α, transactivating p63 isoform α; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; TRIF, Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter inducing IFNβ; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; qRT, quantitative PCR; F, forward; R, reverse. recognize different pathogen-associated molecular patterns, leading to the activation of innate immune response and the priming of subsequent adaptive immune response by controlling multiple functions of dendritic cells (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar, 2Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). Expressed in conventional dendritic cells and in a variety of epithelial cells, including airway, uterine, corneal, vaginal, cervical, biliary, and intestinal epithelial cells (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was the first member of the TLR family known as a pattern recognition receptor and has been demonstrated to detect a conserved viral molecular pattern, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), now regarded as a universal viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (3Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). TLR3 has been reported to promote the cross-priming of the cytotoxic T cell response against viral infection (4Schulz O. Diebold S.S. Chen M. Näslund T.I. Nolte M.A. Alexopoulou L. Azuma Y.T. Flavell R.A. Liljeström P. Reis e Sousa C. Nature. 2005; 433: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Immunization with virus-infected cells or cells containing synthetic dsRNA leads to a striking increase in cytotoxic T cell cross-priming against cell-associated antigens. TLR3 is expressed in the central nervous system and plays important roles in the control of herpes simplex virus 1, which spreads from the epithelium to the central nervous system via cranial nerves (5Zhang S.Y. Jouanguy E. Ugolini S. Smahi A. Elain G. Romero P. Segal D. Sancho-Shimizu V. Lorenzo L. Puel A. Picard C. Chapgier A. Plancoulaine S. Titeux M. Cognet C. von Bernuth H. Ku C.L. Casrouge A. Zhang X.X. Barreiro L. Leonard J. Hamilton C. Lebon P. Héron B. Vallée L. Quintana-Murci L. Hovnanian A. Rozenberg F. Vivier E. Geissmann F. Tardieu M. Abel L. Casanova J.L. Science. 2007; 317: 1522-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies have reported conflicting conclusions about TLR3 in host immunity to viruses. TLR3-deficient mice have been shown to be more resistant to lethal infection and have a reduced incidence of liver disease associated with hepatotropic Punta Toro virus infection compared with wild-type mice (6Gowen B.B. Hoopes J.D. Wong M.H. Jung K.H. Isakson K.C. Alexopoulou L. Flavell R.A. Sidwell R.W. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 6301-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The recombinant strain Western Reserve vaccinia virus has been reported to be more deleterious to the wild-type mice than the TLR3-deficient mice (7Hutchens M. Luker K.E. Sottile P. Sonstein J. Lukacs N.W. Núñez G. Curtis J.L. Luker G.D. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). More importantly, TLR3 has been reported to mediate West Nile virus entry into the brain, causing lethal encephalitis by impairment of the blood-brain barrier (8Wang T. Town T. Alexopoulou L. Anderson J.F. Fikrig E. Flavell R.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1366-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). p63 is a p53-related gene that was cloned in 1998 (9Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dötsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). The high level of sequence similarity between the p63 and p53 proteins, particularly in the DNA-binding domain, allows p63 to transactivate p53-responsive genes, leading to cycle cell arrest and apoptosis. The p63 gene expresses three alternatively spliced C-terminal isoforms (α, β, and γ) and can be transcribed from the promoter upstream of the first exon or from an alternative promoter located in intron 3. Thus, it produces at least six mRNA variants, which encode six different p63 protein isoforms (transactivating p63 (TAp63) α, β, and γ and N-terminally truncated p63 (ΔNp63) α, β, and γ) (9Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dötsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 962-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The TAp63 isoforms are able to bind to DNA through a p53 response element and activate the transcription of target genes to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. However, the ΔNp63 isoforms, which lack the transactivation domain, can bind to DNA through a p53 response element and exert dominant-negative effects over p53, p73, and p63 activities either by competing for the DNA-binding sites or by direct protein interaction. Compared with p53, TAp63 isoforms differentially recognize responsive elements, resulting in target gene specificity (11Osada M. Park H.L. Nagakawa Y. Yamashita K. Fomenkov A. Kim M.S. Wu G. Nomoto S. Trink B. Sidransky D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6077-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). One important p63 isoform, TAp63α, induces apoptosis via the death receptor apoptotic pathway in which the expression of CD95, the TNF receptor, and the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors is triggered and via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in which the expression of pro-apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members, such as Bax, is up-regulated (12Gressner O. Schilling T. Lorenz K. Schulze Schleithoff E. Koch A. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Lena A.M. Candi E. Terrinoni A. Catani M.V. Oren M. Melino G. Krammer P.H. Stremmel W. Müller M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2458-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). p63 has been further implicated in many p53-independent pathways, including stem cell regeneration, epidermal morphogenesis, and limb development (13Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar, 14Senoo M. Pinto F. Crum C.P. McKeon F. Cell. 2007; 129: 523-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Therefore, p63 is not functionally redundant to p53. Recently, TLR has been reported to elicit apoptosis in several cells. In melanoma cells, TLR3 induced the Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adapter inducing IFNβ (TRIF)-dependent activation of pro-apoptotic signaling, which was under the control of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (15Weber A. Kirejczyk Z. Besch R. Potthoff S. Leverkus M. Häcker G. Cell Death Differ. 2010; 17: 942-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β cells, dsRNA induced TLR3-dependent apoptosis by the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway (16Dogusan Z. García M. Flamez D. Alexopoulou L. Goldman M. Gysemans C. Mathieu C. Libert C. Eizirik D.L. Rasschaert J. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 1236-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). TLR3 also triggers apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells through a protein kinase C (PKC) α-dependent mechanism (17Paone A. Starace D. Galli R. Padula F. De Cesaris P. Filippini A. Ziparo E. Riccioli A. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 1334-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In human breast cancer cells, TLR3 induces apoptosis that involves the molecular adapter, TRIF, and type I IFN autocrine signaling (18Salaun B. Coste I. Rissoan M.C. Lebecque S.J. Renno T. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4894-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Moreover, TLR3-mediated cell death involves the activation of caspases and engages both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways (19Salaun B. Lebecque S. Matikainen S. Rimoldi D. Romero P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). IFNα has been reported to sensitize human umbilical vein endothelial cells to apoptosis induced by dsRNA (20Kaiser W.J. Kaufman J.L. Offermann M.K. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of TLR3-induced cell apoptosis is not fully understood. In this study, we found that TRAIL death receptors 4/5 (DR4/5) and Noxa elicited the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, respectively, in TLR3-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, which was regulated by TAp63α, a p53-related protein. By analyzing the cells deficient in p63 gene expression and the cells overexpressing ΔNp63α, a dominant-negative variant of TAp63α, we have established that TAp63α, as a pivotal control point, functions downstream of TLR3 to elicit cell apoptosis. The immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) expressing endothelial cell characteristic markers, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, CD31, and Ve-cadherin (21Gifford S.M. Grummer M.A. Pierre S.A. Austin J.L. Zheng J. Bird I.M. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 182: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. Primary HUVECs were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories and maintained in endothelial culture medium (ScienCell, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% FCS, 1% endothelial cell growth supplement, and antibiotics. All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Human TLR3 shRNA plasmid was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human TRAIL ELISA kit was purchased from Boster Biochemicals (Wuhan, China). Total RNA was extracted from 2 to 5 × 106 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen), as described by the manufacturer. mRNA was reverse-transcribed with RevertAid (MBI Fermentas, Burlington Ontario, Canada) at 42 °C for 60 min, and the resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR (95 °C for 1 min followed by 25–35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min and an extension for 10 min at 68 °C).

Human endothelial cells, grown to subconfluency, were harvested and washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (5 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.1% NaN3, and 1% FCS, in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). After incubation with a monoclonal antibody against human TLR3 for 40 min on ice, the cells were stained with a FITC-labeled secondary antibody and examined for protein expression by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). The death of cells was detected by FITC-annexin V/PI staining. In general, 1–2 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS and then labeled with FITC-annexin V and PI in binding buffer, according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Fluorescence signals of FITC and PI were detected on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). The log of FITC-annexin V fluorescence was displayed on the x axis, and the log of PI fluorescence was displayed on the y axis. For each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. Production of human TNFα and TRAIL, found in the culture supernatants and cell lysates of human endothelial cells, in response to various concentrations of poly(I-C), was detected by ELISA kits, according to the manufacturer's standard protocols. Endothelial cells were lysed in 150 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer (62.5 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 50 mmol/liter DTT), sonicated for 3 s, and then boiled for 5 min. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Total protein was electrophoresed on 4–12% gradient Tris-glycine precast gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked by incubation in 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the protein bands were detected with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate-stable peroxide solution (Pierce) and BIOMAX-MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). When necessary, the membranes were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and re-probed with antibodies against various cellular proteins. For the construction of human p63 RNAi plasmid, a 21-oligonucleotide (GAGTGGAATGACTTCAACTTT) corresponding to nucleotides 2058–2078 in exon 14 of the human p63 mRNA (LOCUS NM_003722) was inserted into pRNAT-U6.1-Neo (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) with BamHI and HindIII. The plasmid was transfected into endothelial cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's standard protocols. All enzymes used for the construction of recombinant plasmids were products of MBI Fermentas (Burlington Ontario, Canada). Total RNA was isolated from squamous carcinoma CNE1 cells using TRIzol reagent and reverse-transcribed. The 1767-bp cDNA of human ΔNp63α was produced by PCR using the primers sense (5′-GCTAACATGTTGTACCTGGAAAAC-3′) and antisense (5′-TCACTCCCCCTCCTCTTTGA-3′) and inserted into the pMD19-T vector (Takara, Japan). The white clones (after blue-white screening) were subject to PCR screening, and positive plasmids were expanded. The amplified cDNA was digested by restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII and inserted into pcDNA3.1+. The ΔNp63α cDNA inserted into the constructs was sequenced and verified as identical to the published sequences. The transfection of cells with the plasmid was performed in a 6-well culture plate with 60–80% confluence of cells using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's standard protocols. Stable transfected cells were selected with 800 μg/ml G418 for 3 weeks. The qRT-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's standard protocols. Briefly, total RNA from cells was isolated and reverse-transcribed as above. The cDNA was amplified using TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Amplification of the target genes was normalized using the amplification levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an endogenous control. The efficiency of the PCR was tested by amplification of the target from serially diluted cDNA generated from the reverse transcription of a stock set of human RNA. Data analysis and calculations were performed using the 2−ΔΔCT comparative method, as described by the manufacturer. Gene expression is shown as the fold inductions of a gene measured in poly(I-C)-treated samples, relative to samples cultured with medium. All experiments were performed at least three times, and the representative results are shown. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using Student's t test, and p values equal to or less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The activation of TLR3 induces apoptosis in various cells (15Weber A. Kirejczyk Z. Besch R. Potthoff S. Leverkus M. Häcker G.

We first detected the effect of poly(I-C), a synthetic dsRNA analog, on endothelial cell apoptosis. We found that the treatment of resting primary HUVECs with poly(I-C) for 24 h elicited a slight apoptotic effects (data not shown). However, when the cells, pretreated with 1 μg/ml poly(I-C) for 24 h, were re-stimulated with poly(I-C) for another 24 h, a significant fraction of cells underwent detachment (Fig. 1A). To quantitate the fraction of dead cells, we stained unfixed cells treated by poly(I-C) for 24 h with FITC-annexin V/PI and performed flow cytometry analysis. This assay detects all early apoptotic (annexin V-positive/PI-negative), late apoptotic (annexin V-positive/PI-positive), and necrotic (annexin V-negative/PI-positive) cells. Fig. 1B shows the annexin V/PI profiles of primary endothelial cells in response to the increasing concentrations of poly(I-C). Up to 30% of endothelial cells underwent cell apoptosis within 24 h by poly(I-C) treatment. In immortalized HUVECs, poly(I-C) induced dose- and time-dependent cell apoptosis (Fig. 1, C and D) without a poly(I-C) pretreatment, and up to 40% of the cells underwent cell apoptosis within 24 h. IFNα sensitizes freshly isolated HUVECs to double-stranded RNA-induced apoptosis (20Kaiser W.J. Kaufman J.L. Offermann M.K. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1699-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and we found poly(I-C) induced cell apoptosis in both primary and immortalized endothelial cells (Fig. 1). To determine the contribution of TLR3 in poly(I-C)-induced cell apoptosis, we first detected the TLR3 gene expression in immortalized HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, resting immortalized HUVECs expressed TLR3 gene transcript and protein. The expression of TLR3 was slightly up-regulated by treatment with poly(I-C) at both the gene and protein levels. In primary HUVECs, Western blot results show that the treatment with 0.1–1 μg/ml poly(I-C) up-regulated the expression of TLR3. However, TLR3 levels were low in 5–10 μg/ml poly(I-C)-treated cells (Fig. 2C), because most of the cells underwent apoptosis. Quantitative real time RT-PCR data show that poly(I-C) significantly up-regulated the gene expression of TLR3 in primary HUVECs (Fig. 2D). We then examined the potential of poly(I-C) to elicit TLR3-medicated signaling transduction. The results show that the treatment of immortalized HUVECs with 1 μg/ml poly(I-C) induced the phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (Fig. 2E). Poly(I-C) treatment also up-regulated the transcripts coding for cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IFNβ, in immortalized HUVECs (Fig. 2F). When a TLR3-neutralizing antibody was administered to inhibit TLR3 activation in both primary and immortalized HUVECs, apoptosis induced by poly(I-C) was repressed significantly (Fig. 2G). Moreover, TLR3 shRNA transfection significantly inhibited poly(I-C)-induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 2H). Thus, we conclude that TLR3 contributed to the cell apoptosis induced by poly(I-C) in endothelial cells, although there are other pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors, such as RIG-I and MDA5, which recognize dsRNA (22Kato H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Matsui K. Uematsu S. Jung A. Kawai T. Ishii K.J. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K. Tsujimura T. Koh C.S. Reis e Sousa C. Matsuura Y. Fujita T. Akira S. Nature. 2006; 441: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). The following are the two main pathways known to contribute to the induction of apoptosis: a death receptor-initiated caspase 8-dependent pathway known as the extrinsic pathway; and a mitochondrion-initiated caspase 9-dependent pathway known as the intrinsic pathway (23Hotchkiss R.S. Nicholson D.W. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). An understanding of the particular pathway involved in TLR3-induced cell death is important because it might provide insight into the potential factors that are responsible for initiating cell suicide and allow for the development of a more targeted therapy. To elucidate the detailed mechanism of TLR3-induced cell death in endothelial cells, we first examined the involvement of these two pathways by measuring the activation of caspases 8 and 9 and their common downstream molecule, PARP, which is a specific hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Western blot analysis shows that poly(I-C) treatment led to the cleavage of caspase 8, resulting in the release of cleaved fragments p41/43 (Fig. 3A), indicating the activation of the extrinsic pathway. Similarly, poly(I-C) treatment also led to the cleavage of caspase 9, resulting in the release of cleaved fragments p35/p37 (Fig. 3A), suggesting the activation of the intrinsic pathway. To prove further the involvement of caspases in TLR3-induced cell death, caspase 8-specific inhibitor Z-IEHD-FMK, caspase 9-specific inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK, and pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, which have been reported to improve cell survival in sepsis by preventing lymphocyte apoptosis (24Hotchkiss R.S. Tinsley K.W. Swanson P.E. Chang K.C. Cobb J.P. Buchman T.G. Korsmeyer S.J. Karl I.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14541-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), were administered to the culture to test the effect of caspase inhibition on poly(I-C)-induced cell death. As expected, the inhibition of caspase 8 or 9 led to the dose-dependent decrease of cell apoptosis, but the down-regulation of cell apoptosis was partial, and the levels of cell apoptosis were not down-regulated to that as low as the background levels (Fig. 3B). On the contrary, pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK completely repressed cell death to the background level (Fig. 3B). When we analyzed the cellular signaling downstream of the caspases, we found that poly(I-C) treatment led to the cleavage of PARP, resulting in the release of the cleaved fragment p89 (Fig. 3C). Additionally, PARP inhibitors dose-dependently repressed poly(I-C)-induced cell death (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways contributed to poly(I-C)-induced cell apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway was initiated by extracellular death ligands, such as TNFα, TRAIL, and FasL, binding to their cell surface death receptors, TNFRs, DR4/5, and Fas, respectively. As TNFα positively regulates brain-blood barrier permeability to promote virus entry into the central nervous system (8Wang T. Town T. Alexopoulou L. Anderson J.F. Fikrig E. Flavell R.A. Nat.

Here, we present the first crystal structure of PSII with a bound herbicide at a resolution of 3.2 Å. The crystallized PSII core complexes were isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The used herbicide terbutryn is found to bind via at least two hydrogen bonds to the Q(B) site similar to photosynthetic reaction centers in anoxygenic purple bacteria. Herbicide binding to PSII is also discussed regarding the influence on the redox potential of Q(A), which is known to affect photoinhibition.

Alternative splicing of exon 10 generates tau with three or four microtubule binding repeats (3R-tau or 4R-tau), which is under developmental and cell type-specific regulation. Only 3R-tau is expressed during embryogenesis, whereas 3R-tau and 4R-tau are expressed in approximately equal amounts in adult human brain (6Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D.

It has been shown that PKA phosphorylates tau at several sites and primes phosphorylation of tau by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (37Liu F. Liang Z. Shi J. Yin D. El-Akkad E. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K.

PKA is a tetrameric holoenzyme consisting of two catalytic (C) subunits and two regulatory (R) subunits in the absence of cAMP. Stimulation by cAMP dissociates the holoenzyme and causes translocation to the nucleus of a fraction of the C subunit. Apart from regulation of transcription, little is known about the function of the C subunit in the nucleus. It is known that PKA phosphorylates several splicing factors and is involved in the pre-mRNA splicing (30Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I.

We recently found that in AD brain, the activity of PKA is down-regulated as a result of proteolysis of the regulatory subunit by over-activated calpain I (40Liang Z. Liu F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Gong C.X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the role of PKA in the alternative splicing of tau exon 10 was unclear. In the present study we demonstrate that PKA phosphorylates SRSF1 and thereby enhances the inclusion of tau exon 10 and that down-regulation of PKA in AD brain correlates with increase in 3R-tau expression. These results suggest that PKA is involved in the tau pathology in AD via regulation of tau exon 10 splicing.DISCUSSIONThe present study shows for the first time that the alternative splicing of tau exon 10 is probably dysregulated in AD brain, resulting in an imbalance between the levels of 3R-tau and 4R-tau. The increase in the level of 3R-tau was negatively correlated with PKA-Cα level, which is down-regulated in AD brain due to activation of calpain I (40Liang Z. Liu F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Gong C.X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Activation of PKA enhanced the binding of SRSF1 to tau pre-mRNA and promoted SRSF1-mediated exon 10 inclusion in cultured cells and in vivo in rat brain. PKA-Cα, but not PKA-Cβ, interacted with and phosphorylated both the RS and RRM domains of SRSF1. Overexpression PKA-Cα, but not PKA-Cβ, enhanced SRSF1-mediated tau exon 10 inclusion. Knockdown of PKA-Cα inhibited SRSF1 function in promotion of tau exon 10 inclusion. Thus, down-regulation of PKA-Cα in AD brain (40Liang Z. Liu F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Gong C.X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) might be responsible for the increase of 3R-tau expression, resulting in an increase in 3R-tau/4R-tau ratio, which may contribute to neurofibrillary degeneration (Fig. 6).The finding of increased 3R-tau level in AD brain is inconsistent with previous studies, which showed either an increase in 4R-tau expression in brain regions affected by sporadic AD (15Glatz D.C. Rujescu D. Tang Y. Berendt F.J. Hartmann A.M. Faltraco F. Rosenberg C. Hulette C. Jellinger K. Hampel H. Riederer P. Möller H.J. Andreadis A. Henkel K. Stamm S. J.

Most of these studies detected mRNA levels of 3R-tau and 4R-tau. However, RNA can be degraded very easily. Many studies have shown that the postmortem interval is related to the quality of RNA, but it is pH that affects RNA quality the most strongly. In postmortem tissue, the protein was found to be much more stable and its level unchanged, even when RNA was degraded (47Stan A.D. Ghose S. Gao X.M. Roberts R.C. Lewis-Amezcua K. Hatanpaa K.J.

Pathol. 2008; 84: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By immunohistochemical analysis, Espinoza et al. observed that tangles appear with both 3R-tau and 4R-tau in the hippocampus in AD, and some advanced cases had large amounts of thioflavin-S-positive neurofibrillary tangles only detected by anti-3R-tau antibody but not anti-4R-tau antibody (16Espinoza M. de Silva R. Dickson D.W. Davies P. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2008; 14: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, they found that the pathology appeared to be more severe and displayed more abundant 3R-tau-positive tangles in the anterior as compared with the posterior hippocampus from the same cases (16Espinoza M. de Silva R. Dickson D.W. Davies P. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2008; 14: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results suggest that aggregation and deposition of 3R-tau may be associated with more advanced stages. In the present study we measured the protein levels of 3R-tau and 4R-tau in the temporal cortices of AD and control brains with a very short postmortem interval (<3 h) and found an increase in 3R-tau level. Previously, we have demonstrated that in AD brain, overactivation of calpain I due to calcium dysregulation causes degradation of the regulatory subunit of PKA, PKA-RII (40Liang Z. Liu F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Gong C.X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A decrease in PKA-RII at basal conditions provides less protection to PKA-C from degradation. The C subunits of PKA are also decreased in AD brain, including Cα (40Liang Z. Liu F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Gong C.X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 2462-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which could lead to tau exon 10 exclusion, resulting in an increase in 3R-tau expression.PKA is a Ser/Thr protein kinase and is involved in many biological pathways. Under non-stimulated conditions, PKA is present as an inactive heterotetramer consisting of two C subunits and two R subunits. There are three isoforms of C subunits, Cα, Cβ, and Cγ, and four isoforms of R subunits, RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ. The Cα isoform is ubiquitously expressed, whereas the Cβ isoform is expressed only in brain (43Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). PKA-Cγ is expressed only in the testis (44Foss K.B. Simard J. Bérubé D. Beebe S.J. Sandberg M. Grzeschik K.H. Gagné R. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1992; 60: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although the Rα isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, the Rβ isoforms are predominant in the nervous and adipose tissues. When a signal arrives at the cell surface, it activates the corresponding receptor, which in turn leads to the transient elevation of intracellular cAMP and consequently activates PKA by dissociating the C subunits and the R subunits. The free C subunits catalyze phosphorylation of the substrate proteins and then become vulnerable to degradation. The present study showed differential effect of PKA-Cα and PKA-Cβ on tau exon 10 splicing. PKA-Cα promoted tau exon 10 inclusion and PKA-Cβ suppressed tau exon 10 inclusion. Further study found that PKA-Cα, but not PKA-Cβ, interacted with SRSF1 and promoted SRSF1-mediated tau exon 10 inclusion. The difference in sequences between PKA-Cα and -Cβ is located in the first 50 amino acids of the N terminus, suggesting that PKA-Cα via N terminus interacts with SRSF1, and PKA-Cβ may act on other splicing factors to inhibit tau exon 10.SRSF1 harbors 2 RRM motifs and 2 RS domains and is heavily phosphorylated in cells. There are 26 Ser, 2 Thr, and 7 Tyr putative phosphorylation sites, as predicted by using NetPhos 2.0. However, the majority of Ser/Thr residues are located at the RS domain; only eight Ser/Thr residues are at the RRM domain. Site/regional phosphorylation impacts SRSF1 function and subcellular localization differentially (27Shi J. Zhang T. Zhou C. Chohan M.O. Gu X. Wegiel J. Zhou J. Hwang Y.W. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I.

It has been reported that several kinases phosphorylate SRSF1 in vitro and in cultured cells.

It is known that SRSF1 binds to the PPE at exon 10 and promotes tau exon 10 inclusion. Tau deletion mutation ΔK280 significantly decreases the SRSF1 binding and leads to tau exon 10 exclusion (24D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2460-2469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that with EMSA, the hyperphosphorylated SRSF1, but not the hypophosphorylated SRSF1, bound to oligonucleotides of tau exon 10 and that with RNA immunoprecipitation assay, activation of PKA enhanced the binding of SRSF1 binding to PPE at exon 10. These data suggest that phosphorylation of SRSF1 by PKA might promote its binding to RNA.Although hyperphosphorylation of tau plays a fundamental role in the development of Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary degeneration, imbalance in the cellular levels of 3R- and 4R-tau is emerging as an important concept in this pathology. Several lines of evidence, from transgenic mouse models to human tauopathies, emphasize the importance of a critical 3R-tau/4R-tau ratio in neurons. Disturbances of the 3R-tau/4R-tau ratio may lead to the characteristic neurofibrillary pathology. Close to 50% of all mutations in the tau gene causing human FTDP-17 affect tau exon exon 10 splicing and alter 3R/4R tau ratio (55D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to FTDP-17, dysregulation of exon 10 splicing may also contribute to other human tauopathies, such as Pick's disease (with a predominant increase in 3R-tau), progressive supranuclear palsy (4R-tau up-regulation), corticobasal degeneration (4R-tau up-regulation) (12Yoshida M. Neuropathology. 2006; 26: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and Down syndrome (3R-tau up-regulation) (27Shi J. Zhang T. Zhou C. Chohan M.O. Gu X. Wegiel J. Zhou J. Hwang Y.W.

The neuronal tau expression levels and isoform content is highly cell- and region-specific both during development and in the mature brain (56McMillan P. Korvatska E. Poorkaj P. Evstafjeva Z.

In vitro, 4R has an ∼3-fold higher binding affinity for microtubules than that of 3R-tau (57Butner K.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell.

In addition, 4R-tau is better at initiating and promoting microtubule assembly than 3R-tau (6Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A.

We observed an ∼4-fold increase in 3R-tau and an insignificant increase in 4R-tau in the AD brain with overactivation of calpain I, resulting in an increase of 3R-tau/4R-tau. Imbalanced tau apparently offers a good substrate for the phosphorylation and aggregation in neurons, leading to neurofibrillary degeneration. IntroductionTau is a neuronal microtubule-associated protein, the function of which is to stimulate microtubule assembly and stabilize microtubules. Hyperphosphorylation of tau leads to its aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; SRSF1, serine/arginine (SR)-rich splicing factor 1; PPE, polypurine enhancer; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; RRM, RNA recognition motif. and related neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies (1Grundke-Iqbal I.

Adult human brain expresses six different tau isoforms from a single gene by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 of its pre-mRNA (5Andreadis A. Brown W.M. Kosik K.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10626-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The exon 10 encodes the second microtubule binding repeat (6Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of exon 10 generates tau with three or four microtubule binding repeats (3R-tau or 4R-tau), which is under developmental and cell type-specific regulation. Only 3R-tau is expressed during embryogenesis, whereas 3R-tau and 4R-tau are expressed in approximately equal amounts in adult human brain (6Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D.

Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Several mutations in tau gene result in either an increase or a decrease in 4R-tau expression and cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), one of the tauopathies (8Goedert M. Jakes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, alteration in the 3R-tau/4R-tau ratio is sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration in frontotemporal dementia and might also play a role in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Pick's disease, progressive nuclear palsy, or corticobasal degeneration in which the 3R-tau/4R-tau ratio is markedly altered (9Bronner I.F. ter Meulen B.C.

https://openalex.org/W2049868874,"The microtubule-associated protein tau, which becomes hyperphosphorylated and pathologically aggregates in a number of these diseases, is extremely sensitive to manipulations of chaperone signaling. For example, Hsp90 inhibitors can reduce the levels of tau in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy. Because of this, we hypothesized that a number of Hsp90 accessory proteins, termed co-chaperones, could also affect tau stability. Perhaps by identifying these co-chaperones, new therapeutics could be designed to specifically target these proteins and facilitate tau clearance. Here, we report that the co-chaperone Cdc37 can regulate aspects of tau pathogenesis. We found that suppression of Cdc37 destabilized tau, leading to its clearance, whereas Cdc37 overexpression preserved tau. Cdc37 was found to co-localize with tau in neuronal cells and to physically interact with tau from human brain. Moreover, Cdc37 levels significantly increased with age. Cdc37 knockdown altered the phosphorylation profile of tau, an effect that was due in part to reduced tau kinase stability, specifically Cdk5 and Akt. Conversely, GSK3β and Mark2 were unaffected by Cdc37 modulation. Cdc37 overexpression prevented whereas Cdc37 suppression potentiated tau clearance following Hsp90 inhibition. Thus, Cdc37 can regulate tau in two ways: by directly stabilizing it via Hsp90 and by regulating the stability of distinct tau kinases. We propose that changes in the neuronal levels or activity of Cdc37 could dramatically alter the kinome, leading to profound changes in the tau phosphorylation signature, altering its proteotoxicity and stability."

As immunogenicity relies on a T-cell-dependent mechanism, we have evaluated in vitro the size of the preexisting CD4 T-cell repertoire specific to therapeutic antibodies in healthy donors. Specific CD4 T cells of individuals with different HLA-DR allotypes were amplified by in vitro stimulation and quantified. Well-known immunogenic proteins, KLH and a murine antibody, exhibited a strong in vitro T-cell response characterized by a mean of preexisting T cells >1 cell/10(6) cells. In contrast, the preexisting CD4 T-cell repertoires specific to 2 chimeric, 2 humanized, and 2 fully human antibodies remained generally inferior to this value, confirming the role of species-specific sequences in their shaping. Mean values ranged from 0.01 to 0.3 cell/10(6) cells and varied not necessarily in relationship with the humanization level of the therapeutic antibodies. Relationship with their known immunogenicity is discussed. These results contribute to a better understanding and prediction of immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2078126488,"The Notch pathway is a conserved cell-to-cell signaling mechanism that mediates cell fate decisions in metazoans. Canonical signaling results in changes in gene expression, which is regulated by the nuclear effector of the pathway CSL (CBF1/RBP-J, Su(H), Lag-1). CSL is a DNA binding protein that functions as either a repressor or an activator of transcription, depending upon whether it is complexed by transcriptional corepressor or coactivator proteins, respectively. In stark contrast to CSL-coactivator complexes, e.g. the transcriptionally active CSL-Notch-Mastermind ternary complex, the structure and function of CSL-corepressor complexes are poorly understood. The corepressor MINT (Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein) has been shown in vivo to antagonize Notch signaling and shown in vitro to biochemically interact with CSL; however, the molecular details of this interaction are only partially defined. Here, we provide a quantitative thermodynamic binding analysis of CSL-MINT complexes. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we demonstrate that MINT forms a high affinity complex with CSL, and we also delineate the domains of MINT and CSL that are necessary and sufficient for complex formation. Moreover, we show in cultured cells that this region of MINT can inhibit Notch signaling in transcriptional reporter assays. Taken together, our results provide functional insights into how CSL is converted from a repressor to an activator of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2146067929,"Eradication of smallpox was accomplished 30 yr ago, but poxviral infections still represent a public health concern due to the potential release of variola virus or the emergence of zoonotic poxviruses, such as monkeypox virus. A critical determinant of poxvirus virulence is the inhibition of interferons (IFNs) by the virus-encoded type I IFN-binding protein (IFNα/βBP). This immunomodulatory protein is secreted and has the unique property of interacting with the cell surface in order to prevent IFN-mediated antiviral responses. However, the mechanism of its attachment to the cell surface remains unknown. Using surface plasmon resonance and cell-binding assays, we report that the IFNα/βBP from vaccinia virus, the smallpox vaccine, interacts with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Analysis of the contribution of different regions of the protein to cell surface binding demonstrated that clusters of basic residues in the first immunoglobulin domain mediate GAG interactions. Furthermore, mutation of the GAG-interaction motifs does not affect its IFN-binding and -blocking capacity. Functional conservation of GAG-binding sites is demonstrated for the IFNα/βBP from variola and monkeypox viruses, extending our understanding of immune modulation by the most virulent human poxviruses. These results are relevant for the design of improved vaccines and intervention strategies."

However, D. arizonae had higher amounts of most hydrocarbons than D. mojavensis and females of both species exhibited greater hydrocarbon amounts than males. Hydrocarbon profiles of D. mojavensis populations were significantly influenced by sex and rearing substrates, and differed between body parts. Lab food–reared flies had lower amounts of most hydrocarbons than flies reared on fermenting cactus substrates. We discovered 48 male- and species-specific hydrocarbons ranging in size from C22 to C50 in the male anogenital region of both species, most not described before. These included several oxygen-containing hydrocarbons in addition to high intensity signals corresponding to putative triacylglycerides, amounts of which were influenced by larval rearing substrates. Some of these compounds were transferred to female cuticles in high amounts during copulation. This is the first study showing that triacylglycerides may be a separate class of courtship-related signaling molecules in drosophilids. This study also extends the kind and number of epicuticular hydrocarbons in these species and emphasizes the role of larval ecology in influencing amounts of these compounds, many of which mediate courtship success within and between species."

The biogenesis of these proteins has been the subject of extensive investigation, and particular focus has been placed on the pathways that assemble iron-sulfur clusters in the different cellular compartments. Iron-only hydrogenase-like protein 1 (IOP1; also known as nuclear prelamin A recognition factor like protein, or NARFL) is a human protein that is homologous to Nar1, a protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that, in turn, is an essential component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly pathway in yeast. Previous siRNA-induced knockdown studies using mammalian cells point to a similar role for IOP1 in mammals. In the present studies, we pursued this further by knocking out Iop1 in Mus musculus. We find that Iop1 knock-out results in embryonic lethality before embryonic day 10.5. Acute, inducible global knock-out of Iop1 in adult mice results in lethality and significantly diminished activity of cytosolic aconitase, an iron-sulfur protein, in liver extracts. Inducible knock-out of Iop1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts results in diminished activity of cytosolic but not mitochondrial aconitase and loss of cell viability. Therefore, just as with knock-out of Nar1 in yeast, we find that knock-out of Iop1/Narfl in mice results in lethality and defective cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2121708521,"Mature neutrophils are notoriously short-lived immune cells that cannot be genetically manipulated. Analysis of gene function therefore requires genetically modified animals, which is expensive, time-consuming, and costly in animal life.

We sought to overcome this obstruction in the field by developing a strategy for the analysis of gene function in neutrophils in a physiologically relevant context. Here, we demonstrate the functional relevance of in vitro conditional-Hoxb8 immortalized precursor-derived neutrophils. In vitro-derived neutrophils functionally resembled primary neutrophils, but critically, neutrophils generated in this way can be adoptively transferred into live animals and tracked during inflammatory responses using single-cell analysis to define functional attributes. We have validated this approach using CD11b-deficient neutrophils and replicated the key findings observed in gene-targeted animals and in naturally CD11b-deficient humans. Furthermore, we show that by retroviral transduction, one can generate stable alterations in the precursor cell lines and thus a continuous supply of functionally altered neutrophils.

https://openalex.org/W1988419689,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a post-translational modification that anchors cell surface proteins to the plasma membrane, and GPI modifications occur in all eukaryotes. Biosynthesis of GPI starts on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and GPI precursors flip from the cytoplasmic side to the luminal side of the ER, where biosynthesis of GPI precursors is completed. Gwt1p and PIG-W are inositol acyltransferases that transfer fatty acyl chains to the inositol moiety of GPI precursors in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. To ascertain whether flipping across the ER membrane occurs before or after inositol acylation of GPI precursors, we identified essential residues of PIG-W and Gwt1p and determined the membrane topology of Gwt1p. Guided by algorithm-based predictions of membrane topology, we experimentally identified 13 transmembrane domains in Gwt1p. We found that Gwt1p, PIG-W, and their orthologs shared four conserved regions and that these four regions in Gwt1p faced the luminal side of the ER membrane. Moreover, essential residues of Gwt1p and PIG-W faced the ER lumen or were near the luminal edge of transmembrane domains. The membrane topology of Gwt1p suggested that inositol acylation occurred on the luminal side of the ER membrane. Rather than stimulate flipping of the GPI precursor across the ER membrane, inositol acylation of GPI precursors may anchor the precursors to the luminal side of the ER membrane, preventing flip-flops."

The only study in which PC tubulovesicular and secretory membranes were isolated, reconstituted in lipid bilayer, and studied electrophysiologically found channels with Kir rather than KCNQ1 channel properties (13Malinowska D.H.

Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated co-precipitation of H+/K+-ATPase and Kir4.1 from both immunopurified tubulovesicles and stimulated secretory membranes, as well as a complete translocation of not only H+/K+-ATPase but also of Kir4.1 from the tubulovesicular to secretory membrane pool (14Kaufhold M.A. Krabbenhöft A. Song P. Engelhardt R. Riederer B. Fährmann M. Klöcker N. Beil W. Manns M. Hagen S.J. Seidler U.

We therefore searched for an experimental model to elucidate the physiological role of the PC Kir4.1 channels. Because Kir4.1-deficient mice develop early neurological deficits and die soon after birth, we investigated the acid secretory capacity, PC ultrastructure, and gene expression of isolated gastric mucosae from 7–8-day-old Kir4.1-deficient, WT, and heterozygous mice. Kir4.1+/+ and Kir4.1−/− mice were originally generated in the laboratory of Henry A. Lester (15Kofuji P. Ceelen P. Zahs K.R. Surbeck L.W. Lester H.A. Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5733-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar) and raised on the original 129/SVJ background in the animal facility of Hannover Medical School or the University of Göttingen. All studies were approved by the Committee on Investigations Involving Animals, Hannover Medical School, and the University of Göttingen and by an independent review committee composed by the State Government Agency for animal welfare. All mice were 7–8 days of age. The genotypes of the mice were verified by PCR. The experiments were performed as described previously (43McDaniel N. Pace A.J. Spiegel S. Engelhardt R. Koller B.H. Seidler U. Lytle C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2005; 289: G550-G560Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with the modifications indicated below. After killing the animals by cervical dislocation, the stomach was cleaned in ice-cold Ringer's solution (145.5 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.05 mm indomethacin) and mounted between two Lucite half-chambers (with an exposed surface area of 0.283 cm2) of a water-jacketed Ussing system equipped with a gas-lift system. The serosal solution contained 108 mm NaCl, 22 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.25 mm KH2PO4, 8.9 mm glucose, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 3 × 10−2 mm indomethacin, and 10−3 mm tetrodotoxin to minimize variation due to intrinsic prostanoids and neural tone and was gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). The mucosal solution contained 154 mm NaCl and was gassed with 100% O2 and kept at constant pH 7.4 with 2 mm NaOH by a pH-stat titration system (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). The volume of the titrant infused per unit time was used to quantify H+ secretion. These measurements were recorded at 5-min intervals. The rate of luminal H+ secretion (JH+) is expressed as μmol·cm−2·h−1. Transepithelial short-circuit current (Isc; reported as μeq·cm−2·h−1) and potential difference (PD; expressed as mV) were measured via an automatic voltage clamp (EVC-4000 voltage-current clamp, World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany). Transepithelial resistance (Rt; reported as ohms·cm2) was calculated according to values of Isc and PD. Basal parameters were measured for a period of 30 min if the stomach showed spontaneous acid secretion, and then stimulant (10−5 m forskolin) was added to the serosal side of the tissue. Changes in gastric acid secretion, Isc, Rt, and PD were determined during the 60 min after the addition of stimulants. Only stomachs that secreted acid after forskolin stimulation and displayed normal electrophysiological parameters and no signs of leakage (rapid increase in luminal pH, indicative of an HCO3− leak from the serosal perfusate) were included in calculations of the time course and magnitude of stimulation of acid secretion by forskolin. Equal numbers of WT, heterozygous, and knock-out (KO) mucosae were excluded because of leakiness or lack of PD buildup. In a subset of experiments, the luminal perfusate was 154 mm KCl. The stomachs were removed and immediately immersed in a fixative solution containing either 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde (freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde) buffered in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate/HCl buffer (pH 7.3) or 4% formaldehyde (freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde) in the same buffer. The stomachs were opened along the limiting ridge separating the keratinized forestomach from the glandular stomach. To ascertain the presence of comparable segments in all specimens, small fragments (1–2 mm) from the gastric fundus were prepared with the same distance from this limiting ridge. The fragments were transferred into fresh fixative solution and stored for at least 4 h at 4 °C. For light and transmission electron microscopy, specimens fixed in the presence of glutaraldehyde were washed with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate/HCl (pH 7.3), post-fixed for 90 min in 2% OsO4 buffered in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate/HCl (pH 7.3), and subsequently dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and finally embedded in epoxy resin (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Thick plastic sections (1 μm) were prepared with a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), stained with alkalinized toluidine blue, and observed with a Leitz Orthoplan light microscope (Leica) equipped with a CCD camera (Olympus DP50). Thin sections were collected on Formvar-coated copper slot grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined using a Zeiss EM 10 CR transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Formaldehyde-fixed specimens were dehydrated and embedded as described above but without post-fixation. Semithin sections (1 μm) of these samples were collected on glass slides pretreated with 3-(triethoxysilyl)propylamide (silane; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The sections were etched for 20 min in sodium ethoxide diluted to 50% with absolute ethanol. After washing with PBS, nonspecific protein binding was blocked with the application of 5% BSA diluted in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Incubation with mouse anti-H+/K+-ATPase monoclonal antibody (HK 12.18) diluted 1:2500 in PBS with the addition of 1% BSA was performed overnight at 4 °C in a humid chamber. After thorough rinsing in PBS, the sections were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope attached to an LSM 510 META detector controlled by LSM 5 Image Version 3.2 software (Zeiss). Parietal cells were counted on toluidine blue-stained semithin sections of stomach specimens (three mice per group) using a Leitz Orthoplan light microscope with a ×40 objective lens. Only glands that were sectioned perpendicular to their length axis were evaluated. For better visualization and quantification of tubulovesicular structures and secretory membranes in the electron micrographs, we asked an expert histologist to outline the tubulovesicles in blue and the secretory membranes with apical microvilli in red. We adapted this method from Ref. 17Tamura A. Kikuchi S. Hata M. Katsuno T. Matsui T. Hayashi H. Suzuki Y. Noda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar. Further quantification was not performed. RNA isolation was performed from the glandular stomach epithelia (fundus and corpus) of 7-day-old Kir4.1-deficient mice and their WT littermates, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described by Song et al. (11Song P. Groos S. Riederer B. Feng Z. Krabbenhöft A. Smolka A. Seidler U. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the mRNA expression of KCNQ1 was investigated. Primer sequences were as follows: KCNQ1, 5′-GGAACATAGGGATGGGGAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTCCCTGATGGTCTCTG GA-3′ (reverse). The PCR product length was 151 bp (potassium voltage-gated channel, subfamily Q, member 1, Mouse Genome Database ID NM_008434). Gastric mucosae from 7-day-old Kir4.1-deficient mice and their WT littermates were homogenized with Ultra-Turrax in PBS containing 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0,1% SDS, 20 μg/ml antipain, 4 mm benzamidine, 1 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 40 μg/ml PMSF. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. 10 μg of homogenate was size-fractionated on 10% NuPAGE Novex BisTris gels (Invitrogen) under denaturing conditions, transferred to PVDF membranes (Hybond-P, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween. Blots were probed at 4 °C with mouse anti-H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit monoclonal antibody (clone 2G11, Sigma), diluted 1:4000 and with rabbit anti-β-actin polyclonal antibody (1:15,000; ab8227, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), both diluted 1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The antigen-antibody complexes on the PVDF membranes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection reagents, GE Healthcare), and the image was captured on light-sensitive imaging film (Hyperfilm ECL, GE Healthcare). Bands were detected and digitized by the BioDocAnalyze image station (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany), and the optical density was measured using TotalLab software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, United Kingdom). The ratio H+/K+-ATPase of β-actin was calculated from individual lanes, each representing protein from one single Kir4.1 mouse. All results are expressed as means ± S.E. ΔJH+ refers to stimulated peak responses minus basal levels. Basal values for JH+, Isc, and Rt refer to an average taken over a 30-min base-line period. Data were analyzed by Student's t tests or by one-way analysis of variance with the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Genotype frequencies of Kir4.1 in pups from heterozygous matings exhibited a normal Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1 with no alteration in the percentage of male or female null mutant mice. Kir4.1−/− mice were indistinguishable at birth from their WT littermates but developed progressive growth failure after ∼4–5 days (Table 1), displaying a mortality rate of 100% at day 14. In addition, they developed motor coordination deficits at ∼1 week after birth (18Neusch C. Rozengurt N. Jacobs R.E. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5429-5438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used pups that were 7–8 days of age, at which age both WT and mutant mice had stable basal as well as forskolin-stimulated acid secretory rates that were about one-fourth of those seen in adult mice. Only mice that had milk in the stomach after being killed were used for the experiments because this indicated normal suckling behavior in WT and mutant mice. Most litters contained one to two Kir4.1−/− mice at birth, but most Kir4.1−/− mutants died before day 7. When we genotyped at days 1–2 after birth and reduced litter size by removing some Kir4.1+/+ and Kir4.1+/− mice, then the Kir4.1−/− mice had higher weights and longer survival.TABLE 1Body weights of 7-day-old Kir4.1+/+, Kir4.1+/−, and Kir4.1−/− pupsGenotypeWeightgKir4.1+/+ (n = 23)4.88 ± 0.17Kir4.1+/− (n = 17)4.87 ± 0.19Kir4.1−/− (n = 19)3.46 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab Spontaneous acid secretion was observed at low and not significantly different rates in Kir4.1+/+, Kir4.1+/−, and Kir4.1−/− gastric mucosae. The addition of 10−5 m forskolin resulted in a strong stimulation of acid secretion in all genotypes. Surprisingly, in the first 10 min after forskolin stimulation, the acid secretory rate increased more than twice as fast in Kir4.1−/− mucosa than in Kir4.1+/+ or Kir4.1+/− mucosa (Fig. 1, A and B), with a marked overshoot. At 30 min post-forskolin, the acid secretory rates between Kir4.1+/+ and Kir4.1−/− mucosae had become similar, but the total acid output during the experiment was significantly higher in Kir4.1−/− mucosa (Fig. 1C). No significant differences were observed in the PD, Isc, and Rt of Kir4.1+/+, Kir4.1+/−, and Kir4.1−/− mucosae basally and when the maximal secretory rate had been reached in all genotypes (30 min after stimulation) (Table 2).TABLE 2Electrical parameters for acid secretion experimentsPDIscRtBasal30 min post-forskolinBasal30 min post-forskolinBasal30 min post-forskolinmVμeq·cm−2·h−1ω·cm2Kir4.1+/+ (n = 6)22.59 ± 1.2526.28 ± 1.6910.40 ± 1.0012.28 ± 1.3798.28 ± 5.8982.40 ± 7.39Kir4.1+/− (n = 6)23.39 ± 1.6727.08 ± 2.1910.62 ± 1.0513.70 ± 1.80100.40 ± 7.3594.31 ± 6.70Kir4.1−/− (n = 6)21.39 ± 1.6526.41 ± 2.408.83 ± 0.9111.56 ± 1.21106.07 ± 5.0094.84 ± 5.13 Open table in a new tab In the next set of experiments, acid secretion was measured in the presence of either a high luminal K+ concentration (154 mm KCl) or saline (154 mm NaCl). After 30 min in the respective luminal solution, the tissues were stimulated with forskolin. In WT mucosa, the presence of high luminal K+ resulted in a significant increase in overall acid output (Fig. 2D), but not in a more rapid onset of acid secretion (Fig. 2C). This indicates that luminal K+ is a rate-limiting factor for acid secretory rate in isolated mucosa of 7-day-old WT mice but does not accelerate the speed of onset of secretion. In Kir4.1−/− mucosa, no significant differences were found between high luminal K+ and saline (Fig. 2, C and D). These results suggest that high luminal K+ can mimic high total acid secretory outputs seen in Kir4.1−/− mucosa, but not the rapid onset of acid secretion, the reasons for which must be sought elsewhere. We therefore studied Kir4.1−/− gastric mucosa and its PCs morphologically. The oxyntic mucosal epithelium of 7–8-day-old mice was routinely composed of numerous mucous neck cells, surface cells, chief cells, endocrine cells, and distinctive PCs, which were found along the gland, including the gland base (Fig. 3A), No significant differences in PC number between the WT and Kir4.1-deficient mucosae were observed (Fig. 3B). Laser scanning confocal microscopy of gastric gland sections labeled with antibody against gastric H+/K+-ATPase revealed similar localization of this enzyme in Kir4.1-deficient mice and WT littermates. In suitable section planes, H+/K+-ATPase was routinely observed bordering the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 3C). PC morphology was further studied by electron microscopy. WT PCs showed intracellular canaliculi lined with numerous microvilli. Close to the canaliculi, membranes of the tubulovesicular system were visible in resting state mucosa (Fig. 4, A and B). Occasional PCs that showed the morphologic features of spontaneous secretion were also identified in WT gastric mucosa (Fig. 4, C and D). The ultrastructural morphology of the Kir4.1-deficient PCs appeared different from that of the WT littermates (Fig. 5, A–D). The conspicuous difference was that in the resting state PCs from Kir4.1 KO mice, the microvilli (labeled in red in the large magnifications) of the secretory canaliculi were much more elaborate than those in resting state WT PCs, even though the lumina of the canaliculi were not expanded (Fig. 5, A–D). In addition, tubulovesicular structures (labeled in blue in the large magnifications) near the canaliculi, as seen in the WT PCs, were absent or rare. In summary, Kir4.1-deficient cells displayed fused secretory membranes as fully stimulated cells do but without expansion of the intracanalicular spaces (consistent with the low acid secretory rates found for these unstimulated mucosae) (Fig. 1). For better visualization of the observed differences, tubulovesicular structures are outlined in blue and secretory canaliculi in red in the higher magnification images of all electron micrographs shown. mRNA levels for a number of PC-specific or PC-enriched genes were determined. The results were striking: although H+/K+-ATPase mRNA expression was significantly increased, the expression levels for the apical K+ recycling channels KCNQ1, Kir5.1 (the likely partner for Kir4.1), and basolateral anion exchanger AE2 were not significantly different in Kir4.1-deficient and WT mucosae (Fig. 6). The increase in H+/K+-ATPase mRNA expression could reflect instability of the apical membrane with increased H+/K+-ATPase turnover. We therefore investigated whether it was paralleled by an increase in H+/K+-ATPase protein. We performed Western analysis of total fundus/corpus mucosal protein lysates. At day 7, a Kir4.1−/− sibling was present in only ∼30% of the litters. We were able to analyze a total of four litters, which contained one Kir4.1−/− sibling, one to three Kir4.1+/+ siblings, and various numbers of Kir4.1+/− siblings, which were not included in the analysis. We found a significant increase in the H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit in Kir4.1−/− mucosa (Fig. 7, A and B). This may explain in part the increase in 1-h acid output in the Kir4.1−/− stomachs compared with WT stomachs, whereas the increase in speed of onset of secretion may be explained by the difference in secretory membrane architecture between Kir4.1−/− and WT PCs. The data in this study show that the loss of Kir4.1 channels results in marked changes in the acid secretory pattern in isolated gastric mucosae of young mice, with an up-regulation of H+/K+-ATPase mRNA and protein expression and an exaggerated H+ secretory response to acid secretagogs. In addition, a different ratio of tubulovesicular to secretory membrane structures in the resting state PC was observed, which may point to a defect in tubulovesicle endocytosis. How can the observed changes be reconciled with the absence of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel in PC tubulovesicles and secretory membranes? When colocalization of Kir4.1 with the H+/K+-ATPase in the tubulovesicles as well as the stimulated secretory membranes had been observed (12Fujita A. Horio Y. Higashi K. Mouri T. Hata F. Takeguchi N. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Malinowska D.H. Sherry A.M. Tewari K.P. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol.

Seidler U. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 1058-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we and others believed that Kir4.1 channels may serve to bring K+ to the extracellular K+-binding site of the H+/K+-ATPase during stimulation of acid secretion. In this scenario, the acid secretory rate should be decreased in Kir4.1 KO mucosa. Surprisingly, the lack of Kir4.1 resulted not in a diminished but in a higher acid secretory rate than in WT mucosa. Because increasing the luminal K+ concentration to supraphysiological values also augmented the acid secretory range in WT mucosa (Fig. 2), but not in Kir4.1−/− mucosa, the role of this inwardly rectifying K+ channel may be to provide the balance between rapid K+ loss via KCNQ1/KCNE2 and slower K+ reabsorption by the slow turnover of the H+/K+-ATPase. An electrochemical gradient for such an action may be present in the stimulated secretory membranes, when extracellular K+ concentration is high and apical membrane potential is in the depolarized state. The most striking functional abnormality in Kir4.1-deficient gastric mucosa was the enormously accelerated onset of acid secretion. Early studies suggested that the rate-limiting step in the onset of acid secretion is the fusion of tubulovesicles with the apical membrane (19Forte T.M. Machen T.E. Forte J.G. Gastroenterology. 1977; 73: 941-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Clausen C. Machen T.E. Diamond J.M. Biophys.

The conspicuous abnormality in the ultrastructure of the Kir4.1-deficient PCs was the fully elaborated secretory membrane with concomitant lack of tubulovesicular structures, despite the fact that the cells were functionally in a resting state (as evidenced by very low rates of acid secretion). These findings suggest that Kir4.1 channels may also be essential for the proper membrane recycling events during the recycling of membrane from the secretory canaliculi to the cytoplasmic tubulovesicular location and vice versa. Comparing published ultrastructural abnormalities in other gene-deficient or transgenic mice with those in the Kir4.1−/− PC suggests that it may be the endocytotic recycling step from the secretory membrane that requires Kir channel activity. First, Nguyen et al. (22Nguyen N.V. Gleeson P.A. Courtois-Coutry N. Caplan M.J. Van Driel I.R. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 145-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) described a mouse strain with a mutation in a tyrosine-based endocytosis motif in the H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit. The deletion of this motif prevents H+/K+-ATPase endocytosis and termination of acid secretion (23Courtois-Coutry N. Roush D. Rajendran V. McCarthy J.B. Geibel J. Kashgarian M. Caplan M.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and results in a PC morphology similar to the one seen in Kir4.1−/− mice. Fused secretory membranes with a lack of tubulovesicles are a hallmark of the altered ultrastructure of these PCs (22Nguyen N.V. Gleeson P.A. Courtois-Coutry N. Caplan M.J. Van Driel I.R. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 145-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), similar to what we observed in Kir4.1−/− PCs. Second, Jain et al. (24Jain R.N. Al-Menhali A.A. Keeley T.M. Ren J. El-Zaatari M. Chen X. Merchant J.L. Ross T.S. Chew C.S. Samuelson L.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2459-2470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently described the Hip1r-deficient mouse, which also displayed similar changes in PC ultrastructure compared with Kir4.1−/− mice, with fully elaborated secretory membranes in the absence of an acid secretory agonist and a lack of tubulovesicles. Interestingly, [14C]aminopyrine accumulation as a measure of acid formation in isolated gastric glands was increased in the Hip1r mouse, whereas overall acid output into the lumina of the stomachs of anesthetized mice was decreased. The seemingly paradox situation may be explained by secondary changes in the gastric mucosa, with fundic hyperplasia and a strong increase in the mucous neck all zone, which can result in increased HCO3− secretion, as we have observed in adult KCNQ1-deficient mouse stomach (11Song P. Groos S. Riederer B. Feng Z. Krabbenhöft A. Smolka A. Seidler U. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hip1r is an F-actin- and clathrin-binding protein involved in vesicular trafficking (25Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Warren R.A. Kessels M.M. Keen J.H. Heuser J. Drubin D.G. J.

Azialcohols photolabel Glu-33 and Tyr-418, two residues that are predicted by homology modeling to lie within 2.8 Å of each other at the interface between the Ig1 and Ig4 domains of L1 (Arevalo, E., Shanmugasundararaj, S., Wilkemeyer, M. F., Dou, X., Chen, S., Charness, M. E., and Miller, K. W. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 371–375). Using transient transfection of NIH/3T3 cells with wild type (WT-L1) and mutated L1, we found that cysteine substitution of both residues (E33C/Y418C-L1) significantly increased L1 adhesion above levels observed for WT-L1 or the single cysteine substitutions E33C-L1 or Y418C-L1. The reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (βME) reversibly decreased the adhesion of E33C/Y418C-L1, but had no effect on WT-L1, E33C-L1, or Y418C-L1. Thus, disulfide bond formation occurs between Cys-33 and Cys-418, confirming both the close proximity of these residues and the importance of Ig1-Ig4 interactions in L1 adhesion. Maximal ethanol inhibition of cell adhesion was significantly lower in cells expressing E33C/Y418C-L1 than in those expressing WT-L1, E33C-L1, or Y418C-L1. Moreover, the effects of βME and ethanol on E33C/Y418C-L1 adhesion were non-additive. The cutoff for alcohol inhibition of WT-L1 adhesion was between 1-butanol and 1-pentanol. Increasing the size of the alcohol binding pocket by mutating Glu-33 to Ala-33, increased the alcohol cutoff from 1-butanol to 1-decanol. These findings support the hypothesis that alcohol binding within a pocket bordered by Glu-33 and Tyr-418 inhibits L1 adhesion by disrupting the Ig1-Ig4 interaction. Ethanol may cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in part by inhibiting cell adhesion mediated by the L1 neural cell adhesion molecule. Azialcohols photolabel Glu-33 and Tyr-418, two residues that are predicted by homology modeling to lie within 2.8 Å of each other at the interface between the Ig1 and Ig4 domains of L1 (Arevalo, E., Shanmugasundararaj, S., Wilkemeyer, M.

Using transient transfection of NIH/3T3 cells with wild type (WT-L1) and mutated L1, we found that cysteine substitution of both residues (E33C/Y418C-L1) significantly increased L1 adhesion above levels observed for WT-L1 or the single cysteine substitutions E33C-L1 or Y418C-L1. The reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (βME) reversibly decreased the adhesion of E33C/Y418C-L1, but had no effect on WT-L1, E33C-L1, or Y418C-L1. Thus, disulfide bond formation occurs between Cys-33 and Cys-418, confirming both the close proximity of these residues and the importance of Ig1-Ig4 interactions in L1 adhesion. Maximal ethanol inhibition of cell adhesion was significantly lower in cells expressing E33C/Y418C-L1 than in those expressing WT-L1, E33C-L1, or Y418C-L1. Moreover, the effects of βME and ethanol on E33C/Y418C-L1 adhesion were non-additive. The cutoff for alcohol inhibition of WT-L1 adhesion was between 1-butanol and 1-pentanol. Increasing the size of the alcohol binding pocket by mutating Glu-33 to Ala-33, increased the alcohol cutoff from 1-butanol to 1-decanol. These findings support the hypothesis that alcohol binding within a pocket bordered by Glu-33 and Tyr-418 inhibits L1 adhesion by disrupting the Ig1-Ig4 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2056491202,"Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of pancreatitis, accounting for 30% of acute cases and 70-90% of chronic cases, yet the mechanisms leading to alcohol-associated pancreatic injury are unclear. An early and critical feature of pancreatitis is the aberrant signaling of Ca(2+) within the pancreatic acinar cell. An important conductor of this Ca(2+) is the basolaterally localized, intracellular Ca(2+) channel ryanodine receptor (RYR). In this study, we examined the effect of ethanol on mediating both pathologic intra-acinar protease activation, a precursor to pancreatitis, as well as RYR Ca(2+) signals. We hypothesized that ethanol sensitizes the acinar cell to protease activation by modulating RYR Ca(2+). Acinar cells were freshly isolated from rat, pretreated with ethanol, and stimulated with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (1 μM). Ethanol caused a doubling in the carbachol-induced activation of the proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin (p < 0.02). The RYR inhibitor dantrolene abrogated the enhancement of trypsin and chymotrypsin activity by ethanol (p < 0.005 for both proteases). Further, ethanol accelerated the speed of the apical to basolateral Ca(2+) wave from 9 to 18 μm/s (p < 0.0005; n = 18-22 cells/group); an increase in Ca(2+) wave speed was also observed with a change from physiologic concentrations of carbachol (1 μM) to a supraphysiologic concentration (1 mM) that leads to protease activation. Dantrolene abrogated the ethanol-induced acceleration of wave speed (p < 0.05; n = 10-16 cells/group). Our results suggest that the enhancement of pathologic protease activation by ethanol is dependent on the RYR and that a novel mechanism for this enhancement may involve RYR-mediated acceleration of Ca(2+) waves."
https://openalex.org/W2089004394,"N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are bioactive fatty acid derivatives that occur in all eukaryotes. In plants, NAEs have potent negative growth-regulating properties, and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)-mediated hydrolysis is a primary catabolic pathway that operates during seedling establishment to deplete these compounds. Alternatively, polyunsaturated (PU)-NAEs may serve as substrates for lipid oxidation. In Arabidopsis, PU-NAEs (NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3) were the most abundant NAE species in seeds, and their levels were depleted during seedling growth even in FAAH tDNA knock-out plants. Therefore, we hypothesized that lipoxygenase (LOX) participated in the metabolism of PU-NAEs through the formation of NAE-oxylipins. Comprehensive chromatographic and mass spectrometric methods were developed to identify NAE hydroperoxides and -hydroxides. Recombinant Arabidopsis LOX enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli utilized NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3 as substrates with AtLOX1 and AtLOX5 exhibiting 9-LOX activity and AtLOX2, AtLOX3, AtLOX4, and AtLOX6 showing predominantly 13-LOX activity. Feeding experiments with exogenous PU-NAEs showed they were converted to hydroxide metabolites indicating that indeed Arabidopsis seedlings had the capacity for LOX-mediated metabolism of PU-NAEs in planta. Detectable levels of endogenous NAE-oxylipin metabolites were identified in FAAH fatty acid amide hydrolase seedlings but not in wild-type or FAAH overexpressors, suggesting that NAE hydroxide pools normally do not accumulate unless flux through hydrolysis is substantially reduced. These data suggest that Arabidopsis LOXs indeed compete with FAAH to metabolize PU-NAEs during seedling establishment. Identification of endogenous amide-conjugated oxylipins suggests potential significance of these metabolites in vivo, and FAAH mutants may offer opportunities to address this in the future."

We report that extracts from GPR37-KO mice displayed biochemical alterations of the nigrostriatal signaling pathways mediated by D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors. Null-mutant mice showed an increase of the basal phosphorylation level of the D2-regulated Akt kinase. The basal phosphorylation of the D1-activated ERK2 kinase was not altered, but acute treatments with amphetamine or cocaine failed to produce its specific increase, as detected in samples from wild-type littermates. Furthermore, the chronic administration of cocaine to GPR37-KO mice did not increase the expression of the ΔFosB transcription factor isoforms. Consistently, behavioral analysis showed that null-mutant animals did not respond to the incentive properties of amphetamine or cocaine, in conditioned place preference tests. Thus, the lack of GPR37 affects both ERK2- and Akt-mediated striatal signaling pathways, impairing the biochemical and behavioral responses typically induced by acute and chronic administration of psychostimulant drugs.—Marazziti, D., Di Pietro, C, Mandillo, S., Golini, E., Matteoni, R., and Tocchini-Valentini, G.

https://openalex.org/W1993645278,"In atherogenesis, macrophage-derived apolipoprotein E (apoE) has an athero-protective role by a mechanism that is not fully understood. We investigated the regulatory mechanisms involved in the modulation of apoE expression in macrophages. The experiments showed that the promoters of all genes of the apoE/apoCI/apoCIV/apoCII gene cluster are enhanced by multienhancer 2 (ME.2), a regulatory region that is located 15.9 kb downstream of the apoE gene. ME.2 interacts with the apoE promoter in a macrophage-specific manner. Transient transfections in RAW 264.7 macrophages showed that the activity of ME.2 was strongly decreased by deletion of either 87 bp from the 5' end or 131 bp from the 3' end. We determined that the minimal fragment of this promoter that can be activated by ME.2 is the proximal -100/+73 region. The analysis of the deletion mutants of ME.2 revealed the importance of the 5' end of ME.2 in apoE promoter transactivation. Chromatin conformational capture assays demonstrated that both ME.2 and ME.1 physically interacted with the apoE promoter in macrophages. Our data showed that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced differentiation of macrophages is accompanied by a robust induction of apoE and STAT1 expression. In macrophages (but not in hepatocytes), STAT1 up-regulated apoE gene expression via ME.2. The STAT1 binding site was located in the 174-182 region of ME.2. In conclusion, the specificity of the interactions between the two multienhancers (ME.1 and ME.2) and the apoE promoter indicates that these distal regulatory elements play an important role in the modulation of apoE gene expression in a cell-specific manner."

Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The various FOS proteins appear to serve distinct developmental, physiological, and pathological roles (2Jochum W. Passegué E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 3Wagner E.F. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2010; 69: i86-i88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and current studies are seeking to define these individual roles and the mechanisms involved. FRA-2 exerts a specific action in bone development (4Bozec A. Bakiri L. Hoebertz A. Eferl R. Schilling A.F. Komnenovic V. Scheuch H. Priemel M. Stewart C.L. Amling M. Wagner E.F. Nature. 2008; 454: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and appears to have selective physiological and pathological roles in diverse processes, including photoperiodic regulation (5Engel L. Gupta B.B. Lorenzkowski V. Heinrich B. Schwerdtle I. Gerhold S. Holthues H. Vollrath L. Spessert R. Neuroscience. 2005; 132: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), some cancers (6Carro M.S. Lim W.K. Alvarez M.J. Bollo R.J. Zhao X. Snyder E.Y. Sulman E.P. Anne S.L. Doetsch F. Colman H.

This accumulated evidence of functional specialization indicates that mechanisms confer specificity to the actions of the FRA-2 TF relative to other members of the FOS/JUN group.One aspect of this selectivity that remains to be fully characterized is selective genomic targeting by FRA-2. Selection at the level of cis-sequence specificity is clearly one aspect of this targeting; numerous studies established that different combinations of FOS and JUN proteins (28 dimeric combinations in total) have different binding affinities for activator protein-1 (AP-1) and cAMP-response element (CRE) sequences (8Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 9Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar). A study using tethered protein dimers (10Bakiri L. Matsuo K. Wisniewska M. Wagner E.F. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4952-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) showed that whereas the c-FOS/c-JUN dimer interacts exclusively with AP-1-like sequences (core consensus, tga(g/c)tca), other dimers, including FRA-2/c-JUN, are less selective and also bind CRE elements (core consensus, tgacgtca). However, it is also apparent that there are other levels of selection because about one-third of vertebrate promoters contain consensus AP-1 family sites (AP-1F; MatInspector, Genomatix), but not all these genes are regulated by AP-1 (11Zhou H. Zarubin T. Ji Z. Min Z. Zhu W. Downey J.S. Lin S. Han J. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).FRA-2, like FRA-1, differs from FOS and FOSB in lacking a potent C-terminal transactivation domain (12Suzuki T. Okuno H. Yoshida T. Endo T. Nishina H. Iba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5537-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As may be predicted from this structural difference, FRA-2 can act to suppress transcription, for example at promoters induced by c-JUN homodimers (12Suzuki T. Okuno H. Yoshida T. Endo T. Nishina H. Iba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5537-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, in heterodimeric combination with JUND, FRA-2 can enhance transcription relative to JUND homodimers (12Suzuki T. Okuno H. Yoshida T. Endo T. Nishina H. Iba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5537-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These findings exemplify the varied actions of FRA-2 and underline the critical role that AP-1 protein composition plays in transactivation potential (13Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The role of FRA-2 has been studied using a unique transgenic animal model in which FRA-2 function is perturbed in a tissue-selective manner using a dominant negative (C-terminally truncated) genetic construct (DN-FRA-2 (14Smith M. Burke Z. Humphries A. Wells T. Klein D. Carter D. Baler R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)). In this model, DN-FRA-2 is stably expressed in transgenic rats under the control of a conditional promoter (Aanat (15Baler R. Covington S. Klein D.C. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 699-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Burke Z. Wells T. Carter D. Klein D. Baler R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) that confers cellularly (pinealocyte) and temporally (nocturnal) specific expression to the pineal gland. DN-FRA-2 binds DNA normally, but because it is unable to transactivate target genes, it competes with endogenous FRA-2 for target sites and thereby inhibits endogenous FRA-2 activity. In addition, it has been shown that this construct also knocks down expression of endogenous Fra-2 via competition of autoregulatory feedback (14Smith M. Burke Z. Humphries A. Wells T. Klein D. Carter D. Baler R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The conditional nature of this transgenic model is of notable importance because it allows examination of the role of FRA-2 throughout life under physiological conditions. In contrast, the study of FRA-2 function in conventional knock-out animal models is limited by neonatal lethality of Fra-2 null alleles (17Zenz R. Wagner E.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The model is also able to reveal true physiological roles of FRA-2 because the pineal gland has an endogenous rhythm of gene expression (linked to rhythms of hormone production) that is regulated by FRA-2 (14Smith M. Burke Z. Humphries A. Wells T. Klein D. Carter D. Baler R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Humphries A. Weller J. Klein D. Baler R. Carter D.A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); when induced in this animal model, DN-FRA-2 therefore intervenes in an autonomous physiological response. Accordingly, this model is superior to experimental paradigms where gene expression is artificially induced.In previous studies with the DN-FRA-2 model, we have shown that FRA-2 mediates both positive and negative transcriptional regulation of genes (14Smith M. Burke Z. Humphries A. Wells T. Klein D. Carter D. Baler R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These opposite modes of regulation by FRA-2 are intriguing because studies have shown that the nocturnal AP-1 binding complex in the rat pineal gland is largely composed of FRA-2/JUND that is inconsistent, prima facie, with multiple modes of regulation (14Smith M. Burke Z. Humphries A. Wells T. Klein D. Carter D. Baler R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). FRA-2 phosphorylation in the nocturnal pineal gland is also progressive and homogeneous (14Smith M. Burke Z. Humphries A. Wells T. Klein D. Carter D. Baler R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), arguing against a role for different protein isoforms underlying differential regulation. We therefore hypothesize that differential regulation of target gene expression is mediated at the level of a cis-acting sequence. To pursue this, we have now sought to explain the complexity of gene regulation by FRA-2 through further analysis using transcriptome-scale expression profiling. This strategy was adopted to obtain a dataset of FRA-2-regulated genes for bioinformatic analysis of cis-regulatory sequences. The results of these studies provide insight into selective genomic targeting of FRA-2 and reveal discordance between predicted and real targets.RESULTSExpression profiling with the Affymetrix 230A rat genome microarray (15866 probe sets) demonstrated that a large number of gene transcripts are dysregulated in the DN-FRA-2 rat model. The full set of (predicted) FRA-2 targets are listed in supplemental Table S2, and a subset of Northern blot-validated targets are listed in Table 1. Representative Northern blots are shown in Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1. Our (statistically verified) validation procedure also involved Northern blot analysis of five nonregulated transcripts (Table 1) and confirmed the microarray/GeneSpring-based prediction of FRA-2 targets. These targets (supplemental Table S2) include proteins of diverse molecular function and biological process, with cellular locations from plasma membrane to nucleus. ModuleMiner analysis confirmed that no Gene Ontology terms are over-represented in the FRA-2-regulated gene set; therefore FRA-2 does not appear to be associated with one particular aspect of cellular function. To gain an understanding of the general molecular mechanisms used by FRA-2, we next conducted bioinformatic analysis of validated target genes.In Silico Analysis of Candidate Gene PromotersFRA-2 actions may be either direct or indirect, i.e. involve intermediating TFs that themselves directly target gene promoters. One potential intermediary factor (CREM/ICER (31Stehle J.H. Foulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simonneaux V. Pévet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 365: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar)) is not regulated in the DN-FRA-2 model (Table 1); however, by using in silico analysis, we sought to obtain positive evidence of conserved sequences that could mediate direct genomic actions of FRA-2.Large scale (−10,000 bp from TSS) regulatory module homology analysis (ModuleMiner (27Van Loo P. Aerts S. Thienpont B. De Moor B. Moreau Y. Marynen P. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) showed that AP-1 elements were over-represented in the regulated group of genes versus validated nonregulated genes (Table 2). Further division of the regulated genes into positively and negatively regulated subgroups generated an additional interesting finding, namely that only repressed genes exhibited an enrichment of AP-1 sites. This finding might indicate that some (positively regulated) genes may be indirectly regulated.TABLE 2Analysis of cis-regulatory module conservation in FRA-2-regulated gene setsGene setIndividual PWM (top 5)PWM weightTop PWM groupaTOP PWM GROUP is a ModuleMiner output that provides a summed score for the most represented PWM group.Top PWM group weightAll FRA-2 regulated genesV$AP1_Q2_011.08V$AP1_01VĊX_Q50.869V$AP1_Q2_01V$NFY_Q6_010.659V$AP1_Q4_011.76V$ALPHACP1_010.591V$BACH2_01V$AP1_010.382FRA-2 repressed genesV$AP1_010.955V$ALPHACP1_010.855V$AP1_01V$LEF1_Q20.765V$AP1_Q6_011.87V$AP1_Q6_010.735V$AP1_Q6V$PAX4_030.55FRA-2 enhanced genesVĀEF2_Q60.97RUSH1-a0.776V$AP4_010.699VĀEF2_Q60.97V$NFY_Q6_010.563V$ALPHACP1_010.514FRA-2-nonregulated genesV$ER_Q6_020.955V$NFY_Q6_01Arnt-Ahr0.605NF-YV$KROX_Q60.594V$NFY_010.988V$AP2_Q60.409V$NFY_Q6V$NFY_010.295a TOP PWM GROUP is a ModuleMiner output that provides a summed score for the most represented PWM group. Open table in a new tab However, analysis of the validated genes employing a more proximal (−2000 to +100) sequence and MatInspector, which distinguishes different classes of AP-1 sites, delivered a less clear outcome (Table 3). We found the following: (i) the presence of AP-1 family (AP-1F, Fig. 1C) and CRE sequences in the majority (but not all) of both FRA-2-regulated and nonregulated genes; (ii) no obvious distinction in the distribution of these sites between FRA-2-regulated and nonregulated genes; (iii) no clear distinction in the distribution of these sites between FRA-2-positively and -negatively regulated genes. At the same time, MatInspector analysis revealed the presence of some interesting alternative sites in the regulated genes set; the most common (8 of 9 genes) AP-1 sites were of the AP-1-related (AP-1R, Fig. 1C) matrix family. This was of interest because this family of elements includes the sequence tgcgtca (the highly conserved AP-1F “A” at position 3 is substituted by a “C”, Fig. 1C) that is present in the FRA-2-regulated Nr4a1 gene and binds FRA-2 (18Humphries A. Weller J. Klein D. Baler R. Carter D.A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The tgcgtca sequence (present in Nr4a1, FRA-2, and Rgs4) includes, on the reverse DNA strand, a CRE half-site which, in some sequence contexts, can bind CREB with high affinity (32Flammer J.R. Popova K.N. Pflum M.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9615-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In Rgs4, this CRE site has been predicted to be a functional CRE (CRE-TATA module) as defined by whole genome bioinformatics and ChIP-Chip analysis (33Conkright M.D. Guzmán E. Flechner L. Su A.I.

The potential role of this AP-1R site in mediating the effects of FRA-2 was therefore addressed in further extensive studies of Rgs4, which is robustly expressed in the pineal gland as a single transcript of ∼3 kb (Fig. 1A).TABLE 3Search for AP1/CRE elements in FRA-2-regulated and nonregulated genesGenesAP1F elements relative to CREBach2.01 elements relative to CREtgcgtca sequenceValidated FRA-2 regulated genes (repressed)Atf-4Four up and down of eight CREtwo up and down of eight CRE0Cox6a2Two up of one CRENone0Dio2One up and down of five CRETwo up of one CRE0Nr4a1No AP1F, six CREFour down and over six CRE4Rgs4Three up and down of four CRETwo down and over two CRE1Validated FRA-2 regulated genes (enhanced)Cd24Two up of three CREOne up and down of three CRE0Fra2(Fosl2)NoneTwo down and over six CRE2Mt1aOne up and down of five CRETwo up of one CRE0Opn1swNoneOne upstream of three CRE0Validated FRA-2 nonregulated genesAanatOne up and down of five CRENone0DbpNoneOne down of two CRE0E4bp4 (Nfil3)One up and down of two CRENone0Crem (ICER)Two up and down of four CREOne down of four CRE0Id1Three up and down of six CREFour up and down of six CRE0Per2Three up & down of 5 CREOne up & down of 5 CRE0Syt4NoneThree up and down of eight CRE0 Open table in a new tab Rgs4 as a Model FRA-2-regulated GeneThe Rgs4 AP-1R site, which starts at position −155 (relative to TSS in rat, Fig. 1D), is 100% conserved across rat, mouse, and human genomic sequences and is generally highly conserved in mammalian species and many higher vertebrate species (supplemental Fig. S2). Furthermore, this is the only AP-1R element in the rat Rgs4 genomic locus between −5 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence to +5kb of the 3′-flanking sequence (chromosome 13, 85,533,882–85,540,173; Ensembl rat genome build Feb. 2006). No other AP-1 or CRE elements were found to be positionally conserved (in rat, mouse, and human) across this region. A consensus AP-1F (tgactca) sequence in the rat 5′-flanking sequence at position −415 is conserved neither in mouse, human (no AP-1F elements in −1500 to +100 region, MatInspector), nor other mammals. The −155AP-1R site of the rat Rgs4 promoter is therefore a promising candidate sequence for mediating the regulatory action of FRA-2.Ex Vivo ChIP Analysis of Rgs4 Promoter OccupancyTo confirm that FRA-2 regulation of Rgs4 is associated with a direct interaction of FRA-2 with the rat Rgs4 genomic locus, we next conducted ChIP analysis on rat pineal gland chromatin, targeting a region of the Rgs4 promoter that contains the AP-1R element discussed above. Using this approach, we found a specific enrichment of proximal Rgs4 promoter sequence following chromatin immunoprecipitation with a FRA-2 antiserum as compared with a control (FRA-2) preimmune serum (Fig. 2). Control ChIP assays also showed relative enrichment of both this Rgs4 sequence and a β-actin sequence when using a RNA polymerase II antiserum (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Association of FRA-2 with Rgs4 promoter sequence in vivo. ChIP assays were conducted using chromatin extracted from rat pineal glands; gene promoter sequences were amplified by PCR and visualized by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels.

These experiments were designed to independently test the function of both the −155 AP-1R and the −415 AP-1F sequences. PC12 cells were selected for this analysis because it is a rat cell line that expresses Rgs4 (30Pepperl D.J. Shah-Basu S. VanLeeuwen D. Granneman J.G. MacKenzie R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cytotechnology. 2005; 47: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The nuclear environment in these cells therefore has characteristics of the nocturnal rat pineal gland in which both FRA-2 and p-CREB activity are strongly induced (14Smith M. Burke Z. Humphries A.

Mutation of the −155 tgcgtca sequence significantly enhanced expression compared with the wild type sequence (Fig. 3A; p < 0.05, ANOVA and Duncan's post hoc test; F = 31.294, df = 31). The longer (−426) construct was not associated with an altered expression level compared with the −167 wild-type construct, and mutation of the −415 tgactca sequence did not affect expression (Fig. 3A). Our finding that the AP-1R sequence appeared to mediate transcriptional suppression in the basal state was initially surprising, but Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) revealed high levels of FRA-2 in the PC12 cell cultures used for transfection studies.FIGURE 3Functional analysis of Rgs4 promoter activity in transfected cells. Rgs4 constructs cloned into pGL4.11 were transfected into PC12 cells. Levels of expression were determined by luciferase (Luc) assays and corrected against a co-transfected Renilla luciferase construct. A, expression levels (luciferase activity) of the different constructs relative to empty pGL4.11 (mean ± S.E., n = 8; *, p < 0.05 versus all other groups, ANOVA and post hoc test).

EMSA of interactions between an oligonucleotide probe containing the rat Rgs4 tgcgtca sequence and pineal gland nuclear protein revealed a sequence-specific interaction (Fig. 4). We discovered that two major shifted bands were observed in the presence of pineal protein extracts, and only one of these bands was found with extracts of brain cortex (Fig. 4A). Comparison of multiple pineal extracts obtained at either 12.00 or 24.00 h revealed a 3–4-fold increase in protein binding to the probe at night (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Protein composition and specificity of DNA binding activity at the Rgs4 AP-1R sequence in vitro. Representative chemiluminescent images of EMSAs showing bands of biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probe shifted in the presence of nuclear protein extracts (1.2 μg) from either pineal gland (P) or brain cortex (Cx). A, note that two shifted bands (upper and lower arrows) are observed in the pineal gland, whereas only the equivalent upper band is observed in the cortex together with two additional slower migrating bands (arrowheads). Note that both EMSA bands are more abundant in pineal samples extracted at 12.00 versus 24.00 h. Unbound (free) probe is indicated at the gel base. B, summated results of multiple EMSAs comparing the abundance of the upper and lower shifted bands in pineal glands sampled at either 12.00 and 24.00 h. Values are fold-difference compared with the level at 12.00 h (mean ± S.E., n = 6, *, p < 0.05 versus equivalent 12.00-h group, paired Student's t test). C, expanded image of shifted bands (only) showing the effect of different antisera on the abundance of pineal EMSA bands. Two different FRA-2 and two different CREB-1 antisera were compared, and a rabbit IgG was used in the Control lane. Note that the lower EMSA band is completely abrogated by both FRA-2 antibodies, whereas both EMSA bands are diminished by the two CREB-1 antibodies; the CREB-9197 (9197, Cell Signaling Technology) antibody is somewhat more effective in abrogating the bands compared with CREB-1–186 (sc186, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) antibody. Unbound probe is not shown. D and E, comparison of the effects of CREB-1 and phospho-CREB antisera on the abundance of EMSA bands observed in pineal glands sampled at either 12.00 or 24.00 h. Note that 24.00-h protein extracts were diluted 2-fold to equalize the intensity of binding activity relative to the 12.00-h samples. Expanded images of shifted bands (only) are shown in D, and summated results of multiple EMSAs are shown in E. Note that the CREB-1 antibody (sc186) diminishes the pineal EMSA bands to a similar extent in both groups, whereas the p-CREB antibody (9197, Cell Signaling Technology) significantly diminishes only the 24.00-h group. Histogram values are fold-difference compared with the control (IgG) level (mean ± S.E., n = 4; *, p < 0.05 versus equivalent control group (IgG), paired Student's t test). F and G, comparison of the effects of either unlabeled wild-type Rgs4 AP-1R probe (Rgs4; 4-, 8-, or 16-fold molar excess) with unlabeled mutant Rgs4 AP-1R probe (mutRgs4, similar molar excess) on the abundance of pineal EMSA bands. Expanded images of shifted bands (only) are shown in F, and summated results of multiple EMSAs are shown in G. Note that the unlabeled wild-type probe significantly competes with the labeled probe at all molar concentrations whereas the mutant probe competes significantly only at 16-fold molar excess. Histogram values are fold-difference compared with the control (No competitor, 1st bar in each group; mean ± S.E., n = 3; *, p < 0.05 versus no competitor, ANOVA, and post hoc test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Pineal proteins interacting with the EMSA probe were shown to include both FRA-2 and CREB based on abrogation in the presence of antisera (Fig. 4C). Complete abrogation of the lower band with FRA-2 antibodies indicated that this band was wholly composed of FRA-2-containing complexes. In contrast, the diminution of both bands in the presence of CREB antisera indicated that CREB was a constituent of both shifted bands. Because FRA-2 is apparently restricted to the lower band, this"

The pneumococcal pilus is composed of three proteins, RrgA, RrgB, and RrgC, each stabilized by intramolecular isopeptide bonds and covalently polymerized by means of intermolecular isopeptide bonds to form an extended fiber. RrgB is the pilus scaffold subunit and is protective in vivo in mouse models of sepsis and pneumonia, thus representing a potential vaccine candidate. The crystal structure of a major RrgB C-terminal portion featured an organization into three independently folded protein domains (D2-D4), whereas the N-terminal D1 domain (D1) remained unsolved. We have tested the four single recombinant RrgB domains in active and passive immunization studies and show that D1 is the most effective, providing a level of protection comparable with that of the full-length protein. To elucidate the structural features of D1, we solved the solution structure of the recombinant domain by NMR spectroscopy. The spectra analysis revealed that D1 has many flexible regions, does not contain any intramolecular isopeptide bond, and shares with the other domains an Ig-like fold. In addition, we demonstrated, by site-directed mutagenesis and complementation in S. pneumoniae, that the D1 domain contains the Lys residue (Lys-183) involved in the formation of the intermolecular isopeptide bonds and pilus polymerization. Finally, we present a model of the RrgB protein architecture along with the mapping of two surface-exposed linear epitopes recognized by protective antisera."
https://openalex.org/W2115969126,"We previously described a non-classical mechanism that arrests FcγRIIa signaling in human neutrophils once engaged by immune complexes or opsonized pathogens. The engagement of FcγRIIa leads to its ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and degradation by the proteasome. Herein, we further examined some of the events regulating this novel pathway. The adaptor protein CIN85 was described in other systems to be involved in the regulation of the c-Cbl-dependent pathway. We found that CIN85 is expressed in human neutrophils and that it translocates like c-Cbl from the cytosol to the plasma membrane following receptor cross-linking. CIN85 was also recruited to the same subset of high density detergent-resistant membrane fractions in which stimulated FcγRIIa partitioned with c-Cbl. The integrity of these microdomains is essential to the FcγRIIa degradation process because the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin inhibits this event. Silencing the expression of CIN85 by siRNA in dibutyryl cyclic AMP-differentiated PLB 985 cells prevented FcγRIIa degradation and increased IgG-mediated phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy revealed that the presence of CIN85 is essential to the proper sorting of FcγRIIa during endocytosis. We also provide direct evidence that CIN85 is a substrate of serine/threonine kinase PKCs. Classical PKCs positively regulate FcγRIIa ubiquitination and degradation because these events were inhibited by Gö6976, a classical PKC inhibitor. We conclude that the ubiquitination and degradation of stimulated FcγRIIa mediated by c-Cbl are positively regulated by the adaptor protein CIN85 in a PKC-dependent manner and that these events contribute to the termination of FcγRIIa signaling."

Candida albicans typically resides as a commensal in the human gastrointestinal tract but becomes an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised hosts. Infections can spread by invasive colonization of host organs and vascular dissemination (1Odds F.C. Candida and Candidosis. 2nd ed. Bailliere Tindall, London1988: 206-228Google Scholar). Adaptation to each host organ may require changes in phenotype that are triggered by specific host environmental cues. For example, white to opaque cell type switching has been observed at some sites of infection (2Kvaal C. Lachke S.A. Srikantha T. Daniels K. McCoy J. Soll D.R. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6652-6662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Soll D.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 5: 183-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Opaque phase cells, although vulnerable to host defenses, are necessary for efficient mating in C. albicans (4Miller M.G. Johnson A.D. Cell. 2002; 110: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). However, suppression of this switching during vascular dissemination may help C. albicans elude host defenses. HBR1 (hemoglobin response gene 1) is a gene that represses white opaque switching and may play a key role to understanding C. albicans survival in a host. HBR1 was identified based on its differential induction in cells cultured with hemoglobin and discovered to positively regulate MTLα genes (5Pendrak M.L. Yan S.S. Roberts D.D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MTLα genes, in turn, control white opaque switching (4Miller M.G. Johnson A.D. Cell. 2002; 110: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). HBR1 shows haplo-insufficiency for MTLα gene expression, indicating sensitivity of the MTL signaling pathway to levels of Hbr1p (5Pendrak M.L. Yan S.S. Roberts D.D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HBR1 is an essential gene in C. albicans (5Pendrak M.L. Yan S.S. Roberts D.D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but its function in mating is not sufficient to explain its requirement during vegetative growth. In fact, the mating genes in C. albicans are not essential for viability (6Hull C.M. Raisner R.M. Johnson A.D. Science. 2000; 289: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 7Magee B.B. Magee P.T. Science. 2000; 289: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), suggesting that Hbr1p plays additional roles in vegetative growth regulation. HBR1 gene expression is maximal during early exponential growth, attenuated during the diauxic transition, and weak in the stationary phase (5Pendrak M.L. Yan S.S. Roberts D.D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hbr1p may serve a regulatory role at the level of protein-protein interactions. The yeast ortholog Fap7 is also an essential gene (8Juhnke H. Charizanis C. Latifi F. Krems B. Entian K.D. Mol.

Despite major similarities, the primary amino acid sequence of Hbr1p differs in two aspects from these potential orthologs: (i) a 9-amino acid insertion between the P-loop and predicted NMP-binding domain and (ii) a highly negatively charged carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). We examine here the nucleotide binding specificity and potential enzymatic activities of Hbr1p. We also report effects of site-directed mutations in the P-loop on ligand binding to Hbr1p and functional effects of Hbr1 on MTL gene expression. Thrombin-His6-tagged versions of Hbr1p were constructed in two steps. A clone containing the entire HBR1 open reading frame (5Pendrak M.L. Yan S.S. Roberts D.D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 764-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using PFX polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following primers (5′ to 3′): GGTACCTATGACAACCATGTCCAAG to introduce a KpnI cloning site at the 5′ end of the gene and a 3′ primer containing coding sequences for a thrombin cleavage site followed by a His6 tag sequence TAATGGTGATGGTGATGATGACCAGCAGCAGAACCTCTAGGAACCAATTGTGCAATATCTTCTGTATGC (1.65 kDa). The purified PCR fragment was cloned into pCR4-Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's standard protocol to generate plasmid pR1-THis. Second, the sequence cloned in pR1-THis was changed to standard codon usage by converting the leucine CUG codon at position 27 to one that would encode serine in standard usage, CCT (22Santos M.A. Tuite M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Primers GGAAATCATCTCATTCCTCATGTTTAGTTTCTCAACTC and GAGTTGAGAAACTAAACTAGAGGAATGAGATGATTTCC were used with the QuikChange II XL system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate a codon-corrected version of the tagged HBR1 gene in plasmid pR1-THis-ls. Three additional mutations were introduced into pR1-THis-ls. The first single amino acid mutant G19S (Fig. 1B) occurs in a consensus region of the P-loop in Hbr1p orthologs (5Pendrak M.L. Yan S.S.

A third mutant K66R occurs at a predicted small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) acceptor site. The primer sequences (5′ to 3′) and the modification sites are as follows: G19S, CAGGTACACCTAGTTGTGGGAAATCATCTC and GAGATGATTTCCCACAACTAGGTGTACCTG; K22Q, CACCTGGGTGTGGGCAATCATCTCATTCCC and GGGAATGAGATGATTGCCCACACCCAGGTG; and SUMO, GATGCCAGGTTAGATACTTCGATTGTAGACG and CGTCTACAATCGAAGTATCTAACCTGGCATC. Protein expression vectors were constructed by releasing the tagged and modified sequences using KpnI and EcoRI and cloning into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) cut at the same sites to create plasmids pYES-R1-THis-G19S, pYES-R1-THis-K22Q, and pYES-R1-THis-K66Q. All of the gene modifications were verified by sequence analysis. Vectors for expression of mutated HBR1 genes were generated by amplifying the HBR1 gene with Platinum PFX DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using primers CACCATGACAACCATGTCAAGAAGATATACACC and GAGCTGCAGGCTATTGTGCAATATCTTCTG to directionally clone into vector pENTR/d-TOPO (Invitrogen). The mutations were carried out by site-directed mutagenesis using the primers described above to generate G19S and K22Q mutations in the HBR1 gene. All of the gene modifications were verified by sequence analysis. A Gateway destination vector (Invitrogen) was constructed in plasmid pCaEXP-RFA by blunt end cloning of reading frame cassette A (Invitrogen) into the blunted BamHI site of pCaEXP (24Care R.S. Trevethick J. Binley K.M. Sudbery P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) that had been partially digested with NdeI to release the RP10 gene. The RF cassette was sequenced to obtain a clone of the correct orientation that placed the attR1 lambda recombination site nearest the 3′ end of the MET3 promoter. The HBR1 wild type (WT) and mutated genes were transferred to pCaEXP-RFA using LR Clonase following the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Selected constructs were sequenced to ensure that no mutations had occurred during manipulations and then introduced into the genome of C. albicans strain BWP17 (25Wilson R.B. Davis D. Mitchell A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by digesting at the unique ClaI site in the HBR1 gene and transformation by the lithium acetate method. Ura+ colonies were selected for PCR analysis to ensure correct incorporation of the gene into the BWP17 genome. The presence of the integrated construct was confirmed using primers PN52 in the MET3 promoter (CAAGTATACGTAATCTCCCC) and PN55 in the HBR1 gene (CCTGCAGATATCTGTCAGGAATATAGCTGTC) located 60 bases 3′ of the ClaI site (data not shown). Transformation and protein expression followed standard protocols (26Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.

Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and the manufacturer's instructions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae InvSC1 cells (Invitrogen) transformed with pYES-R1-THis-HBR1 were cultured at 30 °C and grown to OD650 nm ≅ 4.0 in 2% glucose YNB −URA medium (26Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991: 3-21Google Scholar). The cells were then washed and reinoculated to OD650 nm = 0.4 in 2% galactose YNB −URA medium, and protein expression was induced for 20–24 h (OD650 nm ≅ 2.0). The cells were centrifuged, and the protein extract was generated by cell lysis with 0.5-mm glass beads (29Dunn B. Wobbe C.R. Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. Chapter 13 Unit. 1992; 13: 11-19Google Scholar) (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) in extraction buffer that contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH), 10 μm leupeptin, 20 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm E-64 (Sigma). Hbr1p was purified from cell extracts by performing two sequential nickel affinity purification columns (2× nickel) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The optimized imidazole elution concentration for His-tagged Hbr1p was determined to be 150 mm. After the first purification, the Hbr1p sample was either dialyzed or diluted to 15 mm imidazole buffer and reapplied to the nickel column. After the second purification, the Hbr1p sample was dialyzed with a 12,000 molecular weight cutoff membrane (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) in dialysis buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. For specified assays, Hbr1p was affinity-purified with cobalt, copper, or zinc substituting for nickel as described. Protein extracts were prepared in LDS sample buffer containing 50 mm DTT and heated to 95 °C before sample loading. Electrophoresis of protein samples in 12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels was performed in 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed according to a general protocol for semidry systems (30Adams L.D. Gallagher S.R. Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. Chapter 10 Unit. 2004; 14: 11-23Google Scholar). For anti-His Western blots, 1:1500 primary (Amersham Biosciences) and 1:5000 goat anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) dilutions were used. For anti-peptide Western blots, 1:1000 primary (αP1, P2, or P3) and 1:5000 goat anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody (KPL) dilutions were used. Reacting secondary antibodies were detected by SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Rabbit antisera recognizing three peptide sequences of Hbr1p were prepared by immunizing rabbits with the following sequences cross-linked to BSA using glutaraldehyde: P1, 160LRSDTAEEMDENVDR174; P2, 21GKSSHSLSLVSQLNQ35; and P3, 118LFDRLKTRNYNDL130. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (30Adams L.D. Gallagher S.R. Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. Chapter 10 Unit. 2004; 14: 11-23Google Scholar) was performed using 2× nickel affinity-purified Hbr1p. Discrete protein bands were excised and digested using trypsin, and standard LC/MS preparation, procedure, and analysis were performed (31Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Current Protoc. Protein. Sci. Chapter 11 Unit. 2004; 13: 1-10Google Scholar, 32Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D. Current. Protoc. Protein. Sci. Chapter 16 Unit. 2000; 10: 11-19Google Scholar) using a S. cerevisiae database containing the C. albicans Hbr1p sequence. Ion exchange chromatography was performed according to a general protocol (33Williams A. Frasca V. Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. Chapter 10 Unit. 1998; 10: 11-30Google Scholar). 2× nickel affinity-purified Hbr1p samples were diluted to [NaCl] of ≤50 mm and applied to DEAE fast flow Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). The columns were rinsed and equilibrated with 10 mm NaCl in one of the following buffers: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 50 mm phosphate, pH 6.0; 50 mm histidine, pH 5.0; and 50 mm acetate, pH 4.0. Step (100 mm NaCl/step) or continuous NaCl gradients (10 mm to 1 m NaCl) were used for ion exchange elution. Eluted fractions were collected and monitored by gel electrophoresis with either R-250 stain or anti-His Western blotting. 2× nickel affinity-purified Hbr1p was incubated with a thrombin-agarose resin for 2 h according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Cleaved Hbr1p was recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation and verified by gel electrophoresis with R-250 staining. Generally, the assays were performed with the His tag intact because the presence of the tag did not influence the activity. Hbr1p was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (34Begg G.E. Harper S.L. Speicher D.W. Current Protoc. Protein. Sci. Chapter 7 Unit. 1999; 10: 11-15Google Scholar). A 250-μl sample of 2× nickel affinity-purified Hbr1p (between 10 and 25 μm) was loaded into a liquid chromatography work station (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) that controlled a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl, and with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Sample elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad) were used to calibrate the column. For renatured Hbr1p, a 2× nickel affinity purification was performed in 8 m urea. A ∼20 μm WT Hbr1p sample was loaded into the column as above and renatured by exchanging with buffer on the column. Binding and elution of Hbr1p to ATP immobilized on a polyacrylamide resin (ATP-Binders Resin; Novagen, San Diego, CA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications. 2× nickel affinity-purified Hbr1p samples containing ∼10 μm each of WT and mutant protein (G19S, K22Q, and K66R) were incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C with a pretreated ATP resin. After Hbr1p incubation, the ATP resin was washed with buffer containing three potential ATP competitors: ADP, AMP, and NADH. The resin elution was performed using three fractions containing ATP. Each eluted fraction represented three column volumes of 20 mm ATP buffer incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Western blotting with anti-His antibody was used to visualize Hbr1p in the washed and eluted fractions. ImageQuant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to quantify Western blot band intensities. The experiments were performed in duplicate for Hbr1p mutants and triplicate for WT Hbr1p. Dialysis was carried out in paired 100 μl of volume dialysis chambers fitted with 3500 molecular weight cutoff membranes (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc.) and equilibrated with dialysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). One side of the dialysis membrane contained 100 μl of 10 μm Hbr1p (WT, G19S, K22Q, or K66R). Both sides of dialysis membrane contained varying concentrations (0–300 μm) of nonradioactive ATPγS (Roche Applied Science) and fixed concentrations of trace radiolabeled [γ-35S]ATP (≤0.625 nm) (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). The chambers were equilibrated at room temperature by rotation mixing for 48 h, and the radioactivity in each chamber was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Each assay was performed and counted in triplicate. 10 μm Hbr1p (WT, G19S, K22Q, and K66R) samples were incubated in dialysis buffer (above) with a fixed amount of trace radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP (≤1 nm) (MP Biomedicals) and varied concentrations of nonradioactive ATP (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. Bound Hbr1p was centrifuged through a micro-Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences), and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The samples were prepared in triplicate and counted in duplicate. The raw data (counts/min versus [ATPγS]added) represent the amount of [γ-35S]ATP bound to Hbr1p. Assuming that the ligands [γ-35S]ATP and ATPγS bind with equal affinity to Hbr1p, the fraction of [γ-35S]ATP bound equals the fraction of ATPγS bound. Because the fraction of nonlabeled ATPγS added is known, we calculated the concentration of bound ATPγS and free ATPγS. In this format, bound versus free, the data were fit to a single site homogenous equilibrium-binding isotherm. The equilibrium dissociation constant and maximum bound concentrations are fitted variables. The fit parameter for maximum bound concentration of [Hbr1p:ATPγS] varied from 7.5 to 9.4 μm, which is in good agreement with the known concentration of 10 μm Hbr1p measured by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Treatment of the data for equilibrium filtration was the same as above except that the ligands used were [γ-32P]ATP and ATP. The fit parameter for maximum bound concentration of [Hbr1p: ATP] varied from 0.5 to 1.2 μm, which is below the measured concentration of Hbr1p (10 μm). This may indicate that a large (∼90%) fraction of Hbr1p remains on the G-50 column. The analysis relied on the assumption that the fraction of eluted Hbr1p represented the equilibrium before the filtration. The error in fitting these data is larger than for equilibrium dialysis but still appears to fit well to a single site homogenous model. 5 μm samples of Hbr1p (WT, G19S, K22Q, and K66R) were each incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 0.25 μm tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Cooper Biomedical, Malvern, PA) in dialysis buffer either alone or with 20 mm ATP. For nucleotide comparison, WT Hbr1p was used as above with incubation buffers containing 20 mm each of the nucleotides ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, or dATP. Gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining monitored the extent of proteolysis after trypsin digestion. A 10 μm sample of WT Hbr1p was dialyzed into a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and incubated at room temperature with and without ATP (200 μm) for 1 h. CD measurements were made using a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter at 0 °C at 20 nm/min, using a time constant of 2 s. A cuvette pathlength of 0.1 cm was used to minimize ATP absorbance in the far UV range. A circular dichroism fitting program was used to fit the spectra to the Fasman algorithm (35Deléage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar). The spectral interpretation estimated the percentage secondary structure of α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil. Other algorithms used to fit the CD spectra gave similar secondary structure predictions (35Deléage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μm samples of WT Hbr1p or 30 μg/ml 2× nickel affinity-purified S. cerevisiae extract (blank) were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, and either ∼1 nm [γ-32P]ATP or ∼1 nm [γ-35S]ATP. The Hbr1p samples contained protein purified at each stage of three sequential methods: 2× nickel affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Peak fractions eluting from the ion exchange column at 500 mm NaCl in 50 mm pH 7.5 Tris buffer were collected. Hbr1p eluted from the gel filtration column at 15 min. Protein samples were normalized to 1 μm in a 50-μl reaction volume. Separation of nucleotide components was accomplished by poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose TLC (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) using 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid as the mobile phase (36Randerath K. Randerath E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1964; 16: 111-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retention factor (Rf) values of radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP or free 32P were measured by exposure of TLC plates to BioMax XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Samples containing 1 μm WT Hbr1p or 30 μg/ml C. albicans extract were each incubated for 20 min at 37 °C using 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 nm [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.4 mm NMP (either AMP, TMP, CMP, UMP, or GMP). The samples were loaded and dried onto poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose TLC plates and eluted using 1 m LiCl (36Randerath K. Randerath E. J. Chromatogr. A. 1964; 16: 111-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rf values of radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP, [β-32P]NDP, or free 32P were visualized by autoradiography. 5 μm WT Hbr1p was incubated for 1 min in dialysis buffer with 1 nm [γ-32P]ATP, 1× phosphatase inhibitors (phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and varying concentrations (0–10 mm) of nonlabeled ATP. Gel electrophoresis and autoradiography was used to assess phosphate transfer to Hbr1p. C. albicans Hbr1-His6 was expressed in S. cerevisiae and purified by two sequential nickel affinity chromatographic steps. Denaturing and reducing gel electrophoresis of the recombinant protein preparation revealed a major component with an apparent molecular mass of ∼42 kDa and several other smaller prominent bands (Fig. 2A, lane 1, regions A–E). Because the calculated molecular mass of the His-tagged protein is 31 kDa, we used Western blot analysis to identify proteins containing the His epitope. Reactive bands greater than ∼31 kDa were identified, suggesting that the smaller species may be carboxyl-terminal truncations of the Hbr1p-His6 fusion protein (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Gel filtration chromatography of this affinity-purified Hbr1p-His6 preparation revealed three major species (Fig. 2B, solid line). Analysis of each by LDS-PAGE identified six major protein bands similar"
